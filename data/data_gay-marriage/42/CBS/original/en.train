Pope Francis will wash the feet of 12 inmates at Rome's central prison on Thursday for a ritual that dates back to his first Holy Week as pope five years ago. It led to backlash because women and Muslims were included, one of several actions that have raised concerns among conservative Catholics.\n\nDozens of theologians, priests and academics have also accused the pope of spreading heresy with his 2016 document called The Joy of Love. Critics panned his opinions on marriage, moral life and the sacraments.\n\nHe's the most powerful man in the church. He's an absolute monarch in certain ways, and yet his powers are supposed to be tightly circumscribed because he's not supposed to change essential things that his predecessors have taught going all the way back 2,000 years, said New York Times columnist Ross Douthat. He delves into the controversy and its impact in his new book, To Change the Church: Pope Francis and the future of Catholicism, published by Simon & Schuster, a division of CBS.\n\nSo a lot of the drama of the Francis pontificate… bishops and theologians arguing with each other, cardinals challenging the pope and so on, reflects what happens, this fascinating thing, when a pope sets out to push the limits of his office, Douthat said.\n\nIn his book, Douthat, a Catholic himself, compares Rome under Pope Francis to that of Washington, D.C., under President Trump: a paranoid jumpy place, full of ferment and uncertainty.\n\nI want to be clear. I'm not drawing any kind of moral comparison between the Holy Father and President Trump. The comparison is more of their role within their respective institutions. Both of them have entered institutions, the U.S. government and the church of Rome, that have major credibility problems that are sort of creaking and straining under the pressures of modernity, Douthat said.\n\nWhile they are different figures, Douthat said he thinks they both speak to this moment in the West generally where there's this sense that all of our institutions, governmental, religious and so on, aren't working particularly well.\n\nSo there are openings for populists, for reformers. The question is just whether those reforms actually deliver what they're trying to promise, Douthat said.
Fleetwood Mac, which has sold more than 100 million records, is announcing a new tour today that kicks off in October. But lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham won't be on it.\n\nIn its more than 50 years as a band, Fleetwood Mac has become famous for its dysfunction and turmoil. But the announcement this month that Buckingham was ousted from the band still came as a shock. For the first time, band members tell CBS News what happened.\n\nThis week the new lineup was still getting to know each other, reports CBS News correspondent Anthony Mason.\n\nThe first photo session for the new Fleetwood Mac included Mike Campbell, former lead guitarist for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn, frontman for Crowded House. New members, but hardly novices.\n\nBoth these gentlemen have a legacy of their own. They don't need to have a calling card. They are who they are in their own right, drummer Mick Fleetwood said.\n\nWith them, Fleetwood said, Fleetwood Mac has been reborn.\n\nSo it's effectively a new band? Mason said.\n\nThis is absolutely a new band, Fleetwood responded. This is the new lineup of Fleetwood Mac.\n\nThe new lineup of Fleetwood Mac CBS News\n\nNeither Campbell or Finn are thinking of this as a temporary gig.\n\nI'm making this my priority until whenever, you know. We'll see what happens, Campbell said.\n\nThey will replace Buckingham, who joined the group back in 1974, helped re-shape their sound and wrote some of the group's biggest hits.\n\nMick, when did you decide that you had to make this change? Mason asked.\n\nIt happened after we played in New York at the MusiCares event, which you were there, Fleetwood said.\n\nIt was the band's last performance in late January when they were honored at the MusiCares benefit on Grammy weekend. All five members of the classic lineup appeared together. But tensions were building, Fleetwood said, because Buckingham would not sign off on a new tour they'd been planning for a year and a half.\n\nHonorees Stevie Nicks, John McVie, Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Mick Fleetwood perform onstage during MusiCares Person of the Year honoring Fleetwood Mac at Radio City Music Hall on January 26, 2018 in New York City. Dia Dipasupil / Getty Images\n\nIt became just a huge impasse and hit a brick wall, where we decided that we had to part company, Fleetwood said.\n\nWas Lindsey effectively fired? Mason asked.\n\nWell, we don't use that word because I think it's ugly. And it's not a question that Lindsey has huge amounts of respect and kudos to what he's done within the ranks of Fleetwood Mac and always will, Fleetwood said. But it's like a marriage that came to an end and there are reasons why. … But as a band we needed to move on and we have and that's --\n\nBecause people who saw you in New York would've thought everything was OK. But it wasn't? Mason asked.\n\nNo, it was not, Fleetwood said.\n\nStevie Nicks supported the decision to part ways.\n\nThis team wanted to get out on the road. And one of the members did not want to get out on the road for a year, Nicks said. We just couldn't agree. And you know, when you're in a band, it's a team. I mean I have a solo career, and I love my solo career, and I'm the boss. Absolutely. But I'm not the boss in this band.\n\nSo just six days after the MusiCares performance, Campbell got a phone call from Fleetwood. It was my birthday. And I was sitting in my backyard, Campbell recounted. He said he was wondering what he was going to do. He had a few things in the works, but nothing quite as big as this, he said with a laugh.\n\nCampbell was in as lead guitarist. But the band still needed another singer.\n\nWe sat around a table and we just started listening to everybody we could think of, Nicks said. Anywhere between, you know, 27 and 65. It was like -- it was crazy!\n\nI just made it, Finn joked.\n\nFinn, who turns 60 next month, was in his hometown, Auckland, New Zealand, when he got the call.\n\nI just had this kind of big grin on my face 'cause it's a call you never expect to get, Finn said.\n\nThey all met up at a theater in Maui on March 21. Nicks said they played together for two days.\n\nAnd it did sound really good and I have film to prove it, Nicks said.\n\nWe saw the cellphone footage of that first session. They ran through 10 songs in those two days. Christine McVie also liked what she heard.\n\nThe essence of the band was great, and fun, and the three voices sound really good together, McVie said. I'm really happy.\n\nIt already feels like a band when we've only played once or twice. But with a little rehearsal, I think it's just gonna be incredible, Campbell said.\n\nFor him, it's a new beginning after losing Tom Petty last fall.\n\nIt changed me and Mike for sure, in that you know, we need to take everyday that we have until we're gone and make it the best day we can because if that could happen to Tom, then it could happen to anybody, Nicks said. And I'm gonna have the most fun I can and I'm gonna stop complaining. And I'm gonna throw myself into all these projects because you just never know.\n\nNicks, Campbell and Petty go way back. They co-wrote her first solo hit, Stop Draggin' My Heart Around.\n\nIf all goes well, the band says they hope to record. They also said they did audition one other singer in Maui, but they won't reveal who that was.

Watch Nepal | The Lost Girls in the video player above.\n\nIt's a moment of unprecedented attention for child marriage around the world. Those words come from a 2016 Human Rights Watch report, which estimated that one in three girls in the developing world marries before the age of 18. The topic has slowly moved to the front burner of the global development agenda, and the United Nations has set a goal of eliminating child marriage by the year 2030.\n\nBut as the issue of child marriage gains visibility around the world, many Americans remain unaware of the problem in their own backyards, activist Fraidy Reiss told CBS News.\n\nWe cannot solve the child marriage problem globally if we don't first solve it here in the United States, said Reiss, the founder and executive director of the organization Unchained at Last.\n\nReiss's nonprofit helps girls and women plan their escape from forced marriages and rebuild their lives after the fact. The organization mainly focuses on providing pro bono legal support, including divorce litigation, custody battles, and restraining orders. But the organization also supports girls and women in other areas: from helping clients secure housing after their escape, to taking them to stressful appointments with lawyers and doctors, to connecting them to therapists, English classes, financial assistance in emergencies, and more.\n\nChild marriage is legal in some circumstances in almost every state in the U.S. Though nearly every state has laws barring children under 18 from marrying, there are ways to get exemptions -- for example, by asking for judicial consent or presenting parents' permission, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn 27 states, the law does not specify any minimum age below which a child cannot marry, according to Unchained At Last.\n\nHelping children in forced marriages is murky territory for activists and social workers. A child who leaves home under the age of 18 is considered a runaway, meaning that social service organizations and shelters could face legal action for helping them.\n\nGenerally, children cannot initiate legal action in their own name. In many states, that means a child is allowed to marry but not allowed to divorce.\n\nFor Reiss, her work is deeply personal. Raised in an insular Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, Reiss was forced at 19 into an arranged marriage which quickly became abusive. Under Orthodox Jewish law, only men have the right to grant a divorce.\n\nFifteen years into her marriage, Reiss divorced her husband, was granted a restraining order and full custody of their two daughters, and started a radically new chapter outside the community she was raised in. To this day, her family considers her dead, she said.\n\nThere's nothing easy about escaping a forced marriage, Reiss said.\n\nNational forced marriage statistics are hard to come by. In a survey of marriage licenses compiled by Unchained At Last, at least 167,000 children under 18 were married in the U.S. between 2000 and 2010. (That number is likely on the conservative side, as Unchained At Last could obtain age data from only 38 U.S. states.)\n\nThe vast majority of those children were girls married off to adult men, Reiss said.\n\nChild marriage is most common in the southern United States, according to the Pew Research Center. It's most common in West Virginia and Texas, followed by states like Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Nevada and California.\n\nWhen it comes to child marriage laws, the U.S. in comparable to countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Reiss said. Her organization is lobbying legislators across the country to restrict marriage to those 18 and older.\n\nIn some states, the movement has momentum. Bills to end or limit child marriage are currently pending in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Texas and Pennsylvania. In New Jersey, a bill to stop all marriage before age 18 has already passed the state's Assembly and Senate, and awaits a signature from Governor Chris Christie.\n\nAmericans tend to think of marriage as a beautiful, happy, romantic thing, Reiss said. It's important to know that marriage before 18 is not romantic and beautiful and happy. It is something ugly.
LONDON -- Buckingham Palace has released an image of the handwritten document in which Queen Elizabeth II gives her consent for Prince Harry to marry Meghan Markle. The Instrument of Consent image was released Saturday -- a week before Harry is to marry the American actress at St. George's Chapel in Windsor.\n\nThe document, illuminated on vellum, features a design to the left of the text that incorporates a red dragon, the symbol of Wales. The design to the right features a rose, the national flower of the United States.\n\nUnder British law, the first six people in the line of succession to the throne must obtain the queen's permission to wed.\n\nHarry was fifth in line when he and Markle got engaged. He was bumped to sixth with the birth of his brother's son Prince Louis last month.\n\nKensington Palace also announced Saturday the head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Bruce Curry, will give a sermon at the ceremony. He will join the dean of Windsor, the Rt. Rev. David Conner, and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who will officiate at the service. Welby baptized Markle ahead of her marriage to Harry.\n\nCurry is the first African-American to have served as presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, an offshoot of the Church of England in the United States. It is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion.
Thanks to his 30+ years hosting The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson became a household name. Less well known is his executive producer, Peter Lassally. This morning he's talking television with our Mo Rocca:\n\n\n\nPeter Lassally's life in television has been something of a dream. As a producer, he was an early champion of comedy greats Nichols & May, and Mort Sahl. He mentored Garry Shandling, and discovered Steven Wright.\n\nHe was so clever and so different and such a nice boy, Lassally said of Wright. And so grateful, he still calls me every anniversary of his appearance to thank me again.\n\nBut it was executive producing shows hosted by Craig Ferguson, Tom Snyder, David Letterman and before that Johnny Carson that earned him the moniker The Host Whisperer.\n\nLate-night TV's Peter Lassally, executive producer of shows hosts by Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Tom Snyder and Craig Ferguson. CBS News\n\nJohnny, of all the hosts, was the most normal one, Lassally said. He was intelligent, he was well-informed. We'd talk politics almost every day.\n\nLassally started out as an NBC page. By the mid-1950s, he was working for America's biggest television star, Arthur Godfrey.\n\nRocca asked, Can you give our audience a sense of how big a deal Arthur Godfrey was?\n\nNo. I can't, he replied, because there's nothing comparable today or in recent history to him.\n\nWith his warm demeanor on-camera, Godfrey commanded an immense audience. But off-camera he was rumored to be petty and vindictive -- and early on, Lassally learned a valuable lesson:\n\nArthur Godfrey. CBS\n\nWhen I took the job, the man who preceded me said, 'Arthur will either love you or hate you, but there's very little in-between. Sooner or later, he will invite you to his ranch in Virginia. My advice to you is, don't go. Because once he gets to know you, he turns on you.' I used that advice for the rest of my career, in not becoming friends with the hosts.\n\nOf one picture of Lassally on the Tonight Show set, lurking off camera, Rocca said, You have the look of a man who is not seeking the spotlight.\n\nThat is right, he laughed. I mean, I see reluctance everywhere.\n\nPeter Lassally, right, on the set of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Peter Lassally\n\nLassally spent the longest stretch of his career with Tonight Show king Johnny Carson.\n\nJohnny Carson, which I think will surprise you, was the shyest man I've ever dealt with. He was very uncomfortable with people. If he'd have to go to a party, he'd sit at the end of the couch, wouldn't talk to anybody.\n\nDid he have close friends? Not too many, no. He was not a social animal.\n\nLassally also helped break in some of the many guest hosts who filled in when Carson was away -- including Kermit the Frog. And it was magical, Lassally laughed. I loved it, I loved it, I loved it.\n\nBut in Carson, just like with Godfrey, Lassally saw a man much different off-stage than on.\n\nAs early as the end of the first week that I worked with him, he said, 'Come on up to my office and let's talk.' And he was drinking, and was telling me that he wasn't worthy of this job and all these awful things. And it was most uncomfortable, as you can imagine. And finally, after a couple hours, I just said, 'I have to leave.'\n\nPeter Lassally with correspondent Mo Rocca. CBS News\n\nLassally says Carson's darkness had deep roots. I would hear Johnny on the phone, talking to his mother, and he'd say, 'Yes, Mother, I still have that TV show.' You know, she'd pretend that he didn't exist.\n\nRocca asked, Did you ever meet his mother?\n\nI did. Another strange thing, I didn't like hanging out with celebrities, but I did like hanging out with comics. And three of them all had the same mother -- Johnny, Dave and Garry Shandling. Mothers that didn't appreciate them, didn't give them love, and they were always trying to prove themselves, and never won them over.\n\nIf Peter Lassally sounds blunt -- even dour at times -- it may have something to do with his life before television.\n\nPeter Lassally. CBS News\n\nHe was born in Germany in 1933. Jewish, the family fled to Holland. For a time, he was in grade school with Anne Frank. Well, she wasn't in my class, she was in my sister's class, who told me afterwards that she was not a popular girl. I mean, all her experiences were not unusual or strange to me; I mean, you hid from the Nazis the best way you could. And we tried and failed.\n\nWhen he was ten his father died. Soon after, he and his sister and mother were sent to the first of two concentration camps.\n\nRocca asked, Was there ever, in your 25 months in the camps, even just a moment where you sort of forgot where you were?\n\nNo. No. Never forgot where you were, Lassally replied. I remember watching from my window a little baby being swung against the lamppost and, you know, that's what my life was like: Watching them kill an innocent baby in the most brutal way possible.\n\nLassally recalls another cruel tactic of his captors, this one psychological: The middle of the night, word comes to the barracks, 'Everybody outside, form a formation.' You didn't know whether, a) it was a transport going out to another concentration camp, or you'd stand there for hours in the rain, in darkness. And they did it just to scare you and make you nervous. They always had you off-balance.\n\nSo that you were always scared?\n\nAlways scared. Always scared. Which is what our president is doing.\n\nHis fear about the current state of American democracy is why he says he's only watching the news these days. I sleep from 11:30 at night 'til about 3:00 in the morning, and I turn on the news station. I just watch it all day and all evening. I never watch entertainment programming.\n\nLassally, who has two children with Alice, his wife of 57 years, is especially reflective these days.\n\nRocca asked, Have you had a lot of joy in your life?\n\nWow. That's a very tough question to answer. I don't think so. I'm happy with my marriage.\n\nA lotta years.\n\nA lotta years! he laughed.\n\nCBS News\n\nPointing to a portrait of Lassally, Rocca asked him, What do you see when you look at that, other than a very handsome man?\n\nI see great lighting and a great performance, he replied.\n\nWhat I see is a little bit of wariness. A guy who's seen a lot.\n\nI saw a lot, you're right about that, Lassally replied. I saw plenty. Everywhere!\n\n\n\nStory produced by Kay Lim.
When it comes to awkward moments on tonight's Bachelor, Olivia takes the cake!\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Higgins and his army of ladies said goodbye to the Bachelor mansion and hello to Sin City with an array of flashy dates -- but what happens in Vegas ... gets made fun of by millions of Bachelorfans on the Internet.\n\nWith the exception of JoJo and Becca, who were gifted with the coveted one-on-one dates, Ben's babes went on a group date to show off their hidden talents as the opening act for ventriloquist Terry Fator's show.\n\nOlivia , who already refers to Ben as her husband (and has the largest mouth we've ever seen!) attempted to pop out of a cake and give a sexy performance, but let's just say her dance was a little less showgirl, a lot more, No, girl!\n\nI'm very excited. I'm going to do a little Vegas girl's dance, some kicks, some shimmy, shimmy, she explained with a bit of a slur while the cameras showed her adjusting her barely there costume. I did shave this morning. I knew this was coming.\n\nI'm not concerned about standing out at all today, the 23-year-old blonde said haughtily to the cameras before taking the stage. Not being able to shine, I don't think has ever been a problem for me in this process.\n\nDressed in bright red feathers and spotlight-stealing rhinestones, Olivia's fellow bachelorettes described her performance as awkward and embarrassing as she shimmied, shook, and kicked her legs around the stage.\n\nIt was cringeworthy, Lauren B. said of the cake-popping escapade. You could just tell that she was so uncomfortable that it made her performance really uncomfortable for everyone.\n\nTo make matters even more embarrassing, it all ended in a pity hug from Ben (Olivia's words not ours!) and a post-performance panic attack in the bathroom.\n\nI tried to do something way outside my comfort zone but it didn't go that well, she exclaimed dramatically with tears streaming down her face. I couldn't even look at him because I know he was mortified so that was really embarrassing.\n\nI'm here to be marriage material and I don't think I screamed marriage material, she added. I need to drink heavily. That was awful! What was I thinking?!\n\nWe're not sure, but we find it pretty interesting that she started freaking out considering just before taking the stage, Olivia stated that she doesn't get embarrassed by anything. Yeah. OK.\n\nIn the end, Olivia scored the last rose of the night while Rachel, Amber and Hayley -- aka one of the twins -- were eliminated from Ben's journey to find a wife.\n\nFor more behind-the-scenes secrets about tonight's Bachelordates in Vegas, press play on our video below!
Orson Bean, the witty actor and comedian, was hit and killed by a car in Los Angeles, authorities said. He was 91.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Coroner's office confirmed Bean's Friday night death, saying it was being investigated as a traffic-related fatality. The coroner's office provided the location where Bean was found, which matched reports from CBS Los Angeles.\n\nA man was walking in the Venice neighborhood when he was clipped by a vehicle and fell, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Brian Wendlinginitially told local stations. A second driver then struck him in what police say was the fatal collision. Both drivers remained on the scene. Police were investigating and didn't identify the pedestrian to local outlets, which named Bean based on eyewitness accounts.\n\nOrson Bean attends the LA Premiere of The Equalizer 2 at the TCL Chinese Theatre on Tuesday, July 17, 2018, in Los Angeles. Richard Shotwell via AP\n\nBean enlivened such TV game shows as To Tell the Truth and played a crotchety merchant on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.\n\nHe appeared in a number of films - notably, Anatomy of a Murder and Being John Malkovich - and starred in several top Broadway productions, receiving a Tony nod for the 1962 Comden-Green musical Subways Are for Sleeping. But fans remembered him most for his many TV appearances from the 1950s onward.\n\nOrson Bean and Dina Merrill, actress, gag it up for photographer during luncheon at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York on March 12, 1964, for veteran actress Edith Evans. David Pickoff / AP\n\nMr. Bean's face comes wrapped with a sly grin, somewhat like the expression of a child when sneaking his hand into the cookie jar, The New York Times noted in a review of his 1954 variety show, The Blue Angel. It said he showed a quality of being likable even when his jokes fall flat.\n\nBorn in Burlington, Vermont, in 1928 as Dallas Frederick Burrows, he never lost the Yankee accent that proved a perfect complement to the dry, laconic storytelling that established him as popular humorist. He had picked the stage name Orson Bean because it sounded funny.\n\nHis father, George, was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union and Bean recalled later that his house was filled with causes. But he left home at 16 after his mother died by suicide.\n\nIn a 1983 New York Times interview, he recalled his early career in small clubs where the show consisted of me - master of ceremonies, comedian and magician - maybe a dog act, and a stripper. It was a piano player in one such club, he said, who suggested replacing Dallas Burrows with some funny name like Roger Duck - or Orson Bean.\n\nBean's quick wit and warm personality made him a favorite panelist for six years on To Tell the Truth. The game required the panelists to quiz three contestants to figure out which one was a real notable and which two were impostors. The dramatic outcome inspired a national catchphrase as the host turned to the three and said: Will the real (notable's name) please stand up?\n\nBean's style appealed to both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson, and he appeared on The Tonight Show more than 200 times.\n\nBut his early career was hobbled for a time when he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist in the early years of the Cold War.\n\nBasically I was blacklisted because I had a cute communist girlfriend, he explained in a 2001 interview. I stopped working on TV for a year.\n\nThe blacklist didn't stop him in the theater. Bean starred on Broadway as a timid fan magazine writer in George Axelrod's 1955 Hollywood spoof Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? alongside Jayne Mansfield and Walter Matthau. He also starred on Broadway with Maureen O'Sullivan in Never Too Late and with Melina Mercouri in Illya Darling, based on her hit film Never on Sunday.\n\nOrson Bean and Alley Mills arrive at the Daytime Emmy Awards on Sunday Aug. 30, 2009, in Los Angeles. Matt Sayles / AP\n\nBean took a break from his career for a time in the 1970s when he dropped out and moved to Australia, where he lived a hippie lifestyle. But he returned to the U.S. and - after a period as a self-described house-husband - resumed his career.\n\nI got sick of contemplating my navel and staring up at the sky and telling myself how wonderful it was not to be doing anything, he explained in a 1983 interview with The New York Times.\n\nIn the 1990s, he played the shopkeeper Loren Bray on the long-running drama Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. He remained active on the screen in recent years with guest shots in such shows as Desperate Housewives, How I Met Your Mother and Modern Family.\n\nMeanwhile, his politics turned more conservative. He became related to a leading right-wing commentator, Andrew Breitbart, when his daughter, Susannah, married him. Breitbart died in 2012 and Steve Bannon, later a top adviser to Donald Trump, took over Breitbart's eponymous website, for which Bean had penned occasional columns.\n\nBean wrote a memoir called Too Much Is Not Enough and a book about a non-traditional therapy called Me and the Orgone.\n\nHe had already shown his interest in non-traditional thinking in 1964 when he bought a building in Manhattan and opened up a school based on the philosophy of Summerhill, the progressive British school founded by A.S. Neill.\n\nI said to myself, we have to start with the children. Why not start a school? he told The New York Times.\n\nThat same year, he co-founded the Sons of the Desert, an organization dedicated to comedians Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, with chapters around the world.\n\nMore recently, income from Dr. Quinn and other voice and acting work allowed Bean to finance the Pacific Resident Theater Ensemble in Venice, where he appeared with his third wife, actress Alley Mills.\n\nHe had a daughter, Michele, from his first marriage to Jacqueline de Sibour, and sons Max and Ezekiel and daughter Susannah from his marriage to Carolyn Maxwell.
Those campaigning in California for Proposition 8, which would reinstate the ban on gay marriage, believe they'll get a lot of unintended help from Barack Obama on Election Day, reports CBS News correspondent John Blackstone.\n\nWe thank Barack Obama, even though he's not supporting it, for helping us, says Sonja Eddings Brown, of an anti-gay-marriage group called Protect Marriage. We think it's going to push us over the top.\n\nObama is expected to bring African-American voters out in record numbers, and those voters are seen as often being more conservative on issues involving homosexuality.\n\nPastor Edward Smith of Zoe Christian Fellowship has been urging members of his Los Angeles area church to vote for the gay marriage ban.\n\nMarriage has always been defined as a man and a woman, Smith says.\n\nFor Smith, it's the most significant item on the November ballot.\n\nThis issue is more important than who becomes president of our states to me and to our Christian believers, he says.\n\nBut many African-American supporters of gay marriage see it as a civil rights issue, with gays fighting familiar battles, Blackstone reports.\n\nWe were denied the right to marry a person of another race, says Alice A. Huffman, president of the California chapter of the National Association For the Advancement of Colored People. Any time government intervenes and tells you what you can or can't do, it's a denial of your rights.\n\nThe California NAACP is trying to mobilize voters against the gay marriage ban, but at a meeting this past week showed, it's not an easy sell.\n\nIf you believe in God and the Bible, how do you reconcile same gender marriages with Genesis 1:27 and 28? asked one Obama supporter who is still undecided on the gay marriage ban. The Bible verse referenced is a commandment that called on the first man and woman to be fruitful and multiply.\n\nWhile Obama himself does not support gay marriage, he says California's law allowing it should be left as it is. That has left some of his supporters facing a dilemma on Election Day.\n\nI don't have a problem with civil unions, but when it comes to marriage, and the holy sanctity of marriage, that's where I'm conflicted, says Jacquelynn Hawthorne, an Obama supporter.\n\nThat inner turmoil makes her an undecided voter on the gay marriage ban, Blackstone reports. And although the ban seems to be losing in the polls right now, those voters could make all the difference.
The wife of the Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd, has filed for divorce. According to her lawyer, Kellie Chauvin is distraught over Floyd's death.\n\nShe is devastated by Mr. Floyd's death and her utmost sympathy lies with his family, with his loved ones and with everyone who is grieving this tragedy, the Sekula Law Offices, PLLC said in a statement on behalf of Kellie Chauvin and her family.\n\nAccording to the statement, Kellie Chauvin has officially filed for divorce.\n\nWhile Ms. Chauvin has no children from her current marriage, she respectfully requests that her children, her elder parents, and her extended family be given safety and privacy during this difficult time, the statement added.\n\nChauvin Ramsey County Adult Detention Center\n\nAfter being fired from his job, Derek Chauvin, 44, was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Earlier this week, a video went viral showing him with his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes while other officers held him down.\n\nIn a criminal complaint filed Friday afternoon, prosecutors wrote that Chauvin had his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.\n\nIn the video, Floyd can be heard begging for Chauvin to remove his knee, pleading, I can't breathe.\n\nIf convicted of the state charges, Chauvin could face up to 25 years in prison on the third-degree murder charge and up to 10 years in prison on the second-degree manslaughter charge.\n\nProtesters in Minneapolis defied curfew orders Friday as firefighters worked to put out fires across the city in the fourth night of unrest over Floyd's death. Demonstrations erupted around the country overnight as activists demanded justice.
AMMAN, Jordan -- The lower house of Jordan's parliament on Tuesday scrapped a provision in the kingdom's penal code that allowed a rapist to escape punishment if he married his victim.\n\nCheers erupted from the spectators' gallery as legislators narrowly voted for repeal, following an emotional debate.\n\nThe vote was hailed as a major step forward for women in the conservative kingdom.\n\nThis is a victory for the women's movement and human rights movement in Jordan, said Salma Nims, the secretary general of the Jordanian National Commission for Women.\n\nDespite the country's pro-Western political orientation and cosmopolitan urban elites, many areas of Jordan remain socially conservative, with entrenched notions of family honor.\n\nThis includes the belief that having a rape victim in the family is shameful, and that such shame can be expunged through marriage.\n\nIn Tuesday's debate, some lawmakers had argued that an amended version of Article 308 was needed to protect rape victims against social stigma by giving them the marriage option.\n\nIn the end, lawmakers voted in line with the recommendations of the government and a royal committee on legal reforms.\n\nMoussa Maaytah, the Cabinet minister for parliamentary affairs, said that Tuesday's progressive decision capped years of debate in the Jordanian society.\n\nThe decision must still be approved by parliament's appointed upper house, or Senate, and by King Abdullah II. After the expected final approval, Jordan would join Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt which have canceled their marry the rapist clauses over the years.\n\nThe international rights group Human Rights Watch said Lebanon's parliament is also considering repealing such a provision. The clause remains on the books in several other countries in the Middle East and Latin America, as well as in the Philippines and Tajikistan, HRW said.\n\nIn a statement issued before Tuesday's vote, the New York-based watchdog said that scrapping Article 308 would be a positive step to strengthen the rule of law and end impunity for violence against women.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's vote, several dozen activists rallied outside the parliament in Amman, the Jordanian capital, calling for repeal. They held up banners reading Article 308 is a disgrace to the Jordanian justice system and Article 308 does not protect honor, it protects the culprit.\n\nNims said before the vote that many of the lawmakers had been undecided.\n\nShe said some saw the provision as a form of protection for women who can demand marriage rather than suffer further social stigma for having been raped.\n\nThe need for such protection indicates a fundamental problem in how Jordanian law and society perceive women, said Eva Abu Halaweh, executive manager of Mizan for Law, a human rights group.\n\nThe law still looks at women as bodies, linked with 'honor,' Abu Halaweh said.\n\nEarlier this week, parliament took another step toward legal reform, closing a legal loophole that had given courts the discretion to impose sentences of as little as six months on those who killed female relatives in the name of family honor.\n\nUnder the new amendment, killing in a fit of rage can no longer be considered a mitigating circumstance in such cases.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- What's your dream car to drive? Saudi women are asking that question after the kingdom announced that females would be granted licenses and be allowed to drive for the first time.\n\nAn Arabic Twitter hashtag asking women what car they want to drive already had more than 22,000 responses on Thursday. Some users shared images of black matte luxury SUVs. Others teased with images of metallic candy pink-colored cars. A few shared images of cars encrusted with sparkly crystals.\n\nCarmakers see an opportunity to rev up sales in Saudi Arabia when the royal decree comes into effect next June. But any gains are likely to be gradual due to a mix of societal and economic factors. Women who need to get around already have cars driven by chauffeurs. And many women haven't driven in years, meaning the next wave of buyers could be the young.\n\nThat didn't keep Ford and Volkswagen from trying to make the most of the moment. They quickly released ads on Twitter congratulating Saudi women on the right to drive. Saudi Arabia had been the only country in the world to still bar women from getting behind the wheel.\n\nAmerican automaker Ford's ad showed only the eyes of a woman in a rearview mirror with the words: Welcome to the driver's seat.\n\nGerman automaker Volkswagen's ad showed two hands on a steering wheel with intricate henna designs on the fingers and the words: My turn.\n\nChecking that optimism will be the reality that many women will continue to need the approval of a man to buy a car or take on new responsibilities.\n\nThe family has always operated on the basis of dependency so that's a big core restructuring of the family unit, said Madeha Alajroush, who took part in Saudi Arabia's first campaign to push for the right to drive. In that 1990 protest, 47 women were arrested. They faced stigmatization, lost their jobs and were barred from traveling abroad for a year.\n\nIn 2014, CBS News correspondent Holly Williams met some of the women who dared to criticize the authorities.\n\nThe car for the Saudi women have become the symbol of wanting our voices to be heard and our needs to be heard, activist Madeha al-Ajroush told Williams.\n\nIt's like living your life in a box, another woman told Williams. You can't live life in a box.\n\nBut now, Saudi Arabia's government seems to be modernizing. Just last week, women were allowed into the national sports stadium for the first time.\n\nI had no idea it was going to take like 27 years, but anyway, we need to celebrate, Alajroush said.\n\nThat won't entail buying a new car, though. She hasn't driven in nearly 30 years, she says, and her two daughters still need to learn how to operate a vehicle.\n\nAllowing women the right to drive is seen as a major milestone for women's rights in Saudi Arabia, but also for the Saudi economy. The kingdom's young and powerful crown prince is behind a wide-reaching plan to transform the country and wean it off its reliance on government spending from oil exports.\n\nAllowing women to drive helps to ensure stronger female participation in the workforce and boosts household incomes. It can also save women the money they now spend on drivers and transportation.\n\nThe Saudi government says there are 1.37 million drivers in the country, with the majority from South Asian countries working as drivers for Saudi women. The drivers earn an average monthly salary of around $400, but the costs of having a driver are much higher. Families must also pay for their entry permits, residence permits, accommodation, flight tickets and recruitment.\n\nRebecca Lindland, an analyst for Cox Automotive in the U.S. who has studied the Saudi Arabian market, said families with the means likely already have enough vehicles because women are already being transported in them, with male drivers. Those women could simply start driving the vehicles they already own.\n\nSaudi women take part in a Glowork exhibition in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Sept. 28, 2017. Reuters/Faisal Al Nasser\n\nThere are also many Saudi families who do not have the money to buy new cars.\n\nThe idea that 15 million women are going to go out and buy a car is not realistic, Lindland said. We may not have incremental sales because those that are already with more freedoms already probably have access to a car.\n\nThe industry consulting firm LMC Automotive sees only a small boost in sales next year due to the royal decree, coinciding with a small recovery in sales from a slump.\n\nThe Saudi market peaked at 685,000 new vehicles sold in 2015, falling to under 600,000 in 2016, and is forecast to finish this year at 530,000. LMC had predicted a modest recovery next year based on an improved economy and sees a little added boost from women drivers.\n\nAlthough Saudi Arabia has a reputation for liking luxury goods, mainstream brands dominate the car market with a 93 percent share of sales, according to LMC. Hyundai was the top passenger car brand with a 28.6 percent share of the market, followed closely by Toyota at 28.4 percent and Kia at 8.3 percent, the company said.\n\nThere are also societal factors to consider. Even if the law allows women to drive, many will still need their fathers or husbands to buy a car.\n\nA male guardianship system in Saudi Arabia gives men final say over women's lives, from their ability to travel abroad to marriage. Women often are asked to have the written permission of a man to rent an apartment, buy a car or open a bank account.\n\nIf you don't have credit, if you don't have money, your male guardian will be the one to decide whether you buy a car or not, Lindland said.\n\nWhile car sales might rise in the long-term, ride hailing apps like Uber and local rival Careem could see revenues decline. Female passengers make up the majority of the country's ride-hailing customers.\n\nTo celebrate Tuesday's decree, several Saudi women posted images on social media deleting their ride sharing apps.\n\nThe two companies, however, have seen strong investments from Saudi Arabia. Last year, the Saudi government's sovereign wealth fund invested $3.5 billion in Uber. This year, an investment firm chaired by billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal invested $62 million in Dubai-based Careem.\n\nAlajroush says the right to drive will not immediately change women's lives, but it will change family dynamics at home and will change the economy.\n\nMen used to leave work to pick up the kids. The whole country was paralyzed, she said. It's a restructuring of how we think, how we operate, how we move.
LONDON -- Academy Award-nominated British actress Charlotte Rampling has entered the debate over a lack of diversity at the Oscars, saying the calls for a boycott are racist to white people.\n\nAll this year's acting nominees are white. Rampling, 69, told France's Europe 1 radio Friday that, while it's impossible to know for sure, maybe the black actors didn't deserve to be in the final stretch.\n\nAsked if there should be quotas -- not a suggestion made by most boycott supporters -- Rampling said we live in countries nowadays where everyone is more or less accepted, but there would always be problems with people being judged not handsome enough, ''too black or too white.\n\nSpeaking in French, she asked if the goal was to classify everybody and have thousands of little minorities everywhere.\n\nRampling, who has starred in both English and French films, is nominated for a best-actress Academy Award for Andrew Haigh's portrait of a marriage, 45 Years.\n\nVeteran British actor Michael Caine, meanwhile, urged black actors to be patient and said recognition would come.\n\nHe told the BBC there are plenty of strong performances by non-white actors this year, including Idris Elba's wonderful work in Beasts of No Nation -- which did not receive an Oscar nomination.\n\nBe patient, said 82-year-old Caine, who has won two supporting-actor Oscars. Of course it will come. It took me years to get an Oscar, years.
Dani Levy is an associate producer for the CBS series, Whistleblower. The episode Polygamy, Power and Profits: The Case Against the Kingstons, airs Friday, May 31 at 8/7c on CBS.\n\nPicture this: You're 23 years old, married to your college sweetheart and raising two kids. Then, you find out that your cousins, members of the polygamous cult you escaped from, allegedly tried to pay an enforcer to do something to you — something dangerous. The specifics are unclear, but according to the government, their intent was to intimidate and cause you harm.\n\nI didn't ever think that there would be physical threats until… I saw things that were pointing to me and [my husband], that they were paying somebody off to do something to us.\n\nIf it sounds far-fetched, I understand. I was in disbelief when I first heard it, too. But that's what happened to Mary Nelson and her husband Bryan after they blew the whistle on her cousins for allegedly ripping off $511 million from the government in a fraudulent tax credit scheme. She told her story to me and my colleagues in an interview for CBS's series Whistleblower.\n\nBryan and Mary Nelson Mary Nelson\n\nKnowing she may have been in danger, does she regret blowing the whistle? Not at all.\n\nThese people are not who they say they are, Mary said, referring to the Kingston clan, also known as The Order — the sect to which her family belongs. She, like some members of law enforcement, calls them an organized crime family.\n\nIt's supposedly God's kingdom here on Earth, she told Whistleblower host Judge Alex Ferrer. Mary fled The Order in 2013 with Bryan's help, and proceeded to tell the FBI and IRS about what she calls widespread fraud encouraged by the group's leaders. Her information led to that $511 million indictment against her cousins.\n\nI met Mary a handful of times and was impressed with her determination and fortitude. She wants life to get better for the siblings she left behind. I'm only a few months older than she is and often wonder if I'd have had the strength to leave the only family I ever knew. But that's just who Mary is — she believes their way of life is wrong.\n\nThe Kingstons are a Mormon splinter group, founded in the 1930s by Mary's great-uncle Elden. They maintain a secretive but powerful presence in Utah's Salt Lake Valley, and their estimated 7,500 members can be found in Colorado and California as well. But, according to Mary, they're more than religious fundamentalists. She says they're a business empire that brainwashes its members by depriving them of access to the rest of society.\n\nI feel like my mind is like an onion. The longer I am away from The Order and the longer that I'm in a free world, it's peeling back layers, Mary said. I didn't think it was ever possible for me to be outside of The Order and to be an outsider. I didn't understand how people lived. I didn't understand how people had houses — anything.\n\nThe Order tries to provide everything that you could ever need to interact in your daily life, including schools, grocery stores, hardware stores, and an ever-powerful central bank. They also didn't let us really interact with the outside world because they were scared that we would see behind all their lies. We would see the real truth, and we would see how things really work in the world.\n\nSome people think, well, I want to just leave. But they don't have anything. They have five, six kids. They don't have a house, Mary said. And they threaten you and say, if you leave, we're going to take all your kids, and we're going to take your house, and we're going to take your car, and you don't have anything.\n\nMary says that's because The Order owns everything — the homes, the cars, and the money that you make. After Mary left, she says her parents declined to turn over the $17,000 she earned from years of working in the group's bank — they called it a wedding present that she would have received had she married the person they wanted for her.\n\nThe group derides the evil forces of the world like feminism and enforces a law of one above another, placing women at the mercy of their husbands and girls at the mercy of their fathers. Mary says her father encouraged her to start thinking about marriage when she was just 13, suggesting potential husbands more than twice her age. When Mary's parents learned of her relationship with Bryan four years later, Mary says they demanded she wed her 17-year-old cousin, who was already married with a baby on the way.\n\nI just started crying, Mary said. My dad says, 'Isn't this what you want? Don't you want to have kids in The Order?' I said I don't know what I want. And he is like, 'You do know what you want.'\n\nAnd if she didn't love the person they expected her to marry? Mary says The Order tells young girls, You should love that person just because you know that that's what the Heavenly Father wants you to do.\n\nMary says it's this kind of manipulation and brainwashing that really bothers her. Her mother, the fifth of her father's 18 wives and his half-sister, was born into the group. While her father bought dinner or groceries on occasion, it was largely up to her mother to provide for her 15 siblings.\n\nThe women grow up knowing that's their responsibility.\n\nHer father works, but like her mother, gives his earnings to the central bank. Leaders claim the money is meant to help build God's Kingdom here on earth, but Mary doesn't agree.\n\nHer dad — one of the group's leaders — has access to all the money that he wants, she said. He'll draw out a few thousand dollars a week, maybe even more, and he'll buy the newest Apple products. He'll buy computers and all kinds of electronics. And people out there are struggling to put food on their table.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary says the leaders encourage women to use their children to steal money from the government, by filing fraudulent tax returns or applications for collegiate financial aid and welfare. The leaders expect them to turn over this income to the business office, where they may never see a penny of it again.\n\nWhen Ferrer asked if the women realize they're being controlled and manipulated, Mary said they were clueless.\n\nThey don't have any idea. That's the way they were taught, she added. They were you were taught from a very, very young age that you fit in with your husband. You fit in with your dad. You do exactly what they say. You don't question it because if you do, you're going against the Lord's work.
Lana Clayton said she found her husband Steve Clayton dead at the bottom of a staircase in their South Carolina home. The businessman, who created physical therapy clinics, had been married to his wife for five years when he died.\n\nInitially, the coroner's office ruled Clayton died from a possible heart attack. However, Clayton's nephew, Nick French, a police officer in a nearby town, noticed something was odd about Lana's behavior when he rushed to the mansion to console her.\n\nShe made no mention of attempting to revive him, French tells 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant. And Steve always had his phone with him. We were not able to find Steve's phone anywhere.\n\nConcerned about the nature of his death, the family asked for an autopsy and a toxicology test. The blood test revealed an unusual chemical – tetrahydrozoline – in Steve Clayton's blood that would shift the investigation into a whole new direction.\n\nWhat happened in the Clayton household? And could that case have led to a copycat crime?\n\nA STRANGE ACCIDENT?\n\nJames Blackledge: I'm a Vietnam veteran. So, I've seen things, done things.\n\nBut James Blackledge wasn't ready for what was about to happen as he rode by the home of Steve and Lana Clayton on the morning of July 21, 2018.\n\nJames Blackledge: I was out riding my motorcycle...coming down this road... … And all of a sudden, I see a woman running across this yard...and she was waving me down.\n\nIt was Lana Clayton who apparently had just run out of her house.\n\nJames Blackledge: She flagged me down, stopped me. And first thing she said was call 911.\n\nJAMES BLACKLEDGE: Is this 911? 911 DISPATCHER: It is. JAMES BLACKLEDGE: I was just ridin' by and a woman came running out and said her husband fell down the steps and she thinks he's dead.\n\nAs Blackledge stayed on the phone with the dispatcher, he watched Lana run across the street to a neighbor's house.\n\nTerry Floyd: All of a sudden, I heard this loud knock on the screen. … It almost sound like somebody, you know, was gonna bust the glass out. … It was Lana.\n\nTerry Floyd is a close friend of Lana and Steve.\n\nTerry Floyd: And I asked her, of course, what was wrong. And she just kept saying, It's Steve. It's Steve.\n\nThe two jumped into Terry's golf cart and dashed over to the Clayton's front door.\n\nTerry Floyd: And I said, Well, where is he? And she said, He's at the base of the stairs there in the foyer.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what were you thinking as all of this is unfolding?\n\nJames Blackledge: I just thought it was an accident, a strange accident. Then, what I really thought was strange, was she sat on the front steps. The man went inside the house.\n\nTerry Floyd: I tried to get a pulse. … I couldn't get a pulse. And I just, I knew he was dead.\n\nAccording to Lana, Steve had come down with a bout of vertigo three days prior. News reporter Kristi O'Connor of CBS affiliate WBTV covered the story.\n\nKristi O'Connor: He was nauseated and dizzy and bedridden.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Their bedroom was on the second floor of this house, right?\n\nKristi O'Connor: That's exactly correct.\n\nLana said she checked on him around 11 that morning and found him sound asleep, so she went outside to mow the lawn.\n\nKristi O'Connor: She made sure he had his water. She had his medications and things next to his bed, made sure he had everything he needed.\n\nLana was a nurse – a calling that made Steve's sister, Rosie, very happy.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: I felt, wow, she'll be there for him. God forbid something should happen, he should fall ill.\n\nSteve and Lana Clayton on their wedding day. Mario Muñoz/ Muñoz Photography\n\nThe couple met online in 2010. Three years later, they married in nearby Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: I sensed that my brother loved her very much, that she loved him very much.\n\nIt was Lana's second marriage. Steve's family had lost count on the number of times he'd been down the aisle.\n\nKris Phagan: I think the number's somewhere around six or seven. … Steve loved being in love. … It didn't always work out well for him.\n\nSteve's nephew, Kris Phagan, says his uncle was an accountant by trade who, in the 1980s, created a highly successful physical therapy business, targeting sports injuries.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And he made millions off of this, correct?\n\nKris Phagan: He did. … He, then, fully retired at the age of 40.\n\nPeter Van Sant: From all outside appearances, what was their life like here?\n\nKristi O'Connor: I would say, dare to say that they had it all.\n\nBut on July 21, 2018, when Lana came in after a couple hours of yard work, she discovered her 64-year-old husband was dead.\n\nTerry Floyd: Myself and a few of the other neighbors, we consoled in her. … All the neighbors were behind her 110 percent.\n\nWhen York County Sheriff's Deputies arrived, they found Lana in distress over her husband's apparent fall down the stairs.\n\nTERRY FLOYD [BODY CAM VIDEO]: She's kind of on a guilt trip about not checking on him. OFFICER: Oh, no. TERRY FLOYD: Just take a look to see if you see any signs of him falling or anything … OFFICER: OK. OK. TERRY FLOYD: Everything look OK? OFFICER: Pretty much, pretty much.\n\nThe officer on the scene and a friend comforted her.\n\nLANA'S FRIEND [BODY CAM VIDEO]: You can't blame yourself for any of this. SGT. DAY: Oh, no, not at all.\n\nAs word spread about Steve's sudden death, his nephew, Nick French, a police officer in a nearby town, rushed to the mansion.\n\nNick French: She … gave me a big hug, started crying. ... Right after that, I walked in where Steve was and saw him. … It was very much a shock. I loved Steve and to see him in a vulnerable position like that was very difficult for me.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m., Coroner Sabrina Gast received a call that Steve had died.\n\nSabrina Gast: I have a deputy coroner and she responded to the home.\n\nThe deputy coroner reported seeing nothing suspicious and believed the cause of death was most likely due to a heart attack. Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office\n\nGast says her deputy saw nothing suspicious and believed the cause of death was most likely due to a heart attack.\n\nSabrina Gast: She concluded at that point in time that it appeared to be a natural death.\n\nBut being an experienced cop and investigator, Nick French couldn't help noticing some red flags about Lana's actions immediately after she found Steve.\n\nNick French: There were at least two phones in that house and she's a nurse. Why wouldn't she have called from one of those phones? And also, why wasn't she doing CPR when they arrived on scene?\n\nThat's when he began to make mental notes.\n\nNick French, Steve Clayton's nephew and a police officer in a nearby town, seen on body cam video, saw red flags right away. Steve always had his phone on him. Always. It was his lifeline. … we were not able to find Steve's phone anywhere. Willy Thompson/York County Prosecutor's Office\n\n\n\n\n\nNick French: Steve always had his phone on him. Always. It was his lifeline. ... we were not able to find Steve's phone anywhere.\n\nNick also noted Lana's reaction when the deputy coroner asked about funeral arrangements.\n\nNick French: Lana said, it's just too much right now. She had her head in her hands, and she said, I have no idea.\n\nSo, the deputy coroner offered to take Steve's body to the morgue and run some tests.\n\nNICK FRENCH [BODY CAM VIDEO]: I would do that Aunt Lana.\n\nNick French: And she looked up from her hands and said that funeral home … the one that's right down the street ... Let's take him there and have him cremated. ... and it was just that quick ... She went from I have no idea what I'm going to do ... to ... let's have him cremated.\n\nNick wanted to call Kris and let him know their beloved uncle had died. He says Lana insisted she didn't want Kris to see his uncle in that state.\n\nNick French: Kris is an adult, he's a big boy. That should be Kris's choice. ... I started thinking something's going on. So, when she told me no the third time and yelled at me, I walked upstairs and called Kris.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Why would you be excluded?\n\nKris Phagan: That I couldn't tell you. It still puzzles me to this day.\n\nKris then called Steve's sister, Rosie in Florida.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: I still hear him crying. ... I couldn't speak. ... It wasn't real. It didn't seem real.\n\nFor three days prior to his death, Rosie had been worried she couldn't reach her brother on the phone.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: Suddenly, there were no replies. ... And that was not like him to just completely cut off ... I thought it was very odd.\n\nAlso odd was what Nick would later discover in Steve's upstairs bedroom.\n\nNick French: The state of the bedroom ... indicated to me that Steve had been in that bed multiple days and he wasn't able to get out of the bed. ... Just a culmination of everything we saw out there was highly suspicious.\n\nA FAMILY'S SUSPICIONS MOUNT\n\nKris Phagan: I try not to go into the house a whole lot. That's where the bad memories are really.\n\nFor Steve's nephew, Kris Phagan, visiting his uncle's home, brings back mixed emotions.\n\nKris Phagan: But out here is where we enjoyed parties.\n\nPeter Van Sant: In the best of times at this house what was it like?\n\nKris Phagan: A lot of fun. The dogs running around, the kids chasing them, Steve telling jokes, music going.\n\nSteve and Lana Clayton seen on video dancing during a July 4th party at the couple's mansion on South Carolina's Lake Wylie. Rosie Clayton-Leslie\n\nOne favorite memory — the July Fourth party Lana and Steve threw just weeks before his death.\n\nKris Phagan: Steve was always big on July 4th. He had huge celebrations out here … We'd have a dance floor right here. … fireworks out there.\n\nTo most outsiders, the couple appeared happy and in love.\n\nTerry Floyd: I thought it was a good relationship. … She always kissed Steve on the forehead there and said, I love you.\n\nBut Dr. Nan Saye, a veterinarian who took care of their dogs at the Clayton mansion, claims it was all a façade.\n\nPeter Van Sant: When you saw the two of them together, were they a loving couple?\n\nDr. Nan Saye: No. No. I wondered why they got married. … It was strange … The simplest thing was that she did not speak when he was in the room.\n\nThen there was a bizarre incident in the bedroom just two years before Steve's death. Lana said she accidentally shot her husband in the head with a crossbow while he slept.\n\nKristi O'Connor: Steven himself … said it was an accident. Lana said it was an accident.\n\nMiraculously, Steve's injury was minor, and police never filed charges.\n\nPeter Van Sant: I don't know how many crossbows you have in your bedroom ... But that seemed kind of strange, right?\n\nDr. Nan Saye: Yes.\n\nLana and Steve moved on from that incident. But two months before his death, Steve confided to Kris that their marriage of five years was in trouble.\n\nSteve and Lana Clayton Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office\n\nKris Phagan: He had mentioned … that he wasn't as happy as he thought he was going to be.\n\nWhen Kris got to the house that day, he comforted Lana. She told him she needed his help in organizing Steve's affairs.\n\nKris Phagan: And I said, Well, the first thing we need to do is find the will … and that'll tell us what Steve's wishes were in terms of whether he should be buried or cremated.\n\nKris was startled by Lana's response.\n\nKris Phagan: She said, well, there is no will. And I said, no, there's a will, I know that there is, I've seen it. … Steve had asked me to be his executor. … And at that point she stood up and said, I said there is no will. And … she went into the house.\n\nNick French: My aha moment came about the same time.\n\nNick was gobsmacked when he heard Lana bad-mouthing Steve.\n\nNick French: She was in the kitchen and she was telling these lurid stories of all Steve's illicit drug abuse. … She used the words he was a hardcore drug abuser. … And she's telling these stories and she's laughing.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And you guys had known him forever. Did you ever see him high on illicit drugs?\n\nKris Phagan: Never.\n\nNick French: Never. … She basically said that she didn't want an autopsy done because she was worried about what the toxicology would show … And, you know, for me, it was jarring when I heard it.\n\nNick would soon be jarred again. He went upstairs, where Lana had said Steve was bedridden for three days.\n\nSteve's nephew, Nick French, came to the scene on the day Steve died. Nick — a police officer in a nearby town — did a walkthrough of the house and found it odd that Steve's bed was soaked with urine. Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office\n\nNick French: The bed was the worst part of the upstairs. … Just drenched with urine. … I asked Lana … And she said, Oh, Steve does that when he has vertigo — that happens.\n\nKris Phagan: Really made me think he was there suffering and could reach no one for help.\n\nA short time later, Kris says Lana demanded that everyone leave.\n\nKris Phagan: When we got in the car — my wife and I — I said, something is wrong.\n\nNick was having a similar conversation with his wife.\n\nNick French: We were both of the opinion … that she had a hand in his death. … We didn't know how.\n\nMeanwhile, Rosie was trying to reconcile how Steve's vertigo may have led to a heart attack.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: It seemed too weird to attribute what was happening to him, to what we already knew were his very benign, light symptoms.\n\nOn Sunday, the day after Steve's death, Kris and his Wife had planned to help Lana find his will.\n\nNick French: Lana … said, do not come here. This is my house. … He was my husband. I will handle everything … And she hung up.\n\nThat's when Nick and his wife drove to Kris's house.\n\nNick French: We looked at each other, and we went through the small talk … And I said, something's wrong.\n\nKris Phagan: I said, thank God, because we feel the exact same way.\n\nNick French: And we went to work. … and we knew one of the first things that we had to do was get in touch with the coroner's office.\n\nIt was a race against the clock. Lana had scheduled a cremation for the very next day.\n\nNick French: Steve … was at the funeral home. …And they can move forward.\n\nPeter Van Sant: With whatever Lana says.\n\nNick French: Exactly.\n\nKris Phagan, left, and Nick French say if they hadn't requested an autopsy and toxicology report they may have never discovered the truth about their uncle's death. CBS News\n\nNick and Kris demanded the coroner order an autopsy and a toxicology test. She agreed.\n\nNick French: We were relieved at that point … but we also knew that Lana didn't know.\n\nWhen the autopsy was done, the family's suspicions were confirmed. Steve had not succumbed to a heart attack.\n\nSabrina Gast | Coroner: They looked at the chest. They looked at the heart, the lungs Nothing really suspicious with the autopsy.\n\nBut the toxicology results revealed something sinister. Not hardcore drug use, but the presence of poison — a chemical found in eye drops. And in an instant, Steve's death became highly suspicious.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So suddenly … this could be a poisoning?\n\nDemi Garvin | Forensic Toxicologist: Yes … it was without question the cause of death.\n\nSabrina Gast: Was it an accidental overdose? We didn't know that. … Was it a homicidal overdose?\n\nDemi Garvin: His mobility is limited … He's incapacitated. … it will cause respiratory depression, which then causes death.\n\nAN UNUSUAL DISCOVERY\n\nWhen Coroner Sabrina Gast first reviewed Steve Clayton's toxicology report, there was a chemical found in his blood that she had never heard of before.\n\nSabrina Gast: Hmm, what is tetrahydrozoline? I don't know what that is … So, I had to look up what tetrahydrozoline was. … I was like, whoa, wait.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what is it? What is this drug?\n\nSabrina Gast: Tetrahydrozoline is the common ingredient in Visine.\n\nPeter Van Sant: The eye drop.\n\nSabrina Gast: The eye drop.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Get the red out.\n\nSabrina Gast: Exactly.\n\nAnd Steve's results revealed a large amount of the chemical, which is found in a number of brands of eye drops.\n\nDemi Garvin: In fact, at a concentration of 68 nanograms per mil in the blood sample.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And in English that means?\n\nDemi Garvin: In English that means I'm very worried.\n\nPeter Van Sant: It's a lot.\n\nDemi Garvin: It's a lot.\n\nSteve Clayton's autopsy results revealed a large amount of the chemical tetrahydrozoline [THZ] in his blood, which is found in a number of brands of eye drops. CBS News\n\nForensic toxicologist Demi Garvin was aware of the many ways tetrahydrozoline, also known as THZ, could be abused.\n\nDemi Garvin: We refer to this drug as a modern-day Mickey Finn. … Where a substance is introduced into a beverage without the consent of the individual who's going to consume it for purposes of incapacitating them. That could be for robbery. It could be for sexual assault. It could be for both.\n\nIn the movie Wedding Crashers, a character squirts eye drops into the drink of his rival, causing trouble.\n\nDemi Garvin: Nausea, vomiting, reduced heart rate … dizziness, confusion.\n\nBut if a poisoner empties an entire bottle in someone's drink, it can attack the respiratory system.\n\nDemi Garvin: And if breathing slows sufficiently, it will cause respiratory depression which then causes death.\n\nPoisoning with eyedrops is also the plot line of an episode of the CBS drama CSI:\n\nThere is tetrahydrozoline in the victim's drink. She killed him with eye drops. Well it's not that far-fetched.\n\nDemi Garvin: It's colorless, odorless and tasteless.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, like I have a water bottle here. If it was in there, I wouldn't know it.\n\nDemi Garvin: Correct.\n\nThe results of Steve Clayton's toxicology were a potential game changer.\n\nPeter Van Sant: The initial assessment at the scene is this appeared to be a natural death. … What are you thinking now?\n\nSabrina Gast: I'm thinking, Wow, we've got some work to do … the next phone call was to the sheriff's office.\n\nKevin Brackett: Well, now, of course, there are a whole series of questions that have been raised.\n\nSolicitor Kevin Brackett acts as the prosecutor in York and Union Counties in South Carolina.\n\nKevin Brackett: The first and foremost, how did the Visine get in his system?\n\nSabrina Gast: We didn't know if he had intentionally taken the tetrahydrozoline with the intent of harming himself.\n\nTo find out, the coroner called Lana in for an interview.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Describe the woman that was sitting across from you.\n\nSabrina Gast: I would describe her as confident.\n\nBy now, Lana knew that an autopsy had been performed on Steve. What she didn't know was that investigators from the sheriff's office and the FBI were in the next room listening in.\n\nSabrina Gast: We had set up microphones in the office so that they could hear the questions … and her responses.\n\nDEPUTY CORONER [interrogation]: We've got a couple questions. Let's go over some things, like I said we got some of the reports back.\n\nSabrina Gast: We were trying to get information from her about how he used the product, how often did he use the product?\n\nLANA CLAYTON: Somebody, somebody one time told him Visine would help him go to the bathroom … He put like two drops in his coffee and um, make him go to the bathroom. DEPUTY CORONER: And how long had he been doing that for? LANA CLAYTON: For years.\n\nSabrina Gast: He would put it in his coffee every morning so that he would have a bowel movement.\n\nDemi Garvin It would not be something that you would ever want to do.\n\nKevin Brackett: What that comment did tell us is that she was aware … that we were going to find Visine in his system because she put it there.\n\nSABRINA GAST: Um, let's go over the toxicology … there's a drug called tetrahydrozoline. LANA CLAYTON: That is his Visine.\n\nSabrina Gast: Immediately she knew exactly what tetrahydrozoline was.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You saw it on her face?\n\nSabrina Gast: She said, Oh, yes, that's Visine … that was where it clicked for me of, oh, OK. This is kind of, this is really odd.\n\nThat's when those investigators nearby entered the room, surprising Lana.\n\nOFFICER 1: I'm a detective with the York County Sheriff's Office. LANA CLAYTON: I'm just … OFFICER 2: Overwhelmed, I'm sure. Yes, ma'am. Now listen you are by no means in any trouble, we do wanna ask you some questions. OFFICER 2: … you are a witness in this case for us … we have to read our Miranda rights to everybody, OK … you have the right to remain silent …\n\nLana Clayton during questioning Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office\n\nLana Clayton began turning on her husband:\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I'm wondering if he tried to commit suicide. … He had a mood disorder. … I always walked on eggshells. I didn't know what Steven I was gonna come home to … or if he was angry. You know he could be really nasty, you know. OFFICER 2: What was nasty Steve like? LANA CLAYTON: He was really verbally abusive, you know, call me names, stupid, bitch.\n\nKris Phagan: We never saw any evidence of that.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Never? [to Nick] Did you ever see it?\n\nNick French: I never saw it. And not only did we never see it, but there was no record of anything like that.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I feel I'm painting a bad picture of him. He wasn't, you know, a monster.\n\nThe two investigators pressed her:\n\nOFFICER 1: Right now, the death is suspicious in nature. OFFICER 2: Did you make his coffee for him? LANA CLAYTON: No, he made his coffee. … everybody keeps asking me, you know, about the coffee and I know they wanted to know about the Visine. OFFICER 2: There was only two people in the house, Miss Clayton. LANA CLAYTON: I know, I know. OFFICER 1: It was you, and him. LANA CLAYTON: I know. OFFICER 1: Did he have any — LANA CLAYTON: He always had the Visine on him. OFFICER 1: Did he have any that day? LANA CLAYTON: That's what I don't know. OFFICER 1: You are in the nursing business though … wouldn't you know the effects of it? LANA CLAYTON: Sure. I didn't think Visine was anything that would be serious to your, to your health.\n\nWith the tough questioning, Brackett says Lana got defensive.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I feel like you guys are, you know, doing your job and you're, you know, wondering if I killed my husband and I did not kill my husband.\n\nLana then stopped the interview and returned to the mansion. Investigators followed her home where she continued talking. They recorded the conversation:\n\nKevin Brackett: After that conversation, the situation changes significantly.\n\nWhat Lana Clayton told investigators was nothing short of a confession.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: You know, I had this little table set up next to the bed with his tissues, his urinal, his, you know, medications, his Visine … And I just saw it and just, I was just so angry. … I just took and squirted it. … I think I put the whole thing in.\n\nThat amount of THZ would have caused Steve to stop breathing.\n\nDETECTIVE: So, you — the whole bottle? LANA CLAYTON: I think I did. DETECTIVE: OK. LANA CLAYTON: I squeezed it hard. DETECTIVE: OK. So, where was he when you did this? LANA CLAYTON: He was sleeping. … I don't know — I just saw it there and I just I just did it. I don't have an excuse, I don't have — I just did it.\n\nWhen Nick learned of Lana's confession, he called Kris.\n\nKris Phagan: And he said, She did it. And I knew immediately what he was talking about. And I had a few choice words and screamed. I started crying as well.\n\nPeter Van Sant: This was murder.\n\nKris Phagan: Correct.\n\nWAS THIS LANA'S FIRST ATTEMPT?\n\nAfter admitting she emptied a bottle of eye drops into her husband's water, Lana kept talking to the investigators back at the mansion.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: Just — what if I did kill him? What if I caused his death with the Visine?\n\nShe quickly transformed from a grieving widow into an embittered wife.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I just wanted him to just — I just wanted him to suffer.\n\nSuffer, because Lana claimed she was fed up with Steve's constant demands.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I was just, I was just angry. … He was just constantly, Lana, come here, Lana, come here you know help me to the bathroom, do this, do that and everything … DETECTIVE: And it all just built up? LANA CLAYTON: It just all, all, all just built up and I just …\n\nLana tried to convince investigators that she never wanted to kill Steve.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I just wanted him to have diarrhea. DETECTIVE: To just suffer? LANA CLAYTON: I wanted him to just be, miserable.\n\nKevin Brackett: She's admitted that she's poisoned him.\n\nSolicitor Kevin Brackett.\n\nKevin Brackett: She's trying to think of her story that keeps her out of you know the trick bag.\n\nLana Clayton tried to convince investigators that she never wanted to kill Steve. Her story evolved to include allegations of physical abuse. Mario Muñoz/ Muñoz Photography\n\nAs Lana's story evolved – it now included allegations of physical abuse.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: He was verbally and physically abusive. He had hit me several times.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is there any evidence that he was physically abusing her?\n\nKevin Brackett: No, no.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: The way she portrayed him — I don't know that person. Nobody that knows Steve knows that person.\n\nThe unflattering portrait of Steve does not ring true for those who loved him. Iliana Ivanova was Steve's girlfriend for almost three years before meeting Lana.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Was he ever abusive toward you verbally or physically?\n\nIliana Ivanova: Never, never. He was nothing close to being abusive. … This is completely made up … everybody who knew him knew how generous and loving and kind he is.\n\nHis former partners shared similar sentiments about the abuse claims.\n\nKevin Brackett: They did not believe them. … Some of them still considered him to be the love of their life.\n\nAnd what about that bizarre crossbow shooting incident back in 2016? Lana changed her story, admitting it was no accident.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I was trying to protect myself from him 'cause he was, you know, coming at me. … And I had picked up the crossbow and turned and I just shot it at him.\n\nNick French and Kris Phagan didn't learn of the crossbow story until after Steve's death. They don't believe Lana was defending herself.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Nick, what do you think of that story?\n\nNick French: Unofficially, horses---.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you think that was an attempted murder?\n\nNick French: Absolutely. I think it was, yeah.\n\nKris Phagan: One hundred percent. … We think that was her first attempt at doing this.\n\nAfter Lana's devastating interrogation, investigators left her at the mansion to prepare an arrest warrant. That's when she attempted suicide.\n\nKevin Brackett: She took some pills and turned the gas on. … She left notes … indicating …. that she felt bad about poisoning her husband … and that she couldn't live with herself.\n\nA neighbor went to the house that morning and called for help.\n\nKevin Brackett: She was treated briefly at the hospital and taken into custody at that point.\n\nBrackett had developed a drip-by-drip theory of this eye drop crime.\n\nKevin Brackett: She incapacitated him with a smaller amount and then gradually ramped it up until the fatal dose.\n\nThat would explain why Steve was bedridden for three days prior to his death. Brackett theorizes that Steve may have somehow attempted an escape.\n\nKevin Brackett: He might have gotten a surge of adrenaline, realizing … that he was very, very sick — and he needed help and he tried to go for help and made it as far as the bottom of the stairs, where he died. … he couldn't call for help. His phone could not be found after he died.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, more than a month after Steve's death, Lana Clayton was formally charged with murder.\n\nLana Clayton confessed to a York County sheriff's detective that she had put Visine in Steve's water. She even said she wanted him to suffer. She was arrested the following day. Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office\n\nKevin Brackett: I think Lana Clayton had several million reasons why she wanted her husband dead.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And you're talking about millions of dollars?\n\nKevin Brackett: Yes, exactly right.\n\nSteve's family speculates Lana started planning Steve's death back in 2016, when Lana convinced him to move from North Carolina to the mansion in South Carolina.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: It was important for her to be in South Carolina. And I think I was able to put some puzzle pieces together after the fact.\n\nKevin Brackett: She was married to a very wealthy man. And if that man were to die in the absence of a will … then he would die intestate which, under South Carolina law, leaves her inheriting the entire estate.\n\nAnd remember, Lana insisted there was no will. Kris recalls she became agitated when he asked her about it the day Steve died.\n\nKris Phagan: She stands up. She turns, looks me right in the eye and says, There is no will, just like that.\n\nKris is certain Lana destroyed the will in a fire the neighbors saw her start the day after Steve's death.\n\nKris Phagan: My personal opinion is that's the first thing that she burned.\n\nThe morning after Steve Clayton's death, neighbors told Steve's nephews they watched Lana setting a fire in the backyard firepit. Kris believes this is where Steve's will was destroyed. Rosie Clayton-Leslie\n\nKris Phagan: This is the firepit Peter. … his whole life in paper was burned right here.\n\nAbout three weeks after Lana's arrest, there was another suspicious death just 12 miles away in Mount Holly, North Carolina.\n\nKevin Brackett: The method of killing in that case was the same as ours, a poisoning with THZ.\n\nPeter Van Sant: With eye drops?\n\nKevin Brackett: With eye drops, yes.\n\nFor investigators, it seemed like déjà vu.\n\nKevin Brackett: Our office was consulted on that because it happened in such close proximity … It's very possible that the suspect in that case heard about our case down here, saw it on the news.\n\nTwo months later and just 12 miles away from the Clayton home, there was another death that appeared to be of natural causes in which tetrahydrozoline was found in the victim's system. Stacy Hunsucker, a young mother of two, was found dead by her husband Joshua. Stacy Hunsucker/Facebook\n\nStacy Hunsucker, a 32-year-old mother of two young children, was found dead by her husband Joshua Hunsucker. Just like in the Clayton case, her cause of death was initially ruled a heart attack.\n\nKristi O'Connor: Shortly after Stacy died, he collected almost $250,000 from two life insurance policies taken out on her behalf. And that apparently didn't sit right with Stacy's mother.\n\nMike Causey: We got involved because Stacy's mother contacted us with the possible insurance fraud. … who would ever guess that an insurance fraud investigation could lead to a full-blown murder investigation?\n\nA COPYCAT CASE?\n\nStacy and Josh Hunsucker had been married for eight years before her tragic death from an apparent heart attack. Stacy had suffered from heart problems and had a pacemaker.\n\nKristi O'Connor: They were high school sweethearts. They had two children together.\n\nStacy was a paralegal at one time and then was a preschool teacher. … He was a paramedic, a flight medic actually, at Atrium Health, the major hospital system in the Charlotte area.\n\nReporter Kristi O'Connor says Josh's actions after Stacy's passing raised eyebrows.\n\nIn fact, babysitter Kailyn MacDonald, who looked after the couple's children after Stacy's death, says Josh was dating a coworker, Jennifer Elkins.\n\nKailyn MacDonald: I never saw him sad, ever.\n\nKailyn MacDonald: … he was happy with his new girlfriend, very happy. … It was always about Jen.\n\nFor Stacy's mother, Suzie Robinson, that was a red flag. Another one was when she learned, just 48 hours after Stacy's death, Josh started the process of collecting $250,000 in two life insurance policies. Suzie called the North Carolina Department of Insurance to investigate.\n\nMike Causey: Had it not been for Suzie …we may not have any of … this murder investigation.\n\nMike Causey is the commissioner of the North Carolina Department of Insurance — his agents got involved in Stacy's case in May 2019.\n\nMike Causey: It was referred to our criminal investigations' division. … initial reports from the local police department had it a natural death, heart attack.\n\nBut Stacy's body had been cremated at the request of her husband.\n\nPeter Van Sant: No autopsy.\n\nKristi O'Connor: No autopsy. Joshua actually did not want an autopsy done because he didn't want her cut up.\n\nBut the agents got a huge break when they discovered Stacy was an organ donor and a vial of blood had been collected and stored before she was cremated. That blood was sent out for a toxicology screening.\n\nMike Causey: There was traces of some poison … specifically THZ … a common chemical that's used in eye drops to get the red out.\n\nPeter Van Sant: In the Hunsucker case, have you given authorities there some advice based on your experience here?\n\nDemi Garvin: Yes … that the presence of the tetrahydrozoline in the concentration that was reported warranted further investigation.\n\nKristi O'Connor: They ended up … accusing him of poisoning her with tetrahydrozoline.\n\nOn December 19, 2019, Josh Hunsucker was arrested and charged with the murder of his wife Stacy. Hunsucker is awaiting a trial date. His attorney says his client is innocent and the allegations will be strenuously opposed. WBTV\n\nOn December 19, 2019, 15 months after Stacy's death, Hunsucker was charged with her murder. His attorney says his client is innocent, and the allegations will be strenuously opposed. He is free on bail.\n\nExperts fear homicidal poisonings have been going undetected because their symptoms can mimic natural illness and labs don't routinely screen for them.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you think that this drug should be part of a basic screen in toxicology test?\n\nDemi Garvin: Yes.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you feel the same way?\n\nSabrina Gast: Yes.\n\nSabrina Gast: Because it is so innocuous. It's odorless, it's tasteless. …Anybody can buy it.\n\nIn a statement, Johnson & Johnson, the makers of Visine, said they are devastated that anyone would use our product for such an abhorrent act and Visine is clearly labeled for external use only and should never be swallowed.\n\n\n\nIn Lana Clayton's case — she decided to plead guilty to tampering with food and drugs and voluntary manslaughter.\n\nShe continued to insist she never meant to kill him.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I would like to apologize to Steven's family.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I did impulsively put the Visine in Steven's drink and I did it with the intent to make him sick and uncomfortable.\n\nHer defense team painted Lana as a victim who suffered from PTSD, stemming from sexual abuse in her past.\n\nKristi O'Connor: So, their claims were that she was sexually assaulted throughout her youth … and that went unreported to authorities … Then when she went into the U.S. Air Force … her defense team says that she was raped by three servicemen.\n\nLana Clayton pleaded guilty to tampering with food and drugs and voluntary manslaughter. In court, she said it was Steve's treatment of her that made her snap. WBTV\n\nBut that alleged assault also wasn't reported. Lana told the court it was Steve's treatment of her that made her snap.\n\nLANA CLAYTON: I was upset about the abuse and just wanted him to leave me alone. I never thought it would kill him. I had never heard of Visine being deadly.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: I told the judge … I knew it had to be very difficult to see someone who looks so frail, so gentle, so quiet and meek … and think that that person could be a cold-blooded murderer.\n\nJUDGE BURCH: What a tangled web we weave, Miss Clayton you sure have tangled this one up.\n\nOn January 16, 2020, Judge Burch sentenced Lana Clayton to 25 years in prison.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: I didn't think it was enough. … my brother was my world. He was the center of my world.\n\nKris Phagan: She … stole an amazing man … from a lot of people that loved him.\n\nNick French: … there's a huge hole in everyone that knew Steve. And I think that that hole will be there for the rest of our lives.\n\nLana Clayton declined 48 Hours' request for an interview, writing in an email, it's been a long journey for me, and it hasn't been easy coming to terms with Steven's death. … I'm now at peace.\n\nNone of us can ever be made whole because Steven is gone, his sister, Rosie Clayton-Leslie, told 48 Hours. Rosie Clayton-Leslie\n\nAnd as for Steve's loved ones, they are struggling with their loss.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: None of us can ever be made whole because Steven is gone.\n\nRosie prays the mother of Stacy Hunsucker may find peace.\n\nRosie Clayton-Leslie: We have a saying in Spanish … which means the blood cries out for justice. … I would like to one day meet the mother of that precious girl that was killed using the same method … 'cause I do believe her daughter's blood was crying out for justice, too.\n\nLana Clayton has not been awarded any money from Steve's estate.\n\nJosh Hunsucker has not yet entered a plea and awaits trial. Stacy's parents say they have complete faith in the judicial process.\n\nProduced by Asena Basak. Ryan Smith and Michelle Sigona are the development producers. Hannah Vair is the associate producer.

Authorities in Washington state have made arrests in a botched 2017 murder-for-hire plot that they say left the sister of the intended victim dead.\n\nAlisha Canales-McGuire was gunned down in the doorway of her sister's Everett home in the early morning hours of Sept. 20, 2017, as her two young nieces and nephew slept inside, reports CBS affiliate KIRO. The 24-year-old had been staying at the home of her sister, Amanda Canales, to watch the children while their mother was away on a business trip.\n\nAlisha Canales-McGuire KIRO\n\nThe Snohomish County Sheriff's Office says Amanda Canales was the intended victim of the hit ordered by her ex-husband, 31-year-old Kevin Lewis. Investigators say Lewis paid $2,400 to a 20-year-old Tacoma man and 17-year-old Spokane girl to carry out the killing.\n\nFollowing an extensive investigation, the two were arrested on charges of aggravated first-degree murder and first-degree criminal conspiracy to commit murder, the station reports. Lewis, already serving time on a 2018 conviction for assaulting Canales after she ended their marriage, faces the same charges and is also being held for investigation of first-degree solicitation to commit murder.\n\nThe victim, Alisha Canales-McGuire, was a newlywed and was hoping to have a child of her own, KIRO reports.\n\nAlisha is what I want people to remember, Amanda Canales told the station. She was an amazing sister, an amazing friend to a lot of people, an amazing auntie.\n\nShe said everybody knew from day one that her ex-husband was responsible. Canales said Lewis was emotionally abusive to her, and that the abuse later turned physical.\n\nI think it's important for people to be aware and recognize red flags, and if I had maybe recognized that earlier on my sister might still be here, Canales said.\n\nKIRO reports the two suspects accused of carrying out the botched hit are Lewis' cousin, Jerradon Phelps, and Phelps' teen girlfriend. Investigators say cellphone records show the pair, who were living in Spokane at the time of the murder, drove to Snohomish County at the time of the murder, the station reports.\n\nDetectives say Phelps posted photos on social media displaying several $100 bills shortly after the killing, and his 17-year-old girlfriend allegedly bragged to several people that she'd been hired to kill someone, according to KIRO.\n\nPhelps is reportedly being held in the Snohomish County Jail and the teen, whose name is being withheld, is being held in a juvenile justice facility.
Ever dreamed about swiping right on Tinder and getting matched with Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz? Now's your chance.\n\nAs the 2016 election season heats up, Tinder is getting into the political business with an initiative called Swipe the Vote, which lets users swipe left or right on a series of political issues and then matches them with a candidate.\n\nFirst it was Bernie supporters, then it was Rubio, reads a post on Tinder's blog. We've been amazed by the amount of users expressing their political views with matches during this presidential campaign. That's why we decided to build Swipe the Vote.\n\nSome Sanders supporters earlier this year were blocked from the dating app Tinder after inundating men with pro-Sanders messages.\n\nThe new politics feature was put together in concert with Rock the Vote, the group that seeks to increase young voter participation in elections.\n\nThe app takes user through 10 different issues, asking them to swipe the same way they would on potential romantic partners: right for yes, left for no. At the end of the issue questions, the app matches users with a candidate. Issue questions range from Drill for oil and gas in the U.S.? to Legalize marijuana? or Keep same-sex marriage legal?\n\nAfter matching with a candidate, the app directs users to register to vote with Rock the Vote.
Alan Bean, a Navy test pilot and astronaut who walked on the moon and then spent two months aboard America's first space station before leaving NASA and becoming an accomplished artist, died Saturday. He was 86.\n\nNASA confirmed Bean's death in a statement, saying the former astronaut died at Houston Methodist Hospital after a short illness.\n\nAlan was the strongest and kindest man I ever knew, his wife, Leslie Bean, said in the NASA statement. He was the love of my life and I miss him dearly. ... Alan died peacefully in Houston surrounded by those who loved him.\n\nBean was one of only 12 men to walk on the moon, two in each of six successful lunar landing missions. He is survived by just four moonwalkers: Buzz Aldrin, lunar module pilot of Apollo 11, Dave Scott, commander of Apollo 15, Charlie Duke, lunar module pilot for Apollo 16, and geologist and former U.S. Sen. Harrison Schmitt, lunar module pilot for Apollo 17, the final Apollo moon mission.\n\nI was fortunate to be the first artist with the opportunity to be in the center of the action to capture what I saw and felt, and bring it back to Earth to share with generations to come, Bean wrote on his website.\n\nApollo Astronaut, Alan Bean of Apollo 12, speaks at NASA Headquarters on July 20, 2009 in Washington, DC. Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nIt is my dream that on the wings of my paintbrush many people will see what I saw and feel what I felt, walking on another world some 240,000 miles from my studio here on planet Earth. I believe my paintings are beautiful and important art. It is art not of the distant past, but art of our time. Art we can understand, important art to us and our descendants because we were there as history was made.\n\nAndrew Chaikin, author of A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts, said Bean was unique among NASA's cadre of astronauts, an accomplished test pilot who also had the talent -- and confidence -- to step away from the apex of an extremely successful technical career to pursue his art with the same single-minded devotion that took him to the moon.\n\nHe was very passionate about his art, he devoted the entire post-NASA part of his life to painting and to recording the Apollo missions as an artist, Chaikin said. He was very successful. People paid tens of thousands of dollars for his paintings.\n\nBean also was singularly focused, turning out paintings on commission that were striking in their use of bold colors -- the red, white and blue of the American flag, for example -- set against the stark black-and-white environment of the moon.\n\nFans paid handsomely for that vision. Bean's website recently listed paintings with price tags that ranged up to a half-million dollars.\n\nWhat one must understand about Alan Bean is he is the only artist to have ever walked on the moon, Tom Hanks wrote on Bean's website. No poet has ever been to the lunar surface, nor any journalist, architect nor songwriter. In the realm of the arts, it has fallen upon Alan Bean to be the one moonwalker to turn hard data brought back from the moon into something other than numbered photographs.\n\nThe images that Al has committed to canvas, then, are important, inspiring and priceless works of art. Not only has he painted the moon, he's been there.\n\nChaikin said the key to Bean's success, on Earth and off, was his focus and intensity.\n\nThe thing you have to know about Alan is my God, he was single minded, Chaikin said. He was the most single-minded, diligent guy I can think of. He just got up in the morning with his objective and he just didn't let go of it until it was accomplished. And that included teaching himself to be a better artist. He was absolutely relentless in his pursuit of becoming a better artist.\n\nIn a 1989 interview before the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, Bean recalled struggling to understand how Monet, one of his favorite artists, had captured the subtle lighting in a painting of a cathedral. So Bean flew to Europe, visited the church and spent days, from dawn to dusk, watching how light played across the structure.\n\nAlan wanted to understand what Monet actually saw versus what he painted, Chaikin said, recalling the story. He went to the place and sat there at different times of day. That's classic Alan. He was a perfectionist.\n\nSchmitt recalled phone calls from Bean to ask about some detail about lunar soil, color or equipment he wanted to have represented exactly in a painting. Other times, he wanted to discuss items in the description he was writing to go with a painting.\n\nHis enthusiasm about space and art never waned, Schmitt said in the NASA statement. Alan Bean (was) one of the great renaissance men of his generation - engineer, fighter pilot, astronaut and artist,\n\nBorn in Wheeler, Texas, on March 15, 1932, Bean earned a degree in aeronautical engineering before joining the Navy and eventually winning a coveted assignment to the Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Md.\n\nIn 1963, he was selected in NASA's third group of astronauts, along with Apollo 11 crew members Aldrin and Mike Collins, Scott and Apollo 17 commander Eugene Cernan, the 12th and last man to walk on the moon.\n\nAfter serving in backup roles for the Gemini 10 and Apollo 9 missions, Bean was named lunar module pilot for Apollo 12, the second moon landing mission. Perched atop a gargantuan Saturn 5 rocket, Bean and his crewmates -- commander Pete Conrad and Richard Gordon -- blasted off on Nov. 14, 1969.\n\nThe rocket was launched in dismal weather and 36 seconds after liftoff, a lightning bolt hit the Saturn 5 followed 16 seconds later by a second strike, wreaking havoc with the on-board electronics. To call it a frightening moment would be an understatement.\n\nWhat the hell was that? Gordon asked as caution lights flared in the cockpit. I lost a whole bunch of stuff. I don't know...\n\nMoments later, Conrad radioed mission control in Houston, saying we just lost the (guidance) platform, gang. I don't know what happened here, we had everything in the world drop out.\n\nApollo 12 commander Pete Conrad, left, command module pilot Richard Gordon, center, and lunar module pilot Alan Bean pose beside a mockup of the lunar lander Conrad and Bean would use to land on the moon in November 1969. NASA\n\nBut the Saturn 5 was healthy and an alert flight controller, recalling a similar electrical glitch during training, had the crew change a switch setting in the cockpit and the displays returned to normal.\n\nEven without getting hit by lightning, Bean's first ride aboard a rocket left a lasting impression.\n\nThe noise and the vibration during the launch was so much greater than I anticipated, he said. I'd flown a lot of different kinds of airplanes as a test pilot. When that Saturn 5 started rumbling and kicking around, it was so much more than I ever imagined that I thought something was wrong.\n\nAs it turned out, nothing was wrong. I remember it just as a 10-minute ride on something that was so much more powerful and so much more energetic and had so much more potential than I thought anything had that I was just kind of overwhelmed.\n\nLikewise, the view from orbit.\n\nThe whole thing about the lunar trip was every part of it was more amazing and more science fiction than I imagined it to be, he said. The view of the Earth looking back from space, I knew what it was going to look like. But when I actually got there and looked back and saw it sitting out there and realized that everybody but the three of us was down there, it just seemed impossible. It just seemed too amazing to be true. The whole mission went that way.\n\nFour days after launch, Conrad and Bean left Gordon behind in orbit and landed the lunar module Intrepid near the lip of a crater in the Ocean of Storms.\n\nThe goal was to demonstrate a precision landing and the crew did just that, setting down within sight of a robotic Surveyor spacecraft that landed earlier inside the crater. Bean later snapped a famous photo of Bean standing by the Surveyor spacecraft with Intrepid in the background on the rim of the depression.\n\nThe crew hoped to send down the first live color television from the surface during their two moonwalks, but Bean inadvertently pointed the camera at the sun, knocking it out of action.\n\nHe never kind of got over that, Chaikin said. He was always sorry that he did that.\n\nBut Bean's memories of the surface remained sharp in his mind, with all the clarity that later would be reflected in his paintings. In one of those, titled Heavenly Reflections, Bean shows himself standing on the moon, his hand on Conrad's shoulder as they both look back on Earth, which is reflected in their helmets.\n\nAs I touched Pete's shoulder I thought, can all the people we know, all the people we love, who we've seen on TV, or read about in the newspapers, all be up there on that tiny blue and white marble? Bean wrote of the painting.\n\nEarth is small but so lovely. It is easily the most beautiful object we could see from the Moon. It was a wondrous moment. If there is a God in heaven, this must be what he sees as he looks toward his children on the good Earth.\n\nBean and Conrad spent seven hours and 45 minutes walking on the moon during two excursions, collecting about 75 pounds of lunar rocks and soil, along with components from the Surveyor lander. They blasted off on Nov. 20, one day after landing, rejoining Gordon aboard the command module Yankee Clipper for the trip back to Earth.\n\nOur ascent (from the surface) was like six minutes and three seconds, Bean said. I can remember thinking, I hope this engine runs for six minutes and three seconds! You didn't have much instrumentation on it because there was nothing you could do about it if it didn't. ... Your life's on the line. If it doesn't work, you're cooked.\n\nBut it did work, and the Apollo 12 crew safely returned to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean on Nov. 24, 1969.\n\nNASA would launch another five Apollo missions, but Bean never got another chance to visit the moon. But he did get a chance to return to space, serving as commander of the second three-man Skylab space station crew in 1973, logging a then-record 59 days in orbit. His final flight assignment at NASA was backup commander of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975.\n\nBean retired from the Navy that same year but continued to serve as head of the Astronaut Candidate Operations and Training Group at the Johnson Space Center Houston before retiring from NASA in 1981 to pursue his painting career full time.\n\nHis decision was based on the fact that, in his 18 years as an astronaut, he was fortunate enough to visit worlds and see sights no artist's eye, past or present, has ever viewed firsthand, NASA said in a 1993 biography. He hopes to express these experiences through the medium of art. He is pursuing this dream at his home and studio in Houston.\n\nBean logged 1,671 hours and 45 minutes in space, including 10 hours and 26 minutes spacewalking on the moon or in Earth orbit. He logged more than 7,145 hours flying time in a variety of aircraft, including 4,850 hours in jets.\n\nI became an astronaut because they were flying higher and faster and further than anything else, Bean said. So I didn't do it to be an explorer. I did it to be a pilot and do these amazing flying things.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Leslie, his sister Paula Stott, and two children from an earlier marriage, Amy and Clay.
Washington — Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah released a proposal on Thursday aimed at providing direct payments monthly to parents, with the goal of attracting bipartisan support for a plan aimed at significantly reducing child poverty in the U.S.\n\nUnder Romney's plan, named the Family Security Act, families with children would receive a monthly cash benefit of hundreds of dollars per child. Families with children up to five years old would receive $4,200 per year per child in $350 monthly payments, and families with children ages 6 to 17 would receive $3,000 per year per child, or $250 per month. Romney's proposal caps the monthly amount for a family to $1,250, and expecting parents can apply for the benefit four months before the child's due date.\n\nAmerican families are facing greater financial strain, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, and marriage and birth rates are at an all-time low, Romney said in a statement. This proposal offers a path toward greater security for America's families by consolidating the many complicated programs to create a monthly cash benefit for them, without adding to the deficit.\n\nIndividual taxpayers making up to $200,000 and couples making up to $400,000 would be eligible for the payments, with payments phasing out above those income levels.\n\nA summary of the $254 billion proposal specifies that it would be deficit-neutral by eliminating other areas of spending, including the State and Local Tax Deduction and the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which will likely draw opposition from Democrats.\n\nRomney is expected to file the plan as an amendment to the budget resolution currently under consideration in the Senate on Thursday, according to a source familiar with the senator's plan.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank, Romney's proposal would cut child poverty in the U.S. by up to a third, and deep child poverty by half.\n\nRon Klain, President Biden's chief of staff, weighed in on the proposal, tweeting that he is looking forward to see what @Senator Romney will propose here — an encouraging sign that bipartisan action to reduce child poverty is possible.\n\nA Romney aide said the Utah senator's office has communicated with officials in the Biden administration and is willing to work with them.\n\nThe Biden administration $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package calls for increasing the child tax credit to $3,600 for children up to age 6, and $3,000 per child up to age 17. The White House is also supportive for an additional $1 billion for states to help TANF recipients due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
TAMPA, Fla. -- Oscar Ray Bolin was first found guilty of murdering three women nearly 30 years ago. In the decades since, every one of the verdicts delivered by juries in three separate trials was reversed at least twice by appeals courts, although ultimately he was convicted again in each case: 10 times by 10 juries, to be exact.\n\nIt now appears Bolin's legal pleas are coming to an end.\n\nUnless an appeals court or the U.S. Supreme Court steps in, Bolin, 53, will be executed Thursday at 6 p.m. in Florida State Prison for the 1986 slaying of Teri Lynn Matthews.\n\nFor Matthews' family and relatives of the two other victims, it's about time.\n\nIt will be in a sense, a closure, said Matthews' mother, Kathleen Reeves. It's been so long. The pain doesn't change. It's just time for it. It's due. It's past due.\n\nBolin's trials received widespread publicity in the Tampa Bay area - but not just because of the seemingly endless legal processes or the brutal nature of the killings.\n\nWhile on trial, Bolin and a woman on his defense team fell in love. Rosalie Martinez had been a paralegal at the Hillsborough Public Defender's office who was married to a prominent Tampa attorney. Martinez divorced him and married Bolin, on live TV, in 1996 - 10 years after the slayings.\n\nRosalie Bolin says her husband is innocent in Matthews' killing, and she has become one of the state's most outspoken death penalty opponents since her marriage to Oscar Ray Bolin.\n\nPolice said Bolin's first Florida victim was 25-year-old Natalie Holley, who was abducted after she left work at a Tampa fast food restaurant in January of 1986. In October of that same year, 17-year-old Stephanie Collins disappeared from a shopping center parking lot in Tampa. Two months later, Matthews was abducted from a post office in Pasco County, just north of Tampa. All three were fatally stabbed.\n\nThe cases went unsolved until someone called an anonymous tip line in 1990, when Bolin was already serving a 22- to 75-year prison sentence in Ohio for kidnapping and raping a 20-year-old waitress outside Toledo in 1987.\n\nAuthorities later discovered it was the new husband of Bolin's ex-wife who called in the tip; the ex-wife said Bolin had told her about the killings in 1986. During the trial, Bolin's younger half brother said he watched Bolin beat Matthews and try to drown her with a garden hose. The half brother later recanted his story, then reversed his position again.\n\nAll of Bolin's convictions were reversed at least twice due to legal errors, but new juries found him guilty again in all three cases. He once again received the death penalty in the Matthews' and Collins' killings, but a new jury in the Holley slaying found Bolin guilty of second-degree murder, converting his previous death sentence to a sentence of life in prison.\n\nReeves said it doesn't matter that Bolin is not awaiting execution in all three cases because he only dies once.\n\nHe dies for all of our girls.\n\nThe mothers of the three victims attended many of the trials together. Holley's mother died in 2012.\n\nIn motions for a stay of execution filed with a district court and the Florida Supreme Court, Bolin contends that an Ohio inmate confessed to Matthews' murder. The inmate committed suicide in late 2014, however. Both courts denied the stay.\n\nBolin's attorney, Bjorn Brunvand of Clearwater, said he filed another motion to stay with the district court and with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court denied the motion Monday. If all appeals are denied, Brunvand said he will file a motion to stay with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nI think that he should get a new trial because another individual has confessed to that murder, Brunvand said.\n\nBrunvand is also arguing that Bolin should get a new trial in the Matthews case because the technique of an FBI hair analyst who produced evidence against him was later discredited.\n\nRosalie Bolin has declined to speak about her husband's pending execution. But she wrote in an email that the State is about to execute an innocent man based on perjury, police misconduct, tainted FBI evidence ... confessions of other perps ... prosecutorial conduct.\n\nThe victims' families say that they've been put through hell by the endless appeals, and put some of the blame on Bolin's wife.\n\nHe'd go on forever, he and Rosalie, Reeves said.\n\nIn an interview with ABC's 20/20 in August, Bolin said he wished the families were aware of evidence that he said would help exonerate him.\n\nThey hear what the state wants them to hear and what the prosecution wants them to hear, Bolin said. But all the other evidence that's been suppressed, I know about it and my attorneys know about it. They don't.\n\nReeves said she's prepared to consider forgiveness, if Bolin admits to his guilt in the moments before his execution.\n\nIf he even just hinted, or said, 'I'm really sorry,' I think we could think about forgiving him, she said. If he doesn't do that, there is no forgiveness.
Comedy veteran Jerry Stiller, who launched his career opposite wife Anne Meara in the 1950s and reemerged four decades later as the hysterically high-strung Frank Costanza on the smash television show Seinfeld, has died. He was 92.\n\nHis son, Ben Stiller, announced the death on Twitter on Monday:\n\nI'm sad to say that my father, Jerry Stiller, passed away from natural causes. He was a great dad and grandfather, and the most dedicated husband to Anne for about 62 years. He will be greatly missed. Love you Dad. pic.twitter.com/KyoNsJIBz5 — Ben Stiller (@RedHourBen) May 11, 2020\n\nBen Stiller is a star comic actor in his own right.\n\nMost recently, Jerry Stiller played Arthur on the hit sitcom King of Queens. The Arthur character was also high-strung.\n\nJerry Stiller was a multi-talented performer who appeared in an assortment of movies, playing Walter Matthau's police sidekick in the thriller The Taking of Pelham One Two Three and Divine's husband, Wilbur Turnblad in John Waters' twisted comedy Hairspray.\n\nHe also wrote an autobiography, Married to Laughter, about his 50-plus year marriage to soul mate and comedic cohort Meara, who died in 2015. And his myriad television spots included everything from Murder She Wrote to Law and Order - along with 36 appearances alongside Meara on The Ed Sullivan Show.\n\nStiller, although a supporting player on Seinfeld, created some of the Emmy-winning show's most enduring moments: co-creator and model for the bro, a brassiere for men; a Korean War cook who inflicted food poisoning on his entire unit; and an ever-simmering salesman controlling his explosive temper with the shouted mantra, Serenity now!\n\nStiller earned an 1997 Emmy nomination for his indelible Seinfeld performance. In a 2005 Esquire interview, Stiller recalled that he was out of work and not the first choice for the role of Frank Costanza, father to Jason Alexander's neurotic George.\n\nMy manager had retired, he said. I was close to 70 years old, and had nowhere to go.\n\nHe was initially told to play the role as a milquetoast husband with an overbearing wife, Estelle, played by Estelle Harris. But the character wasn't working - until Stiller suggested his reincarnation as an over-the-top crank who matched his wife scream for scream.\n\nIt jump-started the septuagenarian's career, landing him a spot playing Vince Lombardi in a Nike commercial and the role of another over-the-top dad on the long-running King of Queens.\n\nWhile he was known as a nut-job father on the small screen, Stiller and wife Meara raised two children in their longtime home on Manhattan's Upper West Side: daughter Amy, who became an actress, and son Ben, who became a writer, director and actor in such films as Dodgeball, There's Something About Mary and Meet the Parents.\n\nHe and Ben performed together in Shoeshine, which was nominated for a 1988 Academy Award in the short subject category.\n\nStiller was considerably quieter and reflective in person than in character - although just as funny. The son of a bus driver and a housewife, Stiller grew up in Depression-era Brooklyn.\n\nHis inspiration to enter show business came at age 8, when his father took him to see the Marx Brothers in the comedy classic A Night at the Opera.\n\nYears later, Stiller met Groucho Marx and thanked him.\n\nStiller earned a drama degree at Syracuse University after serving in World War II, then headed to New York City to launch his career. There was a brief involvement in Shakespearean theater, including a $55 a week job with Jack Klugman in Coriolanus.\n\nBut his life and career took off after he met Meara in spring 1953. They were married that fall.\n\nThe seemingly mismatched pair - he a short, stocky Jewish guy from Brooklyn, she a tall, Irish Catholic from the Long Island suburbs - shared an immediate onstage chemistry, too. They were soon appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show and working nightclubs nationwide.\n\nThe pair also wrote and performed radio commercials, most memorably a series of bits for a little-known wine called Blue Nun. The duo's ads boosted sales by 500%. Ben Stiller recalled trips with his sister to California when his parents would head west to do television appearances.\n\nThe couple went on to appear as a team in dozens of film, stage and television productions. One was After-Play, a 1995 off-Broadway show written by Meara.\n\nStiller joined Seinfeld in 1993 and moved on to King of Queens when the other Jerry & co. went off the air in 1998.\n\nThe following year, he appeared in Ben Stiller's spoof on modeling, Zoolander.
LONDON -- The big day finally arrived: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were married Saturday at St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. The prince takes on the title of Duke of Sussex and his American actress bride, the newest member of the British royal family, has become the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nIt all started with a blind date two years ago that went very, very well, and culminated in a global mega-event that will help reshape the British monarchy. It was watched by tens of millions of TV viewers around the world, and CBS News' entire live coverage of the historic event can be enjoyed over and over again in the full video above.\n\nGuests welcomed the royal newlyweds at a reception Saturday afternoon featuring seasonal British produce and a nontraditional wedding cake. It comes after a service which itself managed to combine hundreds of years of British tradition with a contemporary American twist.\n\nHere's how it all unfolded:\n\nArrivals\n\nAfter a stream of A-listers including George and Amal Clooney and David and Victoria Beckham poured out of buses and into St. George's Chapel, the guests of honor began to arrive.\n\nPrince Harry and best man Prince William showed up, dressed in their formal military uniforms, and waved and smiled as they stepped across the grounds of the 15th-century church. Harry ended a week of speculation (and betting) on whether he would shave off his beard for the ceremony. It was neatly trimmed, but still very much upon the royal face.\n\nWilliam, who was married to commoner Kate Middleton at a ceremony in 2011, carried his brother's rings.\n\nMeghan's mother Doria Ragland, who flew in earlier in the week from Los Angeles to attend the wedding, arrived in one of the royal family's fleet of limousines. She was greeted by a member of the clergy and escorted into the chapel.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II arrived at St. George's Chapel in a flared lime-colored dress in printed silk and an edge-to-edge coat with a lime silk tweed fastening. She was joined by her husband, Prince Philip. The guests stood to attention as the pair entered the chapel.\n\nOther members of the royal family had already taken their places inside the chapel, including Harry's uncles Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, his aunt Princess Anne and his cousins Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice.\n\nMeghan -- the dress and tiara\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex emerged from a vintage limousine to reveal a wedding dress by designer Clare Waight Keller -- the first British senior designer taken on by storied French fashion house Givenchy.\n\nMarkle's choice was closely watched Saturday given how big an impact royal wedding dresses have on what brides everywhere want to wear in the years that follow. Princess Diana's 1981 wedding gown, with its romantic details and dramatic train, defined the '80s fairytale bridal look.\n\nMore recently, when Kate Middleton married Prince William in 2011, her long-sleeved lace gown immediately sparked a trend for more covered-up, traditional lace bridal dresses.\n\nMarkle reached 125 years back into the British monarchy's vault to choose her wedding tiara. The diamond bandeau she wore was made for Queen Mary, who was crowned with husband King George V in 1911. The tiara was specifically designed to accommodate a brooch that was given to Mary in 1893 to commemorate her engagement to the then-Prince George.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II inherited the pieces in 1953. The grandmother of groom Prince Harry has hundreds of tiaras stored in locked vaults. Royal tradition dictated that the queen would let the Duchess of Sussex borrow one of the sparkly heirlooms.\n\nIn the months before Saturday's wedding, there had been speculation over whether Markle would continue the tiara tradition and if so, whether she would choose one that belonged to Harry's late mother, Princess Diana.\n\nA service, with a message\n\nMarkle arrived to a fanfare and walked down the aisle accompanied part of the way by Prince Charles, and by 10 young page boys and bridesmaids. The children include 4-year-old Prince George and 3-year-old Princess Charlotte, children of Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nDean of Windsor David Conner welcomed the congregation at the start of the wedding. The couple stood at the altar in St. George's Chapel, smiling at each other as a soprano sang a work by Handel.\n\nAs they stood there, Harry said to Meghan: You look amazing.\n\nThe leader of the Episcopal Church quoted civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the redemptive power of love as he blessed the marriage of Harry and Meghan.\n\nMost Rev. Michael Bruce Curry, who was hand-picked by the couple to deliver the sermon at their wedding, told the bride and groom Saturday that there was power in love and that love can help and heal when nothing else can.\n\nBut Curry, a champion of civil rights causes and outspoken supporter of gay rights, continued it's not just for and about a young couple, who we rejoice with, it's more than that.\n\nIt was an address the likes of which no previous royal wedding had ever witnessed, steeped in the tradition of largely black churches in the United States. Invoking the days of slavery in the United States, Curry said love helped those in captivity to persevere.\n\nHe told the couple love has the power to change the world… When love is the way, we actually treat each other -- well, like we are actual family.\n\nIt was the archbishop of Canterbury who declared Harry and Meghan husband and wife. Justin Welby, the head of the Church of England, made the proclamation after the couple promised to love and cherish one another till death us do part, and exchanged rings.\n\nThe British-American pair were now officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as the duchess took her place among senior members of the royal family.\n\nA kiss and a carriage ride\n\nThe royal newlyweds emerged from St. George's Chapel not long after and the crowd outside roared as Harry and Meghan kissed at the top of he chapel steps.\n\nThey then took a short trip through Windsor in a horse-drawn carriage, to the delight of thousands of well-wishers along the route. The Ascot Landau carriage, in the royal family since it was built for them in 1880, looped through Windsor and then back to Windsor Castle for the daytime reception.\n\nKensington Palace said the 600 guests at the Windsor Castle reception wedding would eat canapés including Scottish langoustines, grilled English asparagus and croquette of confit Windsor lamb. There's no sit-down meal at the lunchtime reception, but guests will be offered bowls of chicken fricassee with morel mushrooms, pea and mint risotto and slow-roasted pork belly.\n\nPlace of honor went to the wedding cake by California-raised London master baker Claire Ptak. The layered lemon and elderflower cake features ingredients including 200 Amalfi lemons and 10 bottles of elderflower cordial from Queen Elizabeth II's Sandringham estate. It was decorated with Swiss meringue buttercream and 150 fresh flowers, mainly British and in season, including peonies and roses.\n\nThe reception is hosted by Prince William, his brother's best man, and will include speeches by Harry's father, Prince Charles, and the bride and groom.\n\nThe newlyweds weren't to be seen again until much later on Saturday, perhaps giving a brief wave to fans again as they head to an evening reception at Frogmore House, several miles from Windsor Castle.
NEW YORK — Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner has been ordered to register as a sex offender as he nears the end of a 21-month prison sentence for having illicit online contact with a 15-year-old girl.\n\nA New York City judge on Friday designated Weiner a Level 1 sex offender, meaning he's thought to have a low risk of reoffending.\n\nWeiner must register for a minimum of 20 years. He's required to verify his address every year and visit a police station every three years to have a new picture taken.\n\nWeiner didn't attend Friday's court hearing. He's in a halfway house after serving most of his sentence at a prison in Massachusetts. He's due to be released May 14.\n\nBefore being sentenced, the Democrat said he'd been a very sick man.\n\nThese destructive impulses brought great devastation to my family and friends, and destroyed my life's dream of public service, Weiner said when he pleaded guilty in 2017. I am committed to making amends to all those I have harmed.\n\nThe disgraced former congressman acknowledged he communicated online with a girl who accused him of sending sexually explicit messages, but said he's also been the subject of a hoax.\n\nWeiner's reputation grew because of his marriage to Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton. It was because of content found on Weiner's laptop, the FBI said, that encouraged the FBI to re-open the investigation into Clinton's emails, something then-FBI Director James Comey announced only days before the 2016 presidential election.
LOS ANGELES -- A California family appealed Tuesday to the state's highest court in their fight to keep a six-year-old foster child who was removed from their home after a lower court said her slight Native American heritage requires that she live with relatives in Utah.\n\nThe family's lawyer, Lori Alvino McGill, filed the request for the California Supreme Court to hear the appeal. McGill also requested that custody of the child named Lexi be returned to Rusty and Summer Page until the appeal is decided.\n\nThe Pages have fought efforts under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act to place Lexi with relatives of her father, who is Native American. The Pages argued that Lexi has lived with them since the age of two and knows no other life.\n\nHowever, a court found that the Page family had not proven the child would suffer emotional harm by the transfer.\n\nThe Pages have three children and want to adopt Lexi, who is 1/64th Choctaw on her birth father's side.\n\nLexi was 17 months old when she was removed from the custody of her birth parents. Her mother had substance abuse problems, and her father had a criminal history, according to court records.\n\nThe child cried and clutched a stuffed bear as Rusty Page carried her out of his home near Los Angeles on Monday and Los Angeles County social workers whisked her away in a waiting car.\n\nDistraught and weeping, Page shared his foster daughter's parting words with CBS Los Angeles: Don't let them take me. I'm scared. I'm scared. Don't let me go.\n\nPage said he responded: I have to because the county of L.A. said I have to.\n\nHow is it that a screaming child, saying, 'I want to stay, I'm scared,' how is it in her best interest to pull her from the girl she was before that doorbell rang? Rusty Page told CBS News Radio station KNX-AM radio.\n\nLexi's foster dad, Rusty, sobs after she is driven away CBS News\n\nHis wife, Summer Page, screamed, Lexi, I love you! and a crowd of friends and neighbors wept, prayed or sang hymns.\n\nUnder the transfer, the girl will live with a Utah couple who are not Native Americans but are related by marriage to her father. The girl's sister is living with the couple, and another sister will be living down the street, said Leslie Heimov of the Children's Law Center of California, Lexi's court-appointed legal representatives.\n\nThe law is very clear that siblings should be kept together whenever they can be, and they should be placed together even if they were not initially together, Heimov told the Los Angeles Daily News.\n\nShe said Lexi and the Utah family had traded messages and monthly visits over the past three years.\n\nShe has a loving relationship with them, Heimov said. They are not strangers in any way, shape or form.\n\nThe National Indian Child Welfare Association said in a statement that the Pages were aware for years that the girl was an American Indian but chose to drag out litigation as long as possible, creating instability for the child.\n\nThe Choctaw Nation said it desires the best for this Choctaw child.\n\nDozens of similar cases involving foster families have gone to court in multiple states stretching back to the passage of the Indian Child Welfare Act in the late 1970s.
Movie lovers, it's time to gorge yourselves at the Tribeca Film Festival, New York City's annual film bash which is as much a celebration of the city as it is of cinema, TV and virtual reality. Now in its 18th year, the TFF runs April 24-May 5 at venues all across Manhattan, showcasing more than 100 fiction and non-fiction features from around the globe, each a world, North American, U.S. or New York City premiere.\n\nThe New York City festival features more than 100 fiction and documentary features, as well as virtual reality displays, talks and musical performances. Tribeca Film Festival\n\nThere are also retrospective screenings of film classics, sidebars (including a collection of movies reflecting on New York's past), genre films, short films, sports films, interactive and virtual reality programming, TV presentations, and panel discussions starring noted filmmakers and industry figures.\n\nThe festival opens Wednesday, April 24, with the world premiere of Roger Ross Williams' HBO documentary The Apollo, about the landmark Harlem showplace, which will be screened – where else? – at the Apollo. The closing presentation is the world premiere of Yesterday, the latest film from Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire), about a musician who awakens in a world which has never heard The Beatles' music. What's a young songwriter to do? Plagiarize!\n\nThe world premiere screening of the thoughtful and tuneful documentary Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice will be followed by a live performance by Sheryl Crow (April 26).\n\nTalks include conversations between director Martin Scorsese and festival co-founder Robert De Niro (April 28); frequent collaborators Jennifer Lawrence and director David O. Russell (April 27); and Alec Baldwin interviewing Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro (April 25). There are also master classes in writing, music, sound design and other cinematic crafts, including a May 3 symposium with Irwin Winkler, producer of such films as Rocky and The Right Stuff.\n\nFeature Film Highlights\n\nOne of the pleasures of the festival is discovering new films before they even have distributors lined up. But that's also a frustration; sharing the word on a movie which might not be accessible to the general public for months, or longer, can be dismaying. [Among the best of last year's Tribeca offerings were the Silicon Valley documentary General Magic and the Canadian teen sex comedy Slut in a Good Way, which are only now entering general release a year later, while the Jeffrey Wright prison drama O.G. took almost a year to make it to HBO.]\n\nOnly a portion of this year's films have been available for preview at press time, but of those screened in advance, here are 15 highlights that are definitely recommended – catch 'em while you can!\n\nAlec Baldwin in Framing John DeLorean. Sundance Selects\n\nFraming John DeLorean (World Premiere) - Documentaries in recent years have expanded the use of recreations to fill in gaps in storytelling where no footage exists. (After all, how many criminal enterprises have kept cameras running to document their activities?) But recreations are also valuable in life stories, as in this imaginative rendition of the tale of General Motors executive John DeLorean, who left GM to build his own car company and then, after its failure, found himself at the center of an FBI sting operation involving $24 million worth of cocaine. It's a life that's choice fodder for the Hollywood treatment, and while there is a wealth of newsreel film (and undercover surveillance tapes!) of DeLorean's life, directors Sheena M. Joyce and Don Argott also employ Alec Baldwin to don makeup and portray DeLorean in public and private dramatizations where the arc of his incredible career reaches both its zenith and its nadir. But that's not all: Baldwin gives us an actor's psychoanalysis of his character, measuring the ambitions and motives of a man who took extreme risks that forever scarred his family. Screens April 30, May 1, 4. Released theatrically and via VOD on June 7 from Sundance Selects.\n\nInna de Yard: The Soul of Jamaica (World Premiere) – In the spirit of Buena Vista Social Club, director Peter Webber documents a congregation of Jamaican reggae royalty as they record an album, then appear in concert in Paris. Beloved musical figures Ken Boothe, Kiddus I, Winston McAnuff, Judy Mowatt and others split their time between performing and engaging in a delightful nostalgia trip of musical discovery, discussing their origins and influences and how a musical life is pursued on a small, hardscrabble Caribbean island, one vinyl pressing at a time. Screens April 29 (followed by a live performance by Ken Boothe), May 1, 3. No U.S. distributor announced, but a soundtrack album is available.\n\nLeftover Women (World Premiere) – In China, where there are tens of millions more single women of marriageable age than men, women who fail to snag husbands are stigmatized as leftover women, upon whom parents and society exert tremendous pressure to find someone, anyone, to plight their troth. Shosh Shlam and Hilla Medalia's surprisingly intimate documentary follows three such women – Hua Mei, a 34-year-old lawyer; Min, a 28-year-old radio broadcaster; and Qi, a 36-year-old professor – as they navigate matchmakers, group date events, marriage markets (where parents try to sell their unmarried offspring's unique talents), therapists, and their fraught relationships with mothers and fathers. The women's emotional revelations about their personal and professional ambitions, and their conversations with parents who are by turns impatient and proud, attest to the directors' ability to be present with their camera without being in the way. Screens April 27, 28, May 1, 5. No U.S. distributor announced.\n\nJaeden Martell and Keean Johnson in Low Tide. Tribeca Film Festival\n\nLow Tide (World Premiere) – This atmospheric coming-of-age crime drama, about Jersey Shore youths who burgle vacation homes, has the welcome advantage of not being predictable. In his feature debut, director Kevin McMullin mixes the atmosphere of an idyllic summer, in which locals flirt with visiting girls, with the double-crosses of a gang who turn on each other when a cache of gold coins is uncovered. Well shot and edited, with believable performances by its young cast, including Jaeden Martell, Keean Johnson, Alex Neustaedter and Daniel Zolghadri. Screens April 28, 29, May 2. No U.S. distributor announced.\n\nMaiden (New York Premiere) – This thrilling documentary with some jaw-dropping footage tells the story of Tracy Edwards, who at age 24 skippered an all-female crew on a 58-foot yacht competing in the 1989-90 Whitbread Round the World Race, sailing 32,000 nautical miles from the U.K. to the edge of Antarctica and back. To say they were sailing in the face of misogyny was putting it mildly; Alex Holmes' film recounts not only the sniffs of the media and the yachting establishment to Edwards and her crew's endeavor, but also their shock once they realized these women knew what they were doing. Screens May 1, 2, 4. Opens theatrically on June 28 via Sony Pictures Classics.\n\nMaking Waves: The Art of Cinematic Sound (World Premiere) - A choice documentary for film nerds (and admit it, if you are reading this very long article about a film festival, you are one) is this examination of the history and evolution of sound in motion pictures, with the linchpins being three superstars of the medium: Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now), Ben Burtt (Star Wars) and Gary Rydstrom (Toy Story). The movie balances discussion of technical advancements since the birth of the movies (including multichannel Dolby stereo and digital recording and editing) with aesthetic uses of sound as a vital, yet often underappreciated, component of storytelling. Screens April 29 (followed by master class conversation with Murch, Burtt, Rydstrom and director Midge Costin), April 30, May 2. No U.S. distributor announced.\n\nOnly (World Premiere) - The dystopian future following a mysterious pathogen that wipes out virtually all human females comes not by a snap but a mournful, months-long passing from life through fear to despair. This sci-fi catastrophe seems decidedly less dystopian than you'd think it would be if suddenly half the human race were eliminated, but Freida Pinto's performance as a woman fighting for survival as possibly the only woman left on Earth, while her partner does everything he can to ensure it, is very effective. A very good scene: Pinto communicates with her father via cellphone but can't reveal herself because of fears of government surveillance. Also noteworthy: the villains of the story are actually painted with a human touch – people who have had their futures stolen from them and seek answers, if not the possibility for a semblance of humanity. Directed and written by Takashi Doscher (Still). Screens April 27, 28, May 2, 4. No distributor announced.\n\nOur Time Machine (World Premiere) – Chinese photographer and mixed-media artist Maleonn embarked on an imaginative theatrical project, incorporating puppetry and projections, as a means to maintain a connection with his father, once a theater director, whose mind is slipping into dementia. Conjuring a story built on memory about a young man building a time machine in order to reunite his father with the memories of the boy's own childhood, Maleonn aims to meld his own memories with an artistic collaboration he'd never had the chance to participate in with his father. A tender and visually striking film about using art to combat the unrelenting difficulties of aging. Screens April 28, 30, May 3. No distributor announced.\n\nThe Quiet One (World Premiere) – The title refers to the member of the Rolling Stones who wasn't gyrating out front with a microphone or setting the stage afire on the guitar, but passionately supplying the bass for the world's greatest rock band. Bill Wyman, who grew up in south London, became enamored of American rock and blues stars like Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters. A self-taught musician, he built his own electric bass when he joined the Cliftons, before being enlisted by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards for their new blues band. A collector by nature, the modest Wyman has amassed decades of rare film footage, photos and interviews, which tell the fascinating story of the Stones, and of his own private life which seems to run counter to the vicissitudes of rock celebrity. Screens May 2, 3, 4. Released theatrically June 21 via Sundance Selects/IFC Films.\n\nRecorder: The Marion Stokes Project (World Premiere) – With a background as a librarian and the moderator of a Philadelphia public access TV talk show that examined political, social and religious issues, Marion Stokes was obsessed with how the media portrayed current events, and rightfully feared that ephemeral TV news broadcasts were in danger of being wiped away – hence, her dogged determination (for which she conscripted family and the hired help) to record TV news channels nonstop for more than 30 years. When she passed in 2012, she left behind a trove of 70,000 Betamax and VHS videotapes covering local, national and international news, from the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis to the Sandy Hook school shooting. Matt Wolf's documentary explores both the personal obsessions of Stokes (a hoarder, she owned 192 Apple computers) and the quandary of what to do with the voluminous archive – her life's work – which she left behind. Screens April 25, 26, 27, May 4. No U.S. distributor announced.\n\nAynur (Almila Bagriacik) rejects her arranged marriage in A Regular Woman. Tribeca Film Festival\n\nA Regular Woman (World Premiere) – Based on the true story of the honor killing of a young Muslim woman living in Berlin whose family felt she had betrayed her religion and so murdered her, director Sherry Hormann's gripping film is brought to vivid life by the performance of Almila Bagriacik as Hatun Aynur Sürücü, a woman who rejected both the abusive husband she'd been forced (as a 16-year-old) to marry and the strict Sunni Islam tenets of her Kurdish émigré family. (Her brothers, convinced Aynur's more secular life and relationships with non-Muslim men will condemn both her and her child to hell, decide that murder is morally justified.) The movie is a flashback, narrated by the murdered Aynur, whose forthrightness, pride and sarcastic asides are in stark contrast to the vise-grip of patriarchal familial traditions to which she is bound. Screens April 27, 28, May 1. No U.S. distributor announced.\n\nRoads (World Premiere) – While vacationing in Morocco, English teenager Gyllen (Fionn Whitehead) decides on a whim to steal his stepfather's camper van and drive it back to France, to meet up with his divorced father. Joining him on his joyride is William (Stéphane Bak), a Congolese 17-year-old sneaking through border security in search of his older brother among the refugees camping out in France. The pair's adventures involve larcenous German drug dealers, the transport of refugees, family schisms, and no small amount of self-discovery in this sensitive drama from Sebastian Schipper (Victoria). Screens April 25, 26, 27. No U.S. distributor announced.\n\nRun (World Premiere) – The spirit of a Bruce Springsteen song – a man trapped by circumstance in a provincial town, yearning for something bigger and better but not sure what – runs through Scott Graham's Scottish drama that would make a fitting companion piece to Roads, as it follows a father who steals his son's car and goes for a joyride, reliving the thrills of racing, and entertains the notion of making potentially startling life changes. With a coiled-spring performance by Mark Stanley, terrific camerawork, and a great sense of the claustrophobia of the northern Scottish town of Fraserburgh. Screens April 26, 27, 28, May 2. No U.S. distributor announced.\n\nScheme Birds (World Premiere) – Documentarians have the disadvantage of never knowing exactly what story may develop before their camera's lens, instead hoping that a person they've chosen to follow for months or years has a story in them worthy of examination. Directors Ellen Fiske and Ellinor Hallin have here chosen Gemma, a teenager in the town of Motherwell, Scotland, whose outlook is shaped by social media, and whose young yet eventful life would encompass family breakups, pregnancy, and violence in her housing project. Gemma is indeed a winning personality in a town whose very character has been shaken by economic distress, crime and personal tragedy. Screens April 26, 27, May 1, 3. No U.S. distributor announced.\n\nWoodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation (World Premiere) – The monumental three-day rock and folk concert at Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel, N.Y., was memorably documented in Michael Wadleigh's 1970 film. But while that classic was primarily focused on the stunning music performances, Barak Goodman's account pays more attention to the nuts and bolts of how the concert came to be, the people behind it and those who attended, and how the resources available that August 1969 weekend became overwhelmed when 400,000 people who needed food, water and medical attention showed up for an unprecedented roster of musical artists, and left having experienced a singular event in human history. Screens April 28, 30, May 1, 4. Opens theatrically May 24 from PBS/American Experience Films.\n\nAnd that still leaves more than 80 other films to explore.\n\nThe festival also marks the 40th anniversary of Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War drama Apocalypse Now by presenting the filmmaker's new 4K Ultra HD restoration and revision of his classic reimagining of Heart of Darkness; a 35th anniversary screening of Rob Reiner's hilarious mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap; a 30th anniversary screening of the rom-com Say Anything; and a 25th anniversary showing of the Gen X comedy Reality Bites.\n\nAnd what would May the 4th be without a big-screen presentation of the original Star Wars?\n\nIn addition, the Tribeca Virtual Arcade and Cinema360 venues offer immersive virtual reality programs, while Tribeca N.O.W. showcases online content.\n\nFilm screenings will be held at Regal Battery Park Stadium and Village East Cinema, as well as the School of Visual Arts Theatre and the BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Center.

Measuring Don Shula by wins and losses, no NFL coach had a better year. Or career.\n\nHe looked the part, thanks to a jutting jaw and glare that would intimidate 150-pound sports writers and 300-pound linemen alike. He led the Miami Dolphins to the only perfect season in NFL history, set a league record with 347 victories and coached in six Super Bowls.\n\nNear the end of his career, Shula's biography in the Dolphins' media guide began with a quote from former NFL coach Bum Phillips: Don Shula can take his'n and beat you'n, and he could take you'n and beat his'n.\n\nShula died Monday at his home across Biscayne Bay from downtown Miami, the team said. He was 90.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins are saddened to announce that Head Coach Don Shula passed away peacefully at his home this morning. pic.twitter.com/MKAtXFA4zd — Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) May 4, 2020\n\nIf there were a Mount Rushmore for the NFL, Don Shula certainly would be chiseled into the granite, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said in a statement.\n\nShula surpassed George Halas' league-record 324 victories in 1993 and retired following the 1995 season, his 33rd as an NFL head coach. He entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997, and the induction ceremony took place at Canton, Ohio, 70 miles from his native Grand River.\n\nMiami Dolphins coach Don Shula has his say to an official during a 1972 game. AP\n\nShula became the only coach to guide an NFL team through a perfect season when the Dolphins went 17-0 in 1972. They also won the Super Bowl the following season, finishing 15-2.\n\nThe 2007 Patriots flirted with matching the perfection of the '72 Dolphins but lost to the Giants in the Super Bowl and finished 18-1.\n\nLegendary Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, who has won 291 career games, would have to average 11 wins for another five years in order to catch Shula, who retired at age 65. On Monday, Belichick released a statement lauding Shula as the standard of consistency and leadership in the NFL.\n\nStatement from #Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick on the passing of Don Shula: https://t.co/Qx6SzsGbsw pic.twitter.com/KSARlkda4Y — New England Patriots (@Patriots) May 4, 2020\n\nWhen asked in 1997 if he was the greatest coach in NFL history, Shula said he didn't know how to measure that, but added, I always thought that's why they keep statistics and wins and losses.\n\nIn this Sunday, November 22, 2015 file photo, former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula receives his Hall of Fame ring during the halftime of an NFL football game against the Dallas Cowboys in Miami Gardens, Fla. AP\n\nShula reached the playoffs in four decades and coached three Hall of Fame quarterbacks: Johnny Unitas, Bob Griese and Dan Marino. During his 26 seasons in Miami he became an institution, and his name adorns an expressway, an athletic club and a steakhouse chain.\n\nBut because the Dolphins last reached the Super Bowl after the 1984 season, Shula came under increasing criticism from fans and the media. He was replaced in January 1996 by Jimmy Johnson, and Shula later said the adjustment to retirement was difficult.\n\nThere's such a letdown, he said in 2010. There's no way you can fill the time you spent as a coach. Life is great after football, but you don't have those emotional ups and downs you had on game day.\n\nShula's active retirement included plenty of travel and social events. In January 2010, the Dolphins threw him an 80th birthday party at their stadium, and guests included NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham and former NFL coaches Marty Schottenheimer and Dan Reeves.\n\nHall of Fame fullback Larry Csonka was among the '72 Dolphins who threw a surprise party for Shula in December to celebrate his 90th birthday.\n\nIt was the first time in the entire time I'm known him where he was genuinely surprised, Csonka said. I think he was very happy.\n\nShula always enjoyed talking about the 17-0 team, and he and his 1972 players drew criticism for the way they savored their unique status each season.\n\nPeople think we're a bunch of angry old guys who can't wait for that last undefeated team to get beat, Shula said in 2010. We're very proud of our record, and if somebody breaks it, I'm going to call that coach and congratulate them. Until they do, it's our record, and we're proud of it.\n\nAs for regrets, Shula put not winning a Super Bowl with Marino at the top of the list. They were together for 13 years, and Marino became the most prolific passer in NFL history, but he played on only one AFC championship team - in 1984, his second season.\n\nShula was born Jan. 4, 1930, and raised in Painesville, Ohio. He played running back at John Carroll University in Cleveland and cornerback in the pros for seven seasons with Cleveland, Baltimore and Washington. He entered coaching as an assistant at Virginia in 1958.\n\nBefore his 1970s triumphs with Miami, Shula had a reputation as a coach who thrived during the regular season but couldn't win the big game.\n\nShula became the youngest head coach in NFL history when the Baltimore Colts hired him in 1963 at age 33. The Colts finished 12-2 the following season and were widely seen as the league's dominant team.\n\nBut they lost 27-0 to Cleveland in the title game, and for the next few years continued to come up short.\n\nThe humiliation was greatest in the Super Bowl to end the 1968 season. The Colts steamrolled through the NFL, finishing 13-1 and outscoring opponents by a nearly 3-1 margin. After crushing the Browns 34-0 in the title game, they were overwhelming favorites to defeat the Jets of the upstart AFL, which had lost the first two Super Bowls.\n\nBut the Colts lost 16-7, blowing numerous scoring opportunities and allowing Jets quarterback Joe Namath to control the game.\n\nThe result is still regarded by many as the biggest upset in pro football history, and it contributed to Shula's departure after the 1969 season. In 1970, after the NFL-AFL merger, Shula joined the Dolphins, a fourth-year AFL expansion team that had gone 3-10-1 the previous year.\n\nMiami improved to 10-4 in his first season and made the playoffs for the first time, and the 1971 Dolphins reached the Super Bowl before losing to Dallas. The following season, when Miami took a 16-0 record into the Super Bowl against Washington, Shula considered his legacy on the line.\n\nIf we had won 16 games in a row and lost the Super Bowl, it would have been a disaster, especially for me, he said in a 2007 interview. That would have been my third Super Bowl loss. I was 0-2 in Super Bowls and people always seemed to bring that up: 'You can't win the big one.'\n\nThe Dolphins beat the Redskins 14-7, then repeated as champions the following year by beating Minnesota in the title game.\n\nAfter Shula retired, he traveled extensively with his wife, Mary Anne. He would also wrestle with his grandchildren, lose to his wife at gin, read John Grisham novels and fall asleep watching late-night TV.\n\nHe supported many charities. The Don Shula Foundation, formed primarily to assist breast cancer research, was established as a tribute to his late wife, Dorothy. They were married for 32 years and raised five children before she died in 1991. Shula married Mary Anne Stephens during a bye week in 1993.\n\nShula's oldest son, David, coached the Cincinnati Bengals from 1992-96. When Cincinnati played Miami in 1994, it marked the first time in professional sports that a father and son faced each other as head coaches.\n\nDon won, 23-7. Another son, Mike, is a longtime NFL assistant coach and was head coach at Alabama in 2003-06.\n\nShula spent more than 20 years on the powerful NFL Competition Committee, which evaluates playing rules as well as regulations designed to improve safety.\n\nIf I'm remembered for anything, I hope it's for playing within the rules, Shula once said. I also hope it will be said that my teams showed class and dignity in victory or defeat.\n\nThere were many more victories than defeats. His career record was 347-173-6.\n\nCBS Miami reports Shula leaves behind his wife, Mary Anne, and five children; Dave, Donna, Sharon, Anne and Mike. Shula's children were from an earlier marriage to his first wife, Dorothy, who died of breast cancer in 1991.
New documentary tells the story of first wife of country music star Johnny Cash Despite being thrown into the public eye for most of her marriage to a country music star, Johnny Cash's first wife was all but forgotten by Hollywood. But in a new documentary available for a limited time on Amazon, her daughters set the record straight. My Darling Vivian filmmakers Matt Riddlehoover and Dustin Tittle (the grandson of Johnny Cash) tell CBSN's Reena Ninan the untold story of Vivian Liberto.
After Beyoncé and Jay-Z sent fans into a frenzy last week when they momentarily listed a tour date for On the Run II, music's most powerful couple have now made it official: The two are going on a joint tour which kicks off this summer.\n\nBeyoncé posted images on Instagram that said OTR II. Her website has pre-sale information for tour dates in Europe and North America. North American tour dates go on sale on March 19, while European dates go on sale on March 19 or 23, depending on the city. Check Beyoncé's website for more information on the pre-sale.\n\nJay-Z and Beyoncé last embarked on a joint tour together in 2014 called On the Run, which promoted the albums Beyoncé and Magna Carta Holy Grail. On the Run made more than $100 million in ticket sales. Fans have been hoping for a new tour featuring Beyoncé's Lemonade and Jay-Z's 4:44, two intertwined albums about Jay-Z's infidelity in their marriage.\n\nIn 2014, Beyoncé called the joint tour the best of her life. She posted a photo of Jay-Z holding their daughter, Blue Ivy, alongside the caption: Thank you San Fran! Your city is beautiful. It was the perfect place to complete the best tour of my life! Thank you to all the fans that supported our show. God bless.

Singer Kelis is accusing her ex-husband Nas of mental and physical abuse. The singer said in a new interview that she has waited nine years to say anything as their custody battle over son Knight Jones gains more headlines.\n\nKelis told Hollywood Unlocked, It was really dark. There was a lot of drinking. There was a lot of mental and physical abuse. I probably would have stayed longer had I not been pregnant [with Knight] because I really did love him and because we were married. We weren't dating, we were married. Like, this was my person.\n\nThe singer said she and Nas had really intense highs and really intense lows; she said when money was coming in, the two had fun, but she also added that they were drinking and getting high a lot. She said the lows were dark.\n\nA lot of drinking, she said, describing the bad times. A lot of mental and physical abuse and it got to the point where if I wasn't pregnant, I might have stayed with him. Kelis said when she got pregnant she started thinking about leaving: I felt like I wasn't going to bring a child into this.\n\nThe singer admitted that she and Nas both hit each other, saying, Did he hit me? Mmhmm. Did I hit him back? Mmhmm.\n\nKelis said the last straw was when she saw photos of Rihanna after Chris Brown assaulted her.\n\nWhen the Rihanna and Chris Brown pictures came out I thought about coming out because I also had bruises all over my body, she said. But I didn't say anything because I'm private. But seeing her the way she looked and then looking at myself … I felt embarrassed.\n\nThe pictures of Rihanna emerged in February 2009; Kelis filed for divorce from Nas in April 2009, when she was seven months pregnant.
It happened this past week … word of the loss of Americans of remarkably diverse accomplishments.\n\nAstronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, and his wife, Annie. CBS News\n\nAnnie Glenn died from complications of the coronavirus.\n\nMarried in 1943 to the future astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn, she shared his early days in the spotlight, even as a chronic stutter left her mostly silent.\n\nBut, after undergoing speech therapy in the 1970s, Annie Glenn became an accomplished public speaker, and an advocate for people with speech disorders.\n\nJohn Glenn died in 2016 at age 95.\n\nAnnie Glenn was a full 100 years old.\n\nAnd we learned of the death of actor Ken Osmond from pulmonary and arterial diseases.\n\nKen Osmond as Eddie Haskell in the TV series Leave It to Beaver. CBS\n\nAn on-screen performer from age nine, Osmond won fame in the late 1950s and early '60s as the two-faced Eddie Haskell on Leave It to Beaver.\n\nHis performance of the slippery Haskell left Osmond professionally typecast – a death sentence, he told one interviewer.\n\nOsmond went on to join the Los Angeles Police Department, though he did occasionally reprise his Eddie Haskell role on Leave It to Beaver revivals.\n\nActor Ken Osmond was 76.\n\nPhyllis George. STEPHEN CHERNIN/AP\n\nShe was a trailblazer who transitioned from being named Miss America 1971 to becoming one of the first female network sportscasters. Phyllis George (who died May 14 at age 70) spent several seasons on CBS' The NFL Today between 1975 and 1983, winning praise for her interviews with star athletes like Joe Namath and Roger Staubach. The first female co-host of Candid Camera before moving to CBS Sports, George broadcast three Super Bowls and six Rose Parades. She also covered horse racing, hosted the entertainment show People, and co-anchored the CBS Morning News.\n\nAfter a brief marriage to film producer Robert Evans, George married John Y. Brown Jr. (the owner of the Boston Celtics), and served as first lady of Kentucky when Brown was elected governor in 1979. She also created a cosmetic and skincare product line, Phyllis George Beauty, and wrote a 2002 self-help book, Never Say Never: 10 Lessons to Turn You Can't into Yes I Can!\n\nShe told Texas Monthly in 2007 that she'd originally turned down entreaties by Miss Dallas organizers to enter the Miss Texas contest in 1970, after having entered and lost a competition the year before. I did it, and I won Miss Dallas. And you know what? Had I won the year before, I wouldn't have won Miss America. I just wasn't ready. I needed the loss. I needed to lose to win. Like they say, 'If you lose, don't lose the lessons,' and I learned a lot.\n\nComic actor Fred Willard.

He was best known for his scene-stealing appearances in the mock-documentaries This Is Spinal Tap, A Mighty Wind, Waiting for Guffman, For Your Consideration, Best In Show and Mascots, portraying genial cluelessness with zeal.\n\nA multiple Emmy-nominee (including for Everybody Loves Raymond and Modern Family), he won a Daytime Emmy Award for The Bold and the Beautiful. Among his more than 300 credits are TV appearances on Get Smart, The Bob Newhart Show, Fernwood Tonight, The History of White People in America, D.C.

He said he took the job because he admired director Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. But as Willard told Vulture in 2011, he was picked for the part of a real estate salesman seemingly out of the blue: One of the producers was talking to me and said, 'You know how we thought of you for this movie?' And I said no. And he said, 'You were in St. Martins one morning.' … It's a Catholic church. Now, my wife is Catholic, and I guess the producer is Catholic. He said, 'You were sitting in the congregation, and the sun came through the window and it shined down on you and we said, That's Fred Willard! We should use him in our movie.' And I said to my wife, 'My God, I should have been going to synagogues for years!'\n\nShoshana Davis, pictured with her husband, Adam, and their daughter, Sienna.

With the Oscars just five weeks away, here's Anthony Mason with The Envelope, Please ...:\n\nIn a half-century on screen, Charlotte Rampling has played opposite Paul Newman (in The Verdict), Robert Redford (Spy Game), and Woody Allen, who cast her as his ideal beauty in Stardust Memories.\n\nIn Paris, where Rampling has lived for most of her adult life, she's known as La Legende. A British actress at home in France, she's never courted Hollywood, preferring the parts to come to her:\n\nIt's like a strange form of pride maybe, she told Mason. I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm just an old-fashioned girl and I like to be asked to dance, you know? Somebody is going to ask me to dance, always.\n\nAnd you're still dancing.\n\nAnd I'm still dancing!\n\nThis year, in the film 45 Years, about a marriage suddenly destabilized as the couple approach a landmark anniversary, her nuanced performance as the wife has earned Rampling her first Academy Award nomination. That pleases me, she laughed.\n\nTom Courtney and Charlotte Rampling in 45 Years. IFC Films\n\nShe is one of 20 acting nominees this year, all white. The exclusion of black actors has prompted some to threaten an Oscar boycott. When Rampling called that racist to whites in comments on France's Radio 1 last week, the backlash was swift.\n\nI regret that my comments could have been misinterpreted, she said later in a statement to Sunday Morning. I simply meant to say that in an ideal world every performance will be given equal opportunities for consideration.\n\nRampling has courted controversy before, most notoriously in the 1974 film, The Night Porter, when she played a concentration camp survivor who, after the war, resumes a sado-masochistic relationship with the Nazi officer who abused her.\n\nAvco Embassy\n\nYou yourself have said 'Night Porter' was a 'dangerous' role, said Mason.\n\nYeah. I realized it could be very explosive. But then at the same time, it was extremely exciting to feel that you could touch that.\n\nAnd when you got the critical reaction you did?\n\nI was really blasted.\n\nMany critics were disgusted. Pauline Kael called it an insult to the people caught in the Holocaust. But the film became an art house hit.\n\nFor a long time, and perhaps maybe even still to this day, that's the image a lot of people still associate with you, said Mason. How do you feel about that?\n\nThat means it's a very strong image. If that's what identifies me, then that's fine by me.\n\nYou're proud of it?\n\nYeah, I am.\n\nIt led to higher-profile films in the '80s.

Alabama Republican Roy Moore, whose all-but-assured 2017 Senate victory in the deep red state was upended by allegations of sexual misconduct, said Friday that he is seriously considering another Senate run, AI.com reports. Democrat Doug Jones' Senate seat is up for grabs for 2020.\n\nI'm seriously considering it, Moore said on Focal Point radio show with Bryan Fischer on American Family Radio. I think the (2017 race) was stolen. I think that's been pronounced in the national newspapers – The New York Times, The Washington Post even has recognized there was a disinformation campaign going on in September of 2017 by forces outside of Alabama that spent a lot of money not regulated by the FEC in trying to dissuade Republicans from voting and encourage and enrage Democrats.\n\nA strange series of events led to Moore's loss for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he left to become President Trump's first attorney general. Moore is a towering and divisive figure in Alabama politics: Once the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Moore has been removed from the bench twice -- once for defying a federal judge's order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building. Then, after he was elected again, a judicial discipline panel permanently suspended Moore in 2016, ruling that he urged probate judges to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples in defiance of the federal courts.\n\nMoore faced off against Luther Strange, who was controversially appointed by a Republican governor who he was investigating, in the September primary, and Mr. Trump threw his support behind Strange. Despite video surfacing of Moore saying at a speech shortly before the primary that we have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting, Moore defeated Luther Strange.\n\nBut then a few weeks before the December special election, The Washington Post first reported -- and CBS News later confirmed -- four women accused Moore of pursuing them when they were teens and he was in his 30s.\n\nThe Republican party at first backed away from Moore but he remained defiant and denied the allegations. Eventually the RNC conceded and threw their support behind him. Mr. Trump even recorded a robocall and tweeted on the day of the election Vote Roy Moore!\n\nEven before the sexual misconduct allegations, the race had attracted national attention -- and outside money, especially from national Democrats. Although Democrats suffered a number of losses in special elections in 2017, the national party was energized after winning the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and civil rights icon U.S. Rep. John Lewis campaigned for Jones, and former President Obama even recorded a robocall.\n\nBuoyed by surprisingly strong turnouts among Democrats and African Americans, as well solid support from younger voters, moderates, and women, Jones eked out a close victory over Moore. Jones became the first Democrat elected to the seat in over a quarter century.\n\nBut one year after the election, The New York Times reported a group of Democratic tech experts decided to experiment during the election with using the tactics that Russians used to meddle in the 2016 presidential election. Jones has called for a federal investigation into the Times' findings.\n\nThe seat is up for re-election again in 2020, and GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne has already announced he will be seeking the nomination in what is expected to be a crowded field of Republicans.\n\nThe Republican primary is set for March 3, 2020.
NEW YORK -- A banker accused of helping Iran evade economic sanctions was convicted Wednesday in a case that strained ties between the United States and Turkey with its testimony about corruption at the highest levels of the NATO ally's government.\n\nMehmet Hakan Atilla, a 47-year-old deputy general manager at Turkey's state-run Halkbank, was charged by U.S. authorities with taking part in a complex scheme in which Iran traded its oil and gas for gold, with some of the proceeds moved through U.S. financial institutions without their knowledge.\n\nHe was convicted of four conspiracy counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States, plus one bank fraud count. He was acquitted of a money laundering charge.\n\nThe prosecution's star witness, Reza Zarrab, a Turkish-Iranian gold trader who admitted orchestrating the deals with Iran, testified that he paid over $50 million in bribes to Turkey's finance minister in 2012 to advance the scheme and that he believed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan knew about the plot.\n\nTurkey's leaders lashed out over the case throughout the trial, with Erdogan calling it an American conspiracy to blackmail and blemish his country. Turkey, a key strategic partner of the U.S. in the Mideast, has taken an increasingly authoritarian turn under Erdogan.\n\nIn the decades after the Iranian hostage crisis, in which 52 Americans were held captive from 1979 to 1981, the United States imposed increasingly stiffer sanctions prohibiting virtually all U.S. financial dealings with oil-rich Iran, including many bank transactions.\n\nAtilla's lawyer said his client was just a hapless and helpless pawn duped in a conspiracy hatched by his boss at Halkbank and Zarrab. Prosecutors, though, said phone recordings captured Atilla setting up bogus food and agricultural deals with Iran to disguise payments for oil sales.\n\nAtilla was arrested after visiting the U.S. last March on a business trip. Zarrab, a celebrity of sorts in Turkey because of his wealth and marriage to Turkish pop star and TV personality Ebru Gundes, was arrested in 2016 when he flew to Florida to take his wife and child to Disney World.\n\nBefore the trial, Turkey officials called Zarrab, 34, a hostage. Zarrab hired former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and ex-Attorney General Michael Mukasey to meet with Erdogan and U.S. officials and try to broker a diplomatic solution to the charges. When that effort failed, Zarrab agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nOn the witness stand, Zarrab said that in addition to the bribes he paid over the gold deals, he made even more payoffs to government officials after he was arrested in Turkey in a corruption case there in 2013.\n\nA former Turkish police official, Huseyin Korkmaz, testified that the corruption investigation he had built against Zarrab and others in the gold-for-oil case was promptly quashed. Korkmaz said he was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months, then had to flee Turkey, taking the evidence with him. Some of that material, which included documents and recorded phone calls, was introduced at Atilla's trial.\n\nTurkish officials have portrayed the original corruption investigation and the U.S. prosecution as a conspiracy hatched by followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania.\n\nErdogan has accused Gulen of being behind a botched 2016 coup attempt and has sought his extradition. Gulen has denied the allegations, and U.S. officials have rebuffed Turkey's extradition demands, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nAs the trial unfolded in New York, Turkey's official media said prosecutors there had demanded the seizure of Zarrab's assets as part of an investigation into claims he spied for a foreign country. Turkish authorities also issued detention warrants for Korkmaz's parents, wife and siblings.
I Need To Know was a big hit for Marc Anthony way back in 1999. All these years later, he's still thrilling audiences ... and speaking his mind. Most recently, he's been speaking to our Tracy Smith FOR THE RECORD:\n\nOff stage, he seems almost like the rest of us mortals -- more a compact bundle of nerves than an international superstar.\n\nBut when Marc Anthony stands in the spotlight and sings, the transformation happens: he becomes larger than life.\n\nEach song is like a short movie, he told Smith. And each character is different.\n\nThose hot and heart-melting characters have made Anthony the bestselling salsa artist in history.\n\nWith two Grammy Awards, five Latin Grammys, and so many other honors, you can't really fit them on just one wall. Referring to his collection, he said, I look at it and it's like a snapshot of why I'm so damn tired all the time!\n\nWhen he's performing, it feels like he's baring his soul. But in real-life, Anthony is intensely private, and almost always shields his eyes in trademark dark glasses.\n\nI'm from the streets of New York, he said. I have a tattoo in my handwriting that I say: Those who say, don't know. Those who know, don't say. Your power and influence is largely based on what a steel trap your mouth is.\n\nSteel trap or no, Anthony's private life has gotten plenty of attention.\n\nEspecially his marriage to, and split from, Jennifer Lopez, with whom he has two kids.\n\nTo watch Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony perform No Me Ames click on the player below.\n\nSmith said, I have to say that every time I tell somebody that I'm interviewing Marc Anthony, first thing is: 'Love him!' And second thing is: 'Are you going to ask him about J-Lo?' Does that drive you crazy?\n\nNo, he replied. I have a different perspective. I mean, we were married, what? Seven, eight years? She's the mother of my children. I'm proud of it. I'm proud to be in the same sentence as someone who's accomplished what she's accomplished and gave me a big part of her life. It's not a bad thing, right? Trust me, it could be worse!\n\nAnthony has since remarried, to Venezuelan model Shannon De Lima. And truth is, the tabloid stuff isn't nearly as interesting as what Anthony's been able to accomplish on his own.\n\nBorn in 1968 to Puerto Rican parents, Anthony grew up in New York's Spanish Harlem. His dad had hopes of being a musician, but paid the bills by working in a hospital lunchroom.\n\nAnthony's dreams early on were to get out of the neighborhood.\n\nHe figured out in order to change where he was, he needed to change WHO he was.\n\nWhat kind of kid was he? To my mom, I was a pain in the ass, he said. To my dad, the light of his eyes. And to me, I was awkward. My dad always told me, and as God's-honest truth: 'Son, we're ugly. Work on your personality.' Swear!\n\nIt was, Anthony claims, The best thing he ever told me. What happened was I'd stutter. And I really couldn't put a sentence together. But when I sang, I didn't stutter. [So] that was my preferred way of communicating.\n\nAs a teenager he sang in commercials, and offered to work for free as a backup singer for groups like Menudo. Before I had my first single I had worked on over 300 records, he said. I had all the experience in the world.\n\nThat first Spanish-language album took off in 1993, and since then he's had hits in both Spanish and English, selling more than 12 million records worldwide.\n\nHe has a line of clothing at Kohl's, and owns a piece of the Miami Dolphins. And thanks to his business sense, he gets frequent calls from other artists asking him for advice.\n\nI was always a phone call away, he said.\n\nSo you were kind of tutoring people? Smith asked.\n\nYeah, mentoring. And we're just beginning.\n\nSo in 2015 Anthony founded Magnus Media (my baby!) to help fellow musicians and athletes target the $1.5 trillion that Latinos spend each year. Magnus was born out of frustration, he said. I saw an absolute need for quality representation. I was doing it anyway, I was advising them on a daily basis as to how to streamline their business.\n\nThe Miami offices are decorated with Anthony's rather eclectic collections of badges, hats, and military uniforms. I'm sort of a history fanatic, he said. It's very easy to imagine, you know, who wore that [hat]. Somebody had to have earned it.\n\nI have to say it: You're a man of many hats, Smith quipped.\n\nOne hat he wears proudly: philanthropist. He has built three orphanages so far -- in the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Mexico -- and three more are under construction, through his foundation, Maestro Cares.\n\nIt all started with a visit he made to a not-so-wonderful orphanage several years ago. It was basically a three-bedroom house with 47 kids, I believe, he recalled. Babies sleeping under the beds, on the floor. What really hit me was just the lack of dignity.\n\nAs long as I have a voice, as long as I can do something, I'm gonna do it! he said.\n\nAnthony's determined to use his voice in other ways, too. At a recent concert in Madison Square Garden, he made a speech that started with being a proud Latino (I'm a Latino in the United States of America!), and ended with 'F*** Donald Trump.\n\nSmith asked, Why'd you feel like you needed to say something?\n\nI wasn't speaking for myself; I was speaking for my people, Anthony replied. There's so many 'dreamers' out there, and I represent them, being born American, but being identified as a Latino in my heart, my soul, upbringing, everything I am. You mess with a Latino, you're messing with me.\n\nStill, while Anthony is proud of the power he's earned, he says it came at a price.\n\nThe one regret would be that what I chose to do took so much of my time, he said. What I would've done to have been a stay-at-home dad and just, you know, witnessed every second of everything.\n\nYou sort of start to wonder, was it all worth it?\n\nHow do you answer that?\n\nI don't think you do, he said.\n\nOr maybe the answer's in Marc Anthony's music -- and all it's allowed him to become.\n\nI have nothing to complain about. As long as your energy goes towards making something better, it's worth the sacrifice.\n\n\n\nFor more info:
Conversion therapy is currently still legal in Indiana, the home state of Vice President Mike Pence, who has long been criticized for his anti-LGBTQ positions. But this week, state legislators formally introduced a bill to ban the discredited therapy for minors.\n\nDemocratic State Senator J.D. Ford has authored Senate Bill 32, which would prohibit mental health counselors from trying to alter the sexual orientation or gender identity of people under the age of 18 in Indiana. Rep. Sue Errington has introduced a companion bill, House Bill 1213.\n\nThe measures say that providers who violate the ban would be subject to disciplinary action.\n\nConversion therapy is an archaic and unscientific practice that inflicts incredible harm, Ford, the first openly LGBTQ legislator in Indiana, tweeted Tuesday. My bill, SB 32, ensures the protection of Indiana's LGBTQ community from such cruelty and can save the lives of countless Hoosiers.\n\nConversion therapy is a discredited practice that aims to convert a person's sexual orientation, currently banned in at least 20 states. The American Psychiatric Association determined that homosexuality is not an illness that can be cured over 45 years ago, but an estimated 700,000 adults in the U.S. have received some kind of conversion therapy, according to GLAAD.\n\nThere is no financial risk to our state government for approving this legislation, so why not do this?, Ford said in a statement. I'm counting on all Hoosiers to help me get this across the finish line. Call your state senators. Call your state representatives. Call our governor. Tell them that Indiana doesn't support hate in our state.\n\nWe cannot expect our students to feel comfortable in learning about or accepting their sexuality in a state that allows this discredited, harmful practice to continue, Rep. Errington said in a statement Tuesday. I know Hoosiers in my district who have personally experienced conversion therapy and are seriously concerned about its use on young people today. I believe banning conversion therapy in Indiana is an essential step in protecting and supporting all Hoosiers.\n\nPence, a conservative Christian from Columbus, Indiana, has a long history of supporting anti-LGBTQ measures.\n\nOver the course of his career, Pence has opposed expanding the definition of hate crimes, supported defining marriage as being between a man and a woman and opposed the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. He has famously been accused of supporting conversion therapy, despite publicly denying it.\n\nWhile governor, Pence signed Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law that allowed people to cite religious reasons for refusing to serve gay people. After widespread protests and boycotts, the state passed an amendment intended to bar such discrimination.\n\nWith Pence as vice president, the Trump Administration has worked to remove federal protections against health care discrimination for transgender patients, allow adoption and foster organizations to deny services to LGBTQ couples, ban Pride flags from U.S. embassies and bar transgender troops from serving in the nation's military openly, among other things.
WASHINGTON - Americans with no more than a high school diploma have fallen so far behind college graduates in their economic lives that the earnings gap between college grads and everyone else has reached its widest point on record.\n\nThe growing disparity has become a source of frustration for millions of Americans worried that they-- and their children -- are losing economic ground.\n\nCollege graduates, on average, earned 56 percent more than high school grads in 2015, according to data compiled by the Economic Policy Institute. That was up from 51 percent in 1999 and is the largest such gap in EPI's figures dating to 1973.\n\nSince the Great Recession ended in 2009, college-educated workers have captured most of the new jobs and enjoyed pay gains. Non-college grads, by contrast, have faced dwindling job opportunities and an overall 3 percent decline in income, EPI's data shows.\n\nThe post-Great Recession economy has divided the country along a fault line demarcated by college education, Anthony Carnevale, director of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce, said in a report last year.\n\nCollege grads have long enjoyed economic advantages over Americans with less education. But as the disparity widens, it is doing so in ways that go beyond income, from homeownership to marriage to retirement. Education has become a dividing line that affects how Americans vote, the likelihood that they will own a home and their geographic mobility.\n\nThe dominance of college graduates in the economy is, if anything, accelerating. Last year, for the first time, a larger proportion of workers were college grads (36 percent) than high school-only grads (34 percent), Carnevale's research found. The number of employed college grads has risen 21 percent since the recession began in December 2007, while the number of employed people with only a high school degree has dropped nearly 8 percent.\n\nBehind the trend is a greater demand for educated workers, and the retirement of older Americans, who are more likely to be high school-only graduates.\n\nThe split is especially stark among white men. For middle-age white men with only high school degrees -- the core of President-elect Donald Trump's support -- inflation-adjusted income fell 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, an analytics firm. By contrast, income for white men in the same age bracket who are college graduates jumped 23 percent.\n\nLong after the recession ended, many young college graduates struggled to find well-paying jobs in a slowly recovering economy, and stories about graduates working as coffee shop baristas abounded. But data collected by the New York Federal Reserve suggests that trend has faded as the economy has improved.\n\nYet few experts think the solution is simply to send more students to four-year colleges. Many young people either don't want to spend more years in school or aren't prepared to do so. Already, four in every 10 college students drop out before graduating -- often with debt loads they will struggle to repay without a degree.\n\nRather, labor economists say, many high school grads would benefit from a more comprehensive approach to obtaining skills, especially involving technology, that are increasingly in demand.\n\nIf the only path you offer them is a traditional college path, they're not going to be successful, said Harry Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University.\n\nHelping lift high school graduates' skill levels is critical, given the many ways they're lagging behind their college-educated peers:\n\nThey're less likely to have a job. Just two-thirds of high school-only grads ages 25 through 64 were employed in 2015, down sharply from 73 percent in 2007. For college graduates in the same age group, employment dipped only slightly from 84 percent to 83 percent.\n\n\n\nThey're less likely to be married. In 2008, marriage rates for college-educated 30-year olds surpassed those of high-school-only grads for the first time. And women with college diplomas enjoy an 8-in-10 chance of their first marriage lasting 20 years, according to the Center for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics. That's double the odds for women with just high school degrees.\n\n\n\nHigh school-only grads are less likely to own homes. Sixty-four percent are current homeowners, down from 70 percent in 2000. By contrast, three-quarters of bachelor's degree holders are homeowners, down slightly from 77 percent in 2000, according to real estate data firm Zillow.\n\n\n\nA college-educated worker is now more likely to belong to a labor union than a high-school-only worker is, according to Pew Research Center. Unions have played a key role in raising pay for members. Yet just 6 percent of workers with only a high school degree now belong to one. Public employee unions, which often represent teachers and others with college educations, have generally maintained staying power while large industrial unions have deteriorated.\n\n\n\nCollege grads are more likely than high school-only graduates to contribute to a 401(k)-style retirement plan, according to research by Christopher Tamborini of the Social Security Administration and Changhwan Kim, a sociology professor at the University of Kansas. College grads contributed 26 percent more even when members of both groups had similar incomes and access to such plans, their research found. Participation in 401(k)-style plans requires decisions -- whether and how much to contribute and how to invest -- that can become barriers for the less educated. That contrasts with traditional pensions, which automatically enrolled everyone eligible and provided defined benefits. But traditional pensions have been rapidly phased out.\n\nCollege graduates are more likely to move to find work than high school-only workers are, said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Companies tend to recruit more broadly for high-skilled jobs than for low-skilled work. College graduates are essentially in a nationwide labor market, Moretti said.\n\n\n\nAll of this contributed to a sharp political split in the presidential election. College graduates favored Hillary Clinton by 9 percentage points. Non-college grads chose Donald Trump by 8 points, according to exit polls. That was the largest disparity between the two groups on record since 1980, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nThese are some of the largest shifts in recent years, said Jocelyn Kiley, an associate director at Pew.\n\nThe gap is most pronounced among whites: Nearly two-thirds of white non-college grads voted for Trump, compared with just 45 percent of whites with college degrees.\n\nSome of these trends might eventually reverse themselves if more high school grads acquire the skills needed for higher-paying work. Though many middle-income jobs don't require college, nearly all require some post-high school education or training.\n\nWhat Holzer calls the new middle includes such health care jobs as X-ray technicians and phlebotomists, as well as computer-controlled manufacturing and some office occupations, like paralegals.\n\nA typical X-ray technician, for example, earns nearly $60,000 a year and needs only a two-year degree, according to government data.\n\nAnd these new middle positions are typically the same jobs for which employers have complained they can't find enough qualified people to fill. Labor experts say the U.S. educational system is failing to help young people acquire such skills.\n\nIf they know where to look, high school graduates can choose from among numerous options for vocational skills training -- from two-year programs to online courses to for-profit schools. Yet many aren't likely to get much help from high school guidance counselors.\n\nJoseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School, said counselors increasingly focus on things like substance abuse, discipline and standardized testing, rather than on career advice.\n\nNor do U.S. high schools funnel students into the kind of on-the-job apprenticeships that exist in some countries. Instead, Fuller said, U.S. apprentices are typically older workers upgrading their skills in areas like construction. The average age of an apprentice in Germany is 17, he noted; in the U.S., it's 27.\n\nWe have a very limited vision of how to get people from their graduation in high school onto a path that's going to lead them to have a successful, independent life, Fuller said.\n\nAsia Howard, 26, of Jacksonville, Florida, is navigating that path right now. She was stuck in mostly retail and fast-food jobs after graduating high school, unable to get a job in banking, a profession she prized for its steady hours. A friend told her about a nonprofit called Year Up, which teaches such career skills as resume writing, interview techniques and time management.\n\nYear Up participants also typically receive internships, which Howard spent at Everbank (EVER). She also took classes to upgrade her computer skills. Early last year, she began a job in mortgage lending at PNC Financial (PNC) that pays nearly twice what she earned in previous jobs. She saw many people lose homes during the financial crisis. Now, she helps people buy them.\n\nIt gives me a chance to see what that side of life is like, Howard said. And unlike in her previous jobs, I can see a lot of room to grow. She is also studying for an associate's degree in business administration at Florida State College at Jacksonville.\n\nThe driving force for many of these changes was the recession, which reshaped the job market in ways that left far fewer opportunities for workers like Howard. Many routine jobs were replaced by computers or robots or were outsourced overseas.\n\nThere are nearly 1.5 million fewer office administrative and clerical jobs now than there were before the recession, according to an analysis by Georgetown's Center on Education and the Workforce. That narrowed a long-time path to the middle class for high school graduates, particularly women.\n\nManufacturing employment is also 1.5 million lower than when the recession began in 2007. The construction industry had offered a lifeline to many high school-educated workers, particularly men, during the housing boom in the 2000s. Yet construction now employs 840,000 fewer people than it did nine years ago.\n\nSince the recession, the fastest-growing industry for high school-only grads has been a mostly low-paying sector that includes restaurants, hotels and amusement parks, according to Georgetown's analysis.\n\nThose are the types of jobs that Crystal Thompson, 35, of Seattle, has held since she finished high school. She has worked at Domino's Pizza (DPZ) for seven years.\n\nThe only jobs that are out there are pretty much minimum wage jobs -- coffee shops, restaurants, things like that, she said. I'm pretty much stuck in fast food for now.\n\nThompson's raises have come from minimum wage increases. She went on strike twice during Seattle's recent Fight for $15 campaign, which led the City Council to approve a citywide $15 minimum wage.\n\nThompson, who has three children, wants to return to school to become a translator. She's mostly fluent in Spanish. Yet she has found it hard to do so in part because her work schedule can fluctuate and is typically distributed just a day in advance.\n\nThe closest community college lacks the classes in medical and legal translation she needs. Those classes are offered at another community college a half hour away, so she needs to buy a car to attend them.\n\nIt's definitely one of my goals, to get some kind of career going, she said. I want to be a productive member of society.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A woman who was 11 when she was forced to marry her rapist has worked for six years to ban child marriages in Florida. On Friday, she was hailed as a hero after the Legislature passed a bill prohibiting marriage for anyone under 17.\n\nState lawmakers have repeatedly cited Sherry Johnson as an inspiration to change the law. She watched in the House gallery as the bill passed the House on a 109-1 vote, then stood as representatives turned to face her and applauded.\n\nMy heart is happy, she said afterward. My goal was to protect our children and I feel like my mission has been accomplished. This is not about me. I survived.\n\nThe bill was a compromise between the House and Senate. The Senate originally passed a bill that banned the marriage of anyone under 18, but the House had wanted to carve out exceptions for some 16- and 17-year-olds when there's a pregnancy.\n\nThe bill going to Republican Gov. Rick Scott would set limits on the marriage of 17-year-olds. While pregnancy won't be a factor, anyone marrying a 17-year-old couldn't be more than two years older and minors would need parental consent. Scott's office said he will sign the bill.\n\nCurrently, 16- and 17-year-olds can marry with the consent of both sets of parents. If a pregnancy is involved, there's no minimum age for marriage if a judge approves. A legislative staff analysis showed that between 2012 and 2016, 1,828 marriage licenses were issued in Florida to couples when at least one party was a minor. That includes a 13-year-old, seven 14-year-olds and 29 15-year-olds.\n\nIn one case, a 14-year-old married a 15-year-old and in another, a man over the age of 90 was able to marry a girl who was 16 or 17 years old. In some cases, girls were allowed to marry men more than twice their age.\n\nSupporters say changing the law will make sure no child is forced to marry a man who raped her, even if she becomes pregnant. Still, Republican Rep. George Moraitis voted against the bill. While he didn't say anything during floor debate Friday, he did say last month when he opposed the bill in committee that the current law is very good, in my opinion, a very carefully crafted balance.\n\nThere's literally only a handful of cases that would fall under what I would say are potentially abusive, said Moraitis, who also is chairman of the Broward County Republican Party. To focus on a 10-year-old or an 11-year-old or something like that when we're talking about the hundreds and hundreds of people that could get married. I'm particularly focused on the pregnancy aspect of it. I don't want the message to be that it's better to not get married.\n\nAfter the vote, Republican bill sponsors Rep. Jeanette Nunez and Sen. Lizbeth Benacquisto emerged from their chambers' floors and greeted Johnson with long, emotional hugs in the rotunda between the chambers.\n\nShe's the star, Benacquisto said to reporters before rushing back to the Senate floor.\n\nJohnson was 9 when she was raped by a church deacon, 10 when she gave birth and 11 when she married the man. Johnson said her church pressured her mother to consent to the marriage and a judge approved it. That was 47 years ago.\n\nI feel the whole system failed me, Johnson told CBS News last month. It wasn't just one person. It wasn't just one source.\n\nShe ended up giving birth to five more children with the man before breaking free from the marriage several years later. She wasn't able to attend school and her experience led to a string of abusive relationships.\n\nWhile the soon-to-be law wouldn't have prevented Johnson's rape or pregnancy, she wouldn't have been forced to marry, and she said that could have prevented her from years of abuse.\n\nIt would have changed my life by not allowing me to get married, to continue to have children, to continue to have my downfall, she said. I would have been a single mother and I think would have done well.
It's pretty clear singer-songwriter Melissa Etheridge is not an Angelina Jolie fan -- not at all.\n\nEtheridge spoke out and had some pretty harsh words for Jolie in an interview on Monday. She spoke with Andy Cohen on his SiriusXM show and defended her friend, Brad Pitt, while they discussed his divorce from Jolie.\n\nCompletely unfounded. Really heartbreaking to see that, Etheridge said of the child abuse accusations lobbed against Pitt. Etheridge and Cohen believe Jolie has provided TMZ with information about the divorce.\n\nThe singer said of Jolie's alleged PR strategy, It breaks my heart that anyone would take something as personal as your marriage and your relationship and your rights to your children and do it as purposefully as I see it's being done.\n\nShe also said that while she and Pitt used to be friends, she hasn't spoken to him since he got together with Jolie.\n\nEtheridge added that she has had distaste for Jolie since she dated Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nI was around when Angelina was not doing nice things with Billy Bob to Laura Dern. I went through that on a personal level, and then to know the side of Jennifer and Brad ...  she said. I helped Laura move out of her house with Billy Bob — I like broke into their home to get their stuff out because it was so nasty.
LONDON — Prince Harry was already there, and now bride-to-be Meghan Markle is by his side. Madame Tussauds London just unveiled a waxwork of Markle as it prepares for events marking the May 19 royal wedding.\n\nThe likeness of the American actress sports the emerald green P.A.R.O.S.H. dress she wore for the couple's engagement announcement. The waxwork will be displayed beside one of Prince Harry, which has been updated to add a beard.\n\nThe waxworks will first go on display to the public on the day before the wedding, May 18. The attraction said it will offer free entry to guests named Meghan or Harry on the day of the royal wedding — but only for one day.\n\nBritain's Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle on display as wax figures at Madame Tussauds in London, May 9, 2018. Frank Augstein/AP\n\nMadame Tussauds London's sister attraction in New York also plans to unveil its own Meghan Markle figure on Wednesday.\n\nAt the actual royal wedding, Markle's friend Serena Williams and the Beckhams are expected to be in attendance. The couple have also invited members of the public to be a part of their big day; around 2,600 lucky people will be allowed on the grounds of Windsor Castle.\n\nMany of the details for the wedding are already known to the public: Prince William will serve as best man, Alexi Lubomirski will photograph the wedding, and Claire Ptak will create a cake with lemon, elderflower and fresh flower decorations. But the world will have to tune in to see Markle's wedding dress and other surprises.\n\nCBS News will have full coverage of the royal wedding on May 19, starting at 4 a.m. ET, anchored by Gayle King and Entertainment Tonight's Kevin Frazier. CBS News will also present Royal Romance: The Marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, a two-hour special to air May 19 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.
Joss Whedon's ex-wife wrote a tell-all essay for TheWrap, in which she called her former husband a hypocrite who masquerades as a feminist. Kai Cole, who was married to Whedon for 16 years, slammed her ex and said he had multiple affairs over the course of their marriage.\n\nCole said that though she considers herself a private person, she felt the need to speak out because she believes Whedon misrepresents himself as a feminist. Cole said Whedon admitted his affairs to her, which started when he was working on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but never came to terms with the hypocrisy of cheating on her while espousing feminist ideals.\n\nDespite understanding, on some level, that what he was doing was wrong, he never conceded the hypocrisy of being out in the world preaching feminist ideals, while at the same time, taking away my right to make choices for my life and my body based on the truth, she said. He deceived me for 15 years, so he could have everything he wanted. I believed, everyone believed, that he was one of the good guys, committed to fighting for women's rights, committed to our marriage, and to the women he worked with.\n\nCole accused Whedon of using their marriage to further his reputation.\n\nShe wrote, I now see how he used his relationship with me as a shield, both during and after our marriage, so no one would question his relationships with other women or scrutinize his writing as anything other than feminist.\n\nCole also said that Whedon wanted it all: to be married to her and to have affairs. She said he excused his behavior by pointing out it was symptomatic of a culture of masculinity. Cole wrote that Whedon said, In many ways I was the HEIGHT of normal, in this culture. We're taught to be providers and companions and at the same time, to conquer and acquire — specifically sexually — and I was pulling off both!\n\nCole said her self-esteem suffered as a result of Whedon's behavior and that now, after her divorce, she is slowly building it up again.\n\nA representative for Whedon responded to the essay, saying: While this account includes inaccuracies and misrepresentations which can be harmful to their family, Joss is not commenting, out of concern for his children and out of respect for his ex-wife.
WASHINGTON—Thousands of requests by men to bring in child and adolescent brides to live in the United States were approved over the past decade, according to government data obtained by The Associated Press. In one case, a 49-year-old man applied for admission for a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThe approvals are legal: The Immigration and Nationality Act does not set minimum age requirements. And in weighing petitions for spouses or fiancees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services goes by whether the marriage is legal in the home country and then whether the marriage would be legal in the state where the petitioner lives.\n\nBut the data raises questions about whether the immigration system may be enabling forced marriage and about how U.S. laws may be compounding the problem despite efforts to limit child and forced marriage. Marriage between adults and minors is not uncommon in the United States, and most states allow children to marry with some restrictions.\n\nThere were more than 5,000 cases of adults petitioning on behalf of minors and nearly 3,000 examples of minors seeking to bring in older spouses or fiances, according to the data requested by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in 2017 and compiled into a report.\n\nSome victims of forced marriage say the lure of a U.S. passport combined with lax U.S. marriage laws are partly fueling the petitions.\n\nMy passport ruined my life, said Naila Amin, a dual citizen from Pakistan who grew up in New York City.\n\nShe was forcibly married at 13 in Pakistan and applied for papers for her 26-year-old husband to come to the country.\n\nPeople die to come to America, she said. I was a passport to him. They all wanted him here, and that was the way to do it.\n\nAmin, now 29, said she was betrothed to her first cousin Tariq when she was just 8 and he was 21. The petition was eventually terminated after she ran away. She said the ordeal cost her a childhood. She was in and out of foster care and group homes, and it took a while to get her life on track.\n\nI was a child. I want to know: Why weren't any red flags raised? Whoever was processing this application, they don't look at it? They don't think? Amin asked.\n\nThere is a two-step process for obtaining U.S. immigration visas and green cards. Petitions are first considered by USCIS. If granted, they must be approved by the State Department. Overall, there were 3.5 million petitions received from budget years 2007 through 2017.\n\nOver that period, there were 5,556 approvals for those seeking to bring minor spouses or fiancees, and 2,926 approvals by minors seeking to bring in older spouses, according to the data. Additionally, there were 204 for minors by minors. Petitions can be filed by U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\n\nIt indicates a problem. It indicates a loophole that we need to close, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told the AP.\n\nIn nearly all the cases, the girls were the younger person in the relationship. In 149 instances, the adult was older than 40, and in 28 cases the adult was over 50, the committee found. Among the examples: In 2011, immigration officials approved a 14-year-old's petition for a 48-year-old spouse in Jamaica. A petition from a 71-year-old man was approved in 2013 for his 17-year-old wife in Guatemala.\n\nThere are no nationwide statistics on child marriage, but data from a few states suggests it is far from rare. State laws generally set 18 as the minimum age for marriage, yet every state allows exceptions. Most states let 16- and 17-year-olds marry if they have parental consent, and several states — including New York, Virginia and Maryland — allow children under 16 to marry with court permission.\n\nFraidy Reiss, who campaigns against coerced marriage as head of a group called Unchained at Last, researched data from her home state of New Jersey. She determined that nearly 4,000 minors, mostly girls, were married in the state from 1995 to 2012, including 178 who were under 15.\n\nThis is a problem both domestically and in terms of immigration, she said.\n\nReiss — who says she was forced into an abusive marriage by her Orthodox Jewish family when she was 19 — said that often cases of child marriage via parental consent involve coercion, with a girl forced to marry against her will.\n\nThey are subjected to a lifetime of domestic servitude and rape, she said. And the government is not only complicit; they're stamping this and saying: Go ahead.\n\nThe data was requested in 2017 by Johnson and then-Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the committee's top Democrat. Johnson said it took a year to get the information, showing there needs to be a better system to track and vet the petitions.\n\nOur immigration system may unintentionally shield the abuse of women and children, the senators said in the letter.\n\nU.S. immigration officials approved thousands of requests for visas for child brides Data obtained by the Associated Press from the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\nUSCIS didn't know how many of the approvals were granted by the State Department, but overall only about 2.6 percent of spousal or fiancee claims are rejected.\n\nSeparately, the data show some 4,749 minor spouses or fiancees received green cards to live in the U.S. over that same 10-year period.\n\nThe head of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna, said in a letter to the committee that their request had raised questions and discussion within the agency on what it can do to prevent forced minor marriages. The agency noticed some issues in how the data was collected and has resolved them. Officials also created a flagging system that requires verification of the birthdate whenever a minor is detected.\n\nThe country where most requests came from was Mexico, followed by Pakistan, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and Yemen. Middle Eastern nationals had the highest percentage of overall approved petitions.
Sunday's most-watched scripted series on broadcast television, the CBS hit drama, Madam Secretary, is now in its second season.\n\nTim Daly CBS News\n\nTim Daly stars as Henry McCord, a professor and husband of the secretary of state, played by Téa Leoni.\n\nThe actor joined CBS This Morning Friday and discussed the show's uniqueness and appeal to American viewers.\n\nIt portrays a marriage that's actually working and it's dynamic, but this couple's committed to figuring out how to do it and they have problems that I think make it very relatable for people, Daly said. You know, like kids who are in trouble in various ways and moving and all this busy life and their job, so I think there's something there for everybody, including political junkies.\n\nDaly's character is prized as the ideal father and husband figure, which Daly said broke the long tradition of the portrayal of men in American television.\n\nA lot of men come up to me and say, 'Thank God you play someone competent, thank God you're someone who can be left with the children in the house and the whole thing doesn't burn down,' Daly said.\n\nThe political drama also touches on many real-life current events and issues -- with episodes centered on ISIS, nude photo leaks, tensions with Russia and the Cuban trade embargo -- which Daly said were not always drawn from the papers.\n\nIt seems like we do a story and we read about it in the newspaper, so we don't exactly rip it from the newspaper -- we rip it from the future, Daly said, joking that the show's writer, Barbara Hall, has a crystal ball.\n\nJust like his role as a family man in the hit series, Daly also shares a close bond with his children off screen. He has his own show on YouTube called The Daly Show with his son Sam, who is also an actor.\n\nIt's sort of an alternative universe version of our own relationship and it's pure and utter silliness and really a lot of fun, Daly said.\n\nDaly's son has also made an appearance in Madam Secretary, playing a comical lobbyist for the marijuana industry. Daly also revealed his daughter, Emelyn, has done some acting for the show, which has yet to make it on the show.\n\nOn his son and daughter's decision to follow his career footsteps, he admitted that he was not fond of the idea at first. But he said it was flattering.\n\nI want them to pursue something that makes them happy and you know most people don't quite realize the kind of personality that it takes to withstand a career in this business, Daly said. People say, 'Should I do this?' and I saw, 'Hey, if you have to ask a question, then no. If you have to do it, then do it. If you don't have to, then try something else.'\n\nOff the screen, Daly is also friends with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, with whom he attended the White House correspondent's dinner, along with co-star Téa Leoni and former Face the Nation anchor Bob Schieffer. The former secretary of state has also made an appearance on the series.\n\nWe had such a funny time because Madeleine is diminutive and an amazing woman, but we got to this barricade, and Madeleine suddenly turned into the incredible hulk, Daly said. She's like, 'I'm not going to go and stand in line with all those cars, we are going in here.'\n\nWatch Madam Secretary at 8 p.m. EDT Sunday on CBS.
Update:Rep. Jim Jordan told CBS News, Kim Davis used our ticket. Our staff heard from the Family Research Council that Ms. Davis and her family hoped to attend the State of the Union address and so we offered a ticket.\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who spent five days in jail for defying federal court ordersand refusing to license same-sex marriages, was given tickets to the president's final State of the Union, an invite-only event for members of Congress.\n\nBut who invited her and her attorney remains a mystery.\n\nEvery lawmaker gets one guest ticket to President Barack Obama's annual speech, though congressional leaders get extras.\n\nDavis' lawyer, Mat Staver, declined to identify the members of Congress who extended the invitations, saying only that it was not a lawmaker from her home state. He said he didn't want the identity of the person who extended the invitation to eclipse Kim Davis and what she stands for.\n\nFirst lady Michelle Obama, on the other hand, invited Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case in which the United States Supreme Court effectively legalized gay marriage across the nation. He will sit in the box with the first lady and Jill Biden, the vice president's wife.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's decision, Davis, the clerk of Rowan County, cited God's authority and refused to issue marriage licenses, despite a series of federal court orders.\n\nShe quickly became a darling of the religious right. Politicians, including presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee, flocked to a rally on the jailhouse lawn during her brief stint behind bars.\n\nStill, no one has claimed to have extended the invitation\n\nThe Family Research Council, a conservative organization that opposes gay marriage, arranged the invitation, said spokesman J.P. Duffy. That group also declined to identify the lawmakers who gave them passes.\n\nStaver said they would be sitting in the House chamber to stand for religious freedom and to represent Judeo-Christian values.\n\nI think when it became more clear that President Obama was going to tick off his so-called accomplishments in the last seven years, the decision was made to invite Kim Davis to be a visible reminder that his policies have not encompassed all of American citizens and, particularly, Kim Davis with respect to religious freedom and marriage, Staver told The Associated Press. So she's there as a visible reminder of that, his policies have actually hurt religious freedom and marriage and to encourage people to stand for these values.\n\nAs CBS News' Stephanie Condon reports, the annual address, typically delivered before a joint session of Congress, usually gives the president an opportunity to encourage Congress and the American public to embrace his policy agenda. However, for a president at the end of his second term, the State of the Union gives him a chance to define his legacy in his own terms and make the case that the next president should build on that legacy.\n\nPresident Obama intends to do that by arguing that he has left the United States poised for a bright future.\n\nThere is no country in the world that is better positioned to capitalize on the kind of opportunities we see, whether it relates to our national security or it relates to our economy than the United States of America, White House spokesman Josh Earnest explained Monday.\n\nThat ultimately is the essence of the message the president wants to deliver, precisely because the next president needs to understand that, and the American people need to understand that, he continued. They need to have an accurate assessment of what our challenges are, what the risks are out there. But also to have an adequate understanding of what opportunities are available so that we do not miss them and we are at a critical juncture in our history that we've spent seven years digging out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nWhile Mr. Obama will urge the nation to seize the opportunities his administration has created, he won't dwell on making the final victory lap that's expected of an outgoing president, Earnest insisted.\n\nIf the president wanted to give a speech about what the president has been able to do over the last seven years, we'd have plenty to talk about, the White House official said. But the president is still writing a speech that is not about him. It is about the American people and about the future of our country and about how our kids and their kids are going to fare.
NEW YORK -- Channing Tatum and wife Jenna Dewan Tatum say they've decided to lovingly separate as a couple after nearly nine years of marriage. They broke the news in a joint Twitter post Monday night, saying there are no secrets nor salacious events behind the split. They say they're best friends who have decided their relationship has run its course.\n\nThey make clear in the tweet that they want to avoid alternative facts about their decision getting into the public domain:\n\nThe two met on the set of the 2006 dance movie Step Up and married in 2009. They have a 4-year-old daughter together.\n\nTatum has starred in box office hits like Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street.
Although Amber Heard filed for divorce from Johnny Depp on Monday after a year of marriage, sources tell ET their relationship actually started souring almost immediately after their February 2015 wedding in the Bahamas.\n\nHeard, 30, and Depp, 52, fought all the time, a source tells ET, and one alleged big issue between the two of them, according to the source, was the actress' former close circle of friends. Heard has always been open about her bisexuality -- coming out publicly at a GLAAD event in 2010 -- and previously dated photographer Tasya van Ree. According to the source, Depp was uncomfortable with Heard hanging out with her old group -- including van Ree -- and as a result she distanced herself from her friends.\n\nTheir 22-year age difference apparently didn't help things either. Heard and Depp met while filming 2011's The Rum Diary but didn't come out as a couple until 2012 -- after he had split from his girlfriend of 14 years, model Vanessa Paradis.\n\nShe is really young and affected by the industry and scene at times, the source says. She is a cool girl, but Johnny is cooler and doesn't tolerate that.\n\nThe couple initially hit a rough patch in May 2015, according to the source, but they decided to give the relationship another shot, at least for a year.\n\nShe can change her mind within minutes, another source tells ET. One minute they are off and the next she decides she wants to stay. The marriage has been on the rocks since it started.\n\nHeard and Depp appeared unhappy together as far back as last September, when they attended the actress' The Danish Girl premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and got into an argument on the way home, the same source tells ET.\n\nHowever, Heard denied reports of marital problems between the two last November.\n\nI try not to react to the horrible misrepresentation of our lives, but it is strange, and hard, she told Marie Claire.\n\nStill, the exes' split is apparently no surprise to the former couple's friends.\n\nThey have been having problems for quite some time, one source tells ET. It started a few months after they got married and it just never got better. It was extremely volatile.\n\nThe two kept their finances separate during their marriage, the source also notes. However, Heard is now asking for spousal support from Depp.\n\nHeard and Depp never signed a prenuptial agreement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Depp filed a response to his ex's divorce filing, asking the court to terminate the court's ability to award support to Heard, according to court docs obtained by ET. Depp also wants the 30-year-old Magic Mike XXL actress to pay her own attorney fees -- when she filed, Heard asked that Depp pay her costs as well as his.\n\nOther changes made in Depp's response include the couple's official date of separation -- he listed it as To Be Determined, while Heard claimed it was May 22, the day before she filed for divorce -- and two days after the death of Depp's mother, Betty Sue Palmer.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean star also requested separation of certain assets, including miscellaneous jewelry, earnings made after their separation and, as stipulated in the response, There are additional separate property assets and obligations of the parties, the exact nature and extent of which are not presently known.\n\nWatch below:
Super Bowl LIV ended in the Kansas City Chiefs' first championship in franchise history, but that doesn't mean Patrick Mahomes and co. were the only victors in this year's big game. The best Super Bowl commercials of 2020 played to our heartstrings, kept us laughing and captivated us almost as much as the 31-20 comeback from the Chiefs.\n\nOne of the biggest standouts came from Google, which showed that its home assistance service can do more than just set reminders or timers for day to day activities. Google's Super Bowl commercial touched on a man's memories of his dearly departed wife and how meaningful every nuance of her was to him over the course of their marriage.\n\nThe commercial clearly resonated with viewers and garnered considerable chatter on Twitter, with one user saying I'm in tears. Good job.\n\nAnother standout Super Bowl commercial touched on levity instead, with Hyundai playing on the iconic Boston accent for its Smaht Pahk commercial.\n\nComedian Rachel Dratch and actor Chris Evans admire John Krasinksi's ability to wedge his car into even the tightest of parking spots thanks to Hyundai's latest automated feature. The commercial features another Boston legend, Big Papi David Ortiz as the car effortlessly maneuvers into its designated spot.\n\nPringles emerged victorious with its own innovative commercial with a play on the Rick and Morty inter-dimensional cable episodes fans love. Morty makes his own flavor combinations to disastrous ends and Rick and Summer realize they're stuck in their very own commercials for the potato chip brand and likely won't be compensated properly.\n\nHow much do you think Pringles pays these people? Summer asks.\n\nHardly anything, Rick responds.\n\nMountain Dew leaned heavily on Byran Cranston's impressive acting chops for a recreation of several iconic scenes from The Shining. The ad spot also features Tracee Ellis Ross in Shelley Duvall's role of Wendy Torrance as Cranston's Jack Torrance unveils a sugar-free version of the popular soft drink after chopping his way through a wall.\n\nFinally, Rocket Mortgage rounded out the top commercial spots for Super Bowl LIV with an ad featuring Jason Momoa showing us the real him. The actor and heartthrob reveals he's less buff and intimidating than his appearance will have viewers believe as he lauds the Quicken Loan service for its ability to see him as he actually is.
Washington — The Supreme Court has agreed to take up a First Amendment dispute between the city of Philadelphia and a Catholic foster care agency excluded from the city's foster care system because it does not allow same-sex couples to serve as foster parents.\n\nThe dispute arose after the Philadelphia Inquirer published an article in 2018 about Catholic Social Services, the agency at the center of the dispute, regarding its policy not to place foster children with same-sex couples because of its religious beliefs about marriage.\n\nCatholic Social Services is one of 30 foster agencies that contracts with the city of Philadelphia. But after the article was published, the city stopped making foster care referrals to the agency, saying at the time the agency violated an anti-discrimination ordinance and warning it would not renew its contract with the foster agency unless it changed its practices. The contract has since expired.\n\nIn response to the freeze, Catholic Social Services and three foster parents, one of whom has since died, sued the city, arguing the move violated their First Amendment rights. Catholic Social Services asked the lower courts to block the move by the city, but the federal district court refused. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled against the foster care agency.\n\nIn its July 2019 petition with the Supreme Court, Catholic Social Services warned that its services are being shuttered by the city because the two have opposing views on marriage.\n\nIt's no mystery why Philadelphia has punished CSS, lawyers for the foster care agency and the two remaining parents wrote. Having worked in harmony with CSS for decades, Philadelphia is shutting down CSS because, it said, it wants to prohibit 'discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom.' But well aware that it can't target religious exercise, Philadelphia started looking for a rationale to justify this predetermined result.\n\nCatholic Social Services also said Supreme Court intervention is needed because faith-based foster care and adoption agencies have been forced to shutter nationwide.\n\nHere and in cities across the country, religious foster and adoption agencies have repeatedly been forced to close their doors, and many more are under threat, the petitioners' attorneys wrote. These questions are unavoidable, they raise issues of great consequence for children and families nationwide, and the problem will only continue to grow until these questions are resolved by this court.\n\nBut the city rejected the allegation it acted with religious hostility toward Catholic Social Services.\n\nThe city respects and values CSS's religious freedom, and its rights to hold whatever beliefs it holds about same-sex marriage, lawyers for the city wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court in October. But the city is lawfully permitted to include nondiscrimination requirements in its city-funded contracts for city services, and it did so here for legitimate secular reasons.\n\nThe city also argued that the foster care agency does not have a preexisting right to determine the fact of Philadelphia's abused and neglected children, whose care is entrusted by law to the government — even if doing so is consistent with or steeped in its religious ministry.\n\nThe care of abused and neglected children in Pennsylvania is a public function. If CSS wishes to voluntarily contract with the city to assist in the discharge of that public function, the city does not burden CSS's First Amendment rights by requiring it to comply with key requirements bearing directly and exclusively on the administration of the city's programs—including the city's rules for who receives these taxpayer-funded public services, they wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court will likely hear the case in its next term, which begins in October.
Gangin' up\n\nThe drama surrounding the Republican presidential contest has reached a fever pitch, with Donald Trump insinuating he's not interested in pursuing the nomination if there is an open convention -- and his rivals announcing that they're teaming up to force just that outcome.\n\nBeing presidential\n\nDonald Trump's top aides have been going to great lengths in recent weeks to convince GOP stalwarts that the billionaire Republican front-runner can and will morph into something more presidential. But there are always inherent risks associated with a complete makeover.\n\nDo your job\n\nThe American public has a low opinion of Congress; only 14 percent think it's doing a good job. But Congress has excelled in one way: Raising money. Members of Congress raised more than a billion dollars for their 2014 election. And they never stop. But is the need to raise funds turning lawmakers in to telemarketers, and keeping them from the work they were elected to do?\n\nU.S. vs. ISIS\n\nPresident Obama has officially expanded the U.S. role in the fight against ISIS, sending hundreds more American troops into Syria. The White House insists the additional U.S. forces in the war-torn country will not be in combat, but he admits they will be in harm's way.\n\nSuicide attack\n\nMore than a dozen people have been killed by a suicide blast in a Shiite enclave south of the Syrian capital. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack yet, but it hit an area where ISIS has killed hundreds of people in recent months.\n\n1,000% loans\n\nIn one remote corner of the financial industry, millions of Americans are borrowing money at interest rates that can top 1,000 percent. Welcome to the predatory world of payday lending, where unwitting customers often find themselves mired in debt they can never escape.\n\nWaste not\n\nStarbucks recently announced a plan to donate 100 percent of its unsold food to charity within five years.

In a candid interview with The New York Times, Ben Affleck opened up about alcoholism, relapsing, divorce, Harvey Weinstein and a new role that hits close to home.\n\nThe 47-year-old actor said he still felt guilt for his divorce from Jennifer Garner, but had moved passed the shame. The biggest regret of my life is this divorce, Affleck said. Shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It's just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.\n\nAffleck and Garner separated in 2015 and filed for divorce in 2017.\n\nJennifer Garner and Ben Affleck arrive at the Oscars on February 24, 2013 in Hollywood, California. The two separated in 2015 filed for divorce in 2017. Jason Merritt/Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, Garner sat down with CBS Sunday Morning and spoke about having her family's public life play out in magazines. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, 'Oh, you've had to go through this in public.' The public isn't what's hard; what's hard is going through it, the actress told Conor Knighton.\n\nThat same year, despite being divorced, Affleck and Garner were back in the headlines together. Entertainment Tonight reported she drove him to rehab – again.\n\nAffleck has gone to rehab three times – in 2001, 2017 and 2018 – and he called relapsing embarrassing, according to The Times. I wish it didn't happen. I really wish it wasn't on the internet for my kids to see. Jen and I did our best to address it and be honest, the father of three said in the interview.\n\nThe Batman actor will soon portray an alcoholic in The Way Back, a sports drama directed by Gavin O'Connor, due out in March. In the film, Affleck plays a high school basketball coach who ruins his marriage and ends up in rehab.\n\nAffleck spoke to The Timesabout growing up with an alcoholic father, who didn't become sober until Affleck was 19.\n\nThe older I've gotten, the more I recognize that my dad did the best he could, Affleck said. There's a lot of alcoholism and mental illness in my family. The legacy of that is quite powerful and sometimes hard to shake.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ET in 2018, Affleck's younger brother, actor Casey, said they come from a long line of alcoholics. Casey said his brother's wife and kids inspired him to get sober.\n\nBen is an addict and an alcoholic. Most of my grandparents are alcoholics. My father is an alcoholic, as bad as you can be, and he's been sober for about 30 years. I've been sober for about six years, the younger Affleck said. Ben is trying to put it together, and it can be a very hard thing to do. He has the kind of resources and time, luckily, to take the time and go to a good facility.\n\nAffleck stars in The Way Back, a film about former high school basketball star, who is struggling with alcoholism and returns to coach his old team.\n\nIn The Times interview, Affleck mentioned Bradley Cooper and Robert Downey Jr. as guys who have been very supportive and to whom I feel a great sense of gratitude. Recently while accepting an award, Oscar winner Brad Pitt thanked Cooper for helping him get sober, too.\n\nHis divorce and sobriety are not the only heavy topics Affleck addressed during his interview. He also spoke about disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, currently on trial for sexual assault.\n\nI don't know that I have anything to really add or say that hasn't been said already and better by people who have been personally victimized or who are survivors of what he did, Affleck, who has acted in many Weinstein films, said. As a reparation, Affleck decided three years ago he would donate residual payments from his Weinstein films to anti-sexual assault charities, according to Variety.\n\nAffleck also has a slate of projects in the works. In addition to The Way Back, he also just finished shooting Deep Water, alongside Ana de Armas, and he stars in a new Netflix movie The Last Thing He Wanted. Soon, he will start filming The Last Duel, alongside friend and frequent collaborator Matt Damon, according to The Times.\n\nWhen asked by The Times how he makes these film choices, Affleck said he's never been very risk-averse – for better or worse, obviously.\n\nRegarding 'The Way Back,' the benefits, to me, far outweighed the risks. I found it very therapeutic, Affleck said referencing his portrayal of an alcoholic character.
Potential 2020 Democratic hopeful Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, delivered a pointed message for Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday, telling him to raise his objections with the gay community with God.\n\nButtigieg, in a speech at LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington, D.C., referenced the vice president's less-than-welcoming attitude toward members of the LGBTQ community when discussing his marriage to his husband Chasten. He called marriage equality a moral issue, saying his marriage of two years has made him a better human being.\n\nMy marriage to Chasten has made me a better man and yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God, said Buttigieg, a devout Episcopalian.\n\nI can tell you, that if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, he added, to a room full of loud cheers. And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pence's of the world could understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\n\nPence, a conservative Christian, has opposed same-sex marriage throughout his political career. He received harsh criticism from social activists for pursuing anti-LGBTQ policies during his time as governor of Indiana.\n\nDuring his remarks Sunday, Buttigieg detailed how so much has changed for the gay community in his young lifetime. He acknowledged the historic implications of his candidacy and what it could mean for the LGBTQ community at large, including the possibility of the very first same-sex couple in the White House.\n\nYou could either be openly gay or run for office, but not both, Buttigieg recalled of his early days in politics. But he said he was uncomfortable with the idea of coming to terms with his sexuality as a young man, saying he would have done anything to not be gay, when I started to half way realize what it meant that I felt the way I did, comparing it to a war inside himself.\n\nIf you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would have swallowed it before I could get a sip of water, he said.\n\nButtigieg said he ultimately decided to come out as gay after his seven-month deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, which he said forced him to realize that you only get one life. He said he finally addressed his sexuality during his reelection campaign as mayor in 2015, when Pence was governor. He said his coming out wasn't for political purposes, but for the simple reason of wanting to start dating.\n\nThe 37-year-old credited a dating app for meeting his future spouse.\n\nI looked through this little screen on my phone and I saw this smile. This guy and I clicked the button the right because I had to meet him. And one of the best things about this past couple of months is watching America meet him too and fall for Chasten, just like I did, he explained, crediting Chasten with helping him get through some of the tougher times in his life, including the loss of his father.\n\nIn previewing his plans for a potential presidency, the mayor said he would push for a Federal Equality Act immediately upon entering office.\n\nThe struggle is not over when states like my own home state of Indiana don't even have hate crime legislation. The struggle is not over when in so many parts of the country it's perfectly legal to fire somebody because of who they are and who they love. It must change, said Buttigieg. He said he would also push to overturn President Trump's ban on transgender service members in the military.\n\nThe struggle is not over when transgender troops have their careers threatened with ruin one tweet at a time by a commander-in-chief who he himself pretended to be disabled in order to get out of serving when it was his turn, he said, referring to Mr. Trump's deferments over bone spurs during the Vietnam War.\n\nWhile still technically in the exploratory phase of his 2020 career, the mayor is slated to formally announce his 2020 run at an event in South Bend this weekend.
Chase and Nicole McKeown's dinner date was a bit out of the ordinary last week, but some are calling the married couple's outing date night goals.\n\nThe McKeowns were eating at Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday night when another man entered the restaurant. That man wasn't a patron – he was there to rob the place, Louisville's police department said on Facebook.\n\nBusiness Robbery at Canes. You never know who's minding their own business but ready to put in work. This is the Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers at #MidCityMall Saturday night. Shout out to the two Elizabethtown Police Department officers that went from enjoying them delish chicken fingie's to full-blown #Sheepdogs real quick. They chased the suspect in the Highlands and made the arrest with our 5th Division officers. Great work, EPD! #LMPD #Etown #BusinessRobbery #RaisinCanes #ChickenBaskets #ChickenFingies #ThatSauceIsOnPoint #OneLove #ThatSweetTeaTho #Chicken #AlwaysFreshNeverFrozen #LikeOurHashtags #EtownStaysDown #EPD #OffDutyResponse #WolfHunters #FormulateAplan #DivideAndConquer #StrongWerk Posted by Louisville Metro Police Department on Tuesday, February 18, 2020\n\nSurveillance video from Raising Cane's shows the suspect, wearing a hood and a white mask, approaching a cashier and pulling out what appears to be a gun. Little did he know the two people dining in the back of the restaurant were also armed.\n\nThe McKeowns aren't just a married couple – they're both police officers. The husband and wife met on the job at the police department in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, the department confirmed to CBS News.\n\nThe surveillance video shows Detective Chase McKeown and Officer Nicole McKeown springing into action, whipping out their guns and approaching the suspect before he flees the scene. They were off duty at the time, but the couple helped nearby Louisville police officers catch the suspect, according to Louisville police.\n\nThe department shared the surveillance video and praised the McKeowns on Facebook, their story going viral. #DateNightGoals, the police department said, sharing a photo of the pair.\n\nLouisville's police department shared surveillance video of two off-duty officers stopping an attempted robbery. The officers were later revealed to be a married couple out for dinner. Louisville Metro Police Department\n\nThe Elizabethtown Police Department told CBS News the couple has only been married for six months. They're probably still in the honeymoon phase of their marriage, but the McKeowns are already shaking up date night.
Almost four years after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, Democrats and several Republican moderates on Capitol Hill are set to push for new legislation that would enshrine legal protections for LGBTQ Americans.\n\nThe Equality Act, which was reintroduced Wednesday by Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley after several previous attempts at passage failed, amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit discrimination due to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.\n\nFreedom is the ability to fully participate in American life, said Senator Merkley. It is way past time to fully open the doors of opportunity for every American.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, a moderate Maine Republican, is co-sponsoring the legislation. In the House, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, and Rep. John Katko of New York, will also co-sponsor the bill.\n\nThis legislation aims to protect the Americans in 28 states who currently have no explicit laws shielding them from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, according to Freedom for All Americans, a group aiming to change the current laws.\n\nEven with attitudes changing throughout the country in favor of gay rights, a majority of LGBT Americans still say they have faced discrimination, according to Human Rights Campaign survey.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat and one of the ten openly gay congressional members, is spearheading the push for the legislation in the House. The effort is supported by almost all Democrats in Congress and could ultimately receive support from more Republicans lawmakers.\n\nIt is past time for the Equality Act to be written into law, Cicilline told CBS News in a statement. No American should ever be treated as less than equal in the eyes of the law.\n\nCollins is the first Republican senator to co-sponsor broad legislation like this to combat gay discrimination. In 2013, several Republican senators joined Democrats and voted in favor of an employment non-discrimination bill that was ultimately unsuccessful in the House.\n\nAll Americans deserve a fair opportunity to pursue the American dream, Collins in a statement Wednesday. It is time we ensure that all people are judged on their talents and abilities, and have full access to the services they need and the opportunities they seek.\n\nIn 2014, Collins was the fourth Republican senator to announce that she supported gay marriage, a decision coupled with an endorsement from the American Civil Liberties Union ahead of her senate re-election that fall. The Maine senator, under fire from progressive activists for her vote in favor of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, is up for re-election again next year.\n\nLast Congress, two House Republicans co-sponsored the Equality Act, but they have both since left office.\n\nLGBTQ Americans are part of the fabric of our society and should be free to exercise the rights guaranteed to every American by the Constitution to participate fully in our society and pursue every opportunity, Fitzpatrick said in a statement.\n\nCicilline said the legislation could pass the House in a few months but it is unclear if the Equality Act will be voted on by the Senate. In the weeks ahead, conservatives will do everything they can to kill this bill, he said\n\nA spokesman for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell told CBS there is no guidance or announcements for you on yet-to-be introduced, let alone passed legislation. If voted on, skeptics say this could be a potentially difficult vote for senators with strong Evangelical and religious support.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken steps to reverse policies that protected from discrimination due to sexual orientation or gender identity. In 2017, the Justice Department reversed the Obama-era policy which used Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to protect transgender workers. The administration has also issued a ban on transgender service members in the military.\n\nCBS News' Grace Segers contributed to this story.
The announcement of nominations for the 92nd Academy Awards left some Hollywood stars and promising up-and-comers empty-handed Monday, with a roster of acting nominees that skewed white and the director nominees all male. Meanwhile, an R-rated character drama surprisingly screamed up a leading 11 nominations from an academy usually averse to comic-book legends.\n\nJoker earned a Best Picture nomination, as well as nods for Best Director (Todd Phillips), Best Actor (Joaquin Phoenix), adapted screenplay, cinematography, editing, costumes, score, hair and makeup, and sound mixing and sound editing — a strong showing for the dark, violent drama (which nonetheless earned more than $1 billion at the box office). The Irishman, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, and 1917 followed with 10 nominations apiece.\n\nBut many movie fans were dismayed by the list of talents left out. Notably, not a single female director made the cut this year.\n\nGolden Globe-winner Eddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name; Screen Actors Guild Award nominee Jennifer Lopez in Hustlers; and Golden Globe-winner Awkwafina in The Farewell were shut out of the acting categories when the Academy Award nominations were announced. Netflix/Styx/A24\n\nBest Director\n\nGreta Gerwig, the most recent female Best Director nominee two years ago for Lady Bird, failed to repeat that honor this year for Best Picture nominee Little Women (though she did earn a screenwriting nomination). Neither, for that matter, did Olivia Wilde for directing Booksmart (a comedy that was shut out completely), Lulu Wang (The Farewell, also shut out), Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood), or Celine Sciamma (Portrait of a Lady on Fire).\n\nThe director nominees instead were Phillips, Sam Mendes for 1917, Quentin Tarantino for Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, Martin Scorsese for The Irishman, and Bong Joon Ho for Parasite.\n\nCongratulations to those men, quipped presenter Issa Rae as she and John Cho announced the nominees Monday morning.\n\nGreta Gerwig directing Meryl Streep in Little Women. Columbia Pictures\n\nBest Actor\n\nIn the Best Actor category, Eddie Murphy's sparkling performance as a wannabe blaxpolitation star in Dolemite Is My Name and Jamie Foxx's powerful turn as a wrongly convicted man in Just Mercy were both shut out. Also passed over were Robert De Niro's rueful mob hitman in The Irishman, Golden Globe-winner Taron Egerton's reincarnation of Elton John in Rocketman, Christian Bale's race car driver in Ford v Ferrari, Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems, Robert Pattinson in The Lighthouse, and Daniel Craig in Knives Out.\n\nThe category only had room for five names already familiar from the awards circuit: Antonio Banderas, Joaquin Phoenix, Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver and Jonathan Pryce are this year's nominees.\n\n(While De Niro wasn't included in the actor nominees, he can console himself with a producer credit in the Best Picture category.)\n\nBest Actress\n\nCynthia Erivo, who starred as Harriet Tubman in Harriet, earned two nominations — for Best Actress, and also Best Original Song. But she was the sole non-white actress in the category, which had an unusually strong list of contenders this year. The other nominees are Renee Zellweger, Judy; Scarlett Johansson, Marriage Story; Saoirse Ronan, Little Women; and Charlize Theron, Bombshell.\n\nUn-nominated: Golden Globe-winner Awkwafina (The Farewell); Lupita Nyong'o (Us); Jessie Buckley (Wild Rose); Elisabeth Moss (Her Smell); Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart); Mary Kay Place (Diane); Alfre Woodard (Clemency); Honor Swinton Byrne (The Souvenir); Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel (for Portrait of a Lady on Fire); and Ana de Armas (Knives Out).\n\nBest Supporting Actor and Actress\n\nFlorence Pugh missed a Best Actress nom for the horror film Midsommar, but she squeezed into the Best Supporting category for Little Women (a performance which required much less screaming), along with Laura Dern (Marriage Story), double-nominee Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Margot Robbie (Bombshell) and Kathy Bates (Richard Jewell).\n\nMissing from the list were Screen Actors Guild nominees Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers) and Nicole Kidman (Bombshell); Golden Globe-nominees Annette Bening (The Report) and Beanie Feldstein (Booksmart); Jamie Lee Curtis (Knives Out); and Cho Yeo Jeong (the affluent housewife in Parasite).\n\nThe Supporting Actor category was pretty much a lock for the five nominees — Anthony Hopkins (The Two Popes), Al Pacino and Joe Pesci for The Irishman; Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood); and Tom Hanks (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood) — so there was no room for hopefuls Wesley Snipes (Dolomite Is My Name), Willem Dafoe (The Lighthouse), John Lithgow (Bombshell), or Ray Liotta (Marriage Story).\n\nOther snubs and surprises\n\nElton John and Bernie Taupin earned a Best Original Song nod for (I'm Gonna) Love Me Again from Rocketman, and Randy Newman is back for the latest Toy Story, but some familiar names from the shortlist, like Beyoncé (The Lion King), Pharrell Williams (The Black Godfather) and Radiohead's Thom Yorke (Motherless Brooklyn) did not make the finals.\n\nThe Best Documentary Feature category was missing such strong and popular contenders as Apollo 11 and The Biggest Little Farm, while of the nominees for the Best Animated Feature category, Disney's Frozen II was frozen out.\n\nThere were few surprises of omission in the technical categories, though the editor of Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood was weirdly missing, given the film's 10 nominations in other categories. A happy surprise: Parasite is up for Best Production Design.\n\nThe costume designers did not see fit to honor the theatrical garb of Rocketman, the strip-club attire of Hustlers, the Scandinavian folkloric adornments of Midsommar, the knightly wardrobe of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, or Chris Evans' sweater in Knives Out.\n\nOne omission that wasn't a surprise: the much-maligned digital fur of Cats did not get a nomination in the Best Visual Effects category.\n\nThe 92nd Academy Awards will be presented Sunday, February 9. For the second year in a row, the show will be presented without a host.\n\nSee also:
LOS ANGELES -- Rita Gam, who had a lengthy acting career on film, television and stage, has died.\n\nPublicist Nancy Willen says the actress died in Los Angeles of respiratory failure. She was 88.\n\nGam starred with Gregory Peck in 1954's Night People and 1971's Shoot Out and with Jack Palance in 1954's Sign of the Pagan and she also starred in the film Hannibal, ''King of Kings and No Exit. Her television credits included The Rockford Files and Mannix.\n\nShe was born in Pittsburgh on April 2, 1927, and made her Broadway debut in 1946 before going on to a decades-long career in film and television.\n\nGam was married to the late director Sidney Lumet from 1949 until 1955, and was a close friend of Grace Kelly. Gam was one of Kelly's bridesmaids when she married Prince Rainier III of Monaco.\n\nShe is survived by a daughter and son from her marriage to publisher Thomas Guinzburg, and three grandchildren.
Former President Barack Obama has become a content creator following his presidency, launching a production company, Higher Ground, with his wife Michelle. Mr. Obama's newest project is a podcast with an unlikely friend — Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe former president and the rocker launched the Higher Ground-produced Renegades: Born in the USA podcast on Spotify on Monday.\n\nThe duo introduced their joint venture with two episodes, the first titled Outsiders: An Unlikely Friendship. Mr. Obama reflects on the strife caused by the pandemic and racial injustice in America and how the country can find our way back to a more unifying story, he says.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen held conversations for a new podcast, Renegades: Born in the USA. Rob DeMartin\n\nThat topic came to dominate so many of my conversations last year, with Michelle, with my daughters and withy my friends, Mr. Obama continues. And one of those friends just happens to be Mr. Bruce Springsteen.\n\nMr. Obama says that on the surface he, a lawyer and politician from Hawaii, and Springsteen, a rock star from New Jersey, might seem to have little in common. But over the years, what we've found is that we've got a shared sensibility, he says. About work, about family and about America. In our own ways, Bruce and I have been on parallel journeys trying to understand this country that's given us both so much.\n\nRenegades: Born in the USA podcast features former President Barack Obama and rock star Bruce Springsteen. Spotify\n\nThey sat down and held conversations for the eight-episode podcast over the course of a few days in a converted farmhouse on Springsteen's property. The first topic they discussed was why they felt like outsiders as kids, and not surprisingly, the conversation then shifted to what has been the central dilemma of America since it's founding: the issue of race, Mr. Obama says.\n\nIn episode 2, American Skin: Race in the United States, which also dropped Monday, Spotify says they reflect on their early experiences with race and racism and the uncomfortable conversations we need to have. In the 42-minute episode, the hosts talk about Springsteen's integrated E Street Band and the central importance of the late saxophonist Clarence Clemons.\n\nRenegades will also cover a wide array of other topics like fatherhood, marriage, and the state of America, Spotify said in a statement to CBS News.\n\nPresident Obama and Bruce Springsteen have formed a deep friendship since they first met on the campaign trail in 2008, the statement reads. Now, for the first time ever, Higher Ground and Spotify invite listeners to eavesdrop as they discuss their hometowns and role models, explore modern manhood, and confront the painfully divided state of America today and how we can all move forward together.\n\nThis is Higher Ground's second original podcast available exclusively on Spotify, following The Michelle Obama Podcast.
Does Miranda Lambert have a new love in her life? It seems that way -- or if nothing else, she has snuggle buddy.\n\nThe newly single country singer posted a photo over New Year's weekend that had many fans wondering if she just confirmed that she's dating singer Anderson East. She's seen under a blanket in the pic cozying up to East. It's captioned: The snuggle is real...\n\nThe snuggle is real... @andersoneast 📷:@raytair @ape_lewis A photo posted by Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert) on Jan 1, 2016 at 8:33pm PST\n\n\n\nThere have been rumors that Lambert, 32, and East, 27, are an item.\n\nLambert and Blake Shelton split up over the summer after four years of marriage. Since then, Shelton has started dating Gwen Stefani, his co-star on The Voice. They haven't been shy about their affection for each other, either.
Mary Higgins Clark, the tireless and long-reigning Queen of Suspense whose tales of women beating the odds made her one of the world's most popular writers, died Friday at age 92. Her publisher, Simon & Schuster, announced that she died of natural causes in Naples, Florida, and said it is with deep sadness we say goodbye to her.\n\nNobody ever bonded more completely with her readers than Mary did, her longtime editor Michael Korda said in statement. She understood them as if they were members of her own family. She was always absolutely sure of what they wanted to read - and, perhaps more important, what they didn't want to read - and yet she managed to surprise them with every book.\n\nWidowed in her late 30s with five children, she became a perennial bestseller over the second half of her life, writing or co-writing A Stranger Is Watching, Daddy's Little Girl and more than 50 other favorites. Sales topped 100 million copies and honors came from all over.\n\nMany of her books, like A Stranger is Watching and Lucky Day, were adapted for movies and television. She also collaborated on several novels with her daughter, Carol Higgins Clark.\n\nWriter Mary Higgins Clark attends the 13th annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books at UCLA April 26, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. David Livingston/Getty Images\n\nMary Higgins Clark specialized in women triumphing over danger, such as the besieged young prosecutor in Just Take My Heart or the mother of two and art gallery worker whose second husband is a madman in A Cry in the Night. Clark's goal as an author was simple, if rarely easy: Keep the readers reading.\n\nYou want to turn the page, she told The Associated Press in 2013. There are wonderful sagas you can thoroughly enjoy a section and put it down. But if you're reading my book, I want you stuck with reading the next paragraph. The greatest compliment I can receive is, 'I read your darned book 'til 4 in the morning, and now I'm tired.' I say, 'Then you get your money's worth.'\n\nHer own life taught her lessons of resilience - strengthened by her Catholic faith - that she shared with her fictional heroines. She was born Mary Higgins in 1927 in New York City, the second of three children. She would later take the last name Clark after marriage. Her father ran a popular pub that did well enough for the family to afford a maid and for her mother to prepare meals for strangers in need. But business slowed during the Great Depression, and her father, forced to work ever longer hours as he laid off employees, died in his sleep in 1939. One of her brothers died of meningitis a few years later. Surviving family members took on odd jobs and had to rent out rooms in the house.\n\nClark had always loved to write. At age 6, she completed her first poem, and by high school, she was trying to sell stories to True Confessions magazine.\n\nAfter working as a hotel switchboard operator and a flight attendant for Pan American, she married Capital Airways regional manager Warren Clark in 1949. Throughout the 1950s and into the '60s, she raised their children, studied writing at New York University and began getting stories published.\n\nAspire to the Heavens was published in 1969. It was a triumph, she recalled in her memoir Kitchen Privileges, but also a folly. The book's publisher was sold near the release date and it received little attention. She regretted the title and learned that some stores placed the book in religious sections. Her compensation was $1,500, minus commission. Decades later, the novel would be reissued, far more successfully, as Mount Vernon: A Love Story.\n\nFor her next book, she wanted to make some money. Following a guideline she would often suggest to other writers, she looked at her bookshelves, which featured novels by Agatha Christie, Rex Stout and other mystery writers, and decided she should write the kind of book she liked to read. A recent tabloid trial about a young woman accused of murdering her children gave her an idea.\n\nIt seemed inconceivable to most of us that any woman could do that to her children, Mary Clark wrote in her memoir. And then I thought: Suppose an innocent young mother is convicted of the deliberate murder of her two children; suppose she gets out of prison on a technicality; and then suppose seven years to the day, on her 32nd birthday, the children of her second marriage disappear.\n\nIn September 1974, she sent her agent a manuscript for Die a Little Death, acquired months later by Simon & Schuster for $3,000. Renamed Where are the Children? and released in 1975, it became her first bestseller and began her long, but not entirely surprising, run of success. She would allege that a psychic had told her she would become rich and famous.\n\nClark acquired several homes and for a time owned part of the New Jersey Nets. She had friends in Washington and was a White House guest during the presidential administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Barbara Bush became a close friend.\n\nMarried since 1996 to former Merrill Lynch Futures CEO John J. Conheeney, Clark remembered well the day she said goodbye to hard times. It was in April 1977, and her agent had told her that Simon & Schuster was offering $500,000 for the hardcover to her third novel, A Stranger is Watching, and that the publisher Dell was paying $1 million for the paperback. She had been running her own script production company during the day and studying for a philosophy degree at Fordham University at night, returning home to New Jersey in an old car with more than 100,000 miles on it.\n\nAs I drove onto the Henry Hudson Parkway, the tailpipe and muffler came loose and began dragging on the ground. For the next 21 miles, I kur-plunked, kur-plunked, all the way home, she wrote in her memoir. People in other cars kept honking and beeping, obviously sure that I was either too stupid or too deaf to hear the racket.\n\nThe next day I bought a Cadillac!
TOKYO -- Princess Mako, the granddaughter of Japan's emperor, is ready to become a commoner.\n\nReports say she is getting married to an ocean lover who can ski, play the violin and cook, according to public broadcaster NHK TV. Kei Komuro, the man she is reportedly set to marry, is also a sort of prince as well: He has worked as Prince of the Sea to promote tourism to the beaches of Shonan in Kanagawa prefecture, the report said.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency declined to confirm the report Tuesday.\n\nThe man who won the princess' heart was a fellow student at International Christian University in Tokyo, where Mako, 25, also graduated, NHK said.\n\nThey met at a restaurant in Tokyo's Shibuya about five years ago at a party to talk about studying abroad, and they have been dating several times a month recently, it said.\n\nWomen can't succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne in Japan. Mako's father and her younger brother are in line to succeed Emperor Akihito, but after her uncle Crown Prince Naruhito, who is first in line.\n\nOnce she marries, Mako will no longer be a princess and will become a commoner.\n\nBut the process building up to the wedding is likely to take some time and be full of ritual, as Japanese nuptials, especially royal ones, tend to be.\n\nFirst there will be an announcement, the equivalent of an engagement, and then a date for the wedding will be picked and the couple will make a formal report to the emperor and empress. NHK said Mako has already introduced Komuro to her parents, and they approve.\n\nUnlike royalty in Great Britain and other European countries, the emperor and his family tend to be cloistered, although they travel abroad and appear at cultural events.\n\nAkihito, 83, is the son of Hirohito, Japan's emperor during World War II.\n\nAkihito expressed his desire to abdicate last year, and Japan has been preparing legislation especially for him so he can.\n\nUntil Japan's defeat at the end of World War II, Hirohito was viewed as divine, and no one had even heard his voice. But the times are changing, and the Japanese public harbors a feeling of openness and familiarity toward the emperor and his family. People are likely to see Mako's marriage as a celebration, although the rituals will continue to be tightly orchestrated.
KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- The wife of the former Uber driver charged in the slayings of six people in southwestern Michigan has filed for divorce, CBS affiliate WWMT reported.\n\nJason Dalton is jailed on six counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder for Saturday's random shooting rampage. Eight people were shot at three locations in the Kalamazoo area. Two survived.\n\nA source in Kalamazoo County Family Court told WWMT Carole Dalton filed the paperwork Thursday. The divorce filing said there has been a breakdown in the marriage relationship, the Kalamazoo Gazette reported.\n\nJason and Carole Dalton married in 1995 and have two children, ages 15 and 10. The newspaper reported that 45-year-old Jason Dalton earned $50,000 per year at an appraisal company. He also worked as an Uber driver and was transporting passengers the day of the shootings.\n\nFunerals for four of the victims will be held Saturday, according to WWMT. A community vigil will be held Saturday night at the car dealership where a father and son were killed.\n\nInvestigators have not disclosed a motive for the shootings. On Thursday, a lawyer for Dalton's family told WWMT he was acting depressed in the days before the killings.
Produced by Lourdes Aguiar\n\n[This story first aired on Jan. 19. It was updated on June 29.]\n\nBetty Jones and her friend Kathryn Crigler were brutally attacked on Labor Day in 1990 after answering a knock on the door at Crigler's Starkville, Miss., home. Jones, who opened the door, was stabbed immediately and died. Crigler, who was in a wheelchair, was in the rear of the home. The killer walked back to Crigler's room, raped her, strangled her and left her for dead. Crigler was able to crawl to a phone and call for help. She died two months later.\n\nStarkville detective Bill Lott says the crime scene was as bad as anything Jack the Ripper ever did.\n\nIt's frustrating, Lott told 48 Hours correspondent Richard Schlesinger this past summer of not yet having solved the crime. Yeah, it's frustrating, no doubt about it.\n\nThe case, which was unsolved for three decades, prompted Betty Jones' step-grandson, Jason B. Jones, to spotlight the case in a podcast. Jones, who was 10 at the time of the murders, launched his podcast in September 2017 as a way to work through his own questions about the incident and, perhaps, have someone uncover new information.\n\nBut what began for 48 Hours as a story about a cold case turned into something much different, thanks to Lott's determination and cutting-edge DNA technology that didn't exist when the women were killed.\n\nEven though I'm a dinosaur, I'm constantly getting on the Internet and looking at science, said Lott.\n\nThat trail led him to Parabon NanoLabs in Reston, Virginia, which developed technology that can predict what someone looks like through DNA.\n\nIt's like, 'now I know what you look like,' Lott said. 'Now I'm going to get you.'\n\nI've just felt an electricity about that this is going to be solved sooner than later, says Juky Crigler Holt, the granddaughter of Kathryn Crigler.\n\nWill technology help solve the case and get long-sought-after answers for the Jones and Crigler families?\n\nA KNOCK AT THE DOOR\n\nJason Jones has a job he loves. He designs album covers and produces music videos in Nashville, Tennessee. But for more than a year, he had a second passion. He had a podcast — a dark podcast — and it was personal.\n\nKNOCK KNOCK PODCAST: I will never forget that night … I remember waking up in the middle of the night sweating.\n\nJason launched his podcast in September 2017. It had an odd title, Knock Knock, and is about a particularly vicious crime that had been unsolved for nearly 30 years.\n\nKNOCK KNOCK PODCAST: I can't imagine the terror that Betty and Kathryn felt when they realized behind that knock, knock ... stood a monster.\n\nFor Jason, this was more than just a murder tale — it's the story of his family. Betty Jones was his step-grandmother.\n\nBetty Jones with her step-grandson, Jason B. Jones. Jason B. Jones\n\nJason Jones: I think that there was this [signals with his hand like a flatline] this hum of fear throughout our family after Betty died.\n\nIt was Labor Day 1990. Jason was 10 years old and living outside of Houston. That's when his family got that phone call telling them Betty had been murdered in Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Were you scared?\n\nJason Jones: Oh, yeah ... I knew enough to know that there was someone out there that killed my grandmother and they may wanna kill me, too.\n\nJason's parents Bill and Colleen Jones struggled to explain it all to him and his younger brother Simon.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Do you remember the words you used?\n\nColleen Jones: We don't know why, but God called Betty home and you'll see her again someday.\n\nBetty came into their family late in life. She was a widow when she married Jason's grandfather. He already had two grown children including Bill, Jason's father.\n\nBill Jones: She was wonderful …she took us in as her own children you know and was just warm and loving and just an angel to me.\n\nSadly, Betty's marriage to Jason's grandfather did not last long.\n\nJason Jones: My grandfather passed away from a heart attack just a few years into their marriage.\n\nAlthough Jason only knew his step-grandmother for a few years when he was young, she left her mark.\n\nJason Jones: She was the lady that came over and took us to nice restaurants and smelled really good. That's how I remembered her as a 10-year-old. She was the grandmother that was really into baseball which ... for a little boy, havin' a grandmother that's into baseball is pretty cool.\n\nBetty Jones was the baseball team mom for the Mississippi State University Bulldogs Starkville Police Department\n\nBetty Jones was more than just a baseball fan. She was a team mom for the Mississippi State University Bulldogs in Starkville. Her job was to keep the players from getting homesick and wanting to leave.\n\nBetty's sister, Anne McWhorter, says Betty often brought the players chewing gum to keep them from other vices.\n\nAnne McWhorter [imitating Betty]: Now, honey [laughs]. I want you to be sure and chew that gum. Now, don't you get into that tobacco!\n\nRichard Schlesinger: She had a real connection with this baseball team.\n\nAnne McWhorter: She did, but she had a connection with any age person.\n\nKathryn Crigler was one of the people to whom Betty felt connected. Betty was 65; Kathryn was 81, a retired school teacher. She was taking some new medication and Betty volunteered to keep her company in case she fell ill.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What was the basis of their friendship?\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Church.\n\nJulia Crigler Holt, known as Juky, says her grandmother and Betty were active members of the First Presbyterian Church, which was right next door. Betty was a church elder. Kathryn sang in the choir and she played the piano at home.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: I think that was her dream for me to be a pianist. That didn't happen, but I took lessons for her.\n\nTo this day, Juky has warm memories of her grandmother's house. Kathryn had raised two children there and it was a gathering spot for extended family.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Her house was a quaint little house. I never, in a million years, would ever feel scared in that location.\n\nThat night in 1990 started out peacefully enough. The two friends were just settling in after suppertime. That changed around 9 p.m.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: They had taken baths, they had their gowns on, they were getting ready to watch a ballgame when somebody knocked on the door.\n\nDavid Lindley | Retired Starkville Police Chief: The monster came to the door.\n\n\n\nDavid Lindley is now retired. but he was the lead investigator at the time. He says when Betty opened the back door, an intruder forced his way in.\n\nDavid Lindley: As best we can tell entered into a physical confrontation with her. And she tried to defend herself.\n\nKathryn Crigler was left bleeding. She had fractured ribs and a broken hip. But she somehow managed not just to survive — but to call for help. Julia Holt\n\nKathryn Crigler was all but helpless. She was an amputee and she was in her wheelchair in the bathroom when she heard Betty calling for help.\n\nDavid Lindley: She tried to see what was goin' on and the attacker appeared. He ended up makin' her go into her bedroom ... and told her that he did not want to hurt her like he had hurt her friend ... he in fact did rape Miss Crigler ... And he left the residence sometime shortly thereafter, we surmised.\n\nKathryn was left bleeding. She had fractured ribs and a broken hip. But she somehow managed not just to survive — but to call for help.\n\nDavid Lindley: Miss Crigler was able to — rally her strength ... she couldn't get to her wheelchair. So, she took a pillow and — used it to — kind of glide or slide into the kitchen area, where there was another phone and she was able to reach up.\n\n911 OPERATOR: Are you Miss Crigler? KATHRYN CRIGLER TO 911: Yes. Tonight there was one single boy — a young man — and he went in the front room where my friend was and he came back with his hands all bloody. And then he raped me. I know, it's just terrible.\n\nKathryn was rescued by EMS, but, in the living room with the baseball game still playing on the TV, Betty was dead on the floor. Her throat was slashed. She died trying to save Kathryn.\n\nAnne McWhorter: She was a fighter. And I know that when this guy started attackin' her, Betty fought back like a wild cat.\n\nBetty's death left a hole in her family's life and everyone in the small university town was on edge. As it turns out, police wouldn't have to look far for a good suspect … there was one right next door to Kathryn's house.\n\nTHE HUNT FOR A SUSPECT\n\nEven now, it's hard for Juky Crigler Holt to think about the details of what happened to her grandmother, Kathryn.\n\nBut Juky is still amazed by the courage and the strength her grandmother summoned after she was attacked, to get help for herself and her friend, Betty.\n\nI think to look at these pictures — it makes me sad. How horrible it is to know that at the very last part of her life something so horrible would happen, said Juky Crigler Holt, pictured with her grandmother, Kathryn. CBS News/Julia Holt\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: It makes me proud of her. Because she could've totally just given up right then. Most people would ... That's pretty amazing.\n\nSadly, Kathryn was unaware at first that Betty was killed.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Clearly what I can remember her saying all the time was, you know, if anything ever happened ... to Betty, I don't want to live.\n\nBetty's stepson, Bill Jones, visited Kathryn in the hospital after she learned her friend was dead. It was an emotional visit.\n\nBill Jones: She was upset that she survived and Betty had gone.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Do you remember what she said?\n\nBill Jones [emotional]: She said, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, please forgive me. And I said, I forgive you.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Did you feel that she was responsible?\n\nBill Jones [Shaking his head] No ... it tore me up. But that's all I could say or do, and that's what she wanted, so that seemed to help.\n\nIn November 1990, two months after the attack, Kathryn Crigler died of complications from her injuries.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: There's no doubt that whoever killed Betty that night, killed your grandmother ... It just took longer.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Yeah, absolutely.\n\nBut Kathryn had lived long enough to give the Starkville police a description of the assailant.\n\nDavid Lindley: She said he was a young man … Short hair that was almost cut like a crew cut — spiked, I guess you would say these days. He had blue eyes and light blonde hair or brown hair.\n\nPolice released a rudimentary sketch.\n\nDavid Lindley: She described his complexion as swarthy ... And we imagined that to be something either as — a skin tone or a suntan.\n\nInvestigator David Lindley says the killer left a few clues behind.\n\nDavid Lindley: We collected fingerprint evidence, we collected hair evidence, blood —\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You found some cigarettes there.\n\nDavid Lindley: We did … And neither of the women smoked. And — so we of course assumed that the perpetrator left the cigarettes at the scene.\n\nBut the police could not figure out a motive. The killer took $28 from Kathryn, but nothing else. And Lindley didn't think a petty thief would commit a crime this violent.\n\nDavid Lindley: But in this particular case there was just no rhyme or reason for it ... This is a crime of violence, purely for the sake of violence.\n\nThe hunt for a suspect was intense and police had a lot to work with. Lindley provided an update soon after the killing back in 1990:\n\nDAVID LINDLEY TO REPORTERS: Residents of Starkville are extremely helpful in providing leads and right now we have several leads that we are pursuing.\n\nMany of those leads, like a report of a drifter spotted in the area, went nowhere. But a good suspect soon emerged. A young neighbor of Kathryn Crigler's was having a party at his house the night of the attack. He had blonde hair and blue eyes — just like the killer Kathryn described.\n\nA rudimentary sketch of the suspect was later updated to show hair and eye color Sgt. Bill Lott/Starkville Police Dept.\n\nThe more police investigated, the more their suspicion grew.\n\nDavid Lindley: He did leave the party for a period of time. ...But nobody at the party could recall for exactly how long he was — gone from the party.\n\nWhat's more, the young man was known to carry a knife and he smoked the brand of cigarettes found at the scene.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Well, that must have caught your attention.\n\nDavid Lindley: Certainly.\n\nThe suspect also reportedly made a cryptic and possibly incriminating statement to a witness when asked about the crime.\n\nDavid Lindley: He stated that he did not do it, but his other self may have done it.\n\nPolice had a lot of suspicion but did not think they had hard evidence to arrest him.\n\nDavid Lindley: There was never enough probable cause to make an arrest … I think a lot of people in the community naturally believed that this individual committed this crime … They wanted it resolved quickly, but unfortunately it didn't occur that way.\n\nPolice were back at square one and, after three years of dead ends, investigators turned to America's Most Wanted, which agreed to feature the case. Everyone had high hopes.\n\nAnne McWhorter: Well, I was hoping that somewhere up in Chicago or California someone would … brag in a bar … you know, I was in Mississippi at that time. And [whispers] — hey, I did it. I did it.\n\nDavid Lindley helped man the phones at the show's headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\nDavid Lindley: We received many, many tips from all over the United States.\n\nIt looked promising, but only for a while.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Anything pan out?\n\nDavid Lindley: They did not … It was unsuccessful. A good attempt, but again, unsuccessful.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: The level of hope that you must have felt.\n\nDavid Lindley: This case has been a heartbreaker over the years ... So, disappointing is a good word.\n\nIn 2004, Lindley — who by then had been promoted to chief of police — handed the case over to an enthusiastic detective named Bill Lott. And Lott was intrigued by this case.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: When I first got assigned this case, I didn't do anything for the first year but read it six times ... I bet Chief Lindley thought, when is this kid gonna start workin' this case?\n\nBut as Lott dug in he became confident that the case could be solved.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: And I knew at that point I had a critical piece of evidence.\n\nA CHANCE MEETING\n\nSergeant Bill Lott's roots run deep in Starkville, Mississippi. And he has struggled for years to solve the mystery that has hung over his town since Labor Day of 1990.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: And to think that somebody would do something as heinous as this to elderly people just — it made me angry.\n\nLott feels a personal connection to Betty Jones and Kathryn Crigler.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Because — my parents had divorced at an early age and aunts and uncles helped raise me. And they were older. I had an older aunt that, you know, played a role in my life ... it just didn't sit well with me.\n\n48 Hours correspondent Richard Schlesinger and Sgt. Bill Lott CBS News\n\nWhen Lott took over the investigation in 2004, he inherited boxes of evidence, hundreds of pages of police reports, and a decade-and-a-half of frustration.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Let me tell ya somethin' — there was a lot of great, great detective work done ... The only advantage I had over those guys was DNA.\n\nThat's because when the crime was committed in 1990, not much was known about forensic DNA. But with new knowledge and new technology, Lott knew he had potentially critical evidence, because doctors had extracted DNA from Kathryn Crigler using a sexual assault kit.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: They might not have known it at the time but that was a key moment in this case.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: There's no question about it … that was the key to the gate.\n\nPolice kept the evidence and in 2005 Lott sent it to a lab.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What did that lab do for you with this evidence?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: They got a semen-based DNA profile.\n\nWith the DNA profile of the killer in hand, Lott's first order of business involved an old suspect: that blond-haired, blue-eyed man who was partying next door to Kathryn's house.\n\nRichard Schlesinger [with Lott looking at a container of evidence]: What is this?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: This is — contains the original kit of the number-one suspect that supposedly did this crime.\n\nLott had the killer's DNA profile compared to the DNA of the young man who many in Starkville still believe had been responsible.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What did it show?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Not a match.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Not a match?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Right.\n\nThe one-time prime suspect was almost certainly not the man who killed Betty Jones and Kathryn Crigler. In 1990 there was a lot of pressure to arrest that man. And Lott believes if he had been arrested he would have been convicted and executed.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Has this case ... changed the way you feel about the death penalty?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: I'll say it this way. I used to 100 percent pro-death penalty.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Now?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: [Sighs] Now I think it would have to be on a case-by-case basis.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Sounds like a shift to me.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Yes, because he could've been put to death for a crime he didn't commit.\n\nLott went on to test the DNA of 60 other potential suspects; none was a match. There was also no match in CODIS, the national DNA database of violent criminals.\n\nAnne McWhorter | Betty Jones' sister: I had resolved that it would probably never be solved ... that I would go to my grave without knowing — who did this.\n\nHours away in Tennessee, Jason Jones and his family — who had grown distant from Betty's over time — knew little about the investigation.\n\nJason Jones: No one was calling us. We were the extended family.\n\nAnd Jason says over the years his family hardly ever spoke about Betty' s death.\n\nJason Jones: It becomes this taboo subject where people don't really disclose information because it's hard to talk about.\n\nBut now, as an adult, Jason was more curious than ever.\n\nJason Jones: I wanted to know what had happened, and so I Googled it, and nothing came up ... it was shocking to me that I couldn't find information about this case or my grandmother's murder or her life or anything.\n\nHe had questions about Betty, but he had even more about Kathryn Crigler.\n\nJason Jones: I don't think I knew the name Crigler, to be honest.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You didn't know the name of the other person.\n\nJason Jones: I don't think so.\n\nBut in August 2005, when Jason was getting married, there was a huge, almost unbelievable development. His fiance's mother held a bridal shower and invited some of her friends. Stories frequently come out of bridal showers, but not like this story:\n\nColleen Jones: I was busy playing mother of the groom. And — so I was introduced to a lot of people that day.\n\nJason's mother Colleen was chatting with a young art teacher when they discovered that even though they were both in Nashville, they had a Mississippi connection.\n\nColleen Jones: And I told her that I had married a guy that had gone to high school and college in Starkville. And she said, Starkville? My grandparents lived there. What's your husband's last name? What were your in-laws' last name? And as soon as I said, Betty Jones … it was just like she had seen a ghost, and I was it.\n\nStanding before Colleen Jones was Kathryn Crigler's granddaughter, Juky.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Well how did you feel?\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Just wow! You know? What are the chances?\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Well, you tell me [laughs]. What are the chances?\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: Yeah, one in a gabillion. You know? It's amazing.\n\nBoth women were quick to see a larger meaning to the chance meeting.\n\nColleen Jones: This cannot be coincidental, happenstance ... It's like the angels went [she sings] ahhhh.\n\nBut it wasn't until 2017 that Jason, who was inspired by true-crime podcasts, decided he should spotlight the cold case.\n\nKNOCK KNOCK PODCAST: Even as a child I learned what the monsters fear. Whether imaginary or real — monsters today still fear the light.\n\nJason Jones: The podcast was not only a way for me to learn more about the life of a grandmother that was taken from me too early ... but also a way to try to seek justice or to make sense of what happened.\n\nWorking on the podcast would force Jason to return to the place he last saw when he was 10 years old — Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nJason Jones [in Starkville]: It's always been a story. And on this trip, it just — progressively became more real.\n\nBut it's always been real to Sergeant Lott who has never given up and believes one of Starkville's oldest cases with be solved with the newest technology.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: And I wanna get this guy. And this is a good tool. This is as good a tool as we've had in a while.\n\nCUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY\n\nIn early 2017, Jason Jones traveled to Starkville, Mississippi — a place he had long associated only with death and sadness.\n\nJason Jones: This just feels like Pleasantville, USA.\n\nBut visiting the home where his step-grandmother spent the last moments of her life brought back those familiar dark feelings.\n\nJason Jones [inside the house]: I just feel overwhelmed here. It's not even sadness it's — there's just a magnitude. I don't know. It's hard to describe.\n\nJason Jones: I hadn't visually put together that this was a real place with real walls and real windows.\n\nJason Jones [inside the house]: Now that I am here I could, I could really understand what it would be like this ... that's ... that sense of being trapped and — and that overwhelming panic.\n\nBeing in this place and knowing what happened here made it even more important to Jason to find out who was responsible, and to share the search with his listeners.\n\nKNOCK KNOCK PODCAST: How is it that we could have untampered DNA evidence, yet no matches had been made? If we couldn't find a match, honestly, could this case ever be solved? CBS News\n\nBut Sergeant Bill Lott was still working this case, often on his own time.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: I told my wife, I said, If I retire and I still haven't solved this case, you're gonna be rollin' me up to the police station in a wheelchair where I'm working on it ... I'm not quittin.\n\nAnd DNA technology is improving quickly. In June 2018, Lott had the suspect's DNA profile sent to Parabon NanoLabs in Reston, Virginia. Parabon works with cutting-edge technology performing what is called DNA phenotyping.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: DNA phenotyping means predicting a person's appearance from DNA.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak is Parabon's lead scientist for DNA phenotyping.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: How new is this technology?\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: It's very new. It's been available to law enforcement for less than four years. And at the beginning, there was a lot of skepticism ... DNA was seen as having this one purpose for matching. And we were saying, No, there's all this other information you can get from DNA.\n\nThat's because DNA is like a blueprint for a person's ancestry and physical characteristics. There are DNA codes that tell the color of your eyes, your hair, and your skin. The codes also tell your face shape, and even if you have freckles — and how many.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: And we've trained up our computers to recognize those genetic signatures ... And then if we run a crime scene sample from an unknown person through that model and the computer recognizes one of those signatures, it can say, There's a high probability that this came from someone with blue eyes. ... And then as you add each trait, you end up with a smaller and smaller group of people.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: If I'm a cop looking for a needle in a haystack, it seems to me you've just taken away a lot of hay.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: Absolutely. It is extraordinarily helpful with eliminating a lot of suspects … and focusing an investigation.\n\nParabon showed 48 Hours how they came up with the composite in the Starkville case.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: We've got the predicted face shape and we've got the predicted skin color on there. But we don't have the predicted eye color or predicted hair color.\n\nBut this process is part science, part art.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: This is sort of a blank canvas, to use an artistic analogy.\n\nThom Shaw is a forensic artist who interprets the computer's conclusions and makes the image more lifelike. The computer had concluded that this killer would most likely have some freckles, brown hair, and light blue eyes.\n\nThom Shaw: And so then I can go … to that collection of light blue eyes and pick out, OK, this is — this is the one we like.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: And we're not producing a photograph. So we don't know the person's age, their weight, anything that they've done with their hair or tattoos, scars, things like that. But we can give a description, which is something that the — that these detectives didn't have before.\n\nIn late August 2018, Parabon sent Sergeant Lott two composites: the first one, pictured at left, showed an idea of what the suspect looked like in 1990; a second composite was age progressed to show what he might look like now. Parabon NanoLabs, Inc\n\nIn late August 2018, just a few days shy of the 28th anniversary of the Labor Day murders, Parabon sent Sergeant Lott two composites. The first one showed an idea of what the suspect looked like back in 1990. And a second one that showed what he might look like now.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: When you look at this picture, what goes through your mind?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Where are you? [smiles] And how am I gonna find you?\n\nBut other experts at Parabon were using another method to find the suspect: genetic genealogy.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: In genetic genealogy, we're uploading it to GEDmatch, which is a public database of people who have explicitly chosen to publicly share their DNA for other people to search and have explicitly consented to law enforcement usage.\n\nThere are roughly one million people on GEDmatch.com who are searching for family members. The DNA of the Starkville killer was compared to DNA of all those people to see if one of them might be at least a distant relative. And they found something.\n\nDr. Ellen Greytak: So in this case we were able to find some good matches ... so these are people who genetically match our unknown subject. And we're trying to figure out, based on knowing approximately how much DNA is shared, can we build their family trees and figure out who this unknown person is.\n\nGenetic genealogy helped police catch the alleged Golden State Killer, who is believed to have murdered 13 people and raped 50 women across California in the 1970s and 80s. So Lott hopes it can help him, too.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: I've been over obsessed with it, lookin' at it to see if I've got the genetic genealogy yet.\n\nThe Jones and Crigler families sensed investigators were on the verge of something big.\n\nI've just felt an electricity about that this is going to be solved sooner than later, says Juky Crigler Holt, the granddaughter of Kathryn Crigler. CBS News\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: I've just felt an electricity about that this is gonna be solved sooner than later.\n\nAnd they were right.\n\nDavid Lindley: I was asleep here at home and about 4am I received a text from Sergeant Lott and he said, We got him! ... It wasn't very eloquent, but I believe my exact quote was you're sh—ing me!\n\nTHE SUSPECT\n\nKNOCK KNOCK PODCAST: Over the course of this season, we've unpacked Betty and Kathryn's lives. … We've seen … setbacks and huge opportunities for moving this case forward.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, as Jason Jones was completing his podcast series, he was hoping — among other things — that a listener would come forward with information about the murder. A listener did come forward, but with a completely unexpected story.\n\nJason Jones: We got a message from a girl by the name of Betty Hong. Her story was hard to believe, honestly.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What was it?\n\nJason Jones: Betty e-mailed us and let us know that she was actually named for my grandmother.\n\nBetty Hong told Jason that in the '80s, her family — having escaped the brutal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia — were sponsored by Betty Jones and several other members of the First Presbyterian Church to come live in Starkville. Betty's mother Kim Hong says her family came to the U.S. with their freedom, but very little else.\n\nKim Hong: Back then I come, I don't have nothing ... I only have two bag.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You came with just two bags?\n\nKim Hong: Two small bag, yeah.\n\nIt was before Betty Hong was born, but she says Betty Jones took care of her family and helped them get settled in America.\n\nBetty Hong: She truly impacted my parents' lives directly by clothing them, bringing them out to eat, and did it out of love. And [tearful] we got to come to America and have this American dream. So it's really — Betty Jones is, like, one of those angels that lived upon us ... But now that she's passed, I feel like she's someone who watches over me.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What is the emotion you're feeling now?\n\nBetty Hong: It's this burst of just — thankfulness.\n\nBetty Hong and Jason Jones meet for the first time. Betty was named for Jason's step-grandmother, Betty Jones. CBS News\n\nIn the summer of 2018, 48 Hours brought Jason and Betty Hong together for the first time.\n\nBetty Hong: We're like family.\n\nJason Jones: We're totally family, yeah.\n\nThe Hong's story became part of the seventh and last episode of the podcast that aired in August 2018. But although the podcast had its finale, it had no finality. Because, still, no one knew who killed Betty and Kathryn.\n\nJason Jones: What I would hope is that if we did a season two of Knock Knock, that it would be about the conviction and the trial of the person who killed Betty and Kathryn.\n\nAnd just weeks after that interview with Jason, it began to look like the story would have the ending he wanted after all. Because, finally, Sgt. Bill Lott had a suspect.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What was it that led you to this guy?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Genetic genealogy.\n\nLott's faith in science paid off. A genetic genealogist at Parabon had completed weeks of detailed work building family trees based on those DNA matches on GEDmatch.com, and she gave Lott a name.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: It seemed surreal. It didn't — it seemed like I was dreaming ... it wasn't a dream, it was real.\n\nLott's suspect: 51-year-old Michael Wayne DeVaughn, a twice divorced father of three. He'd worked in construction and farming most of his life. And he was being held in a jail a few hours away on drug charges.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Why wasn't his DNA in the national database?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: He had no prior criminal history until recently ... He's never served time or anything like that. No, he has not.\n\nLott believed DeVaughn had features similar to the ones depicted in the Parabon composite, but he needed to make sure he had the right man. So he sent a cigarette butt that DeVaughn discarded while in custody on the drug charges to a lab for DNA testing. The result: the DNA on the cigarette was a match to the DNA taken from Kathryn Crigler the night of the attack.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You went up and got him that day? That Saturday?\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Oh yeah … Oh yeah, it was time.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: It was time.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: It was time.\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2018, 28 years after the crime, Betty and Kathryn's suspected attacker was brought in shackles to Starkville, Mississippi.\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2018, 28 years after the crime, Michael DeVaughn was charged with Betty Jones' murder and the rape and sexual battery of Kathryn Crigler. Starkville Police Department\n\nMichael DeVaughn was charged with Betty Jones' murder and the rape and sexual battery of Kathryn Crigler.\n\nSgt. Bill Lott [choking up at a press conference]: It's been a long, long journey, but I would do it all over again.\n\nAnd later that day, Lott visited the man who had worked the case first — retired Police Chief David Lindley.\n\nDavid Lindley: Congratulations!\n\nSgt. Bill Lott: Congratulations to you. You did a lot of great work. I just finished it.\n\nBetty Jones and Kathryn Crigler Anne McWhorter/Julia Holt\n\nInvestigators were finally able to give the victims' families the news they wanted.\n\nAnne McWhorter | Betty Jones' sister: I looked at her picture this morning for the first time in a long time, the tears just flowed down my face ... It was just, Bet I miss you — even 28 years later.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Did you think that you would see this day?\n\nAnne McWhorter: No ... You can't believe it because 28 years is a very long time, but there was a bit of excitement there that it's finally done. He's finally been found.\n\nJason Jones was trying to absorb the news so soon after his podcast's final episode. But his reaction was not as simple as he expected.\n\nJason Jones: I thought I would feel either happy or mad, but the feelings are a lot more complicated than that ... I feel a sadness towards him that he was a guy that made a series of terrible choices that resulted in taking something away from us that was irreplaceable.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt wasn't quite as understanding.\n\nJuky Crigler Holt: He looked like a man to me that probably had no empathy whatsoever. He could care less about anything he did to anybody … Did I feel sorry for him? [pauses] No.\n\nWe may now know who knocked on the door that Labor Day night and attacked Betty.\n\nJones and Kathryn Crigler. But even if this case has been closed, there are still some questions that remain open.\n\nJason Jones: Why did this guy choose Betty and Kathryn? What were the circumstances that made him do this? And I know that it won't help, and I know that it won't make anything better, but I think the storyteller in me just needs to know what the end of that story is in order to put it away.\n\nMichael DeVaughn pleaded not quilty in January 2019. He is awaiting trial.\n\nSergeant Bill Lott has been promoted to lieutenant.
London — A U.K. court has handed a stunning legal victory to Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, ruling that the owner of the Mail on Sunday violated her right to privacy by publishing extracts of a personal letter she wrote to her father after she married Prince Harry. Meghan said she was grateful that the tabloid was being held accountable for what she called dehumanizing practices.\n\nAs CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, the case highlights some significant differences between privacy laws in Britain and the U.S.\n\nA U.K. High Court judge said in a ruling issued on Thursday that publishing portions of the letter was a manifestly excessive and thus unlawful breach of privacy. Meghan called the decision a comprehensive win.\n\nFor these outlets, it's a game. For me and so many others, it's real life, real relationships, and very real sadness, she said in a statement. The damage they have done and continue to do runs deep.\n\nThe ruling underscores a growing schism between British and American privacy laws, according to media lawyer Mark Stephens. Had the letter been published in the U.S., he says, Meghan wouldn't even have had a case.\n\nWhat we're seeing is London becoming the privacy capital of the world, he told CBS News. I think what it will mean is that American media have an advantage, they'll be reporting more, the public will learn more, and citizens from this country will start looking to America in order to get the unvarnished news.\n\nThe case is centered on a personal letter that Meghan sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, after his no-show at her Royal Wedding. She accused him in the private correspondence of breaking her heart for talking to British tabloids.\n\nThe judge's ruling avoids what might have been a messy public trial pitting Meghan against her father in court.\n\nBritain's Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, arrive at the annual Endeavour Fund Awards in London, March 5, 2020. Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\nI know at Buckingham Palace, there is relief, The Sunday Times royal correspondent Royya Nikkhah told CBS News on Friday. they never wanted this to go all the way to trial because it would have put Meghan on the stand, royal aids on the stand, and what would have come out then would have been incredibly damaging.\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to issue any comment on the ruling in the Duchess' case.\n\nIt's still an open question whether the court's decision will serve as a warning shot to certain sectors of the British media that have capitalized on overwhelmingly negative coverage of Prince Harry's marriage to the American actress.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday's publishers said they were surprised and disappointed by the decision, and they're considering whether to appeal.
Beyonce doesn't simply release albums anymore, she unleashes events.\n\nAnd so it was this weekend, amid deep mourning for a lost icon, music's queen dropped Lemonade, an arresting display of what technically qualifies as videos and singles, but is better described as a work of art that appeared deeply personal, yet is a bold social and political statement as well.\n\nIt contains revenge anthems for scorned wives, a requiem for side chicks, a display of #BlackGirlMagic and support of #BlackLivesMatter, and an ode to forgiveness, all wrapped into an hourlong HBO special Saturday night that would of course land on Tidal, the music streaming service owned by hubby Jay Z, moments after the special ended.\n\nAre you cheating on me? Beyonce's husky voice intones early on. For the first half of Lemonade, it seems that Jay Z's 100th problem was here, and unfixable. While Beyonce has used rumors of infidelity to fuel her music for years, from Ring the Alarm to Jealous, it seemed as if she was spilling all the tea on her much-scrutinized marriage with Lemonade.\n\nOn Hold Up, an intoxicating song with an island beat, a smiling Beyonce takes Crazy in Love to a new level: She smashes a bat on everything around her while reminding her man that other women don't love you like I love you. Later, on Sorry, with a twerking Serena Williams by her side, she shows her man the stupidity of his cheating ways and all he's lost. Middle fingers up, put 'em hands high, put it in his face, tell him 'Boy bye.'\n\nAt another point, she references her man's desire for Becky with the good hair and talks about wearing his mistresses scalp -- talk about snatching edges.\n\nWhat could come across as desperate instead becomes empowering, though, in part due to the poetic narrative Beyonce uses to tie each segment together, as well as the imagery, which is a defiant celebration of the beauty of black women: Dark to light, wooly hair to wavy hair, all looking glorious, with cameos from the likes of Oscar-nominated Quvenzhané Wallis, Zendaya and Amandla Stenberg.\n\nAnd just as we think it's time to start to get seriously concerned for Jay Z's safety, he appears, nestled with his queen, in Sandcastles, which speaks to a troubled union but a love that transcends it.\n\nWhile much of Lemonade would appear to tie into Beyonce's own life, or so she would have us believe, she also draws from the angst of the black community: The mothers of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown are seen, among others, looking somber as they hold photos of their slain sons. At another point, she tells the audience via the voice of Malcolm X that the most disrespected woman in America is the black woman.\n\nLike much of her music over the last few years, the music on Lemonade is not made for pop radio. Besides the explicit language, it doesn't fit into neat categories and boxes, ranging from R&B to a bit of reggae to rock and even a country twang. Paired with its visuals, it's also elevated, becoming a work of art that has many layers to be dissected; there may well be dissertations planned on it at this moment.\n\nIt all speaks to Beyonce's undisputed role the queen of pop -- not of music, but of culture. It's hard to imagine any other artist who could drop a project in the middle of our national mourning for Prince and still not only get attention for it, but captivate us so.\n\nToward the end of Formation, not included on the HBO special but part of the album, Beyonce intones: You know you that b---- when you cause all this conversation.\n\nWith Lemonade, she shows us she is King B, once again.
United Nations - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told an auditorium full of college students in New York on Thursday that there was a strong and relentless pushback against women's rights across the globe.\n\nDespite some advances, he said, the state of women's rights remains dire and violence against women, including murder, is at epidemic levels.\n\nGuterres' address at The New School came as the U.N. geared up for both International Women's Day on March 8 and the 25th anniversary of the global body's Commission on the Status of Women meeting in New York, which begins on March 9 with a focus on gender equality and economic justice.\n\nLegal protections against rape and domestic violence are being diluted or rolled back. Rape within marriage continues to be legal in 34 countries, Guterres said Thursday. Women leaders and public figures face harassment, threats and abuse, online and off.\n\nActivists place candles during a protest against femicides in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, on January 25, 2020. Herika Martinez/AFP via Getty Images\n\nGuterres said the pushback against women's rights demanded a response because the offenses were so pervasive: The policing of personal freedom and dress are a daily reality for millions of women and girls… from governments to corporate boards to awards ceremonies, women are excluded from the top table.\n\nOne of students at the event, Maria Francisca Paz y Miño Maya, a Master of Science candidate at The New School, told CBS News: From migration to gender to health to economic empowerment, women have a lot to say; it is a time for women to own this debate.\n\nShe said she hopes to help inspire the next generation of women to have a greater voice.\n\nGuterres spoke of the history of a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture, beginning with patriarchy, a social system founded on inheritance through the male line.\n\nIn a big and deep way, the pushback can be attributed to the idea that patriarchy… is normal and inevitable, journalist and activist Gloria Steinem told CBS News on Thursday. She added, however, that in the U.S. the majority of the country no longer believes that.\n\nNot only are women's rights still a concern, they are challenged and attacked, France's U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere told CBS News. When it comes to women's rights, whenever we stop moving forward, we go backwards.\n\nGermany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also spoke of the need to reverse the current trend Thursday at a separate event at the U.N., saying: We have to push back on the pushback.\n\nGuterres listed five areas in which women's rights needs to be improved: protection for violence against women; in the climate crisis, which he said has a disproportionate impact on women; in building inclusive economies; addressing the digital divide, where artificial intelligence is often programmed with a bias against women; and, finally, in political representation in government around the world.\n\nEverywhere, women are worse off than men, simply because they are women, the U.N. chief said, adding: We live in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture. Policies that penalize women… are back in fashion.\n\nBut the U.N. chief ended on a positive note, saying: Today, young women like Malala Yousafzai and Nadia Murad are breaking barriers and creating new models of leadership.
It's no secret that divorce is hazardous to your wealth. In most cases, it involves splitting marital assets in half, supporting two households rather than one and paying copious amounts of cash to attorneys to facilitate the dissolution.\n\nThat's why the chance of running out of assets in retirement is substantially higher for those who have been divorced than those who haven't. Net financial wealth in households that have never suffered through divorce is about 30 percent higher than in comparable households that have, according to a new study by the Center for Retirement Research (CRR). On average, divorce puts you at about a 5 percent greater risk of running out of assets, according to the study.\n\nWith one noteworthy exception: single women.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement readiness, single women who were divorced are in just as good shape as those who never married -- bucking the trend for all other groups, including single men and married couples. The reason behind these surprising results: real estate.\n\nDivorce leaves single women with two offsetting things -- children, who are costly to raise, and the house, which provides a means for accumulating home equity, the CRR study said. If these women choose to tap that equity, a house can make all the difference to their financial security, said Geoffrey Sanzenbacher, one of the study's authors.\n\nIronically, financial planners have for decades been telling women going through divorce to dump the house.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all financial advice for divorcing women, said Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial, a New York planning firm. But more often than not, Ramnani said she counsels women to get rid of the marital home after she completes her analysis of the women's pre- and post-divorce finances.\n\nIt's often a matter of how much money it takes to run the house, in addition to paying the mortgage, said Ramnani. There are property taxes and, maybe, homeowners association fees, maintenance and landscaping, minor and major repairs.\n\nIf you can't afford to keep the house for at least five years, keeping it short-term just to ease the upheaval on the family is a major money mistake, added Ginita Wall, co-founder of the Women's Institute for Financial Education.\n\nThe house is not the problem. It's what you have to sacrifice to keep the house, Wall said. You may give up other assets, such as retirement accounts to keep an asset that's uncomfortably unaffordable.\n\nAdmittedly, women are often reluctant to take this advice, Wall acknowledged.\n\nI refer to the house as the marriage museum, she said. It's often symbolic of good times. There are memories. ... There's a gravitas to the house that goes deeper than any logical justification you can come up with for it.\n\nHowever, the very problems with affordability may be what makes the house a good retirement asset. After all, where you may not scrimp and save to add money to a retirement account, you're likely to cut out frills to pay your mortgage. And paying the mortgage builds equity, which can be tapped later in life to finance retirement.\n\nThe house does have one singular advantage in that you can't live in a retirement account, but you can live in a house, Wall said. And your payments reduce the mortgage, while the value of the house is likely to rise over time.\n\nThe one catch, said CRR's Sanzenbacher, is that few retirees are willing to tap their equity by downsizing or getting reverse mortgages -- even when they should to live better in retirement. So even though single women with a house are theoretically in a better position, they may not feel like it unless they finally break the tie to their real estate.\n\nIt's a big asset, and our calculations assume that people will use it, Sanzenbacher said. We think they should use it. But we know that not that many people do.
About 4 of 10 LGBTQ workers say they aren't fully out at work, according to a new study from jobs website Glassdoor.\n\nHalf of those surveyed said they feared being out would hurt their career prospects, from getting passed over for a promotion to even losing their jobs.\n\nMore than 5 of 10 LGBTQ workers said they had experienced or witnessed anti-LGBTQ comments from co-workers.\n\nOne of the most rapid social shifts in recent decades is the acceptance of LGBTQ people, from gay marriage to television shows featuring transgender and gay characters. But LGBTQ workers say they're not always feeling the love in their workplaces.\n\nSlightly more than 4 of 10 LGBTQ workers say they aren't fully out at work, according to a new survey from employment site Glassdoor, which undertook the survey in advance of Pride Month in June. The reasons for worker reluctance may boil down to fears about bias and discrimination, with about half of those surveyed saying they believe being out in the workplace could hurt their careers.\n\nThe findings underscore the fears and concerns many LGBTQ people continue to feel in the workplace, especially at a time when some state lawmakers are sponsoring bills that would limit the rights of LGBTQ people, such as a rash of bathroom bills sponsored during the past few years aimed at transgender people.\n\nBut the benefits of coming out at work can provide a productivity boost both to LGBTQ workers and their employers, with Australian researchers finding in earlier surveys that out workers are more satisfied and happier in their employment.\n\nThe latest findings are a wake-up call, said Scott Dobroski, senior director of corporate communications at Glassdoor and a member of the LGBTQ community. I was a little surprised and disappointed and it makes me sad, honestly, that nearly half of LGBTQ workers believe that being out at work could hurt their careers.\n\nBut, he added, he wasn't surprised that more than half had experienced anti-LGBTQ comments at work, since he noted he's among those who have been at the end of a negative comment. It's a mixture of intentional and unintentional comments that can occur, he said. What it illustrates is there is a continued need for education about what is appropriate in the workplace for any minority group.\n\nWorkers who are LGBTQ -- which most often stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning -- aren't always guaranteed workplace protections, another concern for some employees. Twenty-six states don't provide legal protections for LGBTQ workers, Glassdoor noted.\n\nMore employer support wanted\n\nDespite the seachange in public support for gay rights, employers need to do more to support LGBTQ workers, the survey respondents told Glassdoor. It's not enough for employers to march or support in a Pride parade, for instance, Dobroski noted. Instead, LGBTQ workers are looking for policies that show support for their community, such as extending the same benefits to LGBTQ workers as to straight employees, like parental leave, Dobroski added.\n\nLawsuits alleging discrimination for anti-gay bias aren't uncommon. In April, the Supreme Court took a case that could determine whether companies can fire workers for their LGBTQ identities, with two of the plaintiffs claiming they lost their jobs because they were transgender and gay, respectively.\n\nBut even companies aiming to be supportive of LGBTQ workers may be falling short. Employment experts say creating an inclusive workplace should include examining diversity policies to make sure they support LGBTQ parents and people who are transitioning, for example. Other steps include providing gender neutral bathrooms and work forms with options for people who don't identify as either male and female, the Australian researchers wrote in the Harvard Business Review.\n\nEmployers want to fuel their businesses for financial success, and you need quality talent to do that, Dobroski said. If they don't show support to the LGBTQ community, their companies are missing out on great talent.
Shakira is one of the world's biggest music stars, a crossover phenomenon with hits in both Spanish and English. She's won three Grammys, 11 Latin Grammys and amassed a $350 million fortune. Now, at 42, she's about to hit another high note: performing at the halftime show at this year's Super Bowl with Jennifer Lopez. It's a remarkable journey for a woman who was cut from her elementary school choir in Colombia — her classmates said she sounded like a goat. Shakira now lives in Spain. We went to see her there and found an artist bristling with restless energy and drive that sometimes torture her, but always propel her, lifting her to one of the biggest stages in the world: the Super Bowl in Miami.\n\nTwo months before kickoff, Shakira lit up center court at the Davis Cup tennis tournament in Madrid with the kind of full throated, hip thrusting performance that has electrified audiences for more than two decades.\n\nThis was her first live performance in more than a year ... a warm up for the Super Bowl and a showcase for the distinctive music and eye-catching moves that have catapulted her to one-name international pop star status.\n\nShakira\n\nShakira fills huge stadiums around the world, her devotees cry out - sometimes just plain cry — to hear hits like, Hips Don't Lie.\n\nBill Whitaker: I've seen you running around. You go from guitar to drums, and the dancing and the singing. It just looks like you're having so much fun. Are you?\n\nShakira: Oh yeah. I have a blast on stage. I feel that that's my turf. It's a comfortable place for me.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do you feel the music?\n\nShakira: I listen to music through my body. Even when I'm mixing songs in the recording studio, if I don't move, I know that there's something wrong. I say, Do you see them moving? Do you see my hips moving? It's not working. (LAUGH) Hips don't lie.\n\nBill Whitaker: A lot of your dance moves are quite provocative.\n\nShakira: That's what my mom says. (LAUGH)\n\nBill Whitaker: That's what your mom says.\n\nShakira: Now you're sounding like her. (LAUGHTER) It just comes out like that.\n\nBill Whitaker: So you're just feelin' it and that's— that's what happens.\n\nShakira: It's the way I move, baby. (LAUGHTER)\n\nWhen it comes to her moves and her music, Shakira leaves nothing to chance. The Davis Cup performance in November was just eight minutes. She spent a full month rehearsing.\n\nShakira in rehearsal\n\nWhen we dropped in, we saw an artist in constant motion and total control. She fine tunes the fine points of every performance, no detail is too small. Whether working on the choreography critiquing the dancers or directing the timing of the show.\n\nThey used to call James Brown the hardest working man in show business. It seemed to us Shakira is vying for that title. In the studio and on the stage, Shakira strives for perfection.\n\nShakira: I can really be hard on myself wanting it to be 100% perfect but I know perfection doesn't exist but it's a lesson I haven't quite learned yet. If it were up to me I wouldn't be celebrating any of my performances.\n\nBill Whitaker: None of them?\n\nShakira: None of them, no. There's always something that I wish would have been done differently and I coulda done better.\n\nWhere she sees imperfection, her multitude of fans see incandescence. She has sold 80 million records worldwide. Five albums cracked the U.S. Billboard top 10. She writes or co-writes nearly all her songs.\n\nBill Whitaker: What does creating the music do for you?\n\nShakira: Sometimes it saves me a visit to a shrink. (LAUGH) Literally, it's such—\n\nBill Whitaker: It's cathartic?\n\nShakira: Such a therapeutic, yeah, cathartic vehicle, you know, for me to express my thoughts and my angst. Sometimes I'm just restless, and I don't know what it is. And I think it's— what I just need is a piece of paper and a pen or my computer, and just start writing. And then being able to put music to those words. It's something really beautiful, I guess. (LAUGH)\n\nHer distinctive sound is a blend of the music and colors of home, the coastal Colombian city of Barranquilla, a melting pot of cultures: indigenous, European, African, Middle Eastern.\n\nShakira: I have a little bit of everything in my blood.\n\nBill Whitaker: You mix all of those elements with your dance and the sounds of your music.\n\nShakira: You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be an anthropologist. I guess\n\nthat somehow I'm kind of vicariously being one through my music.\n\nOne of her biggest hits: Waka Waka, the anthem for the 2010 soccer World Cup, had African roots.\n\nShakira: There are songs that make you feel like a dog biting your own tail. You never—\n\n(LAUGH) you never figure it out. And there are songs that are so easy that just come to you. Songs like Waka Waka, for example.\n\nBill Whitaker: That came to you easily?\n\nShakira: The music and the lyrics came to me at the same time. (SINGS LYRICS) You're a good soldier, choosing your battles, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, back in the saddle. I'm, like, I need a paper, and a pen. A paper and a pen, someone. Run.\n\nShakira and Gerard Piqué\n\nWaka Waka hit number one in more than 15 countries, racked up almost 2.4 billion views on YouTube, and it swept Gerard Piqué into her life. The Barcelona soccer star was one of several World Cup players who appeared in the music video.\n\nGerard Piqué: For me, it was, like, very shocking. I had to dance and (LAUGH). I'm not…\n\nShakira: Well, that's not dance, going like this.\n\nGerard Piqué: No. No. I had to—\n\nShakira: That's not dancing. (LAUGH)\n\nGerard Piqué: I had to do some— some— some movement. Yeah.\n\nShakira: You did a little bit of that, of the waka.\n\nBill Whitaker: You had to do the Waka Waka movement?\n\nGerard Piqué: And for me, it was ridiculous.\n\nBut his one-second cameo was enough to catch Shakira's eye.\n\nShakira: I wasn't a soccer fan so I didn't know who he was. But when I saw the video, I was like, Hmm. That one's kind of cute. (LAUGH) And then someone decided to introduce us.\n\nGerard Piqué: Yeah.\n\nThe couple now has two boys, live in Barcelona and have enough combined star power that Forbes Magazine named them one of the most powerful couples on the planet.\n\nBill Whitaker: For all intents and purposes, you— you two are married.\n\nShakira: We're not married.\n\nBill Whitaker: But you're not officially married.\n\nShakira: To tell you the truth, marriage scares the out of me. I don't want him to see me as the wife. I'd rather him see me as his girlfriend.\n\nGerard Piqué: The girlfriend.\n\nShakira: Exactly. His lover, his girlfriend. It's like a little forbidden fruit (LAUGH), you know? I wanna keep him on his toes. I want him to think that anything's possible depending on behavior. (LAUGHTER)\n\nAnything's possible should be the mantra of Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll. At 10, she entered a singing contest and won. At 13, she signed her first record deal. Five years later, she was one of the biggest rockeras - rock stars - in Latin America.\n\nCorrespondent Bill Whitaker with Shakira\n\nBut she craved a broader audience. So, she learned English, studied the lyrics of Bob Dylan and the poetry of Walt Whitman and at age 24 was blasting up the U.S. charts with a new look and a new song: Wherever, Whenever.\n\nBill Whitaker: What made you believe you could make it in the United States?\n\nShakira: Destiny? I had no doubt in my mind. I had visions of what was gonna happen to me since a very early age.\n\nIt was a steady rise until 2018, when she ran afoul of Spanish authorities over when she took up residence and how much tax she owes. She's paid about $16 million while she fights the assessment. It's a staggering sum that would have been unimaginable to a young Shakira. When she was seven, her father's jewelry business went bankrupt. The family went from middle class to poor overnight.\n\nBill Whitaker: What impact did that have on you?\n\nShakira: Oh, a tremendous impact it was really important to me to vindicate my family's financial situation and social status. And to a point that it became— an obsession to me. A healthy obsession, I— I would say. You know to succeed in life. To bring my dad and my mom out of that precarious situation. I think that I would not be the same person if my dad hadn't had that financial setback.\n\nHer father scraped together the money to keep his bookish daughter in Catholic school. At 18, with money from her first hit album, she started a foundation to educate disadvantaged children.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why'd you do that? You were a kid yourself.\n\nShakira: I was a kid myself. I grew up witnessing that many kids my age, many kids just like me, instead of going to school, were sleeping barefoot in the park.\n\nShe has built six schools and educated 23,000 children in Colombia. She's considered a global leader on education who lobbies presidents to invest in early childhood development.\n\nShakira: I've always been convinced that my purpose in life is not to shake it endlessly. You know? (LAUGHTER) There's gotta be so much more to it. You know? My musical career has served as a vehicle to work for children, which is the project of my life.\n\nChanging lives, creating music she says she's as driven as ever. She's working on a new song.\n\nShakira: Gotchu moving.\n\nBill Whitaker: Got me movin'.\n\nShakira: Okay, and your hips don't lie.\n\nIn true Shakira fashion, she thinks it can be better.\n\nShakira: There's something in the frequency of the bass that is bugging me a little bit. I was just feeling it as I was listening.\n\nShakira takes a photo with fans\n\nPop star, mother, philanthropist. It's a lot to carry on her 5'3 frame. On a walk in Barcelona, we got a taste of what it's like to be Shakira.\n\nFEMALE FAN: Can I have a photo from you?\n\nShakira: Yeah, of course.\n\nAnd with the Super Bowl just weeks away.\n\nShakira: You'll see me in all my splendor, (LAUGH) meaning I'll be, like, (MAKES NOISE), stressed out. (LAUGH)\n\nThat, she told us, is part of her process - her drive for perfection which is taking her all the way to the Super Bowl.\n\nShakira: I know that was on my to-do list, so, February 3rd, I'm gonna go, Check.\n\nBill Whitaker: You said you like your music to say something? What would be the message that you will send in your Super Bowl performance?\n\nShakira: I think the message is gonna be Listen, I'm a woman. I'm a Latina. It wasn't easy for me to get to where I am. And being at the Super Bowl is the proof that everything is possible. That the dreams of a little girl from Barranquilla, Colombia, they were made of something of what dreams are made of and I'm gonna be there, giving it all.\n\nProduced by Marc Lieberman.

Celeste Ng, like most of us, finds her high school yearbook pictures embarrassing. (I'm gonna call a veto on that, she said to correspondent Martha Teichner as they pored over photos. We're not gonna show that! she said of another.)\n\nNg recalled, In health class we had to write a letter to ourselves ten years in the future. We were 16, and so you wrote a letter to yourself at age 26. And I had asked myself, like, 'So, are you a published author yet?'\n\nPenguin\n\nAt 26, her answer was no. But here she is at 39, back at Shaker Heights High School in February, signing the library copy of her second mega-bestseller, Little Fires Everywhere.\n\nIt takes place in the Cleveland, Ohio suburb where she lived before going off to Harvard. Hulu has turned the novel into an eight-part mini-series. It begins, as the book does, with an actual fire. The plot involves who set it, but more importantly why.\n\nReese Witherspoon plays the wealthy, entitled Elena Richardson; Kerry Washington is artist Mia Warren, who rents an apartment from Richardson.\n\nShaker Heights, by its very nature, is a character in the story, too. Walking past the neighborhood's grand houses, Ng told Teichner, Every one, as I understand it, was different. It had to be designed specifically for that spot.\n\nCorrespondent Martha Teichner walks with novelist Celeste Ng through Shaker Heights, Ohio. CBS News\n\nIncorporated in 1912, Shaker Heights was built on the site of an actual Shaker village. It took to heart some of the Shakers' strictly-enforced values. Every street was designed so schoolchildren never had to cross a major thoroughfare. The grass could be no more than six inches high, or a homeowner was fined.\n\nThey planned it from the very beginning, sort of to be a utopia, said Ng. I mean, their goal was perfection.\n\nBy 1960, it was the wealthiest community in America, where the Good Life included doing good. It was known for being a place where diversity was sort of a priority, Ng said, and that they were working hard to be racially diverse, at least in terms of black and white, and racially aware.\n\nWhich is one reason Ng's scientist parents, both immigrants from Hong Kong, chose to live there, and to send her to Shaker Heights' public schools, among the best in the nation, even though there were few Asian students.\n\nNg said, A lot of times, Asian Americans, much like the Latinx population, are sort of this outside party between sort of the bigger questions about black and white race relations.\n\nIt was probably inevitable Celeste Ng would be a writer. Growing up, she made miniature objects for the imaginary occupants of miniature rooms.\n\nCeleste Ng's miniature rooms. CBS News\n\nThere's a sense that you see the room and you start to make up a story, she said, and that might have been part of the attraction for me when I was a kid. I was always making up stories about the dolls that lived in the house.\n\nEverything I Never Told You, published in 2014, sold a million copies and was chosen Amazon's Best Book of the Year.\n\nBestselling writer Celeste Ng talks about her childhood in a progressive and diverse Cleveland suburb, which helped inspire her stories of class and racial divides, and about being targeted by racist online trolls. CBS News\n\nTeichner said, That book is very much an exploration of the secrets, everything associated with a mixed marriage between a Chinese man and an American white woman.\n\nWell, I started thinking about the family, and they ended up becoming a mixed race family because I'm in a mixed-race marriage myself, said Ng.\n\nYou won't see pictures of Ng with her family, because she's been trolled online. I've had people send me nasty messages, nasty emails out of the blue, strangers, Ng said.\n\nBecause you are in a mixed marriage? asked Teichner.\n\nThat's why they say they're angry anywhere. I think it really goes much deeper. It really goes down to misogyny and to their questions about what they think women should be allowed to do.\n\nAnd I posted this message on Twitter so that people could see what happened. [Her response to the insulting troll? Sorry I didn't reply, I'm on vacation and also you are f*****g idiot.]\n\nAnd the good thing that came out of that was that a lot of women, particularly Asian women, wrote to me and they said, 'I've been harassed like that, too.'\n\nShe's horrified by attacks on Asian Americans prompted by coronavirus. It makes me sad for fellow Asian Americans that we will always be seen as other, and as foreign, no matter how long we've been here, no matter what we might be doing to fight this epidemic, just like everyone else is, Ng said.\n\nIn the Hulu adaptation of Little Fires Everywhere, one of the plotlines involves a dilemma. Who deserves to raise a baby girl: her poor, Chinese mother, or the childless, wealthy white couple desperate to adopt her? I think my job as a fiction writer is to present questions to the reader, more so than to present answers, Ng said.\n\nBetween hardcover and paperback editions, Little Fires Everywhere has spent nearly two years on The New York Times bestsellers list. Ng's success, she hopes, will give her the power to open doors for other Asian American writers.\n\nShe said, No one story is gonna tell the whole Asian American experience. If I'm offered a seat at the table, I want to make other seats at the table. I guess I want to make more chairs for other people.\n\nTo watch a trailer for Little Fires Everywhere click on the video player below:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Kay Lim.

Prairie Village, Kan. — A petition signed by more than 1,000 Catholics asks church officials to reconsider a decision banning a child of a same-sex couple from attending a local Catholic grade school, reports CBS Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KCTV. The petition is signed by parishioners of the St. Ann Catholic Church in Prairie Village, Kansas and more than 20 other parishes in the metropolitan area.\n\nThe online Google petition is addressed to Archbishop Joseph Naumann and school Superintendent Kathy O'Hara. It reads in part, Respectfully, we believe that the decision to deny a child of God access to such a wonderful community and education, based on the notion that his or her parent's union is not in accordance with the Church's teaching in Sacramental marriage, lacks the compassion and mercy of Christ's message.\n\nSueann Douglas, the mother of a student in the school, told KCTV many parents learned of the decision to exclude children based on the sexual orientation of their parents from an email to school families.\n\nThe email from the St. Ann pastor, Father Craig Maxim said he sought the advice of the archdiocese since as a parochial school we are subject to the guidance of the archdiocese on the application of church doctrine. ... The archdiocese advised against admission.\n\nSign in front of Saint Ann Catholic Church and School in Prairie Village, Kansas on March 6k, 2019 KCTV\n\nSt. Ann Parish told KCTV it was directing all questions to the archdiocese. The station was waiting for a response.\n\nLegal experts told KCTV the church is on solid ground, since it's a private institute that doesn't receive any government funding.\n\nThe Kansas City Star notes that some dioceses across the country allow children of same-sex parents to attend their schools.\n\nBut Superintendent O'Hara said in a statement to the Star that the church's teaching on marriage is clear and is not altered by the laws of civil society. Catholic doctrine recognizes marriage as a sacrament entered into between a man and woman.\n\nThe Church teaches that individuals with same sex attraction should be treated with dignity, the statement read. However, the challenge regarding same sex couples and our Catholic schools is that same sex parents cannot model behaviors and attitudes regarding marriage and sexual morality consistent with essential components of the Church's teachings.\n\nDouglas told KCTC she and other parishioners support the archdiocese. If people have feelings they certainly can voice them. There's no gag order … but that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to change anything, Douglas said.\n\nI would be completely respectful of Archbishop Naumann, Douglas added.
Oscar voters finally gave Scarlett Johansson the nomination she's been waiting for. Despite being one of the world's highest paid actresses, Johansson had never been nominated for an Oscar—until now.\n\n\n\nThe 35-year-old scored double during Monday's Academy Awards announcement, with two coveted nominations: Best supporting actress for her role in Jojo Rabbit and best actress for her performance in Marriage Story.\n\n\n\nThe first-time Oscar nominee was snubbed at last week's Golden Globes ceremony, where she was nominated for best actress in a motion picture.\n\nJohansson was nominated alongside Golden Globe winner Renée Zellweger in the leading actress category, which also saw nominations for British actress Cynthia Erivo, Charlize Theron and Saoirse Ronan.\n\nJohansson's Marriage Story co-star, Laura Dern, joins her in the supporting actress category, which included nominations for Kathy Bates, Florence Pugh and Margot Robbie.\n\nThe Oscar nods also place Johansson in an elite group of actors who have earned two different acting nominations in the same year. Though Academy rules state actors cannot be nominated twice within the same category, they can be nominated for best supporting actor and best actor in the same year. Cate Blanchett was previously the most recent actress to achieve this rare feat. Back in 2007, Blanchett was nominated for her roles in I'm Not There and Elizabeth: The Golden Age.\n\nThe 92nd Academy Awards will air live February 9 on ABC.
Los Angeles — The 77th annual Golden Globes will be held Sunday — and Netflix could be the biggest winner. The streaming service leads the award show's nominations with 34 across the film and television categories.\n\nNetflix's divorce drama Marriage Story came out on top with six nods, and its mobster film The Irishman has five. Both are up against 1917, Joker and The Two Popes in the best drama category.\n\nComedian Ricky Gervais will host the telecast starting at 8 p.m. ET. Entertainment Tonight will cover the fashion, winners and parties all night long.\n\nHow to watch the Golden Globes\n\nWhat : The 77th annual Golden Globe Awards\n\n: The 77th annual Golden Globe Awards Date : Sunday, January 5\n\n: Sunday, January 5 Time : 8 p.m. ET\n\n: 8 p.m. ET Location : The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California\n\n: The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California Online stream : fuboTV (get a free trial)\n\n: fuboTV (get a free trial) On TV : NBC\n\n: NBC Host : Ricky Gervais\n\n: Ricky Gervais Live updates: CBSNews.com live blog coverage as winners are announced\n\nWe are seeing a big shift in the culture of award shows right now because Netflix, Amazon, the streaming services, even Apple TV dominated the award show circuit and in particular the Golden Globe nominations this year, said Angelique Jackson of Variety magazine.\n\nAbsent from the nominations are women directors and screenwriters. Those categories did not have any female nominees.\n\nAva DuVernay was the last female director to be nominated for a Golden Globe in 2015 for Selma. Barbra Streisand's 1984 win makes her the only woman to win a Golden Globe for directing.\n\nAs we saw ... with Natalie Portman calling out the Golden Globes for only nominating male directors when she presented in the category, it kind of remains to be seen what, if anything, will be said, Jackson said.\n\nAnd when it comes to Golden Globe history, Awkwafina could make it. She's the projected front-runner for best actress in a musical or comedy movie for her role in The Farewell.\n\nIf she wins, she'll be the first Asian woman to do so. There's also lots of buzz around Jennifer Lopez, who's nominated for best supporting actress in a movie for Hustlers.\n\nShe's been a perennial presenter for the show, so it stands to reason that she will take home that Golden Globe statue on Sunday, Jackson said. Lopez was last nominated for a Golden Globe in 1998 for Selena.
Cameron Diaz wants everyone to know exactly how happily she's married.\n\nShe's so happily married, in fact, that her marriage to rocker Benji Madden makes her forget all her previous relationships, she explained to Andy Cohen during a Sirius XM radio interview set to air Friday.\n\nNothing matters now that I have my husband. I don't even remember any of that. Like, that's the thing, that's how I know he's my husband because no one compares, Diaz said, according to People magazine.\n\nDiaz married Madden in an intimate ceremony at their home in January 2015.\n\nEverything else just kind of, like, washes and slips away, she said. You realize, like, 'Oh right, this is what the real thing is, this is what real love is and this is what commitment and devotion is.' This is the person that you build your life with, and for me, it's like the rest of everything else just kind of like dissolves.
Two newborn babies delivered just hours apart at a South Carolina hospital may have romance, or at least a good story to tell, in their futures. The baby boy is named Romeo and the little girl is — you guessed it — Juliet.\n\nRomeo Hernandez, born on Sunday at 2:06 p.m. Cassie Clayshulte Photography\n\nThe two sets of parents found out about the striking coincidence thanks to a tip from Coastal Carolina Hospital's resident photographer, Cassie Clayshulte. The babies were born on Sunday and Monday in neighboring rooms at the hospital in Hardeeville, South Carolina.\n\nIt was just a coincidence. They were both actually scheduled to be induced on March 26, but they both came early which is so neat, Clayshulte told CBS News. It just shows even more that it's fate — they just happened to be in the room next to each other.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Morgan and Edwin Hernandez welcomed their son Romeo into the world. Eighteen hours later, Christiana and Allan Shifflett welcomed their baby girl named Juliet.\n\nBoth parents had picked the names out early on in their pregnancies, and neither couple knew each other until they met that day, Clayshulte said.\n\nClayshulte said she was talking to Romeo's parents about doing a possible photoshoot when something clicked. Quickly, the photographer excused herself from the room and ran to the nurses' station to double check another patient's name, and realized it was true: a baby girl who was born earlier that day was named Juliet.\n\nSo Clayshulte returned to the Hernandez's room to share the news, and see if they would consider allowing Romeo to be photographed with the infant girl, as long as Juliet's parents agreed, of course.\n\nJuliet Shifflett, born on Monday at 8:14 a.m. Cassie Clayshulte Photography\n\nJuliet's mom, Christiana, just had a C-section so she wasn't able to leave the room, but said her mother would be happy to wheel Juliet into the strangers' room for a picture.\n\nAs soon as Clayshulte entered Romeo's room with Juliet, the jokes began to flow.\n\nWe've already made jokes they need an arranged marriage, Clayshulte said. I had told them that if they want to book me now as their wedding photographer they could do that.\n\nClayshulte snapped a few photos and returned later to the parents' room to show them her work.\n\nThey both cried, Clayshulte said.They just loved them.\n\nThe internet loved them, too.\n\nClayshulte posted the photos of the star crossed babies on her Facebook page and they quickly received thousands of likes.\n\nIt was meant to be, one Facebook user wrote.\n\nClayshulte said she hopes to reunite the babies in the near future.\n\nIt's just so neat, I might try to plan a shoot for these babies together again, she said.
New Yorkers looking to tie the knot while the state is under lockdown now have the option of getting married via video conference. During his daily coronavirus briefing, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Saturday he is issuing an executive order that will allow clerks to perform marriage services over video conferencing software.\n\nCuomo also stated couples in the state will now be able to obtain marriage licenses remotely.\n\nNEW: I am issuing an Executive Order allowing New Yorkers to obtain a marriage license remotely and allowing clerks to perform ceremonies via video conference. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) April 18, 2020\n\nAs CBS New York reports, the executive order temporarily suspends a provision of the law that requires in-person visits.\n\nThe announcement was met with considerable push back, however. The action that has caused me the most amount of grief is what I said about marriages, Cuomo said during his Sunday presser. I said yesterday no one has any excuses anymore.\n\nYou lose your possible wedding excuses. There's no excuses anymore. I got all sorts of bad ugly comments with that, he added.\n\nPrior to Cuomo's announcement, many marriage bureaus were closed or unable to issue licenses in the state.
NEW DELHI -- When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive in India on what's being called their most ambitious tour to date, they'll encounter starry-eyed giddiness along with a hint of nostalgia harkening to a 1992 visit by Princess Diana.\n\nPrince William's mother created a firestorm of attention when she posed alone in front of the Taj Mahal, the marble mausoleum known as a monument to love because it was built by a Mughal emperor to entomb his beloved wife.\n\nNewspaper headlines crowed suggestions that Diana was delivering a hidden message about the end of her marriage to Prince Charles. And the photo, as well as her close relationship with Mother Teresa, helped make Diana hugely popular in the country.\n\nIndia, despite its fractious past in the British Empire, has always loved reading about the British royals, especially the duke and duchess. Their young children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, will not join the trip, which begins Sunday in Mumbai.\n\nLocal media are speculating on what the Duchess of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton, will wear: the work of local designers, perhaps an Indian outfit to cope with the sizzling April heat?\n\nThere will be a lot of interest and a lot of coverage, but it's mostly going to be about pretty people and pretty pictures, media analyst and columnist Santosh Desai said.\n\nPhotos, photos and more photos. It'll be silly to think that there will be any deeper significance to the visit, said Shailaja Bajpai, media critic with the Indian Express newspaper.\n\nBut high-level visits create equally high expectations for economic ties and cultural exchanges. The two allies share their imperial history and India inherited the British judicial and parliamentary systems, along with a vast railway network. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron has visited India twice.\n\nRoyal visits improve atmospherics, leading to better political and economic ties, said former Indian Ambassador to Germany and France, T.C.A. Rangachari. Such visits also provide an opportunity to the royalty to familiarize themselves with a vast country like India.\n\nCelebrities including cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and Bollywood actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are attending a grand ball with the royal couple in Mumbai on Sunday night.\n\nWilliam and Kate are also expected to visit the Taj Palace hotel targeted in a 2008 attack on the city. In New Delhi, they have a scheduled lunch with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nIn a nod to William's conservation efforts, the couple will visit Kaziranga National Park in Assam state that has two-thirds of the world's population of Indian one-horned rhinos as well as endangered swamp deer.\n\nThey then will visit Bhutan at the invitation of the Himalayan kingdom's King Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck and Queen Jetsun Pema.\n\nThey plan to wind up the South Asian tour with a closely watched visit of the Taj Mahal.\n\nHe feels incredibly lucky to visit a place where his mother's memory is kept alive by so many who travel there, the Cambridges' communications secretary Jason Knauf told reporters. It's unclear if they will pose for photos at the same bench where his mother was pictured smiling shyly for the camera.
A federal appeals court has blessed AT&T's takeover of Time Warner, defeating the Trump administration by affirming that the $81 billion merger won't harm consumers or competition in the booming pay-TV market.\n\nThe ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington came Tuesday in the high-stakes competition case, approving one of the biggest media marriages ever.\n\nIt was already completed last spring soon after a federal trial judge approved it, as phone and pay TV giant AT&T absorbed Time Warner, the owner of CNN, HBO, the Warner Bros. movie studio, Game of Thrones, coveted sports programming and other must-see shows.\n\nMany observers had expected the decision favorable to AT&T from the three-judge appeals court panel. The decision was unanimous to uphold the trial judge's June ruling. Opposing the merger forced the Justice Department to argue against standing legal doctrine that favors mergers among companies that don't compete directly with each other, what's known as a vertical merger.\n\nThe U.S. antitrust lawsuit against Dallas-based AT&T marked the first time in decades that the government has challenged that doctrine by suing to block a vertical merger.\n\nThe appeals court judges said U.S. District Judge Richard Leon was correct to dismiss the government's argument that AT&T's takeover of Time Warner would hurt competition, limit choices and jack up prices for consumers to watch TV and movies.\n\nThe government failed to meet its burden of proof for its theory that costs for Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting content would increase after the merger, mainly through threats of programming blackouts, the judges wrote. The Turner networks include CNN.\n\nThe Justice Department antitrust attorneys had asserted that Leon misunderstood the complexities of the TV industry and the nature of AT&T's competitors.\n\nThe idea behind the merger was to help AT&T — which claims about 25 million of the 90 million U.S. households that are pay TV customers — compete better with online rivals like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu.\n\nAT&T already had a streaming service, DirecTV Now, but it launched a cheaper offering called WatchTV soon after the deal closed. It's planning another streaming service, WarnerMedia, for later this year.\n\nThe merger of these innovative companies has already yielded significant consumer benefits, and it will continue to do so for years to come, AT&T General Counsel David McAtee said in a statement. While we respect the important role that the U.S. Department of Justice plays in the merger review process, we trust that today's [decision] will end this litigation.\n\nThe ruling dealt a major setback to the Trump Justice Department. If the government decided to appeal the ruling, the next step likely would be the Supreme Court, and it wasn't clear whether Justice planned to do so.\n\nThere's about a 50 percent chance of the government taking it to the high court — and scant prospects of it winning there, said Matthew Cantor, an attorney focusing on telecom antitrust matters at Constantine Cannon in New York.\n\nThe Justice Department appears committed to pursuing the long-shot bid against the merger, rather than considering conditions that could have been imposed on AT&T by the trial court to make the deal more acceptable. The head of Justice's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, doesn't like merger conditions requiring regulators to keep an eye on the combined company's conduct for years after.\n\nBut politics and presidential influence also could be a factor, Cantor suggested. When the deal was first made public in October 2016, it drew fire from then-candidate Donald Trump, who promised to kill it because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. Trump as president has publicly feuded with Time Warner's CNN, calling it failing and a purveyor of fake news, and suspending one of its correspondents from the White House.\n\nIt seems to me that political considerations played into this, Cantor said. It's odd that the Justice Department has gone after this merger as its principal merger case. ... This was a very tough case. It's very hard to challenge a vertical merger.\n\nThe case could affect future antitrust regulation. It underscores that the government should look at vertical mergers more critically, particularly when the companies combining are already in industries that have few competitors, said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.\n\nThere has been a rush of deal-making in the cable, entertainment and telecom industries over the last few years, and Leon's ruling opened the doors for more efforts.\n\nJust a day after his decision, Comcast jumped back into a bidding war with Disney for most of 21st Century Fox's TV and movie businesses. Disney eventually won, and Comcast bought British broadcaster Sky instead.\n\nIn other deal activity, wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile also are attempting to combine. The Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission are still reviewing that deal, which is not a vertical merger. Sprint and T-Mobile are direct competitors.
It's a picture fit for a Christmas card: Mother, Father and twin 6-year-old sons out walking in a new fallen snow! But if you look closely, that Dad cutting down his own Christmas Tree and hauling it to the car just happens to be a man whose voice you are probably very familiar with: none other than James Taylor.\n\nCBS Sunday Morning correspondent Rita Braver told Taylor that she was surprised to see how domestic he is these days and asked him if he was a little surprised by that, too.\n\nNot really. I mean, I can stay here for days on end and not leave the place and find things to do.\n\nOne of the things he's found to do, Braver tells us, is work on One Man Band, his new CD and DVD collection, recorded at the historic Colonial Theatre in his home town of Pittsfield, Mass. He's accompanied by pianist Larry Golding, with an occasional assist - via video - from the Boston Symphony Orchestra Chorus.\n\nBut most of the time, it's just Taylor on the stage alone.\n\nIs it a little bit scary, Braver asked him. I mean, it's just you out there basically.\n\nI'm used to that, Taylor said. You definitely have to be fresh, you have to be up for it, because there's nothing to hide behind really.\n\nJames Taylor doesn't have to hide behind anything. His music has endured for years. He's had 40 gold, platinum and diamond albums, sold more than 40 million records, won five Grammys, and been inducted into both the Rock and Roll AND Songwriters Halls of Fame.\n\nBraver asked Taylor if he remembered when it was that he first fell in love with music, with writing, performing and singing.\n\nI believe I was six-years-old, he told her, and I remember singing the title song to 'Oklahoma!' My grandmother was in the house at the time and I woke her up doing this, he said laughing, I was terribly embarrassed, but I do remember the moment!\n\nJames Taylor grew up in North Carolina with three brothers and a sister - who all became musicians. His dad was a doctor and a scientist, but his mom ...\n\nShe had studied at the New England Conservatory to be a singer, so maybe that's the genetic connection, I don't know.\n\nTaylor calls Something in the Way She Moves, composed in 1965, the first presentable song he ever wrote. By then, he'd dropped out of school, was living in London and had a chance to audition for the Beatles, who were starting a new record label.\n\nThey liked it. And I was given the green light; I was the first person signed. It was just - it was one of those big break situations. A door opened. The rest of my life was on the other side of the door, it was just amazing.\n\nIn fact, that first album didn't sell well. But with the Beatles cachet, he got a second album and Sweet Baby James took off.\n\nThe title song he says was actually written for his nephew, but it's since become so strongly identified with him. Braver asked Taylor if he liked that.\n\nYeah, I do, he told her, The album was my first big success. So yeah, I'm known as Sweet Baby James still.\n\nYou say that songwriting is a source of joy and deep frustration for you, both those things, Braver asked him, How so?\n\nIt's the best feeling you can get when it connects, when the pieces fall together and the puzzle is solved in a way. And it's also a process that's not under my control, really.\n\nSomething else that got out of control for Taylor in the old days was his drug use.\n\nYeah, well, you know, I was a functional addict for a long time, he admitted, but I came out of it luckily. After 17 or 18 years as an active addict, I came out of it in 1983 with my health. I did some damage in the personal relationships that I had, but generally speaking, I got away pretty clean.\n\nOne of his most famous songs, Fire and Rain, was written in part about his struggles with depression and drugs.\n\nTaylor was able to joke about his drug-using days at a recent benefit performance with Carol King at the famed Troubadour in Los Angeles.\n\nWe played here in the early '70s, Carol and me.\n\nKing was a well-known songwriter who also played in Taylor's band, but she credits him with launching her performing career.\n\nIt was like, 'I want you to go sing Up On The Roof tonight,' King told Braver, which I normally played backup for him. He was very assertive about that.\n\nHe was also assertive about wanting to perform a song she wrote, You've Got a Friend.\n\nI didn't realize at the time that I'd be playing it every single night for the rest of my life, Taylor said with a big laugh.\n\nWatching you together, Braver said to both Taylor and King, there seemed to be so much magic. It made me wonder like, was she ever your girlfriend?\n\nNo, you know, we never got there, Taylor answered with a smile, it never came along to ruin everything, you know. That's the secret of our success, I think.\n\nTaylor did fall in love with and marry another famous singer-songwriter, Carly Simon. They made beautiful music and had two children together, but their marriage of more than ten years came to an end in 1983.\n\nTaylor married and divorced again, but he says it is his current wife of six years, Kim Smedvig, a former publicist with the Boston Symphony, that has brought joy into his life.\n\nI was a mean old man, you know, Taylor said, referencing a line in one of his songs, and the love that's in my life today has turned me around, it's changing who I am. You can change people. Unconditional love on a daily basis, it can melt a frozen stone. It can do it.\n\nWhen you look back at some of the songs that you wrote as such a young man, Braver asked Taylor, you were a boy, really.\n\nYes, I was a kid.\n\nDo you marvel at that now? she asked him.\n\nWell, you know, I don't mean to compare myself to Mozart or Alexander Pope, but you know, people do good work young. It's like, Pow! Steamroller, Zam! Sweet Baby James. You know, they just land intact.\n\nThese days, along with his chores as a dad, Taylor is writing new material for a future album. And though he still may fret a bit about whether his Christmas tree is straight, life is pretty perfect for James Taylor. His 2006 release, James Taylor at Christmas, was just nominated for a Grammy, and he thinks he's figured out how to balance home and work.\n\nI feel as though it's taken a long time for me to get it right, to get the mix right, Taylor told Braver. It's a really, really great time, a great stretch.
Barbara Bush, former first lady of George H.W. Bush, died Tuesday at 92. The couple's love story spanned nearly eight decades. When asked what the secret to their enduring love was, Barbara said it was keeping a sense of humor.\n\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce met in 1941 at a school dance. He was 17. She was just 16. He told a friend she was the most beautiful girl on the dance floor. Barbara was just 19 when she married her Navy pilot, home on leave from World War II, reports CBS News' Jim Axelrod.\n\nI married the first man I ever kissed, Barbara used to say. When I tell this to my children, they just about throw up.\n\nAnd while they did their best to keep pace with modern life over the next 73 years, the two remained an old-fashioned love story.\n\nI fell in love with him practically at first sight, probably. Went home and told my mother about him. She should have been the head of the CIA. She knew everything about him the next morning. But he's just a – he's a very giving, he's never once said 'no' to me, Barbara said.\n\nThe two exchanged love letters throughout their relationship. They shared one from 1943 on The Oprah Winfrey Show.\n\nI love you, precious, with all my heart and to know you love me, means my life. How often have I thought about the immeasurable joy that will be ours someday. How lucky our children will be to have a mother like you, George read aloud. I still feel the same way.\n\nThey were married longer than any couple in presidential history. At times, Barbara polled 40 points higher than her husband, and she used her capital to support him – fiercely.\n\nYou make me feel wonderful, but then I always feel wonderful when I get to talk about the strongest, the most decent, the most caring, the wisest, yes, and the healthiest man I know, she said at the 1992 Republican National Convention.\n\nTheir six kids produced the widest range of parental emotions imaginable: watching one son become president, another the governor of Florida, and burying a daughter, Robin, who died of leukemia at the age of three. Through it all, Poppy and Bar – as they called each other – celebrated and endured together.\n\nThe way I describe it is they can be at a dinner table. And they can look at each other and they're talking to one another without saying a word, their son, Jeb Bush, once said. That's what happens when you're--\n\nWhen you're in love, Barbara finished.\n\nBarbara watched her husband's back, kept his feet firmly planted on the ground, and even to the very end of their long, loving marriage made sure to hold his hand.\n\n\n\nThat love letter George shared with Oprah was written to his then-fiancé on the same day that their engagement announcement was published in the newspaper. In it, the former president also writes Bar, you have made my life full of everything I could ever dream of – my complete happiness should be a token of my love for you.
BRUNSWICK, Fla. -- A Georgia man intentionally left his toddler son to die in a hot SUV as he sought to escape the responsibilities of family life and focus on sexual liaisons with prostitutes and young women - even teenagers - he met online, a prosecutor told jurors as the father's murder trial opened Monday.\n\nProsecutors say Justin Ross Harris intentionally killed the boy by leaving him for hours in a vehicle parked outside the father's metro Atlanta workplace in June 2014. Cobb County prosecutor Chuck Boring said Harris killed his son in one of the most unimaginable, horrible ways and didn't show emotion after the death.\n\nComplete coverage: WGCL Atlanta reports on Harris murder trial\n\n\n\nBoring said Harris shed not a tear when he was being questioned by police after his son died, and complained to officers.\n\nIs he screaming, 'Can I see my son? What is going on here?' Boring said. No. He complains that it's hot in the back of the patrol car.\n\nBoring said that minutes before Harris left 22-month-old Cooper in the car, he sent an online message saying, I love my son and all, but we both need escapes.\n\nProsecutors contend Harris was unhappy in his marriage, sought relationships with other women and had researched websites promoting a child-free lifestyle. Harris, prosecutors say, saw his son as an obstacle to the lifestyle he wanted.\n\nAttorneys for Harris, who moved to Georgia from Alabama in 2012, say the death was a tragic accident. Harris told police he watched cartoons with his son that morning, took him to breakfast at a Chick-fil-A restaurant and kissed Cooper while strapping him into his car seat. But Harris said he forgot to drop his son off at day care and drove to work, forgetting the boy was in the back seat.\n\nBoring told the jury Harris' account doesn't make sense. He said the restaurant is just over half a mile from the Home Depot office where Harris worked as a computer technician, and Harris parked his SUV by backing up between two vehicles - which would have required looking over his shoulder toward the backseat where his son sat.\n\nLater that day, Harris opened his vehicle to toss in a bag of lightbulbs he bought during his lunch break, Boring said. After leaving work, he drove a few miles to a shopping center without stopping, the prosecutor said, though police later reported the SUV reeked from sweat, a dirty diaper, the smell of death.\n\nThe facts of this case only make sense if the defendant had planned on intentionally killing his son, Boring said.\n\nBoring said on the day Cooper died, his father sent more than 30 messages on his phone mostly to women, mostly about sex.\n\nThe month before his son died, Boring said, Harris met a prostitute for sex at a hotel. He had also been trying to persuade an underage, 17-year-old girl to send him a photo of her genitals. Harris was also charged for sending the girl sexually explicit text messages and photos.\n\nHe faces life in prison if he's convicted of murder. Prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty. The case drew national attention and was so closely followed in Harris' suburban home of Cobb County that a judge moved the trial 275 miles to Brunswick, on the Georgia coast.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Mary Staley Clark recessed court late Monday afternoon following a 90-minute delay in the proceedings after prosecutors gave an outline of their case to the jury. She said attorneys for Harris will have their turn Tuesday morning.\n\nThe judge did not give the reason for the delay.\n\nSixteen total jurors - eight men and eight women - were seated Monday morning to hear the case. Four of them will serve as alternate jurors, who will have a final say in the trial only if one more of the 12 main jurors are dismissed. The judge did not specify which jury members were alternates.
MUMBAI -- An Indian man missing for 40 years was to be reunited with his family on Thursday after a YouTube video of him singing a popular Hindi film song went viral. Khomdram Gambhir Singh was 26 when in 1978 he left his home in Imphal, in the remote northeastern state of Manipur, and never returned, according to reports.\n\nFor four decades his family heard nothing. Then a clip showing a grey-bearded man singing a Bollywood song on a Mumbai street 2,000 miles away appeared online.\n\nIn it the singer identifies himself as Khomdram Singh of Manipur. A viewer brought the video to the attention of a local association in Imphal who informed Gambhir's family.\n\nThey recognised him as their missing relative and contacted Imphal police who spoke to their counterparts in Mumbai. Officers then tracked Gambhir down to the suburb of Bandra where he was living rough.\n\n.@AngellicAribam tweeted video of a stranded man in Bandra to @MumbaiPolice While we secured him, @SamarendraAtom tweeted & identified him as Khomdram Singh from Manipur,missing since 40 yrs! Our Twitter team coordinated b/w Bandra & Patsoi Pstn to reunite Mr Singh with family 😊 pic.twitter.com/9zZhOmZF3p — Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) April 16, 2018\n\nHe was making money as a beggar signing old Hindi songs, Firoze Shakir, who shot the video and uploaded it to YouTube in October last year, told AFP.\n\nShakir, a street photographer, said Gambhir, now 66, had told him that he had been a construction labourer but had suffered a couple of accidents and turned to drink.\n\nShakir used to see him around a lot so one day decided to film him singing. The video has been viewed 55,000 times and has helped trace the missing man.\n\nThis is something that has happened accidentally but I am hoping this video touches hearts, Shakir told AFP.\n\nOn Wednesday Imphal officers flew to Mumbai to take Gambhir back to his family. They departed Mumbai on Thursday and were due to arrive in Imphal in the afternoon.\n\nThe Times of India reported that Gambhir, an ex-army officer, had separated from his wife following a brief marriage shortly before he left Imphal.\n\nThis story is a ray of hope. If a video can change a man's life there can be no bigger miracle than this, said Shakir.
Sally Quinn made history as the first woman to anchor a CBS News morning show in August 1973. After she left CBS, Quinn returned to a successful print career at the Washington Post, where she met her late husband, Ben Bradlee. He was the Post's legendary editor during the Watergate era.\n\nQuinn's new book, Finding Magic: A Spiritual Memoir, details her marriage to Bradlee and other defining moments that shaped her beliefs. Quinn joined CBS This Morning to discuss her life and journey to finding spirituality.\n\nWhen I started writing this book it was because I had been an atheist and started a religion website for the Washington Post which, already was sort of a weird combination. And I started studying religion and it became clear to me that all religion was magic, Quinn said.\n\nQuinn says she became an atheist after seeing photos her father had taken during World War II. She said I couldn't believe that God had let this happen.\n\nThat magic and all of the things that go along with magic are just another name for what faith you might have, Quinn said. They're all just as legitimate as the others.
Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, of Iowa, denied allegations leveled by her ex-husband that she had an affair with a subordinate while she served in the military. In divorce documents, she also accused her husband of physically assaulting her during an argument when she confronted him about an affair in 2007 or 2008, before she was elected to the Senate.\n\nAnd in her first interview since the details of her divorce were divulged, Ernst, the fourth-ranking Senate Republican, also told Bloomberg News that she had been raped in college by someone she knew, making her one of the highest-profile women in her party to allege assaults in the era of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe Iowa Republican answered questions from reporters about the divorce allegations on Wednesday at a town hall at the University of Northern Iowa campus in Cedar Falls, the Des Moines Register reported.\n\nIn the court documents, Ernst's ex-husband, Gail Ernst, accused her of having an affair with one of her soldiers while she was deployed as a company commander. She denied the allegation, telling Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs that she had become close to the soldier when he helped her while she was gravely ill, but there was no affair. She told reporters Wednesday that she cares about all of my soldiers.\n\nErnst also accused her ex-husband in divorce documents of having several affairs during their marriage and physically assaulting her during an argument over a woman she accused him of seeing. Ernst told Jacobs that her husband grabbed me by the throat with his hands and threw me on the landing floor. Then, he pounded my head...on the landing. It was very sudden and very violent, Ernst said.\n\nGail Ernst denied in court documents that he had an affair, but the abuse allegations were not addressed. A working phone number for him could not be found, and his attorney on Tuesday declined to comment. The Ernsts' divorce papers were made public once their divorce was finalized this month. They have since mostly been resealed at Sen. Ernst's request. She said Wednesday at the Iowa event that she believed the court documents would be sealed from the public and was caught off guard by news reports on the allegations.\n\nIn an emotional interview with the Des Moines Register, Ernst said she has always been a strong supporter of survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. She said people will now likely view that work as coming from not just a lawmaker but also a survivor of abuse.\n\nWhat I want to remind everybody is that I'm still the same person I was a week ago, she said, her voice breaking as she sought to hold back tears. The only difference is that you know more about me now than you did a week ago.\n\nErnst, 48, plans to run for a second six-year Senate term in 2020.
WorldView: U.S. drone strikes against Taliban, Putin banning gay marriage The U.S. launched defensive strikes against the Taliban in Afghanistan, just days after signing a peace accord; the International Olympic Committee insists the Tokyo Games are on schedule despite coronavirus concerns; and Russian President Vladimir Putin is proposing a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. CBS News' Rylee Carlson rounds up world headlines from London.
OCEAN CITY, N.J. -- A New Jersey man's wedding anniversary was made even more meaningful after his missing ring was found in Ocean City by a woman and her son.\n\nCBS Philadelphia reports Mickey Walsh was vacationing near the beach with his family on Aug. 13, 2016, when a wave knocked the symbolism of his marriage right off his finger.\n\nI was playing in the waves and I noticed it was off my hand, Walsh said. I always take it off when I go into the ocean. For whatever reason, I didn't do it that time. I pretty much thought it was a lost cause.\n\nIt took a year for the ocean's current to carry the ring north. Last Thursday, 11-year-old Daniel Barr spotted the ring on the beach. The discovery spawned an all-out search for the owner.\n\nHe even walked up and down asking if anyone lost a ring, said Kristen Barr, who helped her son in the search.\n\nThe pair wrote a Facebook post that reads in part: My son found this men's wedding band today 8/17/17. Between 7th & 8th Street beach in OCNJ. No inscription inside or outside. Please help us find the owner. Every share helps. Thank you!\n\nDays after the post made the rounds on Facebook, Walsh's wife spotted the post and immediately contacted her husband.\n\nI was at work and my wife texted me (saying), 'Hey I think someone found your ring,' Walsh recounted.\n\nWalsh said he didn't believe that it was possible for the ring to be his.\n\nBarr says she took the ring to a jeweler in Ocean City where they examined its size, material and worth.\n\nWe gave her all the info that we could remember about the ring, said Walsh.\n\nAnd sure enough, it was a match.\n\nHis wife actually saw the Facebook post from a friend's post, Barr said. (She) saw it and immediately contacted me through Facebook. She sent me photos and sure enough, they were a match. She even knew the correct ring size and all.\n\nOn Monday night, Barr and her son met Walsh to return the ring.\n\nRight away, they just seemed like great people, willing to go through all that trouble, said Walsh.\n\nI'm extremely proud of my son for going above and beyond to find the owner, Barr said. It felt really nice to be able to return something that has so much sentimental value to the owner.\n\nShe says her son is also proud of himself.\n\nThe discovery of the ring couldn't have come at a more perfect time.\n\nWalsh celebrated his 9-year wedding anniversary on Tuesday.
After an unorthodox drive-thru convention on Saturday, ex-Liberty University employee Bob Good claimed victory against Congressman Denver Riggleman. Riggleman is the third House incumbent to fall in their primary this cycle, as Good received 58% of the approximately 2,537 delegates who voted, beating the incumbent by about 500 votes.\n\nIn his first interview since the nominating convention, Riggleman told CBS News he is weighing the options on whether to challenge the results of what he called a rigged convention process.\n\nAt some point, we really have to look at how these votes were actually counted and what the processes were, Riggleman said. For only 2,500 people to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of people like this is really egregious.\n\nIn response to Riggleman's earlier claims of an improper election, Good responded that's what losers say when the results were called early Sunday morning.\n\nFacebook\n\nSaturday's convention was held in the parking lot of Tree of Life Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, where registered delegates went through three steps and voted in their cars. Riggleman's team appealed the convention's location, noting the close proximity to Good's homebase. But the district's committee rejected it, and Melvin Adams, the district's Republican committee chair, noted it was a location that has been used for a convention before.\n\nRiggleman said he'll be taking the next couple of days to decide his next steps, and has not endorsed or conceded to Good. A campaign staffer said there have been calls for him to run as an independent from all over the district and the state, but no final decision has been made yet.\n\nI'm new to politics, but I'm not new to life. And I know corruption when I see it. We fought against that pretty hard and to see how this ended in really a rigged convention, that was ludicrous, Riggleman told CBS News.\n\nRiggleman claimed Good had campaign staffers on the district committee that pushed for a convention over a primary. Adams said that while it is necessary for committee members to disclose any affiliations to a campaign, it does not require them to recuse themselves from committee votes.\n\nThere are so many nuances, 'if you're going to restrict this then what about that?' By the time you get done, well, then all the members of committees have to be detached from any campaigns or any active political engagement. That's counter productive, he told CBS News.\n\nRiggleman won this seat in 2018 and had the endorsement of President Trump, who won the district by double digits in 2016. But he came close to being censured after he officiated a gay wedding between two former campaign volunteers.\n\nGood used this issue of marriage equality, as well as abortion and immigration, to paint Riggleman as out of line with conservatives in the district. Good did not respond to CBS News for a comment on this story.\n\nDemocrats have argued that Good's lack of name recognition, low fundraising numbers and views on social issues have put this district more at play. Riggleman agreed, and said Good's hardline stances hurts any efforts to broaden the tent of the Republican party.\n\nI'm the only one who can win this district for the Republicans. The president knew that and a lot of other people knew that, too. Good's just completely out of touch with the fifth district. he said. We want a Republican Party that stays out of our business, out of our pocketbooks, but also out of our bedrooms.\n\nFour Democrats will be in the primary for this seat that will be held on June 23: Entrepreneur and past 2018 primary candidate R.D. Huffstetler, local school board member John Lesinski, veteran Claire Russo and healthy policy instructor at the University of Virginia Cameron Webb. The last Democrat to win this seat was Tom S.P. Perriello in 2008.\n\nWhether Good's name will be on the November ballot is in the air, as it was revealed Friday afternoon he had not submitted the correct paperwork in time. The state's Republican party sent a letter to their Board of Elections asking for an extension to be granted for Good's case, as well as candidate Nick Freitas in Virginia's 7th.\n\nGood's campaign said they were able to file the correct forms in the 10-day grace period and were confident they'd be on the ballot, though the State Board of Elections will make an ultimate call on the extension on July 7.
King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his consort, General Suthida Vajiralongkorn, named Queen Suthida, attend their wedding ceremony in Bangkok, Thailand, May 1, 2019. HANDOUT/REUTERS\n\nBangkok -- Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has appointed his consort as the country's queen ahead of his official coronation on Saturday. An announcement Wednesday in the Royal Gazette said Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya was legally married to the 66-year-old king, and was now Queen Suthida.\n\nAlthough she has been in the public eye for about three years, there has been little official information released about her and the news was a surprise to many Thais. She is reported to be 40 years old and to have previously worked as a flight attendant for Thai Airways International. The two reportedly met on a flight.\n\nSuthida joined the palace guard in 2013 and became commander of the king's security unit, currently holding a general's rank. The new queen also has several top royal decorations.\n\nVajiralongkorn has had three previous marriages and divorced his previous wife, with whom he has a son, in 2014. He became king after the death in October 2016 of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\nThai television, which broadcast the royal order Wednesday evening, showed a video of Suthida prostrating herself before the king. According to the announcer, she presented the king with a tray of flowers and joss sticks, and in return was bestowed traditional gifts associated with royal power.\n\nTV showed the king in a white uniform and his bride in a pink silk traditional dress formally registering their marriage on Wednesday in his palace residence in Bangkok. The couple was seen signing a marriage certificate book, which was also signed by the king's sister, Princess Sirindhorn, and Privy Council head Prem Tinsulanonda as witnesses. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and other senior officials were also in attendance.\n\nThailand is ruled by a military government and the royal family still wields significant influence as an embodiment of power.\n\nInsulting the monarch, queen or heir apparent is punishable by three to 15 years in prison under Thai law. In practice, however, the rules are more widely interpreted, and the military government has been criticized for its frequent use of the law to silence critics since it seized power in May 2014.\n\nThe lese majeste law has been widely condemned, including by rights groups and the United Nations, which has called for it to be revoked. Some 100 cases of lese majeste have been prosecuted since the 2014 coup, according to the legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.
A gay French writer has lifted the lid on what he calls one of the world's largest gay communities, the Vatican, estimating that most of its prelates are homosexually inclined and attributing much of the current crisis in the Catholic Church to an internal struggle.\n\nIn the explosive book, In the Closet of the Vatican, author Frederic Martel describes a gay subculture at the Vatican and calls out the hypocrisy of Catholic bishops and cardinals who in public denounce homosexuality but in private lead double lives.\n\nAside from the subject matter, the book is astonishing for the access Martel had to the inner sanctum of the Holy See. Martel writes that he spent four years researching it in 30 countries, including weeks at a time living inside the Vatican walls. He says the doors were opened by a key Vatican gatekeeper and friend of Pope Francis who was the subject of the pontiff's famous remark about gay priests, Who am I to judge?\n\nIn an interview Friday in a Paris hotel, Martel said he didn't tell his subjects he was writing about homosexuality in the Vatican. But he said it should have been obvious to them since he is a gay man who was researching the inner world of the Vatican and has written about homosexuality before. He said it was easier for him, as a gay foreigner, to gain the trust of those inside the Vatican than it would have been for an Italian journalist or Vatican expert.\n\nIf you're heterosexual it's even harder. You don't have the codes, he told The Associated Press. If you're a woman, even more so.\n\nFrench writer Frederic Martel gestures during an interview with Associated Press, in Paris, Friday. Thibault Camus / AP\n\nMartel says he conducted nearly 1,500 in-person interviews with 41 cardinals, 52 bishops or monsignors, and 45 Vatican and foreign ambassadors, many of whom are quoted at length and in on-the-record interviews that he says were recorded. Martel said he was assisted by 80 researchers, translators, fixers and local journalists, as well as a team of 15 lawyers. The 555-page book is being published simultaneously in eight languages in 20 countries, many bearing the title Sodom.\n\nThe Vatican didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMartel appears to want to bolster Francis' efforts at reforming the Vatican by discrediting his biggest critics and removing the secrecy and scandal that surrounds homosexuality in the church. Church doctrine holds that gays are to be treated with respect and dignity, but that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\n\nFrancis knows that he has to move on the church's stance, and that he will only be able to do this at the cost of a ruthless battle against all those who use sexual morality and homophobia to conceal their own hypocrisies and double lives, Martel writes.\n\nBut the book's Feb. 21 publication date coincides with the start of Francis' summit of church leaders on preventing the sexual abuse of minors, a crisis that is undermining his papacy. The book isn't about abuse, but the timing of its release could fuel the narrative, embraced by conservatives and rejected by the gay community, that the abuse scandal has been caused by homosexuals in the priesthood.\n\nMartel is quick to separate the two issues. But he echoes the analysis of the late abuse researcher and psychotherapist A.W. Richard Sipe that the hidden sex lives of priests has created a culture of secrecy that allowed the abuse of minors to flourish. According to that argument, since many prelates in positions of authority have their own hidden sexual skeletons, they have no interest in denouncing the criminal pedophiles in their midst lest their own secrets be revealed.\n\nIt's a problem that it's coming out at the same time (as the summit), Martel acknowledged in the AP interview, adding that the book was finished last year but its release was delayed for translation. But at the same time it's, alas, the key to the problem. It's both not the subject, and the subject.\n\nThe Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of Building a Bridge about how the Catholic Church should reach out more to the LGBT community, said that based on the excerpts he had read, Martel's book makes a convincing case that in the Vatican many priests bishops and even cardinals are gay, and that some of them are sexually active.\n\nBut Martin added that the book's sarcastic tone belies its fatal flaw. His extensive research is buried under so much gossip and innuendo that it makes it difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction.\n\nThere are many gay priests, bishops and cardinals in ministry today in the church, Martin said. But most of them are, like their straight counterparts, remaining faithful to a life of chastity and celibacy.\n\nIn the course of his research, Martel said he came to several conclusions about the reality of the Holy See that he calls the rules, chief among them that the more obviously gay the priest, bishop or cardinal, the more vehement his anti-gay rhetoric.\n\nMartel says his aim is not to out living prelates, though he makes some strong insinuations about those who are in the parish, a euphemism he learns is code for gay clergy.\n\nMartin said Martel traffics in some of the worst gay stereotypes by using sarcastic and derogatory terms, such as when he writes of Francis' plight: Francis is said to be 'among the wolves.' It's not quite true: he's among the queens.\n\nMartel moves from one scandal to another — from the current one over ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington to the priest-friendly gay migrant prostitute scene near Rome's train station. He traces the reasons behind Pope Benedict XVI's resignation, and devotes a whole chapter to the cover-up of the Mexican founder of the Legion of Christ, the pedophile Rev. Marcial Maciel. In each, Martel parses the scandal through the lens of the gay-friendly or homophobic prelates he says were involved.\n\nEqual parts investigative journalism and salacious gossip, Martel paints a picture of an institution almost at war with itself, rife with rumor and with leaders struggling to rationalize their own sexual appetites and orientations with official church teachings that require chastity and its unofficial tradition of hostility toward gays.\n\nNever, perhaps, have the appearances of an institution been so deceptive, Martel writes. Equally deceptive are the pronouncements about celibacy and the vows of chastity that conceal a completely different reality.\n\nMartel is not a household name in France, but is known in the French LGBT community as an advocate for gay rights. Those familiar with his work view it as rigorous, notably his 90-minute weekly show on public radio station France Culture called Soft Power. Recent episodes include investigations into global digital investment and the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nAs a French government adviser in the 1990s, he played a prominent role in legislation allowing civil unions, which not only allowed gay couples to formalize their relationships and share assets, but also proved hugely popular among heterosexual French couples increasingly skeptical of marriage.\n\nHis nonfiction books include a treatise on homosexuality in France over the past 50 years called The Pink and the Black (a sendup of Stendhal's classic The Red and the Black), as well as an investigation of the internet industry and a study of culture in the United States.\n\nMartel attributes the high percentage of gays in the clergy to the fact that up until the homosexual liberation of the 1970s, gay Catholic men had few options. So these pariahs became initiates and made a strength of a weakness, he writes. That analysis helps explain the dramatic fall in vocations in recent decades, as gay Catholic men now have other options, not least to live their lives openly, even in marriage.\n\nMartel said no special interests financed the book, other than his advance from the publisher.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are now officially the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, following a royal wedding watched by millions around the world. About 600 wedding guests were at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, and 200 will stay to join them to party into the night.\n\nCBS News had extensive live coverage of the royal wedding between Prince Harry and the American actress starting at 4 a.m. ET (9 a.m. GMT) on Saturday, May 19. CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King and Entertainment Tonight co-host Kevin Frazier anchored the coverage from Windsor Castle, which was televised and streamed live on CBSN, and you can watch the entire ceremony in the video player at the top of the page.\n\nIn addition to the morning broadcast, CBS News presented a two-hour primetime special called Royal Romance: The Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle -- recapped the events of the day and take viewers into the modern marriage and its impact on the monarchy. Watch the special in the video player below:\n\nHow did Prince Harry and Meghan meet?\n\nThe couple was set up on a blind date by an unnamed mutual friend in July 2016. It was through her and then we met once, then twice, back-to-back -- two dates in London last July, Harry said in a BBC interview after their engagement in November 2017. Then it was I think three, maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to come join me in Botswana and we camped out together under the stars for five days.\n\nHow old are Prince Harry and the Duchess?\n\n\n\nPrince Harry is 33 years old. Meghan is 36 years old.
College decision day is May 1, which means that students -- and their parents -- have less than two weeks to commit to an institution of higher learning. A major part of that is figuring out which college makes the best financial sense.\n\nUnfortunately, the financial aid letters sent by colleges to accepted students aren't always clear, and it can be all too easy to make a financial misstep. While the U.S. Department of Education has developed a financial aid shopping sheet that aims to standardize the format of financial aid letters, not all colleges have adopted it. (The education department says 2,900 institutions are using it, which represents about 62 percent of degree-granting two- and four-year colleges.)\n\nThe first thing you have to understand is that there will be variance between colleges' financial aid letters, said Kevin Fudge, government relations and community affairs manager for the non-profit American Student Assistance, who describes himself as a loan doctor practicing preventative medicine.\n\nIn evaluating the offers, Fudge said, Treat it like a private good. It's a consumer purchase. You have to shift your mentality about 'How do I make the best decision.'\n\nThe letters will spell out the cost of attendance, which should break out the cost of tuition, room and board and books and supplies (but sometimes don't include other costs, such as travel.) The letter will also include the expected family contribution, or EFC, which is broken down between what a student and their parents are expected to pay out of pocket.\n\nYet another section will detail the grants, scholarships and loans that have been given to the student or which they can apply for to pay for their attendance.\n\nThat might not sound too bad, but within that format can be a great deal of missing or confusing information. The details can be overwhelming and leave families missing the big financial picture.\n\nRead on for five pitfalls to avoid when evaluating financial aid letters.\n\nSkipping over what you can actually pay.Start the process by determining what your family or student can actually afford to pay, Fudge said. Ideally, this calculation should be made before reading the financial aid letter, because it will help students and their parents set limits. When [families] do the calculation and they see the out-of-pocket cost, they can say, 'It's out of our range,' or, 'Do we want to borrow loans to make up the difference?', Fudge said.\n\nLosing sight of the four-year commitment. The financial aid letter details the costs and aid for just one year. That means whatever costs are detailed in the letter should be multiplied by four. Suddenly, that $10,000 loan ends up being much bigger -- and costlier -- than you might have imagined. Along those lines, families with more than one child should keep their future college costs in mind, Fudge said.\n\nFailing to ask questions. Some financial aid letters will leave out some costs, such as the cost of a student's transportation between home and campus at the start and end of the school year. Other letters may be unclear about whether a scholarship or grant is a lump-sum payment, or whether it will renew every year for four years. Make sure to contact the school to ask for clarification if anything is unclear. Financial aid offices are making an attempt to be more customer friendly, Fudge said.\n\nIgnoring the Parent PLUS red flag. One major red flag is if a college includes Parent PLUS loans on the student's financial aid letter, Fudge said. That's because a Parent PLUS loan is a federal program that allows for unlimited borrowing for parents to pay for their kids' college educations. It's not truly financial aid, and can end up misleading a family about their total costs. It's morally indefensible to put a PLUS loan in a financial aid letter, Fudge said.\n\nGetting into a locked in mindset. First, remember that parents can ask financial aid offices to reevaluate their offer, which may be effective if the family has suffered a change of fortune, such as a job loss or a death of a parent. Secondly, be willing to walk away, Fudge said. People have this at-all-costs mentality, but this is where people get into trouble, he said. While your student may want to go the college of their dreams, it's also important to set them up for a financially stable life in their 20s, he added.\n\nLastly, remember that students can transfer if the costs are too high. When you are in a hole, stop digging, Fudge said. People feel like it's a marriage, but you have no obligation to the school. I admire your loyalty, but it's okay to jump ship and go to a different school.
Actor and comedian David Cross has been a fixture in TV and film for more than 25 years. But through all the acting opportunities he's had, Cross stayed connected to the creative outlet that first got him noticed: stand-up.\n\nIt's an outlet that began for him when he was searching for his voice as a kid in an Atlanta suburb and dealing with being abandoned by his father, who left the family when Cross was a teenager.\n\nHe revealed in an interview with CBS News' Jamie Wax that he still harbors a fear that one day he'll do the same to his own daughter.\n\nI know what I and my sisters went through and my mom and I'll be real honest with you, it worried me… what if there's that thing in me? What if it's a gene? What if it's the thing that let my dad just abandon us? Cross said.\n\nCross has even thought about how he'd grapple with the concept in his craft. He's scripted out a scene in his head, perhaps for a future film or TV project, where a father rationalizes his decision to leave his family behind.\n\nI've always imagined this. I want to put a scene in something where my dad just sort of rationalized it, and went, 'You know what? I honestly did think I wanted to have kids and be married, but now I know I don't. I don't. So anyway, I'm gonna take off,' Cross said. What if there's that ability to rationalize that thought? What if I had that thing in me?\n\nIt's something that Cross finds himself worrying about now.\n\nAnd it really scared me and I try not to let on at all. I don't even think of – I don't know that I've talked about it except here, he said. And I still don't know if, you know, she's gonna be six or seven and I'm gonna be like, 'eh.'\n\nEven so, Cross acknowledges there were gifts, like his introduction to comedy, that he received from his father.\n\nHe turned me on to Abbott and Costello and the Marx brothers, Cross said. He loved comedy.\n\nNow, Cross is passing on that love of comedy to his daughter, taking her on tour around the world.\n\nHe also talked about a member of his chosen family – longtime comedy partner Bob Odenkirk. Their show,Mr. Show with Bob and David, put Cross on the national stage and propelled Odenkirk's career.\n\nLike Cross, Odenkirk has had tremendous success individually, like his acclaimed turns in Breaking Bad, and its hit spinoff, Better Call Saul. The solo triumphs haven't taken away from the fact that Bob and David remain uniquely connected. They've compared their relationship as a comedy team to a marriage.\n\n\n\nYeah, in the same way that Naomi and -- I my wife and I – it's always kind of fresh. It almost feels like the first moment when we first met is happening still. And I think David and I have the same thing, Odenkirk said. He's funnier than me. And I am funny, but he's funnier than me.
Another young marriage bites the dust.\n\nTeen Mom 2 star Kailyn Lowry confirmed to the Daily Mail that she is divorcing her husband of two years, Javi Morroquin. Lowry was running errands in suburban Delaware when she was asked by the newspaper for an update.\n\nYes, it's true, Lowry said. We're trying to do the best we can for our kids because they are what really matters.\n\nLowry and Morroquin, who appear on the current season of the long-running MTV series, were married in September 2013 and welcomed their son, Lincoln, shortly after. Lowry also has a 6-year-old son with ex-boyfriend Jo Rivera.
Only on CBS This Morning, Oprah Winfrey is revealing her latest book club pick: An American Marriage. As Tayari Jones' fourth novel, the work of fiction is being described as a love story warped by racial injustice.\n\nWinfrey said she discovered the book after much, much, much searching.\n\nI have to tell you, it is intriguing. It's a love story that also has a huge layer of suspense. And it's also so current and so really now that I could not put it down and I've already passed it on to lots of my friends and so I know – certainly believe – that you're gonna love it, Winfrey said.\n\nJones, who said receiving the call from Winfrey was the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me in my life, said she was trying to write a novel that was timely and dealing with the issues of the day. She happened upon a couple at a mall in Atlanta who sparked her inspiration.\n\nThey were obviously in love and in trouble, Jones said Tuesday on CBS This Morning. The woman was beautifully dressed, she said, but the man just looked like he had had a long day – perhaps even a long life even though they are the same age.\n\nTayari Jones CBS News\n\nShe said, 'Roy, you know you wouldn't have waited on me for seven years.' And I was intrigued because I didn't know Roy, but I felt fairly confident that he wouldn't wait on her for seven years. But he said, 'What are you talking about? This wouldn't have happened to you in the first place,' Jones recounted.\n\nIn her novel, Jones chronicles the story of newlyweds Celestial and Roy. Eighteen months into their marriage, Roy is arrested for a crime does not commit.\n\nHe is given a lengthy sentence that's over 10 times the time they've been married. But they are married. And so the question is, can this marriage survive? Even if this marriage doesn't survive, can this relationship survive? Then can this man survive? Jones said.\n\nYou can use these discussion questions to guide you through the book:\n\nThe title of this novel is An American Marriage. Do you feel this title accurately represents the novel? Why or why not? And if you do find the title appropriate, what about the story makes it particularly American? When Celestial asks Roy if he would have waited for her for more than five years, he doesn't answer her question but reminds her that, as a woman, she would not have been imprisoned in the first place. Do you feel that his response is valid, and do you think it justifies his infidelity? Do you believe that he would have remained faithful if Celestial had been the one incarcerated? Does this really matter, and, if so, why? In her Dear John letter to Roy, Celestial says, I will continue to support you, but not as your wife. What do you think she means by this statement? Do you feel that Roy is wrong to reject her offer? You may not have noticed that Tayari Jones does not specify the race of the woman who accuses Roy of rape. How did you picture this woman? What difference does the race of this woman make in the way you understand the novel's storyline? Andre insists that he doesn't owe Roy an apology for the way his relationship with Celestial changed. Do you agree? Why or why not? There are two father figures in Roy's life: Big Roy is the one who shepherded him into adulthood and helped him grow into a responsible, capable person, but Walter is the one who taught Roy how to survive. Do you feel these men deserve equal credit? If not, which was the more important figure in Roy's life and why? Big Roy explains that he and Olive never had children of their own because Olive feared that he would not love Roy as much if he has is own children. Do you feel she should have had the right to make that decision? And do you feel she was right in making that decision? When Roy is released from prison, he first goes to his childhood home and almost immediately makes a connection with Davina. Do you feel that given the tenuous relationship he has with Celestial—who is still legally his wife—he is cheating? Why or why not? And when Roy announces to Davina his intention to return to his wife, do you feel that her anger is justified? Roy is hurt when Celestial, in discussing her career as an artist, doesn't mention him or the role he played in giving her the encouragement and freedom to follow her dreams, but Walter argues that she is justified in her silence. Do you agree? Do you think her silence is due to shame, or is she just being practical in how she presents herself to advance her career? It is obvious that Andre is different from Roy in many ways. Do you feel that ultimately he is a better match for Celestial? If so, why? Also, why do you think Celestial and Andre decide against formally marrying? Do you think that as a couple they will be good and nurturing parents? Do you feel that as a couple, they will be better at parenting than Celestial and Roy would have been? If so, why? Do you think that Andre strategized to get Celestial to fall in love with him, or did it happen naturally? Do you feel that it was a surprise to them that it happened after all those years? Do you predict that Celestial's parents will come to accept Andre as her life partner? Toward the end of the novel, Celestial does a complete about-face and returns to Roy? What do you think her emotions were in coming to that decision? Do you feel that it was the right decision?\n\nOther Oprah's Book Club authors:
NEW YORK -- Designers Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig are two fashion swans worthy of the red carpet gowns they create for A-list stars. So exactly how will their dramatic luxury brand, Marchesa, fare in the onslaught of sexual abuse claims against Chapman's disgraced husband, Harvey Weinstein?\n\nChapman took what some believed was her only brand-saving leap Tuesday as allegations against Weinstein mounted, breaking her silence when she told People she was leaving the film mogul she married in 2007. The divorce revelation, following Weinstein's remarks last week that she was standing by her man, came as some on social media called for a Marchesa boycott.\n\nMy heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time, Chapman said in her statement.\n\nMarchesa did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\n\nAs fashion fairytales go, this one is a classic - for Chapman and Weinstein, to be sure, but also for Chapman and Craig. The pair has been best friends since they met as teens in a life drawing class nearly a quarter century ago at the Chelsea College of Art & Design in London, Elle magazine wrote in 2011.\n\nThe Marchesa origin story reads like this: The 41-year-old Chapman was an actress working as a costume designer in 2003 when she was spotted at a party in one of her own designs by the late fashion magazine editor and muse Isabella Blow, who urged her to focus on the art of evening dressing. Chapman and Craig were already considering a company of their own at the time, founding the brand in 2004, the year Chapman met Weinstein at a party in New York City.\n\nThough they didn't date at first, the blog Jezebel noted Chapman's coming out on the arm of Weinstein at the 2005 Golden Globe Awards. Marchesa had already dressed Renee Zellweger for the UK premiere of Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason in 2004 and Cate Blanchett at the premiere of The Aviator, executive produced by Weinstein, that same year.\n\nAt the 2005 Globes, Diane Kruger wore Marchesa. She was starring in National Treasure, produced by Disney, Miramax's parent company at the time, Jezebel reported.\n\nWeinstein and Chapman have two small children, ages 7 and 4. After their marriage, they presided as a Hollywood power couple as Marchesa continued to feast on the fruits of Weinstein's celebrity connections. The axis on red carpets has continued through the years.\n\nMarketing researcher Robert Passikoff, president of the New York-based consultancy Brand Keys, said only time will tell exactly how Marchesa does in the Weinstein fallout, especially among non-famous consumers as opposed to red carpet stars.\n\nWhen the house is still burning people comment about the flames and the smoke, he said. A month later, when people are just looking at the ashes, they tend to forget about these things.\n\nOn the backs of celebrities, will craftsmanship win out over Weinstein influence-peddling that helped put Marchesa in the limelight? Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have lined up with numerous other women to allege mistreatment, first reported Thursday by The New York Times.\n\nHe may have been the doorway in but the fact is the clothes make the women, Passikoff said. It's ultimately how the designers behave in this situation that will have a greater effect than all of the stuff that he did.\n\nChapman's move toward divorce will speak volumes in that regard.
CAMDEN, Maine -- Don McLean's wife was granted a temporary order of protection from the American Pie singer after she cited a pattern of abuse going back three decades.\n\nPolice in Maine arrested McLean on a misdemeanor domestic-violence charge on Monday, and court records show that his wife then filed a handwritten request for protection.\n\nSinger Don McLean pictured in a mushot WGME\n\nPatrisha McLean wrote that in the early years of their marriage, McLean's rage was unfathomably deep and scary. She said McLean's abuse often left her bruised, and that she feared for her life when she called 911 from the bathroom of their Camden home this week. Don terrorized me for four hours, until the 911 call that I think might have saved my life, she wrote.\n\nDon McLean issued a statement on Thursday on his website and social media saying the nearly-30-year relationship is experiencing a very painful breakdown. He also said he is not a villain and that it is an emotional time for his family.\n\nI may never recover from this but I will try and hope to continue to entertain you all as I always have, and I hope people will realize that this will all be resolved but I hope I will not be judged in this frantic media environment, he wrote.\n\nMcLean was released on bail and is due in court Feb. 22. His attorney, Walter McKee, said McLean will plead not guilty when the case returns to court. He also said McLean vigorously denies his wife's allegations.\n\nOur hearts are broken and we must carry on.

PHOENIX -- A fourth professional found fatally shot in a three-day span has been identified by Arizona detectives as a 72-year-old counselor and life coach, but authorities were not immediately linking his death to that of the other three. Police in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale said Sunday that Marshall Levine was found shot inside an office building shortly after midnight Saturday.\n\nThe Arizona Republic reported Levine worked as a hypnotherapist and life coach. He also provided marriage and divorce counseling.\n\nOn Thursday, Dr. Steven Pitt, a prominent forensic psychiatrist who assisted in high-profile murder cases including the JonBenet Ramsey mystery in Colorado, and a notorious Phoenix serial killer investigation, was found dead near Scottsdale. Witnesses reported hearing a loud argument and gunfire outside Pitt's office.\n\nPolice said the killings Friday of paralegals Veleria Sharp, 48, and Laura Anderson, 49, were related to the Pitt shooting, but were still trying to determine exactly what linked the three victims.\n\nWe don't know the relationships or the connections, said Sgt. Ben Hoster.\n\nPolice say Marshall Levine, 72, was found deceased in his office by an acquaintance. Courtesy: Psychology Today\n\nHow, or if, Levine's death also had ties to the killings of the two women and Pitt was still being investigated, Scottsdale police told The Republic.\n\nSgt. Hoster told CBS 5 that the police were encouraging folks to go back to work, but we're telling them to remain vigilant.\n\nPhoenix police released a sketch of the suspect who they say shot and killed Dr. Steven Pitt. Phoenix Police Department\n\nPhoenix police say Pitt's killer was described as a bald man wearing a dark-colored hat with a short brim. Police released a sketch of the suspect in the three killings.\n\nSharp and Anderson were shot Friday inside a law office. Police say one of the women managed to walk to an intersection to seek help despite a gunshot wound to her head. She was taken to a hospital where she died.\n\nOfficers followed a blood trail back to the office and found the other woman. She was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHoster said there was no indication that family members of the victims were in danger.\n\nWe're asking the public to remain vigilant and to call us if they notice anything out of the ordinary, Hoster said.\n\nIn the Levine case, Scottsdale police received a call Saturday about a man found fatally shot inside an office. Hoster did not identify the caller but said the person knew the victim.\n\nThe killing occurred in an office park that houses mostly therapists and counselors.\n\nOn Sunday, CBS 5 in Phoenix reported that the shootings have caused fear in the local family law and counselling community, with some lawyers hiring private security guards to work in their offices.\n\nPitt, 59, assisted in the investigation of the 1996 death of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, who was found dead at her home in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nA decade later, he helped Phoenix police in the Baseline Killer investigation as they sought a man who was later convicted of killing nine people.\n\nThe website of Burt/Feldman/Grenier, the law firm that employed Sharp and Anderson, says it practices divorce, child support and other aspects of family law litigation and mediation.
Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex: Their relationship in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\nHarpo Productions/Joe Pugliese In March 2021, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, sat down for an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired Sunday. March 7, on CBS. The royal pair broke with generations of tradition when they stepped away from The Firm, as the British monarchy is informally known, and announced they would forge their own professional paths across the pond. Since their first public outing as a couple, Meghan and Harry have steadily made headlines, and not just for their very public wedding in 2018. Here's a look at their most memorable moments so far — and some of the decisions that set them apart from typical royals.\n\nAn early outing Danny Lawson/Getty Images Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced they were a couple in 2016. Here, they watch Wheelchair Tennis at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSealed in wax Frank Augstein/AP On November 27, 2017, the royal family announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018. Britain reacted accordingly. Here, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are on display as wax figures at Madame Tussauds in London, May 9, 2018.\n\nReady the royal tchotchkes CBS News Britain, and the world, got ready for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and American Meghan Markle with a slew of collectibles, plastering their faces on mugs and other objects.\n\nRoyal titles as gifts Owen Humphreys/AFP/Getty Images Ahead of their wedding, Queen Elizabeth II bestowed new titles upon Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. They quickly made it clear that they would break from royal tradition in many ways; instead of mainly using children from the royal family as bridesmaids and page boys, the couple said those roles would be filled by the children of Meghan and Harry's closest friends.\n\nBreaking new ground WPA Pool/Getty Images In marrying Harry, Meghan became the first woman of mixed-race heritage to join the royal family. Here, Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his new wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, leave from the West Door of St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on May 19, 2018, in Windsor, England.\n\nKeeping some tradition Steve Parsons/Getty Images In preparation for the wedding, in March 2018, Meghan was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England at St. James's Palace. Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorcees since 2002.\n\nGetting social AP During their first official visit to Scotland, the couple stopped at the Social Bite, an Edinburgh cafe that supports the homeless, on February 13, 2018.\n\nBreaking another tradition Chris Jackson/Getty Images This off-the-shoulder dress made news on June 9, 2018, when Harry and Meghan attended the annual Trooping The Colour celebration on the Mall in London. According to some British outlets, such a revealing look is technically a no-no for royals.\n\nEverybody on the balcony Chris Jackson/Getty Images This shot marks Meghan's second appearance on the storied balcony at Buckingham Palace. The occasion: the centenary of the Royal Air Force on July 10, 2018 in London. Cramming onto the balcony along with them were Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who, technically, was on maternity leave.\n\nFirst visit to Ireland Chris Jackson/Getty Images Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, meet Walter Cullen, 3, during their visit to Dublin, Ireland on July 11, 2018.\n\nPulling back? Joe Giddens/Getty Images In August 2018, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attended the wedding of Harry's childhood friend, Charlie van Straubenzee, and Daisy Jenks. Around that time, stress from relentless press coverage reportedly spurred the royal couple to pull back somewhat from the spotlight.\n\nGreeting a cast Dan Charity/Getty Images Meghan and Harry meet the cast and crew of Hamilton backstage after the gala performance at Victoria Palace Theatre on August 29, 2018, in London.\n\nMeeting some kids Kirsty Wigglesworth/Getty Images Two days after they announced Meghan's first pregnancy, Meghan and Harry made this public appearance.

An estimated 6 million Americans live with Alzheimer's disease, but a survey from UsAgainstAlzheimer's shows more than 50 percent of couples dealing with the condition have not discussed their wishes related to having another relationship. This was highlighted when the husband of lifestyle expert B. Smith revealed he was in a second relationship while he cared for her.\n\nFor CBS News' Barry Petersen, his relationship with Alzheimer's is personal. Fourteen years ago, his late wife, Jan, was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's. During part of that time, he also had another woman in his life. They called themselves a family of three.\n\nThe parallels to Smith, her husband Dan Gasby, and his girlfriend are uncanny. It's an all-too-common tale for couples battling Alzheimer's – one where love can be complex and unconventional.\n\nSmith, who rose to fame as a model, lifestyle guru and restaurateur, developed early onset Alzheimer's six years ago. Today, husband Gasby is caring for his wife of 27 years.\n\nWhen B. and I realized what we're dealing with and she understood what the situation is, she said to me… 'I know what I have. I know where it's gonna take me. Tell the story. Tell the truth,' Gasby recounted.\n\nIn January, he spoke that truth — and let cameras into his home. It's a home he shares with his wife and his girlfriend, Alex Lerner, who also has a bedroom in the house and helps with B.'s care.\n\nIf you wanted to have a relationship, Alex, you could've chosen a lot easier paths, Petersen said.\n\nThat's true, Lerner said with a laugh.\n\nWhy this one?\n\nI met Dan when he was pretty much at his lowest. I remember going through a time in my life where I felt that way, where I was — where I was pretty much at my lowest. And I saw the pain in his eyes, I did. And I reached out, and I thought, maybe this man just needs somebody to talk to. You know? Or as humans, sometimes we just need a hug.\n\nIt was natural. It was organic. It was not intentional, but we fell into each other, Gasby said.\n\nDoes she still know who you are? Petersen asked Gasby.\n\nShe will call me dad. She will call me her brother Gary or her brother Ron… Then she'll say Dan out of nowhere, and then I say, 'Who?' 'Dan, he's over there,' he responded. There may be something in her mind that says that, but then it's gone… It's like trying to drink water from a colander. No matter how much you bring it to you, there's nothing there.\n\nIt's something Petersen himself experienced with his wife, Jan. After almost 25 years together, Jan was in assisted living and could no longer remember his name. That's when Petersen met Mary Nell Wolff, who became Jan's friend.\n\nIt broke my heart that a man who could love this woman so much couldn't remember — she could not remember who he was, Wolff said.\n\nA year and a half after Jan passed away, Wolff and Petersen got married.\n\nThe hardest thing, for me, is people who don't know but decide that they can judge what I'm doing, Petersen said.\n\nPlease. I mean, we've got the 800-pound gorilla in the room. She's white, and I'm black, Gasby said, referring to Lerner and himself.\n\nSo many people jump to conclusions and judgment, that don't even understand what Alzheimer's is, and what it does to a person, to the patient, the Alzheimer's patient, as well as the caregivers, Lerner said.\n\nGreg O'Brien has early onset Alzheimer's. A lifelong journalist, he's written a book about being embedded in Alzheimer's.\n\nI so respect what you're saying... and respect you guys and what you're going through, because it's a definition of – of – of love and… nobody understands what a caregiver goes through, O'Brien said.\n\nHe and his wife Mary Catherine raised three kids over their 42-year marriage. She's gone from wife to caregiver.\n\nPeople think that caregiving is a daytime event, Petersen said. It's an all-night event. How do you sleep? How do you recharge? How do you rest?\n\nI say one eye open and one ear open, Gasby said. Lerner agreed. I live in a nightmare and a daymare… Everything I have to do is to mitigate her everyday irrationality — because she doesn't have that ability — maintain her dignity, and try to keep my sanity.\n\nThis disease robs everything, O'Brien said. It robs your brain, slowly, like a sliver every day… My brain is like an iPhone now. It's still a sophisticated device but it has a short-term battery, it pocket-dials, and it gets lost very easily.\n\nI try to say to people who have been critical of our relationship, you are one diagnosis away from knowing what your life will be, Wolff said.\n\nIn our situation, even though Greg is still very functioning — we were the house that had the Super Bowl parties and the Patriots and the Red Sox, we were the house that everybody came to, Mary Catherine said. I mean, we just did 30, 40 people summertime deck parties. He can't do that anymore. And so our social life has really narrowed down to our very, very closest friends,\n\nAnd people run away from you, Gasby said.\n\nWhat do you want for Mary Catherine in the future? Petersen asked O'Brien.\n\nI want her to be happy. I want her to marry a better person than me… And I want her to be at peace… I just don't want her to marry someone who's handsome. That's it, O'Brien said, as the group laughed.\n\nWhat you said, Greg, is what my wife said to me: 'I want you to go on' because if you truly love someone, you don't own them, Gasby said. And what you said is the true, to me, expression of love.\n\nSo Greg asked if we would, now that we know you, if we would watch out for you. And the answer's yes, Petersen said.\n\nResoundingly yes, Gasby said.\n\nThank you, Mary Catherine said, tearing up. That was so meaningful.\n\nThe question is: When do you have the talk about another relationship? The answer is when you're young and healthy, because once the person you love has been diagnosed with a disease like Alzheimer's, it's already too late.

Their marriage wasn't perfect before the couple started working from home amid the shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic, but the underlying problems bubbled dangerously close to the surface with their forced isolation and constant contact, the wife told CBS News.\n\nLike millions of other Americans, the couple has been forced into this situation because of the pandemic sweeping the country. Non-essential workers are working from home, or have been furloughed or laid off, and the ripple effects can be seen in millions of unemployment claims filed over the past month.\n\nThe couple has been married for a few years, and spending so much time together with their active toddler these past few weeks has put them both on edge, she said. The wife was previously in an abusive relationship, and she said she now recognizes the red flags that have recently emerged in her marriage. She requested anonymity due to concerns about her personal safety.\n\nI closed my office and have been working from home, so we can't really go anywhere to get away from each other. When we argue, we can't cool off or escape for a day, the wife told CBS News.\n\nShe thinks her current husband has been verbally abusive in the past, but said she had found ways to excuse his behavior. Now the intensity of their arguments has been rising.\n\nWe're all living in a pressure cooker with economic tension, physical restriction within our homes, and fear everywhere, she said.\n\nShe said the couple recently got into what seemed to be a minor spat, but it ended with the husband becoming physically abusive. The wife said she felt trapped. She said she used the skills gained from her last marriage to deescalate the situation, but now she feels as if she is walking on eggshells. She has made a few emergency escape plans, but now, she doesn't have access to a counselor.\n\nShe said her biggest fear is being trapped in her house with her husband for an undefined period of time. Even though public health officials recommend remaining indoors as much as possible, she's trying to spend more time out of the house.\n\nIt's a harm reduction decision at this point, she said.\n\nAmericans have been told that staying home is the safest option. But for domestic violence victims, that can be a trap.\n\nDomestic violence is rooted in power and control, and I don't think there's been another time in our lived history when any of us have felt more of a lack of control, said Barbara Paradiso, the director of the Center on Domestic Violence at the University of Colorado Denver, in an interview with CBS News.\n\nDomestic violence is a hidden threat in American life, lurking behind closed doors and affecting people of all ages. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in four women and nearly one in 10 men experience sexual violence, physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetimes. Intimate partner violence affects 12 million people a year.\n\nStay-at-home orders have been implemented in over 40 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia to stop the spread of coronavirus. But what may be safe practice for society as a whole can be dangerous for domestic violence victims. These stay-at-home orders make it more difficult to call domestic violence hotlines without being overheard, or visit shelters undetected.\n\nSome regions are seeing spikes in domestic violence complaints and requests for shelter. Houston police chief Art Acevedo said last week that domestic violence calls were up 6% in the city the month of March. Two-thirds of police calls in Minnesota the first two days after its stay-at-home order was issued were domestic violence-related, Governor Tim Walz said last month. Domestic violence calls to the Phoenix Police Department in Arizona between March 20 and 27 were up 21% compared to the same week in 2019.\n\nHowever, some areas are instead seeing a drop-off in domestic violence calls, as victims holed up with their abusers become more isolated. According to the Seattle Times, phone calls made to New Beginnings, a Seattle-based nonprofit with a domestic violence hotline, decreased in March.\n\nChristina So, the communications director for the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said in an interview with CBS News that the hotline has not seen an increase in calls from victims in recent weeks.\n\nHistorically, with other disasters like the 2008 economic downturn and Hurricane Katrina, we see a spike in contact volume once things go back to normal, So said.\n\nSo said that hotline workers were already beginning to hear accounts from survivors about how the pandemic is worsening the situation at home. Some have reported that abusers are taking the opportunity to prevent them from spending time with their children.\n\nSo said some callers said abusers were trying to gaslight them into believing that they were going to spread the virus, or that the virus doesn't exist. Others are withholding items like hand sanitizer, or preventing victims from seeking medical treatment.\n\nIf you think about how isolated a lot of folks who aren't even experiencing domestic violence are feeling right now — that isolation is just amplified for a domestic violence survivor, So said.\n\nBeing forced to stay home with abusers may have long-lasting effects not just on victims, but also children present in the house.\n\nThere is a likelihood that primary and secondary victims — so a victim and their children — will experience trauma, and then have that trauma to deal with as they move into the future, Paradiso, from the University of Colorado Denver, said. The school's Center on Domestic Violence helps provide resources for K-12 schools to support students who may have unsafe home situations and Paradiso said that despite school closures, the center is still working with schools to provide resources for children.\n\nTakisha Richardson, an attorney at the firm Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll in Florida who represents domestic violence victims, noted that children are often able to escape domestic violence by going to school, and raise awareness about their home situation to trusted adults. The same is true of adult victims who may find relief and support at work.\n\nMost of those calls or cries for help don't come when the survivor is at home, Richardson said.\n\nThe situation is dire for domestic violence victims, but that doesn't mean that they are totally without assistance.\n\nSafe Horizon, a victim assistance nonprofit in New York City, continues to operate its hotline, as well as its eight domestic violence shelters in all five boroughs. Maureen Curtis, the vice president of criminal justice and court programs at Safe Horizon, said that several initiatives are operating remotely.\n\nSafe Horizon has advocates working with the New York Police Department and in family courts in the city to assist victims navigating the criminal justice system.\n\nEven though we're working remotely, because of our years of working with the police, years of working in the family and criminal courts, we not only have the knowledge but we have relationships with people in these systems, Curtis said.\n\nThe New York City Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender-based Violence (ENDGBV) is also still in operation. Family justice centers operated by the office are closed, but victims can still reach out to these centers remotely and be connected with resources across the city.\n\nOur Centers continue to provide crucial crisis support and advocacy by connecting survivors to immediate safety planning, shelter assistance, legal consultations, and more, ENDGBV Commissioner Cecile Noel told CBS News in a statement.\n\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline is available 24/7 for victims across the country, and can help connect callers to local resources. If people are unable to speak safely, they can chat with an advocate online on the hotline's website or text LOVEIS to 22522.\n\nBut the onus to take action should not rest solely on the victim.\n\nAs a society, no matter how far we've come in understanding domestic violence and being more aware, we still judge and blame survivors every day for the decisions that they make, Curtis said. In a time of unprecedented stress and trauma, it's important to support survivors of domestic violence in any way possible.\n\nMembers of the community can keep an eye out for potential victims, and pay attention to whether a situation seems dangerous for a neighbor or friend.\n\nIt would be wonderful for people to realize that there is potential danger for their neighbors, Paradiso said. She urged victims to trust their instincts and not be afraid to reach out for help.\n\nRichardson also advocated for a policy of see something, say something.\n\nWhen you suspect something is happening, you might be the difference between saving someone's life and them ending up dead, Richardson said. She noted that stay-at-home orders don't prevent people from making runs to the grocery store, and suggested that victims try to visit shelters or make calls to hotlines while conducting necessary errands if they are able.\n\nIf a person specifically knows that their friend or family member is experiencing domestic violence, it is important to reach out to them, So said.\n\nIsolation is one of the strongest tactics an abuser can use, so it's really important to build community around a survivor, So said. For people who know and care about survivors, now is a really good time to connect with them.\n\nResources for domestic violence survivors
Recently, while President Trump was talking law and order, first lady Melania Trump was tweeting about healing & peace. And back in April, when Mr. Trump declined to wear a face mask (It's voluntary, you don't have to do it. ... I don't think I'm going to be doing it), his wife put one on, and urged others to do the same (to keep us all safe).\n\nIt's not exactly a palace coup, and some might say not nearly enough to keep her husband's more controversial actions in check. But either way, according to a new book, Melania Trump has more influence than you might think.\n\nIn The Art of Her Deal, Washington Post correspondent Mary Jordan explores the life of the first lady and her surprising role as one of the most influential voices in the Trump White House. CBS News\n\nCorrespondent Tracy Smith said, This is very different than the narrative that some people have painted that she is trapped.\n\nOh, ho! Makes her crazy to say she's 'Poor Melania Trump'; she's not, said Pulitzer Prize-winner Mary Jordan. She is smart, independent. She will decide what she wants to do and what she doesn't wanna do.\n\nJordan is the author of The Art of Her Deal, published by Simon & Schuster (a ViacomCBS company).\n\nSimon & Schuster\n\nJordan, a Washington Post correspondent, asked to interview her for this book. The response? Basically, no reply. The Trumps, both of them, make people who are around them sign non-disclosure agreements. They also, I quickly learned, told people that knew Melania when she was young, when she was a model, to not talk.\n\nThe White House dismisses the book as fiction. But Jordan said that, after several years and more than a hundred interviews, a clearer picture emerged or a woman who grew up dreaming of a life far away from her native Sevnica, Slovenia.\n\nShe's a girl who grew up in a really small town and couldn't wait to get out, Jordan said. She told everyone that. I mean, everyone I talked to in Slovenia said, 'She couldn't wait to get out of this town. She wanted to be where the action is.'\n\nAt first, young Melania wanted to study architecture, but she was persuaded that modeling was a better option, and she found success doing mostly print work in Europe and, later, in New York City.\n\nSome of Melania Knauss' early modeling shots. CBS News\n\nShe met Donald Trump in 2005; became a U.S. citizen in 2006; and eventually sponsored her mother and father, Amalija and Victor, to be U.S. citizens as well.\n\nIn fact, just days after their son-in-law made a speech blasting so-called chain migration, Melania's parents took the oath – and in effect became chain migrants themselves.\n\nPolitics aside, both are said to dote on their 14-year-old grandson, Barron, who's learned to speak their language.\n\nJordan said, So, Barron Trump speaks Slovenian, is very close to the father. Both her parents spend huge amount of times in the White House, living there. There's a unit within the family unit, and it's Melania, her mother, her father and Barron. And they all speak Slovenian. And it's kind of interesting: the Secret Service has no idea what they're saying.\n\nAnd Donald Trump doesn't have a good idea of what they're saying a lot of the time when they're speaking Slovenian? said Smith.\n\nNo. And he has said it annoys him sometimes, 'cause he has no idea what they're saying.\n\nBut Jordan also says Melania has no problem making herself understood. She's quite influential, she said. And I think people underestimated her, big time.\n\nFor instance, when Donald Trump was trying to figure out who to pick as his vice presidential candidate, he brought Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich and Mike Pence and had her vet them. She spent two days with the Pences. And her advice to [Donald] was, 'You know, pick Pence, because he'll be content to be number two. The other ones won't. They'll be angling for the number one job.'\n\nBut while Melania has toed the Trump Company line in the past, like the false birther claims about President Obama, it's tough to tell what she thinks about her husband's most recent decisions, like advocating the use of force against people protesting the killing by police of George Floyd.\n\nSmith asked, So, if people don't like what's going on with this administration, how much can they blame her?\n\nThis is a really tricky question, Jordan replied. But I think most people that I've talked to about that interesting question say, 'You know, you're not really to blame for what your husband does.' But I do think there's a special responsibility when you're in the White House.\n\nYou know, it's not just a regular spouse. You have a platform. Now I know that she's using it in ways that we don't know, because I keep hearing about all the influence and advice she's given him. She doesn't do it publicly. But you know, maybe it would even be worse. For those who don't like Trump, who knows what else he would be doing if she weren't whispering in his ear?\n\nKatherine Jellison, who teaches history at Ohio University, said, I still think that most Americans don't think they know the real Melania Trump.\n\nSmith asked, So, is it kind of important to know where the first lady stands? Because she does have the president's ear.\n\nJellison replied, I think pretty consistently, in the modern era, first ladies have been sounding boards for their husbands, and occasionally have weighed in on policy matters. Certainly Mrs. Clinton did. Mrs. Carter did. So, I think the American people want to know something about the family life of a president, or a would-be president at the time of a presidential campaign.\n\nA defining moment in the 2016 campaign was the infamous Access Hollywood incident. I think that was the moment that she had the most power, Jordan said. You know, Trump is all about leverage and power. And that was the moment that Melania really came into her own.\n\nThe tape, recorded during a 2005 Access Hollywood shoot, surfaced a month before Election Day. It captured Mr. Trump talking about women in the most vulgar, offensive ways.\n\nHe was saying that because he's a star he can grab any woman, and was using pretty lewd language, said Jordan. And you know, if Melania didn't back him up, if she walked away right then, he was toast.\n\nAt around the same time, Jordan writes, Melania was starting to renegotiate her prenuptial agreement. Because she had wanted to do that during the campaign – no dummy! And she picked the right moment to try to get a better deal out of him.\n\nAnd when she delayed her move to the White House, that, Jordan said, gave her even more leverage.\n\nSmith asked, What did she get in the new prenup?\n\nI don't know the exact details, but what I'm hearing from multiple sources is, 'She moved in at the right time and got what she wanted,' Jordan said.\n\nAt 15 years, President Trump's marriage to the first lady has outlasted both of his previous unions. He may call himself a great negotiator, but in Melania, it seems he's met his match.\n\nSmith asked, Is it a loving marriage, or is it a business deal?\n\nWhat I'm told is that there is more there than people realize, Jordan said. Yes, they live, I think, what many people think is bizarrely separate lives. Separate bedrooms, you know, they have separate routines. But she's fascinating because we've never had somebody who only arrived in America at the age of 26, and 20 years later she's in the White House. It's quite a story.\n\n\n\nREAD AN EXCERPT: The Art of Her Deal\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by John D'Amelio. Editor: Remington Korper.
Washington — President Biden is expected to use his executive authority to rescind the Mexico City Policy, also known as the global gag rule, as part of a slew of executive actions on Thursday, according to three people familiar with the White House's plans. The Mexico City policy prohibits federal dollars from going to non-governmental organizations (NGO) that provide abortions, advocate to legalize and expand abortion access, or who provide abortion counseling.\n\nThis policy, first announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, has been regularly enacted by Republican administrations and rescinded by Democratic administrations.\n\nBut the Mexico City Policy was expanded under the Trump administration, prohibiting funding for NGOs who, in turn, fund other programs that provide abortions or abortion counseling.\n\nA 2020 report by the Government Accountability Office found in 2017 at least 54 instances when NGOs did not accept U.S. federal aid dollars because they did not want to cease their abortion access advocacy or limit abortion counseling. This resulted in the NGOs foregoing $153 million, according to the report.\n\nMr. Biden is also expected to ask the Department of Health and Human Services to review a similar policy in the United States that prevents money from Title X, a federal program meant to help low-income patients afford reproductive health care, from going to health care centers that provide abortion counseling.\n\nFinally, Mr. Biden is expected to disavow or remove the United States' 2020 endorsement of the Geneva Consensus, which is a nonbinding international declaration signed by countries opposed to abortion. Led by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the U.S. was among more than 30 countries, namely Uganda, Hungary, Indonesia, Brazil and Egypt, to join the consensus. The text of the pact is also viewed by critics as being anti-LGBTQ and anti-same sex marriage, as most of the nations involved have not legalized same-sex marriage and several others criminalize and prosecute their LGBTQ citizens.\n\nThese executive actions are expected to be part of additional health care related actions on Thursday, the people familiar with the plans said.\n\nWhile these actions were expected, Mr. Biden has not always supported expanding access to abortion. For decades, then-Senator Biden supported the Hyde Amendment, which bans using federal money for abortion services in most cases. But under pressure from progressive groups and fellow Democratic presidential candidates, Mr. Biden in June 2019 reversed his stance and said he was now in favor of repealing the Hyde Amendment.\n\nI can't justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability ... to exercise their constitutional protected right, Mr. Biden said at the time.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
2020 Democratic hopful Beto O'Rourke said Friday night that the criticisms of his ham-handed comments about his wife were right on. Not only will I not say that again, but I will be much more thoughtful in the ways that I talk about my marriage, he said.\n\nDuring a taping of the Political Party Live podcast in Cedar Rapids, he addressed criticism of his campaign-trail joke that his wife, Amy, has raised their three kids sometimes with my help. O'Rourke made the comment at multiple campaign stops during his first swing through Iowa, including earlier Friday, eliciting laughs each time, but he also drew criticism as being insensitive to the challenges faced by single parents raising children.\n\nO'Rourke told CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King in an interview that aired Friday that as he and his wife came close to making the decision if he should run for president, the best decision was made by his wife.\n\nShe said, 'There are lots of people who are talkin' about us doin' lots of different things. Let's instead of trying to figure that out right now, just spend some time as a family' … That's really what we did, O'Rourke said.\n\nDemocratic 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke speaks with supporters during a three-day road trip across Iowa, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Fri., March 15, 2019. Reutes\n\nHe said his children would often offer unsolicited advice about running for president.\n\nUnsolicited. And I honestly did not expect that. But I think they're just as sensitive to what's going on in the world right now, O'Rourke said. They understand that they will inherit the consequences of the choices that you and I make at this moment. And they're counting on us to make the right ones.\n\nO'Rourke, 46, also said he was mortified when he reread the violent fiction he wrote as a teen, which received fresh attention Friday after a Reuters report outlined his involvement in a hacker group as a teen. O'Rourke wrote a handful of posts on the group's message board under the name Psychedelic Warlord, including a fictional piece he penned when he was 15 about children getting run over by a car.\n\nI'm mortified to read it now, incredibly embarrassed, but I have to take ownership of my words, he said. Whatever my intention was as a teenager doesn't matter, I have to look long and hard at my actions, at the language I have used, and I have to constantly try to do better.\n\nO'Rourke had said after an earlier campaign stop that it was stuff I was part of as a teenager.\n\nIt's not anything I'm proud of today, and I mean, that's — that's the long and short of it, he said. All I can do is my best, which is what I'm trying to do. I can't control anything I've done in the past. I can only control what I do going forward and what I plan to do is give this my best.\n\nThe comments came on the second day of a presidential campaign in which O'Rourke is seeking to establish himself as a unique voice in the race. He avoided what has become something of a tradition among the 2020 contenders by refusing to announce how much money he raised in the 24 hours after announcing his candidacy. He said it would be soon.\n\nI don't have a definite plan, he added. We're not ready to release them now.\n\nThe former Texas congressman entered the 2020 presidential race Thursday after months of speculation. He raised an eye-popping $80 million in grassroots donations last year in his failed U.S. Senate race in Texas against Republican Ted Cruz, all while largely avoiding money from political action committees. His early fundraising numbers will be an initial signal of whether his popularity during the Senate campaign will carry over to his White House bid.\n\nSo far, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has set the pace for grassroots donations in 2020, pulling in $6 million during his first day as a candidate.\n\nAsked if he thought he would top Sanders, O'Rourke said only, We'll see.\n\nO'Rourke's reception during his first Iowa swing was overwhelmingly positive, even as he launched his campaign by hitting a handful of counties that had shifted from supporting Democrat Barack Obama to backing Republican Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign.\n\nMost of the towns O'Rourke visited during his first two days in the state were small and rural, manufacturing or farming towns. He kicked off his bid in Keokuk, population 10,300, dropped by a private home in Fairfield, a town about the same size, and jumped atop a coffee shop counter to address the crowd in Mount Pleasant, population 8,500.\n\nThe strategy set O'Rourke apart from the rest of the field, many of whom have focused their early swings on the state's population centers or on the traditionally blue counties that make up the bulk of the Democratic primary electorate.\n\nNorm Sterzenbach, who's advising O'Rourke in Iowa, said the strategy came out of the Texan's desire to do more intimate events in his first swing through Iowa.\n\nHe didn't want to do big rallies or big events. He wanted to get into communities and really talk to Iowans, and he wanted to go to smaller towns, smaller communities, and places that had been neglected by politicians, he said.\n\nIt was an approach reminiscent of his Texas Senate bid, where O'Rourke hit every one of the state's 254 counties, even the most rural areas, some of which hadn't been visited by Democratic candidates in years. O'Rourke didn't commit to visiting all of Iowa's 99 counties — what's locally known as the Full Grassley, after Iowa's senior Republican senator, Chuck Grassley, who's famous for doing the full swing - but he said he planned to visit as much of Iowa as possible.\n\nThat go-everywhere, speak-to-everyone strategy brought him within three points of defeating Cruz in Texas, the nation's largest red state.
Erin Moriarty is a 48 Hours correspondent. Here, she weighs in on covering the case of Jane Laut, a California woman who says she killed her Olympian husband in self-defense.\n\nI was raised in the Midwest by well-meaning parents who regularly reminded me to keep my voice low and my questions to myself. Curiosity into the lives of others was discouraged as unbecoming nosiness. Asking about someone's income or home life was completely taboo.\n\nWATCH: 48 Hours: Death of an Olympian\n\nBecoming a television journalist forced me to adjust the rules. I need to make myself heard on air and curious questions are part of my job. And lately, as I followed the murder trial of Jane Laut in the beach town of Oxnard, California, I have begun to seriously question the virtue of minding one's own business. The truth is, in some cases, looking the other way can lead to heartbreak and even tragedy. There are instances when a friend or family member must not only pry, but intervene.\n\nJane, Dave and Michael Laut Dotty Laut\n\nIn August 2009, when the world got news that Dave Laut, an American Olympian shot put Bronze medalist, had been shot and killed by his wife, nearly everyone who knew them expressed shock. Laut, a high school athletic director, and his wife Jane were perceived as the perfect couple; classmates in high school who became revered members of the community.\n\nIt wasn't until days after the tragedy, as police began to question family members and friends, that a different image emerged. Some of Jane's friends remember strange bruises that Jane would explain away. She always wore shirts with long sleeves, they said, even on the hottest days.\n\nOf greater concern were some of the stories Jane would tell. Stories that seemed outlandish about a particular stalker who attacked her not once, but twice. Despite a search, police were never ever able to identify or apprehend him. Today, Jane says that she made up those stories to cover up injuries that her husband caused.\n\nIt might not have been easy in the past to uncover the secrets in Dave and Jane's marriage. The couple was incredibly private, faithfully following the rules of my own childhood. But, today, because those close to Jane politely pushed aside past doubts and concerns, it is impossible to know what really happened.\n\nIs Jane now telling the truth? Did she endure years of verbal and even physical abuse? And on the night of Aug. 27, 2009, did she feel she had to kill the man she loved and married to save her family?\n\nOr is Jane now lying? Is she, in fact, a seriously troubled woman who recklessly spent money that left the family in debt and Dave in despair? And did she kill him because he threatened to leave or expose her?\n\nI got closer to the truth than many. After years of silence, Jane Laut agreed to talk to me and Marjorie Hernandez, the reporter who covered the case for the Ventura County Star. It is Jane's only television interview. We asked Jane to explain the events that led to the shooting. We pushed her to explain why she initially lied to police and blamed the shooting on a prowler. In the end, we got a story, but was it the full story? You will be able to judge it for yourselves during this week's 48 Hours.\n\nIt is understandable why family members who saw signs of trouble didn't want to interfere with Dave and Jane's marriage. But now Dave Laut is gone, his reputation tarnished. Jane Laut's life too is destroyed. A young son has lost both parents. A terrible tragedy that just might have been averted if someone broke the unspoken rules and asked more questions.
PHILADELPHIA -- Bill Cosby's lawyers urged an appeals court Wednesday to reseal the comedian's lurid, decade-old testimony about his womanizing, but the panel of judges seemed to think the request was pointless, since the deposition has already made headlines around the world.\n\nMembers of the three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit of Appeals reeled off a list of the toothpaste's out of the tube-type metaphors to suggest that any damage to Cosby's reputation from the release of the testimony has already been done.\n\nCosby's attorneys hope a ruling in their favor could help them keep the documents from being used in the criminal case against him in Pennsylvania and in the many lawsuits filed around the country by women who accuse him of sexual assault or defamation.\n\nBut the judges questioned that strategy, too. The other courts don't have to necessarily follow us. We can't control them, Circuit Judge Thomas L. Ambro said.\n\nCosby gave the testimony in 2005 as part of a lawsuit brought against him by Andrea Constand, a Temple University employee who said he drugged and molested her at his home. She later settled for an undisclosed sum, and sensitive documents in the file remained sealed.\n\nIn the nearly 1,000-page deposition, the comic known as America's Dad admitted to several extramarital affairs and said he obtained quaaludes to give to women he hoped to seduce. The documents were released last year on a request by The Associated Press. U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno found the public had a right to Cosby's testimony because of his role as a self-appointed public moralist and because he had denied accusations he drugged and molested women.\n\nIn court papers, Cosby's lawyers argue that the comedian had been assured confidentiality and that the private and embarrassing testimony would cause serious injury to the TV star, who relies upon his reputation for his livelihood.\n\nFaced with a skeptical panel of judges, Cosby lawyer George Gowen argued Wednesday that there may yet be more toothpaste in the tube. But Ambro said it was already spit out and down the drain.\n\nYou're asking us to put it back, and we just can't do it, Ambro said.\n\nGayle C. Sproul, a lawyer for the AP, argued against resealing the documents, saying that Cosby had not only spoken out on issues of marriage and morality, but had profited from them through books, TV shows and advertising. The appeals court panel, though, debated whether entertainers who speak out on issues are really public figures under the law, with a lesser right to privacy.\n\nThe judges have a number of options: They could find the issue moot and let the unsealing stand; find it moot but still reject the lower court's public moralist reasoning; or rule in Cosby's favor and reseal the documents, even if they could still be found online.\n\nThe judges gave no indication of when they would rule. The former TV star's lawyers say a ruling in their favor would allow Cosby to argue in the other cases against him that the testimony should never have been made public in the first place and should not be admitted as evidence.\n\nThe release of the deposition led prosecutors in suburban Philadelphia to revisit Constand's 2005 police complaint and charge Cosby in December with sexual assault. Cosby, 78, is free on $1 million bail while a state appeals court considers whether a former prosecutor had made a binding promise that the star would never be charged in the Constand case.
Sarah Paulson loves her girlfriend Holland Taylor a lot.\n\nHow much? So much so that she says Taylor is her favorite person in the world.\n\nPaulson tweeted a birthday message to Taylor on Thursday, saying, Happiest Birthday to @HollandTaylor my most favorite human... No one is more deeply grateful that you were born than I.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaulson must have made Taylor's birthday very special. Taylor wrote a cryptic note on Twitter on Friday, saying, Now THAT is glorious birthday present @MsSarahPaulson thank you for all your many gifts. She did not reveal what the gifts were.\n\nPaulson and Taylor have recently emerged as one of Hollywood's lesbian power couples; the two have been together for at least seven months. Taylor came out publicly in November during a WNYC interview, and did not say she was dating Paulson, but did say she and her girlfriend were talking about marriage.\n\nGiven my generation it would not be something that would automatically occur to me, she said at the time. But as a symbol, as a pledge, as a plighting one's troth, it would be a wonderful thing to do.\n\nDespite the couple's 32-year age difference, the two are very close and frequently share photos of each other on social media.
Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign is launching a nationwide voter outreach effort in June to coincide with Pride Month and engage millions of LGBTQ voters ahead of the November presidential election, campaign officials tell CBS News.\n\nThe coordinated outreach — dubbed Out for Biden— will target the estimated 11 million LGBTQ voters throughout the country, with a focus on racking up support in battleground states.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign (HRC) estimates there are approximately 772,000 LGBTQ adults in Florida, 416,000 in Pennsylvania and 311,000 in Michigan who could deliver key votes. Other states where Biden's team has said it expects him to be competitive include Arizona, with approximately 242,000 LGBTQ adults, Minnesota with 175,000 and North Carolina with 319,000, according to HRC.\n\nAbout 50% of registered LGBTQ voters are Democrats, while 15% are Republicans, according to a study by UCLA School of Law's Williams Institute last year. These voters are racially diverse and also tend to be younger. About one fifth of LGBTQ adults aren't registered to vote.\n\nHRC also points to tens of millions more LGBTQ-allied voters who may be sympathetic to the equality cause.\n\nBecause of the coronavirus pandemic, LGBTQ issue outreach is expected to continue to be virtual until it's deemed safe to resume campaigning in person. Virtual discussions are expected to be held on issues of health, race and sports, related to the LGBTQ community. Tool kits will be distributed with voter registration information and best messages to others to become equality voters. Biden's growing list of celebrity endorsers will amplify the importance of LGBTQ issues, too.\n\nOne battleground-state Democrat who believes LGBTQ Americans could boost Biden in the battleground states is Senator Tammy Baldwin, the country's first openly lesbian senator.\n\nIt is critical that, in this moment, as we speak out against racial injustice, discrimination, and harassment, we don't forget to do everything we can to empower people, Baldwin said in a statement. LGBTQ voters could be the margin of victory in Wisconsin, and in key states across the country.\n\nFrom the black trans woman in Milwaukee, to the Dreamer in south Texas to the pro-equality suburban woman in Bucks County Pennsylvania, the LGBTQ equality movement is ready to unite like never before, HRC President Alphonso David said in a statement. Our rights have long been on the ballot, compelling us to register to vote and participate in politics rather than let others speak for us and make decisions without us.\n\nThe Out for Biden initiative will be spearheaded by a current group of 32 LGBTQ politicians and allies, officials said. Alongside Baldwin, six other openly gay congressional members will advocate for Biden, with more expected to lead outreach in their own states. Transgender leaders, like Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins, will also have a prominent voice. Jenkins is the first transgender black woman elected to public office in the country and has been a visible presence after the death of George Floyd in her city.\n\nThe importance of LGBTQ rights was a common refrain for Biden on the campaign trail even outside of equality-centered events. He regularly repeated a story about when he was younger, and he saw two men in business suits kissing on the way to work in Delaware. It's simple, they love each other, Biden says his father told him at the time.\n\nLGBTQ couples frequently thanked Biden on his campaign rope lines for his early support of same-sex marriage in 2012. His advocacy for same-sex marriage went further than President Barack Obama's position at the time, and came before the Supreme Court's 2013 decision to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, as unconstitutional. That law was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 and supported by many high-profile Democratic lawmakers, including Biden.\n\nThe Biden campaign has a number of LGBTQ people on staff. I was in the car and there were several of us and I looked around with all the staff helping out and I realized that four of them were gay men, Dr. Jill Biden quipped during a LGBTQ virtual happy hour about her Iowa campaign road trips, I got a crash course in gay pop culture last summer, I must say.\n\nAnd while progress has been made for gay Americans, Biden has placed specific focus on potential policy changes to assist transgender Americans. He blames the Trump administration for erecting additional hurdles and using the White House as a literal bully pulpit to undermine LGBTQ+ rights, as he said in a statement marking Pride Month.\n\nBiden has pledged to reverse the Trump administration's ban on transgender military service members on his first day in office. They can shoot as straight as anybody else can shoot, Biden said in May. With executive orders and legislative actions, he also hopes to root out discrimination against transgender Americans in federally funded homeless shelters, ensure appropriate gender markers on government documents and force insurance companies to treat gender confirmation surgery as a medical necessity, which it is.\n\nNothing about this will be easy, Biden said when accepting the endorsement of the HRC. I'm convinced the American people are with us. I've seen firsthand the incredible capacity to win some of these battles and soften impenetrable hearts.
On the matter of email etiquette, we have a cautionary tale from our Faith Salie:\n\nWhat I'm about to tell you is not an opinion; it is a public service announcement. It's time to reply all responsibly.\n\nPlease, for the love of all things holy and efficient, consider hitting reply all for your emails on which someone is cc'd.\n\nCc stands for carbon copy. It means all the people in the cc column are getting the same information as the folks in the To line. So even if you're not in charge, you're informed.\n\nCc means everyone's fate is now entangled.\n\nFaith Salie has tips on email etiquette, including when (and when not) to use cc: instead of reply all. CBS News\n\nWhen you hit reply all, you're including all the folks on the cc train. You're keeping people in the loop, so no one spends his life copying and forwarding. No one has to say, Phil moved our meeting to 9.45?? Nobody told me. And no one has to say, Wait. I thought you were bringing the sleeping bags.\n\nYour reply all behavior can say a lot about you.\n\nI once accidentally replied all and sent an email complaining about my then-boyfriend to a bunch of strangers. It was meant for my friend who was a bride, but I ended up addressing her entire wedding party. Her marriage lasted; my relationship didn't. I was young and trigger happy.\n\nHere's a simple guideline: if five names or fewer are cc'd, just go nuts and hit reply all.\n\nBut if more than five folks appear in the cc line, pause. Give it a thought. Some people are promiscuous and cc dozens of people who don't need to know each other's business. When your daughter's second grade teacher cc's all the parents in the class about the upcoming field trip, do you need to hit reply all so that 43 adults know your daughter objects to taxidermy in dioramas on ethical grounds?\n\nOkay, also? If you're ever bcc'd, do NOT go near reply all. Bcc is blind carbon copy. It means you're a fly on the wall, dude! If you hit reply all, it's beyond bad etiquette to out the person who gave you the superpower of invisibility. It's like screaming I'M A SPY!\n\nLook, we all think Al Gore invented email so we could save time and save paper, to save trees. And that includes phone trees.\n\nLet's get it together and hit reply all responsibly.\n\nCc you later!\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nMore commentaries from Faith Salie:
Hal Holbrook, the award-winning character actor who toured the world for more than 50 years as Mark Twain in a one-man show and uttered the immortal advice Follow the money in the classic political thriller All the President's Men, has died. He was 95.\n\nHal Holbrook on March 16, 2015. Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP\n\nHolbrook died on January 23 at his home in Beverly Hills, California, his publicist, Steve Rohr, told CBS News on Tuesday.\n\nActors across the spectrum mourned Holbrook's passing, including Bradley Whitford, who called him an incredible actor, and Viola Davis, who wrote RIP to the always wonderful Hal Holbrook.\n\nHolbrook pursued a busy career in theater, television and movies, winning five Emmys and a Tony. His more than two dozen film credits ranged from Steven Spielberg's Lincoln to Oliver Stone's Wall Street. He was a steady presence on TV as well, having appeared on such shows as The West Wing, Grey's Anatomy and Bones.\n\nBut his most famous movie role was as a key source for Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward (played by Robert Redford) in the 1976 adaptation of All the President's Men, the bestselling account by Woodward and fellow Post reporter Carl Bernstein about their investigation of Richard Nixon's administration and the Watergate scandal that led to his resignation.\n\nHolbrook played the mysterious informant Deep Throat (later revealed to be FBI official Mark Felt) who provided key information to Woodward. The most famous tip, uttered from the shadows of a parking garage — Follow the money — became an instant catchphrase but was never said in real life. The line was invented by screenwriter William Goldman.\n\nFollow the money may have been his most famous film words, but Twain was his defining role. The association began in 1954 when an instructor at Ohio's Denison University gave Holbrook the role as part of a thesis assignment.\n\nHolbrook and his first wife, Ruby Johnson, later created a two-person show, playing characters from Shakespeare to Twain. After their daughter, Victoria, was born, he started working on a one-man Twain show while working on the soap opera The Brighter Day.\n\nHolbrook, raised in Cleveland, was 29 when he first performed as Twain (who was portrayed as 70) and eventually developed the role into a two-act, one-man show called Mark Twain Tonight!, taking it to schools, nightclubs and theaters. He took it to Broadway three times — 1966, 1977 and 2005 — and won a Tony Award as best dramatic actor for the 1966 version.\n\nThe truth is that he's been wonderful company, Holbrook told The Plain Dealer newspaper in 2017. It would be an understatement to say I like him. He never ceases to amaze me. Even after all these years, I'm still stunned by his insight into the human character. So much of what he had to say more than 100 years ago is right on the money for today.\n\nIn 1959, after years of honing his material in small towns, Holbrook debuted his Twain at an off-Broadway theater in New York to high critical praise. Mr. Holbrook's material is uproarious, his ability to hold an audience by acting is brilliant, said The New York Times. The New Yorker called it a dazzling display of virtuosity.\n\nHolbrook would tour as Twain — with the writer's familiar white suit and white hair — whenever he wasn't busy with other acting jobs. He would update the show to fit the times and performed the role by his account some 2,200 times. He hung up the white suit in 2017.\n\nHe did a ton of work over the years, never less than first-rate, but the Twain performances approached perfection, and they will stay with me forever, tweeted Michael McKean.\n\nHe was meticulous in his preparations, taking as long as 3 1/2 hours to don his makeup and insisting on oversized stage furniture so that, at 6 feet tall, he wouldn't appear larger than the 5-feet-8 1/2-inch Twain was. He read books by and about the author and scoured newspaper files in search of interviews with Twain and stories about his lecture tours.\n\nDuring a performance on the open-sided stage at Wolf Trap near Vienna, Virginia, lightning flashed and thunder cracked just as Holbrook reached toward the humidor for a cigar. He scuttled backward. A roar of laughter followed. Holbrook looked out over his glasses at the audience. When he could be heard again, he spoke: He wasn't talking to you.\n\nOver the years, Holbrook took Mark Twain Tonight! to numerous foreign countries, including Saudi Arabia. His audiences included Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Carter.\n\nWhen he wasn't portraying Twain, Holbrook showed impressive versatility. He was Burt Reynolds' crotchety father-in-law in the 1990s TV series Evening Shade. He appeared as Abraham Lincoln in two different miniseries on the 16th president and won one of his Emmys for the title role in the 1970-71 TV series The Senator.\n\nOther notable stage credits included After the Fall, Abe Lincoln in Illinois and I Never Sang for My Father. In 2008, at age 82, he received his first Oscar nomination for playing a lonely widower who befriends young wanderer Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) in director Sean Penn's Into the Wild.\n\nIn 1980, he met actress Dixie Carter when both starred in the TV movie The Killing of Randy Webster. Although attracted to one another, each had suffered two failed marriages and they were wary at first. They finally wed in 1984, two years before Carter landed the role of Julia Sugarbaker on the long-running TV series Designing Women. Holbrook appeared on the show regularly in the late 1980s as her boyfriend, Reese Watson. She died in 2010.\n\nHolbrook had two children, Victoria and David, with his first wife, and a daughter, Evie, from his second marriage to actress Carol Rossen. He was stepfather to Mary Dixie Carter and Ginna Carter.
Marriage and family therapist Shinique Charli Wright sent out two different sets of resumes when applying for a corporate job — one had her given name, the other only Charli Wright.\n\nAlthough their work history was exactly the same, Wright said Charli got about seven calls to offer a job or offer interview. The resume with her own name only heard back twice.\n\nWhat happens, is oftentimes unconscious bias is in place. Sometimes just actual bias is in place. But people with equal qualifications and skills don't always get equal outcomes, LinkedIn career expert Andrew McCaskill said on CBS This Morning Thursday. The unfortunate fact is that a lot of professionals are starting to feel like they have to whiten their resume or remove racial descriptors from their resumes.\n\nMcCaskill, himself a graduate of Morehouse College, said he can't imagine considering removing that credential from his resume.\n\nWright said part of her struggle was that it is difficult for people to either remember my name or pronounce it correctly. She said people often ask her for her middle name or a nickname instead.\n\nWhich definitely makes me feel ashamed of my name at times, because it seems like I'm not good enough or I'm stereotyped, she said.\n\nThe experience ultimately led Wright to create her own practice, specializing in culturally competent relationships.\n\nHowever, Wright's disheartening experience is not unique — people with ethnic-sounding names are 50% less likely to be called back for a job, according to the National Bureau of Economic research.\n\nBlack Americans and people of color across the United States also face a myriad of other challenges when trying to find a job or climb the corporate ladder.\n\nResearch from 2019 found Black Americans only made up 3.2% of senior leadership roles at large companies.\n\nThe onus is on the corporations to put things in place to make sure that racial discrimination in their hiring process doesn't creep in — and you have to be intentional about it, McCaskill said.\n\n81% of Black professionals say seeing other Black people in positions of leadership would make their workplace more inclusive, according to a survey by LinkedIn. The site has been researching racial bias in hiring and retention of Black professionals as part of its new series, Conversations for Change.\n\nRespondents reported limited opportunities, lack of senior leadership diversity, lack of mentorship and lack of support and belonging as obstacles they frequently encounter in the workforce.\n\nAll of those things culminate to Black professionals feeling like that there's more opportunity outside of the workforce and working for themselves than working for companies and corporations, McCaskill said.\n\nConsultant and entrepreneur Zachary Nunn said he experienced this lack of support firsthand when it came time to announce promotions — something Nunn said he was gunning for.\n\nI'm actually doing all types of work, working in and outside of my business unit. I'm doing above and beyond, Nunn said. I find out I got a white counterpart.\n\nThe colleague then quit close to the top of the year, and came back just before promotions were determined, Nunn said.\n\nThat guy got promoted with me, he said. So equal outcomes, but effort was not equal.\n\nNunn himself has heard numerous, contradicting criticisms as a young Black man in corporate America.\n\nI've been told I'm too arrogant, too aggressive, sometimes not aggressive enough, too proactive, not proactive enough, he said.\n\nTo help combat the racism he and other young professionals experience, Nunn said he created Living Corporate, a digital media network that centers and amplifies Black and Brown folks at work.\n\nNunn also placed responsibility with the companies themselves to create an anti-racist workplace.\n\nGestures are cool, days off are cool, but the reality is, if you're not letting Black and Brown folks make actual decisions that can impact systemic change, you're not doing anything, he said.\n\nCareer expert McCaskill said employers could take this on by among other things, looking into a blind recruitment process where the only details they look at are a candidate's qualifications and skills.\n\nThe other thing that they can do is, they have to hold themselves accountable. They need to start to measure and think about the number of people from underrepresented groups who are applying for roles and opportunities, and then juxtapose that to the number of folks who get callbacks and hired in the end, he explained.\n\nMcCaskill said one in four respondents to Linkedin's survey said they feared retaliation in the workplace — so for meaningful impact, business leaders should be the ones having the hard conversations.\n\nWe have to have allies in this process, that if you are a leader, you should be talking about inclusion because that sets the tone for culture, he said. People are not leaving — they're just not leaving their jobs, they're leaving toxic cultures, and they're not wanting to have to deal with things like microaggressions at work or feeling like there's hopelessness at work.
Thomas S. Monson, the president of the Mormon church -- The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- died late Tuesday at the age of 90, the church announced.\n\nPresident @ThomasSMonson, 90, has passed away peacefully surrounded by family. pic.twitter.com/66qoVrinIW — The LDS Church (@LDSchurch) January 3, 2018\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune notes that, During Monson's nearly 10-year tenure … Mormonism faced some of the most intense public scrutiny in its history -- from a divisive vote over gay marriage to high-profile Mormon candidacies for president and a hotly debated policy for same-sex couples and their children. Still, the private prophet stayed largely behind the scenes, showing up unexpectedly at funerals, comforting the bereaved, visiting the sick and, before her death, caring for his wife, Frances.\n\nCBS Salt Lake City affiliate KUTV reports the church issued a statement saying Monson died at 10:01 pm in his home in Salt Lake City. He was with family at the time of his passing. He died at age 90 from causes incident to age. President Monson ... leaves behind a legacy of service and good works. A successor is not expected to be formally chosen by the Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until after President Monson's funeral.\n\nProminent Utah figures were quick to tweet tributes. Among them:\n\nPresident Monson was among the greatest men I have ever known. Service was his motto and humility his hallmark. Countless were the lives he touched as a prophet, father, and friend. Today, I join millions across the globe in mourning his passing. #LDSChurch #utpol — Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) January 3, 2018\n\nMy heart is filled with love for Pres. Monson. He touched countless lives, including my own, in a positive and sweet manner influencing good throughout the world. https://t.co/cXnZswmZP3 — Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) January 3, 2018\n\nFor more than 50 years, Monson served in top leadership councils for the church - making him a well-known face and personality to multiple generations of Mormons.\n\nA church bishop at the age of 22, the Salt Lake City native became the youngest church apostle ever in 1963 at the age of 36. He served as a counselor for three church presidents before assuming the role of the top leader of the church in February 2008.\n\nMonson's job is expected to go to next longest-tenured member of the church's governing Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Russell M. Nelson, per church protocol.\n\nMonson's presidency was marked by his noticeably low profile during a time of intense publicity for the church, including the 2008 and 2012 campaigns of Mormon Mitt Romney for U.S. president. Monson's most public acts were appearances at church conferences and devotionals as well as dedications of church temples.\n\nMonson will also be remembered for his emphasis on humanitarian work; leading the faith's involvement in the passage of gay marriage ban in California in 2008; continuing the religion's push to be more transparent about its past; and lowering the minimum age for missionaries.\n\nMormons considered Monson a warm, caring, endearing and approachable leader, said Patrick Mason, associate professor of religion at Claremont Graduate University in California. He was known for dropping everything to make hospital visits to people in need. His speeches at the faith's twice-yearly conferences often focused on parables of human struggles resolved through faith.\n\nHe put an emphasis on the humanitarian ethic of Mormons, evidenced by his expansion of the church's disaster relief programs around the world, said Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University.\n\nMonson often credited his mother, Gladys Condie Monson, for fostering his compassion. He said that during his childhood in the Depression of the 1930s their house in Salt Lake City was known to hobos riding the railroads as a place to get a meal and a kind word.\n\nPresident Monson always seemed more interested in what we do with our religion rather than in what we believe, Mauss said.\n\nA World War II veteran, Monson served in the Navy and spent a year overseas before returning to get a business degree at the University of Utah and a master's degree in business administration from the church-owned Brigham Young University.\n\nBefore being tabbed to join the faith's church's governing Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Monson worked for the church's secular businesses, primarily in advertising, printing and publishing including the Deseret Morning News.\n\nMonson married Frances Beverly Johnson in 1948. The couple had three children, eight grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. Frances died in 2013 at the age of 85.\n\nThroughout his life, Monson was an avid fisherman who also raised homing pigeons, specifically, roller pigeons who twirled as they flew. He was known for his love of show tunes, Boy Scouts and the Utah Jazz.\n\nMonson's legacy will be tied to the religion's efforts to hold tight to its opposition of same-sex marriage while encouraging members to be more open and compassionate toward gays and lesbians as acceptance for LGBT people increased across the county.\n\nAt Monson's urging, Mormons were vigorous campaign donors and volunteers in support of a measure to ban gay marriage in California in 2008. That prompted a backlash against the church that included vandalism of church buildings, protest marches and demonstrations outside church temples nationwide.\n\nIn subsequent years, the church began utilizing a softer tone on the issue. In 2015, the church backed an anti-discrimination law in Utah that gave unprecedented protections for gay and transgender people while also protecting religious freedoms.\n\nBut the religion came under fire again in the fall of 2015 when it banned baptisms for children living with gay parents, and instituted a requirement that those children disavow homosexual relationships before being allowed to serve a mission. The changes were designed to avoid putting children in a tug-of-war between their parents and church teachings, leaders said.\n\nThe revisions triggered anger, confusion and sadness for a growing faction of LGBT-supportive Mormons who were buoyed in recent years by church leaders' calls for more love and understanding for LGBT members.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of Monson's tenure came in October 2012, when he announced at church conference that the minimum age to depart on missions was being lowered to 19 from 21 for women; and to 18 from 19 for men. The change triggered a historic influx of missionaries, and proved a milestone change for women by allowing many more to serve.\n\nTaking the lead from Hinckley, Monson also continued the church's push toward being more open about some of the most sensitive aspect of the faith's history and doctrine. A renovated church history museum reopened in 2015 with an exhibit acknowledging the religion's early polygamous practices, a year after the church published an essay that for the first time chronicled founder Joseph Smith's plural wives.\n\nOther church essays issued during Monson's tenure addressed other sensitive topics: sacred undergarments worn by devout members; a past ban on black men in the lay clergy; and the misconception that Mormons are taught they will get their own planet in the afterlife.\n\nThe growth and globalization of the religion continued under Monson, with membership swelling to nearly 15.9 million, with more than half outside the United States.\n\nThe Mormon church was founded in 1830 in upstate New York by Joseph Smith, who claimed he was visited by God and Jesus while praying in a grove of trees and was called to found the church. Members are known as Mormons because of the religion's keystone scripture, the Book of Mormon.\n\nMormons believe they are called to share the word of God, specifically their own message of the restored Gospel, through their missionaries. There were 71,000 church missionaries serving around the world at the end of 2016.\n\nLike his predecessors, Monson traveled the world, visiting countless countries to give speeches, dedicate temples and preach to Latter-day Saints. Under his watch, 27 new temples were planned or built.\n\nMonson chose five new members to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a top-governing body that sets policy and runs the worldwide faith's business operations. All five were white and from Utah - a fact that disappointed some Mormons who wanted to see a minority or person from outside the U.S. selected to acknowledge the globalization of the church.\n\nThe man expected to take Monson's seat, the 93-year-old Nelson, has been a church apostle since April 1970. Out of respect for Monson, his appointment will not be officially named until after his funeral services.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, Nelson will choose two new counselors from the Quorum of the Twelve who will join him to form a three-person presidency that is the top of the religion's governing hierarchy. Monson's two counselors were Henry Eyring and Dieter Uchtdorf. They will go back to being regular members of the Quorum unless they are chosen again.

For many black Americans, owning a piece of the American Dream is nothing but a fading reverie.\n\nAccording to research from the Urban Institute, homeownership rates for blacks in the U.S. have slumped since 2000 and are now below their level in 1970, a distressing backward step from the progress made in previous decades. Although homeownership rates are declining for all age groups and races, African-Americans are the hardest-hit among all demographic groups, Laurie Goodman, co-director of Urban's Housing Finance Policy Center.\n\nThe trend is troubling because homeownership has served as an effective way to for people to build wealth and achieve financial stability. Paying a mortgage works as a forced savings mechanism, since homeowners sock away money toward their principal every month. The declining homeownership rate could snowball into a devastating chapter in black Americans' economic well-being, leading to greater racial inequality and higher rates of poverty, especially in old age when many Americans rely on their home equity to fund retirement.\n\nThe black community has just been hit really, really hard, Goodman said. The irony is homeownership is the best way to build wealth by far. What worries me is that we're in a self-perpetuating cycle.\n\nHomeownership rates have declined across the board in the U.S., to be sure. Americans are stepping back from the property market, although not always by choice, Goodman noted. Tighter lending standards and stagnant wages have played their part in reducing homeownership rates.\n\nThe homeownership rate for white households stood at 71.1 percent in 2015, compared with 72.9 percent in 2000. While the homeownership rate has traditionally been lower for blacks than whites, the gap has widened in recent years. In 2000, about 47.3 percent of black households owned their homes, while the share dropped to 41.2 percent by 2015.\n\nStagnant incomes are partially to blame. The earnings gap between whites and blacks has widened since 1979, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Blacks generally earn less than white workers, making it hard to save for a downpayment.\n\nThe recession was especially tough on blacks, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Even college-educated black workers, who have higher earnings than their less educated cohort, weren't protected by the impact of the economic downturn, economists found. One theory: Many of them bought homes in minority neighborhoods, which haven't benefitted from the same rebound in housing prices as predominantly white areas.\n\nBlack consumers are less likely to have high credit scores than white borrowers, according to Bankrate.com. Higher credit scores are tied to lower interest rates, which means some black borrowers may face higher lending costs, adding to the difficulty in affording a home.\n\nAside from rates and income, there's another issue that may be coming into play: changing views on homeownership. The recession scared some Americans away from committing to homeownership. Others are delaying marriage and kids, which are other traditional points when Americans decide to buy homes.\n\nI see the difference between me and my kids, Goodman said. My son said to me last year, 'Mom, I'm 34, I have a kid on the way, and I own my own home. Where were you at 34?' I said, I had owned a home for 10 years and, by the way, you were eight.\n\nShe added, If you are a homeowner at 35 rather than 24, you are a homeowner for less of your life and have fewer years to save and build equity.\n\nBlack Americans in Generation X (born between 1966 to 1975) are those at most risk by eroding homeownership rates, the Urban Institute, a centrist think tank, found. More of this generation lost their homes than bought houses after 2010, which it called unprecedented.\n\nThe losses for black Americans reverses decades of progress following the 1968 Fair Housing Act, which made it unlawful to discriminate against a buyer or renter because of their race, color, religion, gender, family status or country of origin.\n\nDespite the law, black homeowners were victims of risky mortgages that fueled the housing crisis. In 2012, Wells Fargo (WFC) settled allegations that it had discriminated against black and Hispanic borrowers, some of whom were pushed into subprime mortgages and paid higher rates and fees than whites.\n\nIt's not only mortgages where minorities have faced obstacles A new study from ProPublica and Consumer Reports found that residents of urban minority neighborhoods could be paying as much as 30 percent more for car insurance than those in white areas.\n\nAs for boosting the homeownership rate among Americans of all ages and races, Goodman said a few policy changes could help, such as increasing the housing supply for both renters and homeowners. Broader credit availability would also help.\n\nWe're taking half the credit risk we were taking in 2001, she said. There should be greater tolerance to allow people to become owners.
NEW YORK — Playwright Neil Simon, a master of comedy whose laugh-filled hits such as The Odd Couple, ''Barefoot in the Park and his Brighton Beach trilogy dominated Broadway for decades, has died. He was 91.\n\nSimon died early Sunday of complications from pneumonia surrounded by family at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, according to Bill Evans, his longtime friend and the Shubert Organization director of media relations. Evans, who had donated a kidney to Simon, said the playwright was admitted to the hospital two days ago.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Simon was the American theater's most successful and prolific playwrights, often chronicling middle class issues and fears.\n\nStarting with Come Blow Your Horn in 1961 and continuing into the next century, he rarely stopped working on a new play or musical. His list of credits is staggering.\n\nPlaywright Neil Simon attends The Road To Mecca opening night at the American Airlines Theatre on Jan. 17, 2012, in New York City. Neilson Barnard / Getty Images\n\nThe theater world mourned his death, with actor Josh Gad calling Simon one of the primary influences on my life and career. Playwright Kristoffer Diaz said simply: This hurts.\n\nSimon's stage successes included The Prisoner of Second Avenue, ''Last of the Red Hot Lovers, ''The Sunshine Boys, ''Plaza Suite, ''Chapter Two, ''Sweet Charity and Promises, Promises, but there were other plays and musicals, too, more than 30 in all. Many of his plays were adapted into movies and one, The Odd Couple, even became a popular television series.\n\nFor seven months in 1967, he had four productions running at the same time on Broadway: Barefoot in the Park; The Odd Couple; Sweet Charity; and The Star-Spangled Girl.\n\nEven before he launched his theater career, he made history as one of the famed stable of writers for comedian Sid Caesar that also included Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner.\n\nSimon was the recipient of four Tony Awards, the Pulitzer Prize, the Kennedy Center honors (1995), four Writers Guild of America Awards, an American Comedy Awards Lifetime Achievement honor and, in 1983, he even had a Broadway theater named after him when the Alvin was rechristened the Neil Simon Theatre.\n\nIn this Nov. 23, 1981, file photo playwright Neil Simon, left, and actor James Coco pose for a photo in New York during the New York announcement of a Broadway bound musical comedy, Little Me. / AP\n\nIn 2006, he won the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, which honors work that draws from the American experience. The previous year had seen a popular revival of The Odd Couple, reuniting Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick after their enormous success in The Producers several years earlier.\n\nIn a 1997 interview with The Washington Post, Simon reflected on his success. I know that I have reached the pinnacle of rewards. There's no more money anyone can pay me that I need. There are no awards they can give me that I haven't won. I have no reason to write another play except that I am alive and I like to do it, he said.\n\nSimon had a rare stumble in the fall of 2009, however, when a Broadway revival of his Brighton Beach Memoirs closed abruptly after only nine performances because of poor ticket sales. It was to have run in repertory with Simon's Broadway Bound, which was also canceled.\n\nThe bespectacled, mild-looking Simon (described in a New York Times magazine profile as looking like an accountant or librarian who dressed just this side of drab) was a relentless writer — and rewriter.\n\nI am most alive and most fulfilled sitting alone in a room, hoping that those words forming on the paper in the Smith-Corona will be the first perfect play ever written in a single draft, Simon wrote in the introduction to one of the many anthologies of his plays.\n\nEmbed:\n\nHe was a meticulous joke smith, peppering his plays, especially the early ones, with comic one-liners and humorous situations that critics said sometimes came at the expense of character and believability. No matter. For much of his career, audiences embraced his work, which often focused on middle-class, urban life, many of the plots drawn from his own personal experience.\n\nI don't write social and political plays, because I've always thought the family was the microcosm of what goes on in the world, he told The Paris Review in 1992.\n\nSimon received his first Tony Award in 1965 as best author — a category now discontinued — for The Odd Couple, although the comedy lost the best-play prize to Frank D. Gilroy's The Subject Was Roses. He won a best-play Tony 20 years later for Biloxi Blues. In 1991, Lost in Yonkers received both the Tony and the Pulitzer Prize. And there was a special achievement Tony, too, in 1975.\n\nSimon's own life figured most prominently in what became known as his Brighton Beach trilogy — Brighton Beach Memoirs, ''Biloxi Blues and Broadway Bound — which many consider his finest works. In them, Simon's alter ego, Eugene Morris Jerome, makes his way from childhood to the U.S. Army to finally, on the verge of adulthood, a budding career as a writer.\n\nSimon was born Marvin Neil Simon in New York and was raised in the Bronx and Washington Heights. He was a Depression-era child, his father, Irving, a garment-industry salesman. He was raised mostly by his strong-willed mother, Mamie, and mentored by his older brother, Danny, who nicknamed his younger sibling, Doc.\n\nSimon attended New York University and the University of Colorado. After serving in the military in 1945-46, he began writing with his brother for radio in 1948 and then, for television, a period in their lives chronicled in Simon's 1993 play, Laughter on the 23rd Floor.\n\nThe brothers wrote for such classic 1950s television series as Your Show of Shows, 90 minutes of live, original comedy starring Caesar and Imogene Coca, and later for The Phil Silvers Show, in which the popular comedian portrayed the conniving Army Sgt. Ernie Bilko.\n\nYet Simon grew dissatisfied with television writing and the network restrictions that accompanied it. Out of his frustration came Come Blow Your Horn, which starred Hal March and Warren Berlinger as two brothers (not unlike Danny and Neil Simon) trying to figure out what to do with their lives. The comedy ran for more than a year on Broadway. An audience member is said to have died on opening night.\n\nBut it was his second play, Barefoot in the Park, that really put Simon on the map. Critically well-received, the 1963 comedy, directed by Mike Nichols, concerned the tribulations of a pair of newlyweds, played by Elizabeth Ashley and Robert Redford, who lived on the top floor of a New York brownstone.\n\nSimon cemented that success two years later with The Odd Couple, a comedy about bickering roommates: Oscar, a gruff, slovenly sportswriter, and Felix, a neat, fussy photographer. Walter Matthau, as Oscar, and Art Carney, as Felix, starred on Broadway, with Matthau and Jack Lemmon playing the roles in a successful movie version. Jack Klugman and Tony Randall appeared in the TV series, which ran on ABC from 1970-1975. A female stage version was done on Broadway in 1985 with Rita Moreno as Olive (Oscar) and Sally Struthers as Florence (Felix). It was revived again as a TV series from 2015-17, starring Matthew Perry.\n\nThe play remains one of Simon's most durable and popular works. Nathan Lane as Oscar and Matthew Broderick as Felix starred in a revival that was one of the biggest hits of the 2005-2006 Broadway season.\n\nBesides Sweet Charity (1966), which starred Gwen Verdon as a goodhearted dance-hall hostess, and Promises, Promises (1968), based on Billy Wilder's film The Apartment, Simon wrote the books for several other musicals.\n\nLittle Me (1962), adapted from Patrick Dennis' best-selling spoof of show-biz autobiographies, featured a hardworking Sid Caesar in seven different roles. They're Playing Our Song (1979), which had music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager, ran for more than two years. But a musical version of Simon's movie The Goodbye Girl, starring Martin Short and Bernadette Peters, had only a short run in 1993.\n\nMany of his plays were turned into films as well. Besides The Odd Couple, he wrote the screenplays for movie versions of Barefoot in the Park, ''The Sunshine Boys, ''The Prisoner of Second Avenue and more.\n\nSimon also wrote original screenplays, the best known being The Goodbye Girl, starring Richard Dreyfuss as a struggling actor, and The Heartbreak Kid, which featured Charles Grodin as a recently married man, lusting to drop his new wife for a blonde goddess played by Cybill Shepherd.\n\nIn his later years, Simon had more difficulty on Broadway. After the success of Lost in Yonkers, which starred Mercedes Ruehl as a gentle, simple-minded woman controlled by her domineering mother (Irene Worth), the playwright had a string of financially unsuccessful plays including Jake's Women, ''Laughter on the 23rd Floor and Proposals. Simon even went off-Broadway with London Suite in 1995 but it didn't run long either.\n\nThe Dinner Party, a comedy set in Paris about husbands and ex-wives, was a modest hit in 2000, primarily because of the box-office strength of its two stars, Henry Winkler and John Ritter. A hit revival of Promises, Promises in 2010 starred Kristin Chenoweth and Sean Hayes.\n\nPerhaps Simon's most infamous production was the critically panned Rose's Dilemma, which opened at off-Broadway's nonprofit Manhattan Theatre Club in December 2003. Its star, Mary Tyler Moore, walked out of the show during preview performances after receiving a note from the playwright criticizing her performance. Moore was replaced by her understudy.\n\nHe wrote two memoirs, Rewrites (1996) and The Play Goes On (1999). They were combined into Neil Simon's Memoirs.\n\nSimon was married five times, twice to the same woman. His first wife, Joan Baim, died of cancer in 1973, after 20 years of marriage. They had two daughters, Ellen and Nancy, who survive him. Simon dealt with her death in Chapter Two (1977), telling the story of a widower who starts anew.\n\nThe playwright then married actress Marsha Mason, who had appeared in his stage comedy The Good Doctor and who went on to star in several films written by Simon including The Goodbye Girl, ''The Cheap Detective, ''Chapter Two, ''Only When I Laugh and Max Dugan Returns. They were divorced in 1982.\n\nThe playwright was married to his third wife, Diane Lander, twice — once in 1987-1988 and again in 1990-1998. Simon adopted Lander's daughter, Bryn, from a previous marriage. Simon married his fourth wife, actress Elaine Joyce, in 1999. He also survived by three grandchildren; and one great-grandson.\n\nI suspect I shall keep on writing in a vain search for that perfect play. I hope I will keep my equilibrium and sense of humor when I'm told I haven't achieved it, Simon once said about his voluminous output of work. At any rate, the trip has been wonderful. As George and Ira Gershwin said, 'They Can't Take That Away From Me.'
BRUNSWICK, Ga. -- A defense attorney said Tuesday a Georgia father didn't intentionally leave his toddler son to die in a hot SUV, and said he will call the child's mother to testify that Justin Ross Harris was a good father.\n\nDefense attorney Maddox Kilgore spoke during his opening statement in Harris' murder trial. Prosecutors argue Harris intentionally left his 22-month-old son Cooper in the SUV in June 2014 as he sought to escape the responsibilities of family life and focus on sexual liaisons with prostitutes and young women - even teenagers - he met online.\n\nJustin Ross Harris trial Justin Ross Harris' defense team is presenting their opening statements, painting him as not an angel, who has committed sexual sins but not a criminal, in leaving his son in the car to die. Posted by CBS46 on Tuesday, October 4, 2016\n\nTuesday, Kilgore admitted that Harris committed sexual sins, and argued that although there's no doubt Harris is responsible for the boy's death, he is not a criminal.\n\nRoss's sex life, no matter how perverse and nasty and wrong … doesn't have a thing to do with the fact he forgot that little boy, he said, according to the Atlanta-Journal Constitution.\n\nKilgore said Leanna Harris, the defendant's ex-wife and the child's mother, will tell jurors that prosecutors got it wrong. He said that though Leanna Harris will testify that her former husband was unfaithful to her in their marriage, she will say that the man loved that little boy more than anything in the world.\n\nShe's going to tell you he was a wonderful father – a woman who's got every reason in the world to despise his guts, Kilgore said.\n\nProsecutors say Harris intentionally killed the boy by leaving him for hours in a vehicle parked outside the father's metro Atlanta workplace. Cobb County prosecutor Chuck Boring said Monday that Harris killed his son in one of the most unimaginable, horrible ways.\n\nBoring said Harris shed not a tear when he was being questioned by police after his son died, and complained to officers.\n\nIs he screaming, 'Can I see my son? What is going on here?' Boring said. No. He complains that it's hot in the back of the patrol car.\n\nBut Kilgore countered that Tuesday, showing jurors of video of Harris in a police interview room after the boy's death, apparently sobbing and wailing, What have I done?\n\nHarris grew emotional in court as his lawyer spoke, wiping tears from his eyes.\n\nAttorneys for Harris, who moved to Georgia from Alabama in 2012, say the death was a tragic accident. Harris told police he watched cartoons with his son that morning, took him to breakfast at a Chick-fil-A restaurant and kissed Cooper while strapping him into his car seat. But Harris said he forgot to drop his son off at day care and drove to work, forgetting the boy was in the back seat.\n\nKilgore said he will call experts to the stand to explain how someone could forget a child in a car when habit memory overpowers an intention to make a change in their daily routine. He said Harris was planning to drop the child off at day care, and didn't realize the fatal mistake until it was too late.\n\nHe had every reason in the world to take him to day care – that was his plan. That was what he intended to do, Kilgore said.\n\nJustin Ross Harris listens to Cobb County Senior Assistant District Attorney Chuck Boring's opening remarks during his trial at the Glynn County Courthouse in Brunswick, Ga., Monday, Oct. 3, 2016. Stephen B. Morton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, Pool\n\nOn Monday, Boring told the jury Harris' account doesn't make sense. He said the restaurant is just over half a mile from the Home Depot office where Harris worked as a computer technician, and Harris parked his SUV by backing up between two vehicles - which would have required looking over his shoulder toward the backseat where his son sat.\n\nLater that day, Harris opened his vehicle to toss in a bag of light bulbs he bought during his lunch break, Boring said. After leaving work, he drove a few miles to a shopping center without stopping, the prosecutor said, though police later reported the SUV reeked from sweat, a dirty diaper, the smell of death.\n\nThe facts of this case only make sense if the defendant had planned on intentionally killing his son, Boring said.\n\nBoring said on the day Cooper died, his father sent more than 30 messages on his phone mostly to women, mostly about sex.\n\nThe month before his son died, Boring said, Harris met a prostitute for sex at a hotel. He had also been trying to persuade an underage, 17-year-old girl to send him a photo of her genitals. Harris was also charged for sending the girl sexually explicit text messages and photos.\n\nHe faces life in prison if he's convicted of murder. Prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty. The case drew national attention and was so closely followed in Harris' suburban home of Cobb County that a judge moved the trial 275 miles to Brunswick, on the Georgia coast.\n\nSixteen total jurors - eight men and eight women - were seated Monday morning to hear the case. Four of them will serve as alternate jurors, who will have a final say in the trial only if one more of the 12 main jurors are dismissed. The judge did not specify which jury members were alternates.
Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston drew lots of attention at the Screen Actors Guild awards show Sunday, but the movie Parasite officially infected Hollywood's award season.\n\nBong Joon Ho's Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea became the first foreign language film to take top honors from the guild, setting itself up as a legitimate best picture contender with front-runner 1917 at next month's Academy Awards.\n\nBefore the win for Parasite, the SAG Awards were most notable for their reunion of Pitt and Aniston. They each took home awards and celebrated the other's win.\n\nBrad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston at 26th Annual Screen Actors' Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on January 19, 2020, in Los Angeles. Emma McIntyre / Getty\n\nPitt is widely seen as headed for his first acting Academy Award for his supporting performance in Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, and he added to his front-runner status with a win from the actors' guild. Along the way, his speeches have been full of one-liners and he didn't disappoint Sunday. Pitt, who said he was nursing a flu, looked down at his award and said, I've got to add this to my Tinder profile.\n\nHe added: Let's be honest, it was a difficult part. A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn't get on with his wife. It was a big stretch. The audience laughed and clapped, including — as the cameras captured — Aniston, his ex-wife.\n\nAniston later won an award of her own for best female actor in a drama series for the Apple TV+ show The Morning Show. What! she said upon reaching the stage. Aniston finished her speech with a shout-out to her Murder Mystery co-star Adam Sandler, whose performance in Uncut Gems has gone mostly unrewarded this season despite considerable acclaim.\n\nYour performance is extraordinary and your magic is real. I love you, buddy, said Aniston.\n\nBackstage, Pitt watched Aniston's acceptance speech. After she got off stage, they warmly congratulated each other on their first individual SAG Awards.\n\nRobert De Niro was given the guild's lifetime achievement award, an honor presented by Leonardo DiCaprio who, like De Niro, is a frequent leading man for Martin Scorsese. (The two co-star in Scorsese's upcoming Killers of the Flower Moon.) A raucous standing ovation greeted the 76-year-old actor.\n\nDe Niro, a fiery critic of Donald Trump, referenced the president in his remarks.\n\nThere's right and there's wrong. And there's common sense and there's abuse of power. As a citizen, I have as much right as anybody — an actor, an athlete, anybody else — to voice my opinion, said De Niro. And if I have a bigger voice because of my situation, I'm going to use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power.\n\nThe best ensemble cast win for Parasite came over the starry epics Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood and The Irishman. It was a surprise, but only to a degree.\n\nParasite, up for six Oscars including best picture, has emerged as perhaps the stiffest competition for Sam Mendes' 1917, which won at the highly predictive Producers Guild Awards on Saturday.\n\nBut Parasite was the clear crowd favorite Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, where even the cast's appearance introducing the film drew a standing ovation. Yet until the SAG Awards, the many honors for Parasite have seldom included awards for its actors, none of whom were nominated for an Oscar.\n\nDirector Bong Joon Ho said winning the award made him think that maybe we haven't created such a bad movie.\n\nI am so honored to receive this award. I will never forget such a beautiful night, he said through an interpreter.\n\nAlthough the title is 'Parasite,' I think the story is about coexistence and how we can all live together, said Song Kang Ho, one of the film's stars, also through an interpreter.\n\nBecause actors make up the largest percentage of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, their picks are closely watched as Academy Awards harbingers.\n\nIf Parasite can pull off the upset at the Oscars on February 9, it would be the first foreign language film to do so.\n\nAlong with Pitt, all the Oscar favorites kept their momentum, including wins for Renee Zellweger (Judy), Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) and Laura Dern (Marriage Story).\n\nAs expected, Phoenix took best performance by a leading male actor. After individually praising each fellow nominee, Phoenix concluded with a nod to his Joker predecessor. I'm standing here on the shoulders of my favorite actor, Heath Ledger, said Phoenix.\n\nDern also further established herself as the best supporting actress favorite with a win from the actors guild. On her way to the stage, she hugged her father, Bruce Dern, part of the Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood ensemble.
Blake Shelton might be dating Gwen Stefani, but his ex-wife Miranda Lambert has a new romance stirring up as well.\n\nThe country star, who won Female Vocalist of the Year at Sunday's Academy of Country Music Awards, brought along her new boyfriend. Anderson East, who is a rhythm and blues singer.\n\nET reports that the couple have been dating since last year, and the two looked quite cozy during their first awards show together. Lambert and East held hands, and a source told ET they were very affectionate.\n\nLambert has alluded to her relationship before on social media; she posted a photo of herself snuggling with East on Instagram and wrote, The snuggle is real.\n\nThe country singer divorced Shelton last year after four years of marriage, but have maintained a cordial relationship -- at least on social media.
NEW YORK -- Barbara Cook, whose shimmering soprano made her one of Broadway's leading ingenues and later a major cabaret and concert interpreter of popular American song, has died. She was 89.\n\nCook died early Tuesday of respiratory failure at her home in Manhattan, surrounded by family and friends, according to publicist Amanda Kaus. Her last meal was vanilla ice cream, a nod to one of her most famous roles in She Loves Me.\n\nThroughout her nearly six decades on stage, Cook's voice remained remarkably supple, gaining in emotional honesty and expanding on its natural ability to go straight to the heart.\n\nOn social media, powerhouse singers paid their respect, including Betty Buckley, who called Cook one of the great artists & lovely being, and Lea Salonga, who wrote Rest In Peace on Twitter. New Tony Award winner Ben Platt from Dear Evan Hansen wrote: Thank you Barbara Cook for the beautiful songs, the indelible characters, and the masterful storytelling. Heaven must sound glorious today.\n\nOn Broadway, Cook was best known for three roles: her portrayal of the saucy Cunegonde in Leonard Bernstein's Candide (1956); librarian Marian opposite Robert Preston in The Music Man (1957); and Amalia Balash, the letter-writing heroine of She Loves Me (1963).\n\nYet when Cook's pert ingenue days were over, she found a second, longer career in clubs and concert halls, working for more than 30 years with Wally Harper, a pianist and music arranger. Harper helped in shaping her material, choosing songs and providing the framework for her shows.\n\nTo celebrate her 80th birthday, she appeared with the New York Philharmonic in two concerts in November 2007 and then had a similar birthday salute in London. In 2011, she was saluted at the Kennedy Center Honors and remained a singer even in her 80s.\n\nOf course, I think I've gotten better at it, she said in an interview with The Associated Press in her Manhattan home in 2011. I still think this is a work in progress. I do. Seriously. As the years go by, I have more and more courage to go deeper and deeper and deeper.\n\nBorn in Atlanta in 1927, Cook always hated vocal exercises, never had a vocal coach and had an effortless skill of creating beauty by just opening her mouth. I don't remember when I didn't sing. I just always sang, she said in 2011. I think I breathed and I sang.\n\nHer father was a traveling salesman who sold hats; her mother worked for Southern Bell. Her baby sister died of pneumonia when she was 3 and her father left when she was 6. She was raised by her far-too-clingy mother, who blamed young Barbara for both the death and the abandonment.\n\nCook made her Broadway debut in Flahooley (1951), a short-lived musical fantasy about a mass-produced laughing doll. The show became a cult classic for musical-theater buffs, primarily because it was recorded, keeping its memory alive long after the production closed.\n\nCook then appeared in a pair of Rodgers and Hammerstein classics, playing Ado Annie in a City Center revival of Oklahoma! and then on tour in 1953. She followed that by portraying Carrie Pipperidge in a 1954 revival of Carousel. It led to Cook's first original musical success, a yearlong Broadway run in Plain and Fancy (1955), in which she portrayed an innocent, unworldly Amish girl.\n\nThe following year, she starred in Candide, which ran only 73 performances but later became a staple of opera houses around the world. In the musical, Cook got to sing Glitter and Be Gay, a fiendishly difficult coloratura parody of the Jewel Song from Charles Gounod's Faust.\n\nMeredith Willson's The Music Man was Cook's biggest Broadway hit, opening in December 1957 and running for more than 1,300 performances. She won a Tony Award for her portrayal of the prim librarian who realizes Professor Harold Hill (Preston) is a con man selling band instruments and uniforms to the gullible residents of a small Iowa town.\n\nCook scored a personal triumph in She Loves Me, a Jerry Bock-Sheldon Harnick-Joe Masteroff musical based on the film The Shop Around the Corner. It told of two squabbling employees in a Budapest perfume shop who, unknown to each other, are romantically inclined pen pals. In the show, Cook sang a number extolling a gift of Vanilla Ice Cream, which became a signature number for the performer when she began appearing in cabaret.\n\nThat turn began after her Broadway career withered in the late 1960s as Cook battled alcoholism and weight gain. In her 2016 memoir Then & Now, Cook describes hitting rock bottom as a drunk: I was so broke that I was stealing food from the supermarket by slipping sandwich meat in my coat pocket.\n\nBut she gave up drinking in the 1970s and, with the help of Harper, reinvented herself as a solo artist, working in small New York clubs and finally Carnegie Hall. Her first concert album, Barbara Cook at Carnegie Hall (1975), became a classic.\n\nCook and Harper, who died in 2004, worked methodically and carefully on her shows, mixing show tunes with standards not from musical theater. Often the programs were constructed around themes, specific composers such as Stephen Sondheim, lyricists such as Dorothy Fields, or directors such as Harold Prince and Gower Champion.\n\nSondheim became one of her biggest champions. Cook starred, along with Lee Remick, Mandy Patinkin and George Hearn, in a legendary 1985 concert version of Follies at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall.\n\nHer marriage to acting teacher David LeGrant ended in divorce. Cook is survived by a son, Adam LeGrant.\n\nWhen asked what her advice usually was to aspiring singers, she told The AP it boiled down to three words that she learned early on herself and have been her guide.\n\nYou are enough. You are always enough. You don't ever have to pretend to be anything other than what you are. All you have to do is deeply embrace who you are and you'll be fine, she said. In life, aren't you drawn to the more authentic people? Of course. You're not drawn to phonies.
The following script is from 60 Minutes Presents: Barack Obama: Eight Years in the White House, which aired on Jan. 15, 2017. Steve Kroft is the correspondent.\n\nGood evening. I'm Steve Kroft. Welcome to 60 Minutes Presents. Tonight, President Barack Obama looks back at eight years in the White House. His successes. His failures and what he learned from his two terms as the nation's chief executive and commander-in-chief.\n\nWe first met him 10 years ago, when he was in his first term as a U.S. senator from Illinois and launching an unlikely campaign for president.\n\nAs we said at the time, there had never been another presidential candidate quite like him. His last name rhymed with Osama. And his middle name was Hussein.\n\nHe was half black, half white, and in terms of political experience, very green.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Steve Kroft.\n\nSteve Kroft: Hey!\n\nWe sat down with President Obama Monday afternoon in the State Dining Room at the White House. It marked our 12th and final interview with him since he was elected president. We began by showing him a picture.\n\nFrom left: 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft, President Barack Obama and producer L. Franklin Devine, 2007. CBS News\n\nSteve Kroft: I got something I want to show you.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: What do we got here? Look at that. I got to say that I feel as if I couldn't take this kind of Chicago winter right now.\n\nIt was taken Super Bowl Sunday 2007 on a frigid day on the South Side of Chicago -- one of the last times he could walk a street without attracting a big crowd, unencumbered by Secret Service or an entourage. It was a week before he declared his formal candidacy for president.\n\nSteve Kroft: That was 10 years ago.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I think that's right. That's my mother-in-law's house, that block, I think.\n\nSteve Kroft: Nobody around, nobody. Nobody cared.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: They didn't. How about that?\n\nHe was an audaciously hopeful junior senator from Illinois, splitting his time between his tiny apartment in Washington and the Chicago home where he had two young daughters.\n\nSteve Kroft: What else does he make besides tuna fish?\n\nMalia Obama: Chili, and that's it.\n\nHis wife was a working mom, a hospital executive and major breadwinner in the family. She wasn't crazy about her husband being in politics.\n\nSteve Kroft: Has it put strains on the marriage from time to time?\n\nMichelle Obama: Oh, no.\n\nSen. Obama: Absolutely, it has.\n\nSteve Kroft: But you'd let him go ahead and do this?\n\nMichelle Obama: I think if I weren't married to him, I'd want him to be in there. So I don't want to stand in the way of that because we have to work out a few things. We've had those arguments and…\n\nSen. Obama: And I've lost them all.\n\n60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft and President Barack Obama CBS News\n\nIt all seems like a long time ago.\n\nSteve Kroft: So what's the difference between this guy and the guy you are now? How much smarter are you than this guy standing on the street corner?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well, let's see. Obviously I'm grayer, a few more wrinkles. You know I'll be honest with you, Steve. One of the things I'm proud about is that I think my basic character and outlook actually have not changed much. And people who are closest to me will tell you that the guy who came here is the same guy who's leaving. And the reason I take pride for that is one of the things you worry about when you're in the bubble, and there's all this pomp and circumstance and hail to the chief is, do you lose touch with what you thought was important and what brought you here? And I'm proud that I don't think I have lost touch.\n\nSteve Kroft: If you had to write a brief description of this job beginning with wanted-- how would you describe the position? And what are the tasks? And what skills do you think you need?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Thick skin helps.\n\nSteve Kroft: Thick skin, stamina.\n\nPeople who are closest to me will tell you that the guy who came here is the same guy who's leaving. President Obama\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Stamina. There is a greater physical element to this job than you would think, just being able to grind it out. And I think your ability to not just mentally and emotionally, but physically be able to say, We got this. We're going to be OK.\n\nSteve Kroft: Did you learn the executive stuff on the job? Because when we first talked, I must have asked you 100 times. Your only executive experience was running the Harvard Law Review and running your own campaign. Did you have to learn a lot of this on the job?\n\nPresident Barack Obama and 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft CBS News\n\nPresident Barack Obama: The campaign was a more significant training ground than I think people give it credit for. By the time I got here, I think I had a pretty good sense of what was required. But the circumstances in which I came in were different than most executives, right? The enterprise was in the midst of a major crisis. And so, those first six months were a fire drill.\n\nBeside the two wars he inherited in Iraq and Afghanistan, and promised to end, a financial crisis at home had pushed the United States to the brink of another Great Depression. When we spoke with the new president in March of 2009, the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month, the government was throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at failing banks, and the auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Politically pummeled from all sides, Obama did his best to keep a sense of humor.\n\nPresident Obama: I just want to say that the only thing less popular than putting money into banks is putting money into the auto industry. So--\n\nSteve Kroft: But 18 percent are in favor, 76 percent against.\n\nPresident Obama: It's not a high number.\n\nSteve Kroft: You're sitting here and you're-- you are laughing about some of these problems. Are people going to look at this and say, I mean, he's sitting there just making jokes about money-- How do you deal with that?\n\nPresident Obama: No, no, no.\n\nSteve Kroft: I mean, wha-- explain the-- the-- the--\n\nPresident Obama: Well--\n\nSteve Kroft: The mood in your laughter.\n\nPresident Obama: Yeah, I mean, there's gotta be--\n\nSteve Kroft: Are you punch-drunk?\n\nPresident Obama: No, no, there's gotta be a little gallows humor to get you through the day.\n\nPresident Barack Obama participates in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft in the State Dining Room of the White House, Jan. 9, 2017. Chuck Kennedy, The White House\n\nA political candidacy built around hope and change and compromise would eventually become a presidency of crisis and confrontation.\n\nSteve Kroft: Is there anything that surprised you about this job?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I was surprised and continue to be surprised by the severity of partisanship in this town. And I think that I'd been warned about it. You'll remember, in the campaign back in 2007, 2008, people would say, Oh, he's being naïve. He thinks that there's no red states and blue states. And wait 'til he gets here. And I will confess that, I didn't fully appreciate the ways in which individual senators or members of Congress now are pushed to the extremes by their voter bases. I did not expect, particularly in the midst of crisis, just how severe that partisanship would be.\n\nSteve Kroft: You came into this office trying to unify the country. You said that many times during the campaign. You wanted to bring people together. You wanted to change Washington. You talked about transformative change. And you became the focal point for some of the division.\n\nI'm the first to acknowledge that I did not crack the code in terms of reducing this partisan fever. President Obama\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I became a lightning rod for some partisan battles. I could not be prouder of the track record we've put together. By almost every measure, the country is significantly better off than when I came in. If you can look back and say, The economy's better. Our security's better. The environment's better. Our kids' education is better, if you can say that you've made things better, then considering all the challenges out there, you should feel good. But I'm the first to acknowledge that I did not crack the code in terms of reducing this partisan fever.\n\nSteve Kroft: You didn't change Washington.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: You know, I changed those things that were in direct-- my direct control. I mean, I-- look, I'm proud of the fact that, with two weeks to go, we're probably the first administration in modern history that hasn't had a major scandal in the White House. In that sense, we changed some things. I would've liked to have gotten that one last Supreme Court justice in there. I'd like the Supreme Court to take a look at--\n\nSteve Kroft: You couldn't even get a hearing.\n\nPresident Barack Obama participates in a 60 Minutes interview with Steve Kroft in the Oval Office of the White House, Jan. 9, 2017. Pete Souza, The White House\n\nPresident Barack Obama: But we couldn't even get a hearing. Trying to get the other side of the aisle to work with us on issues, in some cases, that they professed, originally, an interest in, and saying to them, Hold on a second. You guys used to think this was a good idea. Now, just because I'm supporting it, you can't change your mind. But they did. And what that did, I think, made me appreciate. And I've said this before. But it's worth repeating. Because this is on me. Part of the job description is also shaping public opinion. And we were very effective, and I was very effective, in shaping public opinion around my campaigns. But there were big stretches, while governing, where even though we were doing the right thing, we weren't able to mobilize public opinion firmly enough behind us to weaken the resolve of the Republicans to stop opposing us or to cooperate with us. And there were times during my presidency where I lost the PR battle.\n\nAnd losing the PR battles, particularly about healthcare, translated into losing his Democratic majorities in Congress, beginning with a Republican landslide in the midterm election of 2010.\n\nSteve Kroft: There is this feeling in-- particularly among people who are among your hardened supporters—\n\nPresident Obama: Right.\n\nSteve Kroft: --who feel a little disappointed that they think that you've lost your mojo. That you've lost your ability, that touch you had during the campaign to inspire—\n\nPresident Obama: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: -- and lead that-- you know, everybody in Washington writes about the sort of aloofness that you have and I`m sure that drives you crazy. That you've let other people define you, that you haven`t sold your successes well enough?\n\nPresident Obama: I think it`s a fair argument, you know, I think that over the course of two years we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, you know leadership isn't just legislation, that it's a matter of persuading people and giving them confidence, and bringing them together and setting a tone.\n\nFor the next six years, there would be legislative gridlock, and by 2016, the people who had looked to Obama for change were looking somewhere else.\n\nSteve Kroft: Donald Trump, if you take away the particulars, was elected to the office, basically, on the same program that you were, of change. He wants to change Washington.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well, I mean that's a lot of particulars you're taking away. Fair enough.\n\nSteve Kroft: But do you think--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: He was a change candidate.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you think anybody can change Washington?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I think the American people can change Washington. But I think that it is not going to change, because somebody from on high directs that change. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, are motivated by all kinds of issues. They're sincerely interested in the economy, in terrorism, in social issues. But the one overriding thing they're interested in is getting reelected. And if they think that it's harder for them to get reelected by cooperating with each other, then they won't cooperate.\n\nSteve Kroft: A lot of people think the system is broken, that the system, the political system is broken. That seemed to be the message that you heard throughout this campaign.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well --\n\nSteve Kroft: And you seem to be saying, in some ways, maybe it is broken.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft CBS News\n\nPresident Barack Obama: In the first two years, when I had a strong majority in the House and the Senate, we were as productive as any administration has been since the '60s. I mean, we got a lot done. And so you can get a lot of stuff done through this system. But to sustain a governing majority, that requires an ability for Republicans and Democrats to find some common ground. And right now, the structure of the system is such where it makes it really hard for people to work together. And we mentioned, an example earlier, the Supreme Court nominations. I mean, the fact that Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans, was able to just stop a nomination almost a year before the next election and really not pay a political price for it, that's a sign that the incentives for politicians in this town to be so sharply partisan have gotten so outta hand that we're weakening ourselves.\n\nSteve Kroft: How serious do you think this is? I mean, how stable do you think that the political system, the democratic system, is?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Look, I think it's stable, because the framers, in their wisdom, designed the system so that power's pretty disbursed. You know, we have states. And we have cities. And we have counties. And we have the private sector. And-- and so the country still works even when Washington's dysfunctional. But the problem is that, over time, big pieces of business that have to get done without leadership from Washington, don't get done.\n\nSteve Kroft: I want to go back just briefly on this. But I think, look, this last election, you had a political system. Well, first of all the people elected somebody who went around saying that the system was rigged.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: You had two of the most unpopular presidential candidates selected by the two parties in history. Doesn't that say something's wrong, something serious is wrong?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: It indicates that there is a lot of cynicism out there. It indicates that the corrosive nature of everything from talk radio to fake news to negative advertising has made people lack confidence in a lot of our existing institutions. I think it indicates, at least on the Democratic side, that we've got more work to do to strengthen our grassroots networks. In some ways, the Democratic Party hadn't constructed itself to get that message out to the places it needed to get to. The Tea Party I have huge disagreements with, obviously. But I give them credit for having activated themselves. And they made a difference in terms of moving the Republican Party, in terms of moving the country in a particular direction. It's a direction I disagreed with. But it showed that, in fact, you get involved, if your voice is heard it has an impact.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you feel the same way about Donald Trump?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well I think that he clearly was able to tap into a lot of grievances. And he has a talent for making a connection with his supporters that overrode some of the traditional benchmarks of how you'd run a campaign or conduct yourself as a presidential candidate. What will be interesting to see is how that plays out during the course of his presidency. We are moving into an era where a lot of people get their information through tweets and sound bites and some headline that comes over their phone. And I think that there's a power in that. There's also a danger, what generates a headline or stirs up a controversy and gets attention isn't the same as the process required to actually solve the problem.\n\nSteve Kroft: You said you don't know how he's going to do when he governs, but we're in this transition period and one of the first things that he has done in this transition period is to pick a fight with the intelligence agencies. Do you think that that's a smart move?\n\nPresident Barack Obama CBS News\n\nPresident Barack Obama: You're not going to be able to make good decisions without building some relationship of trust between yourself and that community.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you see that happening?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Not yet, but, you know, again, he hasn't gotten sworn into office yet.\n\nWhen we come back, President Obama talks about one of the strangest transitions in White House history -- and he acknowledges some mistakes.\n\nAt the White House on Monday, crates and boxes lined the hallways and cluttered the East Room. Some carpets had been rolled up. Outside, there are bleachers on Pennsylvania Avenue and moving vans in the driveway – visual evidence that there's a transition underway.\n\nThis ritual of democracy, this peaceful transfer of power can be awkward under the best of circumstances. And these are not the best of circumstances for either the outgoing or incoming president.\n\nSteve Kroft: You have to admit that this is one of the strangest transitions in history.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: It's unusual. I'll agree with that. Well, I--\n\nSteve Kroft: I mean, he--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --and I suspect-- I suspect the president-elect would agree with that. Look--\n\nSteve Kroft: No, I--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --he is an unconventional candidate.\n\nSteve Kroft: Right.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I don't think there's anybody who's run a campaign like his successfully in modern history, not that I can think of. And, as a consequence because he didn't have the supports of many of the establishment in his own party, because he ran sort of an improvisational campaign--\n\nSteve Kroft: Can you run an improvisational presidency?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I don't think so. And so now he's in the process of building up an organization. And well, we'll have to see how that works. And it'll be a test, I think, for him and the people that he's designated to be able to execute on his vision.\n\nFirst of all, I think everybody has to acknowledge don't underestimate the guy, because he's going to be 45th president of the United States. President Obama\n\nSteve Kroft: Look, I think that the country deeply appreciates the fact that you have not spoken clearly, I think, probably what's on your mind in relation to the president-elect. But as you said earlier it's unusual. He seems to have spent a good deal of his time sending out tweets that, you know, that the United States must strengthen and expand its nuclear ability. That Meryl Streep is an overrated Hillary flunky. You're watching this like everybody else. I mean what's going on?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: You know, you're going to have to talk to him. But here's what I-- here's what I think. First of all, I think everybody has to acknowledge don't underestimate the guy, because he's going to be 45th president of the United States. The one thing I've said to him directly, and I would advise my Republican friends in Congress and supporters around the country, is just make sure that, as we go forward certain norms, certain institutional traditions don't get eroded, because there's a reason they're in place.\n\nOne thing both men have in common is a love of golf and a shared knowledge of the word mulligan, which means a do-over to replace a lousy shot.\n\nSteve Kroft: I mean you play golf.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I do.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you ever wish you had a mulligan? I mean in the eight years that you've had, if-- if you had-- if you had three or four mulligans would you use 'em?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah. You know, there's no doubt that probably at least once a week, maybe once a day, I said, Ah, I should have done that better. I bet at the end of this interview I'll say, Oh, that's-- that would have been a really good answer for that or this. I think we've done the big stuff right. I think that there are some big, obvious fumbles--\n\nSteve Kroft: Like?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --or shanks if you are using the--\n\nSteve Kroft: Right.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --golf analogy. Well, Healthcare.gov is a good example.\n\nSteve Kroft: Right.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: You know, if you know you got a controversial program, and you're setting up a really big, complicated website, website better work on the first day or first week or first month. The fact that it didn't obviously lost a little momentum. That was clearly a management failure.\n\nCritics of the administration would cite what they see as larger failures in the area of foreign policy particularly in the Middle East, which we grilled him about in an interview15 months ago.\n\nSteve Kroft: There is a perception in the Middle East that the United States is in retreat, that we've pulled our troops out of Iraq and ISIS has moved in and taken over much of that territory. The situation in Afghanistan is very precarious and the Taliban is on the march again.\n\nPresident Obama: I think it's fair to say, Steve, that if--\n\nSteve Kroft: It's -- Let me just finish the thought.\n\nPresident Obama: OK.\n\nSteve Kroft: They say you're projecting weakness, not strength--\n\nPresident Obama: You're-- you're-- you're-- you're saying they--\n\nSteve Kroft: I'm talking about--\n\nPresident Obama: You're-- you're not-- you're not citing too many folks, but-- but--\n\nSteve Kroft: No, I'll cite folks if you want me to.\n\nPresident Obama: But here's--\n\nSteve Kroft: I'd say the Saudis, I'd say the Israelis, I'd say a lot of our friends in the Middle East.\n\nPresident Obama: I--\n\nSteve Kroft: I'd say everybody--\n\nPresident Obama: Steve--\n\nSteve Kroft: Everybody in your-- everybody in the Republican Party. You want me to keep going?\n\nPresident Obama: Yeah, if you are—if you're citing the Republican Party, I think it's fair to say that there is nothing I've done right over the last seven and half years.\n\nBut even former members of his administration criticized the president for talking tough and not following through. In 2012, Obama told the Syrian government that the use of chemical weapons would cross a red line…\n\nObama: That, that's a red line for us.\n\nThat could provoke us military involvement. When they were used, the president responded not with force, but diplomacy, raising questions about his credibility.\n\nSteve Kroft: I want to go back to, like, 2012.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: I want to-- to two words. Red line.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: You didn't have to say that.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: And there have been reports that it wasn't in your speech.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: No, it wasn't.\n\nSteve Kroft: That you just sort of ad-libbed it. If you could pull – and it created – it created problems for you with the military people. Would you take those words back? You didn't have to say them.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah, look, if you're putting all the weight on that particular phrase, then in terms of how it was interpreted in Washington, I think you make a legitimate point. I've got to tell you, though, I don't regret at all saying that if I saw Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons on his people that that would change my assessments in terms of what we were or were not willing to do in Syria.\n\nSteve Kroft: But you didn't say that.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well--\n\nSteve Kroft: You said you drew the red line.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I-- look, I--\n\nSteve Kroft: I don't want to make too big a deal out of it, but--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I understand--\n\nSteve Kroft: --I think that-- but I--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I-- but that--\n\nSteve Kroft: --you think that that was--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --well--\n\nSteve Kroft: Would you take it back? If you had--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well--\n\nSteve Kroft: --the opportunity to take it back?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: The reason I'm hesitating is not to be defensive. It-- it's simply, Steve, that I would have I think made a bigger mistake if I had said, Eh, chemical weapons. That doesn't really change my calculus. I think it was important for me as president of the United States to send a message that in fact there is something different about chemical weapons. And, regardless of how it ended up playing, I think-- in the Beltway, what is true is Assad got rid of his chemical weapons. And the reason he got rid of 'em is--\n\nSteve Kroft: For a while.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --because-- well, look-- if 90 percent or 95 percent of those-- chemical stockpiles were eliminated, that's a lot of chemical weapons that are not right now in the hands of ISIL or Nusra or, for that matter, the regime.\n\nSteve Kroft: Israel.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: A few weeks ago you allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israel's settlements in the West Bank. It caused a major fallout between the United States and Israel. Was it your decision to abstain?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yes, ultimately.\n\nSteve Kroft: Why did you feel like you had to do that?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well, first of all, Steve, I don't think it caused a major rupture in relations between the United States and Israel. If you're saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu got fired up, he's been fired up repeatedly during the course of my presidency, around the Iran deal and around our consistent objection to settlements. So that part of it wasn't new. And despite all the noise and hullabaloo-- military cooperation, intelligence cooperation, all of that has continued. We have defended them consistently in every imaginable way. But I also believe that both for our national interests and Israel's national interests that allowing an ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that could get worse and worse over time is a problem. And that settlements contribute. They're not the sole reason for it, but they're a contributing factor to the inability to solve that problem. And--\n\nSteve Kroft: And you wanted to make that point?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Not only did I want to make that point. We are reaching a tipping where the pace of settlements, during the course of my presidency has gotten so substantial that it's getting harder and harder to imagine an effective, contiguous Palestinian state. And I think it would have long-term consequences for peace and security in the region, and the United States, because of our investment in the region, and because we care so deeply about Israel, I think has a legitimate interest in saying to a friend, This is a problem. And we've said it-- look, it's not as if we haven't been saying it from Day One. We've been saying it for eight years now. It's just that nothing seemed to get a lot of attention.\n\nWhen we return: the president discusses eight years in the Oval Office and life with his family in the White House.\n\nAfter our interview in the State Dining Room, President Obama invited us to the Oval Office where he had some things he wanted to show us, and some thoughts about his family's eight years in the Executive Mansion.\n\nSteve Kroft: What are you going to miss most about this place?\n\n60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft and President Barack Obama CBS News\n\nPresident Barack Obama: This walk is one of them.\n\nOn the way, he told us that his family life had thrived living and working under the White House roof, but that his wife and daughters didn't feel the same way about life in what Harry Truman called the finest prison in the world.\n\nSteve Kroft: How do they feel?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Ah, they're ready to go. I mean, the girls, obviously, you know, they are now of an age in which the constraints of Secret Service and bubbles and all that stuff has gotten pretty old. Michelle never fully took to the scrutiny. I mean, she's thrived as a first lady, but it's not her preference. And so--\n\nSteve Kroft: She was the hardest sell.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: She was the hardest sell. And she never fully embraced being in the public spotlight, which is ironic, given how good she is. Having said that she would acknowledge, and I certainly feel that we-- we just have a lot of memories here. You know, our kids grew up here. Some of our best friends have been made here in this place. There have been moments that were highlights for us-- that-- you know, are going to be hard to duplicate. So--\n\nSteve Kroft: She's glad you did it though?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: She is now. Ahhh, I think I've said this story before. You know, she used to say to our friends, Barack's exactly the kind of guy I want to be president. I just wish he didn't want to do it when I was married to him. So-- so now that we're--\n\nSteve Kroft: But you're still all right? I mean, everything's OK?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: So far, as far as I know. I better check later. Yeah.\n\nSteve Kroft: You have said you're going to take a big vacation. You're going to write your book. You're going to work on your library. You're going to set up a foundation. I mean, that sounds very professorial compared to what you've been doing, like the ivory tower equivalent of puttering around the garden. Are you going to be happy doing this?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well--\n\nSteve Kroft: Are you--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --look, I'm going to try to get some sleep. And do a little puttering. Because I haven't had a lot of chance to reflect and absorb all this. I do not expect to be behind a desk a lot. I look forward to teaching the occasional class, 'cause I was a professor. And I had fun doing it.\n\nSteve Kroft: You're not going to go to Wall Street, make a lot of money?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I'm not going to Wall Street. The amount of time that I'll be investing in issues is going to be high. But it'll be necessarily in a different capacity.\n\nSteve Kroft: Roosevelt's remembered for Social Security. Eisenhower is remembered for a speech about the military industrial complex. Ten years from now, what are they going to say about you? What are they going to remember you for?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: You know, I don't think you know now. I think you're not going to know until 10 years from now. I do think that, you know, saving the economy was a pretty big deal. We did a lot of stuff early that ended up having an impact. I believe that the work we've done in moving our energy future in a cleaner direction is going to stick even if some of the individual steps that we took are reversed by future administrations. I think that it's embedded itself in the economy. And we've been able to organize the international community around it in ways that aren't going to go back. I think we've set the bar with respect to the notion that it is possible to provide health care for people. Now I know that the incoming Congress and administration talks about repealing it. But we've set a bar that shows that this can be done. And that core principle is one that the majority of Americans, including supporters of Donald Trump believe in.\n\nSteve Kroft: What are your memories of this office? What's going to stick in your mind? What are you going to remember from here?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well I think the number of decisions that you make just with your advisers sitting here-- we've had some big powwows around, is the banking system about to collapse and what do we do about it? To questions of war and peace. So you remember the decisions that were made in this room. The objects in this room-- only a few of 'em I really attach to. I think that I'll always remember the bust of Dr. King. I thought having an American here who represented rhat civic spirit that got me into this office was useful. Over there I've got the original program for the March on Washington that was framed and given to me by a friend. You know, I'll remember the view out this window, because this is where we had our-- the playground that we put in when Malia and Sasha came in. Being able every once in awhile to look out the window and see your daughters during the summer, swinging on that swing set, that made the presidency a little bit sweeter.\n\nWhen Sasha and Malia Obama arrived at the White House in 2009, they were age 7 and 10. Their parents -- for the most part – were successful in keeping them out of the limelight, except in the rarest circumstances. In the fall, Malia begins at Harvard after a gap year. Sasha is a sophomore at her private school in Washington. This month, the swing set was dismantled and given away.\n\nSteve Kroft: You feel older?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah. You know, it's interesting. Physically, I feel probably as good as I've ever felt. And I've got as much energy as I ever did. But what you feel after eight years -- and I think you'd feel this no matter what, but anytime you have a big transition, it gets magnified – is time passes. Your kids grow up. I think they more than anything are making me feel as if, you know, you want to squeeze everything you got every single day out of this thing. Because it passes quick.\n\nSteve Kroft: You're having trouble letting go?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: No. I am looking forward to getting out of the bubble. I am glad that I'm leaving this place at a relatively young age, at 55. So I have the opportunity for a second maybe even a third act in a way that I think would be tougher if I were, you know, the age of some presidents when they left. There's some bittersweet feelings about leaving the people here. 'Cause even though all the team you assemble, you know, you're going to stay in touch with 'em, it's not the same, you know? The band kind of breaks up. And, I think I'm the best president I've ever been right now. And I think the team that is operating right now functions as well as any team that I've had. And so, you know, there is a part of you that thinks, Man, we're pretty good at this stuff right now. And you hate to see that talent disperse.\n\nSteve Kroft: You going to have reunions?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well, not I don't think we're go have, like, T-shirts and, you know, all that stuff. That sounds kind of sad. And so my-- so many of my staff is young enough that they're going to do amazing things. And I'm going to be helping them try to do them. So overall though, I have a deep appreciation for the wisdom of this guy right there, George Washington. It's good to get fresh legs in here. I think that it refreshes our democracy. It-- I think sustaining the pace over more than eight years is pretty tough.\n\nSteve Kroft: What are you going to do on the 21st when you wake up? I don't know where you're going to be when you wake up, but you're going to wake up someplace where you're not president.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well, here's one thing is I'm not setting my alarm. That, I'm certain of. That I am absolutely positive of. I'm going to spend time with Michelle. And, you know, we got some catching up to do. We've both been busy.\n\nSteve Kroft: You're going to be spending your own money, right?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Abs-- well, you know, the truth though is that we've been--\n\nSteve Kroft: Have you been spending your own-- when was the last time you--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I--\n\nSteve Kroft: --spent your own money?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Well, I will say this. You know, I mentioned how I've got a pretty thick skin in this job. You've got to have it. One thing that did kind of get under my craw sometimes was people talking as if when we went on vacation or--\n\nSteve Kroft: Right, right, right, right.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --you know, that people'd be like, Oh, spending taxpayer money. It's like, No, no, I actually I'm paying for all of this. The only thing I don't pay for is Secret Service and an airplane.\n\nSteve Kroft: And communications.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: And communications, 'cause I don't have any choice. But, you know, we buy our own toilet paper even here in the White House.\n\nSteve Kroft: Really?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: You know, we-- it's not free. I'm-- I've got a grocery bill at the end of every month. You know, our toothpaste, our, you know, our orange juice, that all gets paid. But I-- it is true that I don't carry my wallet that often. So I'm going to have some catching up to do in terms of how day-to-day things operate.\n\nSteve Kroft: It's not unusual for a president to issue an observation, Beware of this. Be wary of that. What is the thing that concerns you most right now, leaving office, about the country?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Making sure that our democracy stays healthy. And making sure that we maintain that sense of solidarity. Um, the thing that has disturbed me most about the Russian hacking episode is-- and the thing that surprised me most has not been the fact of Russian hacking, because Chinese, Russians, Iranians-- a lot of--\n\nSteve Kroft: The United States--\n\nPresident Barack Obama: The United-- well, the cyber world is full of information gathering, you know, propaganda, et cetera. I have been concerned about the degree to which, in some circles, you've seen people suggest that Vladimir Putin has more credibility than the U.S. government. I think that's something new.\n\nAnd I think it's a measure of how the partisan divide has gotten so severe that people forget we're on the same team.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: We go into the hallway here…\n\nThe president led us through a side door from the Oval Office into a short hallway and into his small private dining room. Here, the mementos were personal, far less formal.\n\nSteve Kroft: All this stuff is coming with you?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Absolutely. Well, not all of it. It-- I think--\n\nSteve Kroft: Hard packing up?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: I think, this famous--\n\nSteve Kroft: This is going to stay there, right?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: --painting of The Peacemakers, that goes with the territory.\n\nSteve Kroft: How much stuff are you going to take with you?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Not that much. I mean, you know, we got-- I got books, I got clothes, I got mementos like-- these that, you know, I cherish. We got some furniture that we purchased that, you know, we'll try to use in the new place.\n\nSteve Kroft: Do you like it, the new house?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: It's a nice-- it's a nice home. I mean--\n\nSteve Kroft: You've been there--?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah. It'll-- it's temporary. And--\n\nSteve Kroft: Two years?\n\nPresident Barack Obama: Yeah. But it feels like a home. You know, it's not crazy big but there's enough room for, you know, a treadmill and some workout equipment in the basement.\n\nMy fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. President Obama\n\nThe next day President Obama was back in Chicago where it all began to deliver his farewell address.\n\nObama in farewell address: My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won't stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. Thank you. God bless you. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you.\n\nPresident Obama, in all the times we were with him, seemed to savor the challenge of an interview. For him, it was an intellectual workout, something on par with a pickup basketball game, complete with a little trash talk.\n\nThere were never any restrictions on questions. No taboo topics.\n\nA year and half ago, there was a particularly contentious line of questioning about America's role in Syria. After it, we took a short break for a few sips of water. And when the cameras rolled again, the president was ready for more.\n\nPresident Obama: What else you got?\n\nTonight, at last, we have no more questions. I'm Steve Kroft. Next Sunday, here on CBS, the AFC Championship game. And we'll be back in two weeks with a brand new edition of 60 Minutes.
Barely hours after filing his intent with the FEC to run for the 2012 Republican nomination for president, Fred Karger stopped by Washington Unplugged to formally announce his decision.\n\nSpeaking with CBS News congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes Karger said, I've filed to run for President of the United States. (watch above)\n\nExplaining what brought him to this moment Karger said, It was the culmination of a lifetime of political work. It was a very exciting moment.\n\nThis is the first time Karger has run for political office, but he has been a behind-the-scenes player for 35 years -- serving as an advisor to Presidents Ford, Reagan and George H. W. Bush.\n\nKarger says he's an outsider but has political experience.\n\nHe is also the first openly gay presidential candidate. Cordes asked when so many of his fellow Republicans are opposed to gay rights and same-sex marriage why he would chose to run as a candidate of that same party.\n\nBeing a gay Republicans is kind of an oxymoron, he said, I have been a fighter in my party, I have always been on the more moderate side but I'm also a protégé of Lee Atwater. We need to open up this party and that's one of my reasons for running. The party should not be dominated by one faction or another. It should be open to all.\n\nKarger also added, I want to be a different kind of Republican. The kind of Republican I grew up with. I consider myself to be Progressive. The last Progressive Republican president was over 100 years ago; Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nKarger also weighed in with his thoughts on his potential opponents in the GOP race, taking particular aim at Newt Gingrich.\n\nHe's yesterday's news... and he's living in the past. I think we need some new, fresh leadership, he said.\n\nKarger also had some choice words for President Obama when it came to his leadership skills. As he told Cordes, The guy's been a disappointment. He's not a happy guy, he needs Zoloft. He's just not optimistic.\n\nKarger is still a long-shot and although he's thrown his hat in the ring, many of his would-be opponents have the instant name recognition that he lacks, but he remains optimistic.\n\nIn speaking about his hopes to take part in the Republican presidential debates he said, If I can get in one or more of these presidential debates, I will make history.\n\nWatch Karger explain why a gay candidate can win the GOP nomination.\n\nWatch Karger weigh in on his possible Republican opponents.\n\nWatch Karger explain how he would handle the crisis in Libya.
Joe Biden's campaign announced Monday they raised $80.8 million in May along with the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committee. CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reports that it's the most the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has raised to date during the 2020 presidential election cycle. According to the campaign, more than half of the donors last month were new contributors, signaling a surge in grassroots momentum, with more than 1.5 million new supporters joining the campaign in the last few weeks. The campaign also said the number of online donors has tripled since February. The average online donation in May was $30 and educators continue to be listed as the largest occupation group for donors.\n\nI'm humbled and honored that you have put your trust in me as your presumptive Democratic nominee. And I'm incredibly honored by the support I've received from you all, Biden wrote in an email to supporters. This cash haul comes as the Biden campaign has been furiously playing fundraising catch-up with President Trump's campaign's powerhouse fundraising. In April, the Biden campaign announced it and the DNC raised a combined $60.5 million, just behind the $61.7 million Mr. Trump and the RNC brought in that month. But the incumbent president maintained about a $100 million cash-on-hand advantage that month. Just a few months ago, people were ready to write this campaign off. Now, we are making huge dents in Donald Trump's war chest. Every single dollar is going to make sure he is only a one-term president, Biden wrote in Monday's email. Let's keep up that pressure.\n\nMr. Trump's campaign has not yet announced its cash haul for May. On Monday, Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted that the campaign had its single biggest online fundraising day ever the day before by bringing in $14 million to mark the president's birthday. That sum will show up in the second quarter totals. Presidential campaigns and parties face a monthly June 20 filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission. The second fundraising quarter ends on June 30.\n\nMeanwhile, ActBlue, which is used by Democrats and progressive groups to raise funds, announced it brought in $178 million through its platform in May. The cash haul came from 5.2 million contributions, making it the third largest month for the number of contributions and unique donors. The average May contribution was just $34. According to ActBlue, Senate and House candidates raised $52 million using the platform in May, and twice as many people have given to Senate and House candidates last month as did in May 2018 before the midterm election. Congressional candidates face a second quarter filing with the FEC in mid-July. At the same time, State House and State Senate candidates also raised nearly double the amount of money in May as in April 2020 signaling a growing interest in down-ballot races. This comes as state legislatures are set to play a major role in redistricting following the 2020 census.\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nBiden called Monday's LGBTQ Supreme Court decision a momentous step forward for our country, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. Heralded as the highest-level politician in 2012 to publicly support same-sex marriage, Biden said in a statement that everyone should be able to live openly, proudly, as their true selves without fear. On the trail, Biden frequently spoke out about LGBTQ firings and has been critical of the Trump administration's policies related to LGBTQ Americans, as he did last week after some healthcare protections under the Affordable Care Act were rolled back for LGBTQ Americans. Regarding another social issue, the former VP was endorsed by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund on Monday. The abortion-rights group pressured Biden a year ago to reverse his support of the federal Hyde Amendment, which prevents tax payer dollars to be used for abortions. He switched that position then and today accepted the endorsement, pledging to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care, including reproductive health care.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nAhead of his first rally in over three months, President Trump downplayed the risks of hosting tens of thousands of his supporters in an indoor arena on Saturday night in downtown Tulsa amid the coronavirus pandemic. Oklahoma's at a very low number. They've done really fantastic work, Mr. Trump told reporters following a roundtable on Monday afternoon. Mr. Trump spoke with Oklahoma Governor Stitt on Monday, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports. We have a 22,000 seat arena, but I think we're also going to take the convention hall next door and that's going to hold 40,000 so we'll have 22,000 plus 40,000 people. The location of the rally, the Bank of Oklahoma Arena, fits approximately 20,000 people, but according to their official website, the adjoining Cox Business Center accommodates just under 9,000. I can tell you on COVID or coronavirus, whatever you want to call it - plenty of names - tremendous progress is being made, Mr. Trump said Monday. This week, Oklahoma counts itself among over a dozen U.S. states battling spikes in new coronavirus cases. State officials on Monday reported 186 new cases of COVID-19, once again marking a new high in daily increases for both the state and Tulsa County. The Oklahoma State Department of Health have reported 1,653 confirmed coronavirus cases in Tulsa County since the pandemic broke out. According to Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, each attendee at Mr. Trump's rally will receive a temperature check, hand sanitizer and mask before entry. Masks handed out to rally attendees will be optional, per a campaign spokesperson. The head of the Tulsa Health Department said he wishes an upcoming rally held by the Trump campaign would be postponed amid the surge in new coronavirus cases in the county. In an interview with Tulsa World, Dr. Bruce Dart, director of the Tulsa Health Department, said an indoor rally set to attract tens of thousands of Mr. Trump's supporters is a huge risk factor. Dart added that COVID is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently…I wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isn't as large a concern as it is today. It is remains unclear if the campaign will implement further social distancing measures both inside and outside the arena, with thousands of overflow expected.\n\nVEEPSTAKES\n\nELIZABETH WARREN\n\nOver 100 progressive leaders, activists, scholars and celebrities are urging Joe Biden to pick Senator Elizabeth Warren as his running mate. CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says that in a letter to Biden, the groups outlined six arguments for Warren as VP, ranging from her policy ideas to her ability to explain complex government functions. Elizabeth Warren has proven herself most prepared to be president if the occasion arises and deeply expert on the overlapping emergencies now plaguing America – COVID-19, Economic Insecurity, Racial Injustice and Climate Change, the letter reads. It also argued that Warren is the best option to unite the party. Among the best-known signers are actors Jane Fonda and Alan Cumming, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and activist Ady Barkan. The letter also pushed back on the idea that Warren's Senate seat would be in jeopardy if she were chosen because Massachusetts has a Republican governor who would appoint her temporary successor. The letter accurately noted that the Democratic super majority in the state House and Senate there could, as it has in the past, vote to change the rule. The letter, which was first reported by The Washington Post, was provided to CBS News by former New York City Public Advocate Mark Green, who spearheaded the effort. He said that he did not speak with Warren or her team about the letter, but that he saw a need for her case to be made. She's a once in a generation talent, he said. But she's pretty humble. That's the Oklahoma side. She's not going to hustle for it, and some of the others will.\n\nWarren and a group of Democratic lawmakers on Monday introduced a bill to strengthen oversight of the federal government's pandemic response. The Coronavirus Oversight and Recovery Ethics (CORE) Act, which would require the president to inform Congress about the removal of any acting inspector general, comes after Mr. Trump fired or replaced nearly a half dozen watchdogs in April and May. Warren, along with Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Coons as well as Representatives Pramila Jayapal and John Sarbanes, proposed a draft of the bill last month, but officially introduced it Monday with 26 Democratic Members of Congress joining as co-sponsors. The bill would expand the authority of the Congressional Oversight Commission to include the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program and give the Commission subpoena power. It would also require White House task force members working on pandemic aid to disclose their financial interests and ban companies receiving pandemic aid from spending money on lobbying for at least a year. Congress must pass our bill in the next relief package to hold the Trump administration accountable as they hand out trillions of dollars in response to the COVID-19 crisis, Warren said in a statement. The bill would also hold senior executives at companies receiving pandemic aid personally liable if they fail to meet employment requirement\n\nLEGAL MATTERS\n\nLGBTQ CIVIL RIGHTS\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that it is illegal for an employer to fire someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, delivering a major victory in the fight for civil rights for LGBTQ people, CBS News digital reporter Melissa Quinn reports. The court's 6-3 ruling extends the scope of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion, to include LGBTQ people. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch, who authored the majority's opinion, joined the liberal wing of the bench in ruling that an employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender violates Title VII. Gorsuch wrote, Judges are not free to overlook plain statutory commands on the strength of nothing more than suppositions about intentions or guesswork about expectations. He continued, In Title VII, Congress adopted broad language making it illegal for an employer to rely on an employee's sex when deciding to fire that employee. We do not hesitate to recognize today a necessary consequence of that legislative choice: An employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender defies the law.Mr. Trump called the ruling, very powerful at the White House, Monday afternoon, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports. We live with the decision of the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump said, later adding, They have so ruled.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nNEW YORK\n\nThe state's 16th district is slated to be the most competitive primary to watch next Tuesday. Progressive Jamaal Bowman is looking to unseat 31-year-incumbent Eliot Engel and picked up the endorsement of California Congresswoman Katie Porter on Monday. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro reports the campaign also announced they'd raised more than $750,000 in the month of June alone. Engel, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has picked up more Democrat establishment support, with endorsements from Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressmen Adam Schiff of California and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina.\n\nVIRGINIA\n\nAfter an unorthodox drive-thru convention on Saturday, ex-Liberty University employee Bob Good has claimed victory against Congressman Denver Riggleman, winning 58% of the approximately 2,537 delegates who voted in the adapted drive-thru convention vote on Saturday. Pending a challenge to the results from Riggleman, he would be the third House incumbent to be unseated in a primary this cycle. The other two are Dan Lipinski of Illinois and Steve King of Iowa. Saturday's convention was held in the parking lot of Tree of Life Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, near Good's home, where registered delegates voted in their cars. Riggleman, a Republican freshman who faced scrutiny from some local Republicans for officiating a gay wedding, claimed ballot irregularities as the results were being calculated. At some point, we really have to look at how these votes were actually counted and what the processes were, Riggleman told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro in his first interview since Saturday. For only 2,500 people to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of people like this is really egregious. In response to Riggleman's claim, Good said when results were called, That's what losers say. Riggleman said he's still weighing his option on whether to challenge the results and claimed Good paid committee members to push for a convention rather than a primary. Democrats anticipated a Good win to make this seat, which Trump won by double digits, more competitive. Good is seen as a poor fundraiser and a more polarizing social conservative that Democrats could campaign against, and four Democrats will have a primary for this seat on June 23: entrepreneur and past 2018 primary candidate R.D. Huffstetler, local school board member John Lesinski, veteran Claire Russo and healthy policy instructor at the University of Virginia Cameron Webb. The last Democrat to win this seat was Tom S.P. Perriello in 2008.\n\nIN THE SENATE\n\nGEORGIA\n\nOne Democratic candidate running in Georgia's special senate election is receiving national attention. Reverend Raphael Warnock, the pastor of Atlanta's famous Ebenezer Baptist Church (the church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was once the pastor), received endorsements from five sitting U.S. senators and former presidential candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Michael Bennet all announced their support for Warnock, according to CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. In a statement Warnock praised the senators for their leadership and support and said, I look forward to joining them in the United States Senate and continuing my service to Georgians and working people. Warnock is currently in a crowded special election race for the Senate seat currently held by Senator Kelly Loeffler. Loeffler also faces a Republican primary opponent in her race, Congressman Doug Collins. The special election date is set for November 3 with a potential runoff scheduled for January 5, 2021.\n\nKENTUCKY\n\nEarly in-person voting has started this week in Kentucky for the state's primary next Tuesday, and one contest to watch will be the Democratic Senate primary for who will take on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in November, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath has led the field in fundraising, but in recent weeks Kentucky State Representative Charles Booker has earned the endorsements of the Louisville Courier-Journal, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. McGrath has been criticized in ads from both sides for either being too Democratic or too pro-Trump. Booker's campaign released an ad called Real Democrat in which he promises to fight for real change. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has endorsed McGrath and many of the former presidential candidates like Senators Warren and Harris supported McGrath when she initially launched her Senate campaign last summer.\n\nAND IN CASE YOU MISSED IT…\n\nCBS News campaign reporters Tim Perry and Jack Turman joined CBSN over the weekend to talk about their latest reporting on Louisiana and Minnesota for CBS News COVID Chronicles, which reports what has changed for the lives of residents in some of the biggest battleground states in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Watch here.
Fewer millennials are getting married than in previous generations, but those who are tying the knot share one important trait: money.\n\nNot even 4 out of 10 millennials were married in 2016, compared with almost 6 out of 10 young adults in the late 1980s, representing a generational shift away from the altar, a recent paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis notes.\n\nMillennials are far more likely to be living with a partner or to be single then their parents at their age, in other words, and their generation's shift away from marriage may be less a matter of choice and more the result of economic factors that have made the institution less approachable. Young adults born between 1981 and 1996 have remarkably similar tastes as previous generations -- they're just much poorer, the data show, and that's putting marriage out of reach for all except the wealthiest of their generation.\n\nMillennials who are getting married tend to have more wealth than in previous generations, the St. Louis Fed noted. Millennials who are married have median assets of $91,000, compared with $63,000 for the same age group in 1989 on an inflation-adjusted basis, the study found. Married millennial households also have half the student loan debt as single millennials, the study found.\n\nWhich comes first: the marriage or the money?\n\nThat raises the question about whether marriage itself places millennials on a better financial footing, or whether those millennials who get hitched are already well off. One marriage expert says it's the latter.\n\nMillennial women who have achieved professional success feel they are in a better place to start looking for a marriage partner, according to Sami Wunder, a love and relationship coach who works with women.\n\nThe women of today are not getting married for money, Wunder said. She's financially secure and then she gets married for love or because she finds a man she knows she can share a life with. She chooses a partner who is a match to her.\n\nRich marrying the rich\n\nAs Wunder suggests, Americans increasingly are pairing up with partners who match them on a number of issues, including wealth and education. That's leading to assortative mating, or when people pick spouses who have similar backgrounds.\n\nThat could also be boosting the wealth of married millennials compared with earlier generations. For instance, because college-educated adults are more likely to pair up with other college grads, that's super-charging their income and wealth, especially since the economy is handing bigger income gains to college-educated workers than to high-school grads.\n\nAlthough people say they marry for love, the economic pressures on the millennial generation appear to weigh on their ability -- or willingness -- to get hitched, the Census found last year.\n\nSingle women who haven't managed to carve out a career may have a harder time finding a marriage partner, Wunder said. But women who are ready to get married typically have ticked off the boxes in terms of education, wealth and stability, she added.\n\nIt's a very well thought out decision, she said of her clients. If they are marrying, the desire is there to make it last and make it work.
The family of a Michigan man deported to Mexico are blaming a legal blunder for his removal. Immigration officials forced Jorge Garcia, who has lived in the U.S. for about 30 years, to return to Mexico this week. He has an American wife and two children. CBS News' Anna Werner spoke with the family who says they will fight to get him back to the U.S.\n\nThe Garcia family had been back and forth with immigration officials since the Obama administration. So although their concerns over deportation didn't start with the Trump presidency, the new administration's change in its approach to enforcement means those fears have now become reality.\n\nAfter 15 years of marriage, Cindy Garcia had to say goodbye to her husband. Her children had to part from their father. Cindy said it was devastating.\n\nWe did not want to let him go. We said our goodbyes, we told him we love you, we're going to miss you, but you don't want to let someone go that you love. It's very hard, she said.\n\n\n\nGarcia has lived in the U.S. since an uncle brought him here from Mexico at 10 years old.\n\nHe and Cindy married in 2002 and began trying to get him on the path to citizenship through proper legal channels, but she says their first lawyer did not follow the right immigration procedures.\n\n\n\nJorge was exposed to ICE because of this application that should not have been filed, said Diego Bonesatti of Michigan United Legal Services.\n\nJorge Garcia's family. CBS News\n\nGarcia was ordered removed. During the Obama administration, ICE granted stays several times while the couple worked to resolve his residency issues. Then President Trump came into office. Suddenly, Garcia was told he had to go.\n\nICE told CBS News in a statement, that the agency exercised prosecutorial discretion on multiple prior occasions in Garcia's case, but that anyone violating immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and…removal from the United States.\n\n\n\nI understand that the president wants to protect our borders. But at the same time, if my husband was brought here as a child, he has no criminal record, each individual case needs to be looked at because we try to do the right thing. It's not like we didn't. We tried, Cindy said.\n\nSo what do you say to people out there who say you know what, he came to this country illegally, so tough luck? Werner asked.\n\nWhat I'd like to tell them is he came at 10 years old, so somebody brought him into the country. So there was nothing he possibly could have done, she said. There will be no ICE coming to the door to try and deport me because I am a U.S. citizen. There's nothing ICE can do to shut me up.\n\nThe Garcia family expects to be apart from Jorge or at least 18 months, until they hope to get him an appointment with a U.S. Consulate in Mexico. But delays in these cases often go on for years, and it's anyone's guess as to when – or if – he will ever be allowed to return to the U.S.
HARMONY, N.C. -- Naomi Wooten, 98, has only walked down the aisle once before. She was 28 when she married Claude, whom she met on a blind date.\n\nHe was in the Panama Canal and he wrote me a letter and asked if i'd marry him, she explained. He sent me a diamond ring through the mail.\n\nTheir marriage lasted 64 years.\n\nI loved him, I loved that man, Naomi said.\n\nNaomi Wooten CBS News\n\nAfter Claude's death, Naomi never dreamed she would walk down the aisle again. But out of nowhere, came a proposal, this time to be matron of honor for 23-year-old Bethany Shaw. Naomi met Bethany at church where her father is the pastor. The two became friends and Naomi has even known Bethany's fiance since he was a boy. Despite all of that, Naomi said no.\n\nI'm not going to be matron of honor, i'm too old, Naomi said.\n\nBut after awhile, she came around. Naomi even invited guests of her own, who didn't even know the bride and groom.\n\nNaomi Wooten served as matron of honor for her friend, Bethany Shaw CBS News\n\nIf somebody asks me whether I was gonna sit on the bride's side or the grooms side, I was gonna say neither, I'm on Ms. Naomi's side, said one guest.\n\nOn Sunday, with a flower on her walker and a smile on her face, Naomi Wooten made her way down the aisle, and shared nearly a century of wisdom.\n\nIf you don't have love, forget it, said Naomi. This couple has got it.
When you're ready to search for professional money help, a smorgasbord of options will appear before you: financial planning; credit counseling; money coaching; burdening your nightstand with a teetering pile of self-help books.\n\nFinancial therapy is one of the newest additions to the field, emerging from a small forum for mental health and financial planning professionals in 2008. While certified financial planners help you develop and implement concrete financial strategies, and mental health professionals help you recognize and change thought patterns that aren't serving you, financial therapists straddle both worlds. They focus on your relationship with money and how it affects your behavior so you can realize your financial goals.\n\nMoney comes with a lot of emotional baggage, and there just aren't many places to talk about it openly and constructively, says Dr. Mary Gresham, a financial psychologist in Atlanta.\n\nIf you struggle with saving, budgeting, paying off debt, severe frugality or other money issues, financial therapy could help. Here's how to assess whether it makes sense for you, and how to evaluate any professionals you may work with.\n\nWhen to go to a financial therapist\n\nFinancial therapy can help you understand why you're stuck in the same patterns, such as overspending, even if you've tried to change. It also can help you explore the feelings that bubble up when you think about money. Gresham and Derek Lawson, a doctoral student in personal financial planning with a focus on financial therapy at Kansas State University, say financial therapy might be the right call if:\n\n1) Your finances make you feel depressed or anxious\n\n2) You're consistently spending more than you earn or aren't saving any money\n\n3) You've tried to change those behaviors, with no luck\n\n4) You want to understand the root of your money troubles\n\nIn some cases, other experts could better suit you. Try traditional financial planning if you want straight money advice you're fairly certain you can implement on your own. If you're dealing with a mountain of debt and urgently need an action plan, try credit counseling. Gresham says she refers her clients to these financial pros when necessary.\n\nWhat financial therapy looks like\n\nAt your first few sessions, a financial therapist might ask you, What are your best hopes for your financial future? and How would you know if these hopes were realized?\n\nI might have a couple of meetings with clients before I analyze their financials, says Lawson, who is also a financial planner at Priority Financial Partners in Durango, Colorado.\n\nLawson says he'll ask clients who have trouble saving to focus on a time in the past when they did save and how they felt. That positive emotional memory may encourage clients to integrate saving into their lives more frequently.\n\nHow to find a financial therapist\n\nBecause there are few formal places to study financial therapy, practitioners today typically have either a mental health background and an understanding of financial issues, or a financial planning background and further training in mental health counseling. (Kansas State University and the University of Georgia offer financial therapy studies, and the Financial Therapy Association plans to develop a certification in three to five years, says president-elect Sarah Asebedo, who is also assistant professor of personal financial planning at Texas Tech University.)\n\nYou can use the Financial Therapy Association's member directory or do a general online search to find financial therapists or financial psychologists near you. The XY Planning Network lists financial planners who work with clients in their 20s and 30s. It's best to work with fee-only financial planners, who charge flat or hourly fees and won't earn commissions on insurance or investment products, like mutual funds, that they might recommend you buy. This type of planner may be more affordable than one who charges based on a percentage of your assets he or she is managing.\n\nCheck each professional's background and training: Ideally, they'll have both the certified financial planner designation and licensure as a mental health counselor, marriage and family therapist, social worker or psychologist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NerdWallet.
Gay rights and religion are at the heart of a simmering feud between Vice President Mike Pence and potential Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is openly gay, criticized Pence Friday for his opposition to gay marriage and gay rights, which Pence claims is informed by his Christian faith.\n\nI don't have a problem with religion, I'm religious too. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people, he said on Ellen.\n\nI hope that Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith or attacks on the president as he seeks the highest office in the land, Pence said.\n\nThe vice president said he doesn't believe in discriminating against anyone.\n\nI think Pete's quarrel is with the First Amendment. All of us in this country have the right to our religious beliefs, Pence said.\n\nLast month, Buttigieg began raising questions about the vice president, whom he worked with when Pence was governor of Indiana.\n\nHow could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn star presidency? Is is that he -- is that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump, Buttigieg said.\n\nIn 2015, when both men were serving in Indiana, Pence signed a law that critics say unfairly targeted members of the LGBTQ community. At the time, Buttigieg was just months from coming out as gay. The law was eventually rolled back amid a national outcry.\n\nToday, Buttigieg is surging in the polls, placing third in both Iowa and New Hampshire. He's an Afghanistan war veteran and a Harvard grad, with a famously tricky last name.\n\nAfter more than three months of officially exploring a run, Buttigieg formally filed paperwork to run for president. He's expected to officially kick off his campaign Sunday in South Bend.
Disney is hosting its first-ever official pride event to celebrate the LGBTQ community. Magical Pride will take place at Disneyland Paris on June 1 to kick off Pride Month.\n\nDress like a dream, feel fabulous and experience Walt Disney Studios Park like never before - loud, proud and alive with all the colours of the rainbow, Disneyland Paris says on its website.\n\nWhile unofficial Magical Pride events have taken place at the park since 2014, this is the first official pride event organized by Disney, a Magical Pride organizer told CBS News via email. There will be a parade through the streets of Walt Disney Studio Park.\n\nThe event also boasts late-night access to the park, a dance party and many more magical surprises, according to Disneyland Paris.\n\nLast year, Disney introduced rainbow Mickey ears at its parks. The Mickey Mouse Rainbow Love hat became available for purchase just before last year's Pride Month.\n\nIn 2007, the company opened Cinderella's Castle to same-sex weddings. The Walt Disney Company had originally limited its Fairy Tale Wedding program to couples with valid marriage licenses. Same-sex marriage was not legal in most places at the time, but Disney decided to make ceremonies at its parks available to gay couples.
YouTube star Jake Paul faces charges after he allegedly participated in an unlawful protest at an Arizona mall over the weekend. Paul, 23, has been charged with criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly, the Scottsdale Police Department announced Thursday.\n\nPolice said they received hundreds of tips and videos identifying Paul as a participant in the demonstration at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall on Saturday. Police said Paul was present at the mall after the protest was declared an unlawful assembly and rioters were ordered to leave. He also illegally entered the mall when it was closed.\n\nIn response, Paul tweeted Thursday, gimme my charges and let's put the focus back on George Floyd and Black Lives Matter.\n\ngimme my charges and let's put the focus back on George Floyd and Black Lives Matter https://t.co/nwBZmsxFFz — Jake Paul (@jakepaul) June 4, 2020\n\nPaul denied that he engaged in any looting or vandalism despite being seen with friends on video as people around them appeared to be damaging property. Demonstrators all over the country continued to protest the death of George Floyd over the weekend, calling for an end to police violence.\n\nTo be absolutely clear, neither I nor anyone in our group was engaged in any looting or vandalism, Paul said in a statement Sunday. He claimed that he and his friends spent the day doing our part to peacefully protest Floyd's death and claimed they were tear-gassed for filming the protests.\n\nWe filmed everything we saw in an effort to share our experience and bring more attention to the anger felt in every neighborhood we traveled through; we were strictly documenting, not engaging, he added. I do not condone violence, looting or breaking the law.\n\nPaul said he understands the anger and frustration that led to the destruction we witnessed.\n\nMultiple videos showing Paul and his group at the Arizona mall surfaced on Twitter late Saturday and into Sunday morning. New York Times Reporter Taylor Lorenz was one of many who shared the viral videos on the platform. She claimed the footage showed Paul and his friends 'looting' and trashing property in a Scottsdale mall last night amid protests.\n\nMuch of the footage appears to be Instagram stories posted by Paul's photographer/videographer, Andrew Blue. Blue also put out a statement on his Instagram stories denying their party took part in the alleged looting or vandalism.\n\nThe viral videos appear to show Paul walking around both the outside and the inside of the mall wearing a white face mask with a red stripe. Multiple people are seen on camera damaging the property, walking into stores and running around.\n\nThe footage doesn't clearly show if Paul did or didn't participate in the alleged vandalism or take anything from the businesses.\n\nPaul is no stranger to public incidents and viral moments. He recently admitted his brief supposed marriage to YouTube star Tana Mongeau last year was fake, after speculation the nuptials were a publicity stunt, according to Entertainment Tonight. Earlier this year, Paul alleged he and former One Direction member Zayn Malik, had a tense interaction in Las Vegas. Malik's model girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, later called Paul out on Twitter for his comments, reports ET.
J.K. Rowling has issued a statement in response to accusations that she made anti-trans and transphobic comments on Twitter last weekend, following intense backlash. In the lengthy statement, the Harry Potter author defends her most recent comments, discusses her history of controversial opinions about the transgender community, and opens up about a traumatic part of her personal past.\n\nThis isn't an easy piece to write, for reasons that will shortly become clear, but I know it's time to explain myself on an issue surrounded by toxicity, the writer began in a statement posted on her website Wednesday. I write this without any desire to add to that toxicity.\n\nThe author noted that she has been receiving accusations and threats from trans activists on Twitter for years, including blowback over her support for the researcher Maya Forstater in December. Forstater lost her job and an employment court case in the U.K. due to a series of tweets in which she disputed the gender identity of trans people.\n\nRowling said she had stepped back from Twitter until recently, when she wanted to share her new children's book The Ickabog. Upon her return, she said she was immediately called a TERF, an acronym for a trans-exclusionary radical feminist — an accusation she said has been used to intimidate others. Rowling initially announced her Wednesday statement with a tweet that simply read, TERF wars.\n\nIn the essay, Rowling then elaborated on the five reasons she is worried about the new trans activism and why she decided to speak out on the matter.\n\nThe first reason is her concern for the future of the causes she supports, many of which have an emphasis on providing support to women and children. The second is her worries about the trans rights movement's impact on education and safeguarding. And the third concern is defending freedom of speech.\n\nHer final concerns become more personal, however.\n\nIn explaining her fourth worry, the author expressed concern about what she calls a huge explosion in young women wishing to transition — some of whom, she asserts, later regret the move and seek to detransition. She even pondered if she would have tried to transition in her youth if it were an option, due to her struggle with mental health issues and the sexualised scrutiny and judgement that sets so many girls to war against their bodies in their teens.\n\nThe allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge, she writes. If I'd found community and sympathy online that I couldn't find in my immediate environment, I believe I could have been persuaded to turn myself into the son my father had openly said he'd have preferred.\n\nRowling wrote about her concern that teens experiencing gender dysphoria may transition and then grow out of their dysphoria. She does, however, acknowledge that transition will be a solution for some gender dysphoric people.\n\nRowling laments that society today is in the most misogynistic period I've experienced, and cites trans activists who declare that TERFs need punching and re-educating as one of the many reasons this is so.\n\nEverywhere, women are being told to shut up and sit down, or else, Rowling writes. I've read all the arguments about femaleness not residing in the sexed body, and the assertions that biological women don't have common experiences, and I find them, too, deeply misogynistic and regressive.\n\nShe added, It isn't enough for women to be trans allies. Women must accept and admit that there is no material difference between trans women and themselves.\n\nHer statement echoed the opinion she expressed in her controversial tweets this weekend about sex and gender identity.\n\nOn Saturday, the author took issue with the wording of a headline for an opinion article which read, Opinion: Creating a more equal post-COVID-19 world for people who menstruate. The article was written for the outlet Devex.\n\n\n\n'People who menstruate.' I'm sure there used to be a word for those people, Rowling tweeted Saturday. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?\n\n\n\nIn her new statement, she explained why she took issue with that headline: The 'inclusive' language that calls female people 'menstruators' and 'people with vulvas' strikes many women as dehumanising and demeaning.\n\nTwitter users, and Harry Potter himself, actor Daniel Radcliffe, swiftly criticized the tweet for appearing to define a woman as a person who has a menstrual period and equivocating one's sex or sex organs with their gender identity.\n\nIn her final point in the essay, Rowling opened up about her experience with domestic abuse and sexual assault, and her violent first marriage — a topic she said she has never discussed publicly. She explained, due to that experience, that when she learns of a trans woman dying at the hands of a violent man, she feels solidarity and kinship.\n\nTrans people need and deserve protection, Rowling wrote. She added, Like every other domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor I know, I feel nothing but empathy and solidarity with trans women who've been abused by men.\n\nHowever, she added that while she wants trans women to be safe, she does not want to make natal girls and women less safe. She appeared to specifically criticize Scottish legislation that would make it easier for a person to obtain legal recognition of their gender identity, according to the BBC.\n\nWhen you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman… then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth, Rowling said, though supporters of the legislation dispute that.\n\nRowling went on to say that while she faces criticism for speaking her mind on the subject, instead of tweeting the approved hashtags, she will not stop speaking out on the current movement.\n\nI have a complex backstory, which shapes my fears, my interests and my opinions. I never forget that inner complexity when I'm creating a fictional character and I certainly never forget it when it comes to trans people, she concluded.All I'm asking — all I want — is for similar empathy, similar understanding, to be extended to the many millions of women whose sole crime is wanting their concerns to be heard without receiving threats and abuse.\n\nThe LGBTQ organization GLAAD issued a statement in response to Rowling's essay shortly after it published Wednesday.\n\nIt seems JK is good at only one thing: writing fantasy. Her misinformed and dangerous missive about transgender people flies in the face of medical and psychological experts and devalues trans people accounts of their own lives, a GLAAD spokesperson told CBS News. And to all the trans and cisgender youth raised on her books who are now loudly speaking up in support of the trans people you know and love, you are the future and we can't wait to read and watch the beautiful art you will create.\n\nThe organization also spoke out about Rowling's initial tweets this weekend on Twitter, calling her comments anti-trans and encouraging its followers to channel their rightful anger by supporting organizations that help black trans people.
RALEIGH, N.C. - A federal judge has dismissed a challenge to a North Carolina law that allows magistrates to refuse to marry same-sex couples by citing religious beliefs.\n\nThe judge in Asheville dismissed a lawsuit filed by three couples​, two gay and one interracial. The judge ruled that the couples lacked legal standing as taxpayers to sue and lacked evidence showing they were harmed directly by the law taking effect in June 2015. Still, U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn wrote there is potential someone could suffer real harm because of the law.\n\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers filed a notice Wednesday that they'll appeal Tuesday's ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nNorth Carolina is one of only two states (the other being Utah) with such religious-objection laws that are being enforced. About 5 percent of North Carolina's magistrates have filed recusal notices. In North Carolina, any official's decision to opt out applies to all marriages - same-sex and heterosexual - for at least six months.\n\nThe law was pushed by Republicans and passed in mid-2015 over the veto of GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. Backers of the law said that it protects religious freedom and that government employees should be allowed religious accommodation if marrying same-sex couples runs counter to their beliefs.\n\nThe lawsuit focused primarily on the magistrate exception, arguing that it treats gay and lesbian couples differently, in violation of the equal-protection provision in the Constitution. The lawsuit also puts religious belief above the obligations of magistrates to carry out laws they swore to uphold, critics say.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the lawsuit included two same-sex couples. One of them, Kay Diane Ansley and Catherine Cathy McGaughey, helped overturn in court North Carolina's 2012 constitutional ban​. The third couple, a white woman and black man, successfully sued in the mid-1970s when Forsyth County magistrates refused to marry them on religious grounds, according to the lawsuit.
On Friday night, 88-year-old Holocaust survivor Arie Even died after contracting coronavirus, his family said. Even became Israel's first coronavirus fatality, the Los Aangeles Times reports.\n\nNone of Even's children or 18 grandchildren were able to visit him the week before he died due to social distancing rules, according to Times, which spoke with three of his children. Even's children remembered his strong values.\n\nHumanism was in his DNA, his daughter Ofra said.\n\nHe believed profoundly in equality, in civil rights, his daughter Yael added. He believed that this land belonged to all of its citizens.\n\nArie Even's daugher, Ofra, said her father didn't speak about the Holocaust much. Only in the last few years, I'd spend Holocaust Day with him and we began talking about it, she said in the call with the LA Times. Even Family via LA Times\n\nOfra said her father didn't speak about the Holocaust much. Only in the last few years, I'd spend Holocaust Day with him and we began talking about it, she said in the call with the LA Times.\n\nEven was born in Budapest in 1932 as George Steiner. He was the eldest son in an affluent family and said his mother's resourcefulness saved him survive during the Holocaust. Even told his daughter Ofra that his mother was warned by the Swedish Embassy that they were going to get arrested, so they fled.\n\nAt the last minute they managed to get away, Ofra told the LA Times. Someone from the embassy stuffed them under the tarp of a horse-drawn carriage, and from there to some basement where they survived.\n\nEven's maternal grandparents were killed by Nazis in Budapest but the rest of his family survived, including his parents who were in a Nazi work camp during the war, the Times reported. Even moved to Israel when he was 17 years old, his children said. Both his parents died in Israel within five years of moving there.\n\nEven's son, Yaakov said his father gave up his job with the Foreign Ministry because his wife was a diplomat and couples could not both diplomats. Instead, Even traveled with is wife, Yona, to Japan, Germany, France, India and Belgium.\n\nIn the Foreign Ministry's memorial book, my mother's name was listed as my father's companion, whereas in reality, the opposite was true, Yaakov said.\n\nYona died in 2012, after half a century of marriage to Even. They loved traveling, cooking, history and listening to classical music, their children said.\n\nWith 29 Israelis and 19 Palestinians tested positive for coronavirus so far and thousands placed in isolation, Israel closed land border with Egypt on Sunday afternoon, due to coronavirus.

Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center says there has been 1 death in the country, and over 1,200 people have tested positive. As of Monday, 37 have recovered there.\n\nAn exception was made so the Holocaust survivor could be laid to rest on Saturday night. Pallbearers wore biohazard gear and those in attendance practice social distancing, according to the LA Times.\n\nThe funeral was held in the dead of night and Even was buried by members of the Jerusalem burial society, who volunteered to be there. His children are sitting shiva in their individual homes, mourning their father in isolation.\n\nCBS News has reached out to Israel's Health Ministry and Shaare Zedek Medical Center for more information.
The lady of the house is a prisoner. Born poor, the teenager came to her position though a forced marriage, to a man clearly unsuitable to companionship. The environment of the surrounding 19th century British countryside - stark in its beauty and isolation - traps her, as she is forbidden to leave the manor house in her husband's absence.\n\nBut Katherine doesn't cotton to taking orders, and in the course of Lady Macbeth (opening Friday in select cities), she uses duplicity, steely determination and violence to realign a natural order constructed against her.\n\nAnd if people have to die in the process, well, she won't as much as bat an eye.\n\nAdapted from the 1865 Russian novella, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk, by Nikolai Leskov, William Oldroyd's captivating new film is not expressly based upon Shakespeare's Scottish Play, but its central character is the natural heir to the scheming Lady Macbeth. As played by the remarkable Florence Pugh, Katherine shows no weakness or fear in confronting the misogyny of her husband, Alexander (Paul Hilton), or her father-in-law, Boris (Christopher Fairbank). Indeed, she's a female warrior fighting for her dignity, as well as her own sexual pleasure, which she takes in the most undignified ways.\n\nInitiating an affair with a farmhand, Sebastian (Cosmo Jarvis), Katherine challenges conventions and dares the wagging of tongues as gossip abounds. One person whom she does not fear (but perhaps should) is the maid Anna (Naomi Ackie), a woman practically mute but who sees all, and whose silence may be mistaken for a conspiratorial assent, or an acquiescence mandated by her class.\n\nPlaywright Alice Birch, with her first screenplay, and director Oldroyd (who makes his feature debut) fashion a protagonist whose empowerment is born from her insolence, and a vengefulness that wreaks havoc on everyone around her -- those with more power, and those with none.\n\nDon't expect period opulence a la Downton Abbey; the puritanical settings are severe, grounding the movie's modernist sentiments and making Katherine's cold-blooded actions all the more chilling.\n\nIn addition to Oldroyd's precise direction, Ari Wegner's cinematography, Jacqueline Abrahams' production design and Holly Waddington's costumes are all top-notch.\n\nLady Macbeth (distributed by Roadside Attractions) opens July 19 in New York City and Los Angeles, expanding later this month in Washington, D.C., San Antonio, San Francisco, and other cities. The film is rated R (for sexual situations, nudity and disturbing violence). 89 mins.\n\nTo watch a trailer click on the video player below.
Editor's Note: Since this story originally aired, viewers have asked how they can help. We suggest contacting the organization we featured – GrandFamilies – through its website http://cssutah.org/\n\nThe growing opioid crisis has been declared a public health emergency. It's sparked a parallel crisis you rarely hear about: the impact on children neglected by addicted parents. More than one million American children now live with grandparents, primarily because of their parent's addiction to opioids and other drugs: crack, heroin, meth and alcohol. As we first reported in may, grandparents, are putting off retirement and plowing through savings to rescue their grandchildren from dangerous situations.\n\nTo see how widespread this is, we went to one of the healthiest states in the country, Utah. Tonight, we'll re-introduce you to a few families around Salt Lake City, and meet children, raised in the wreckage of the opioid crisis, getting a chance at a normal life.\n\nCheyenne and Lilah Nunn, who now live with their grandmother CBS News\n\nNine-year-old Cheyenne Nunn and her seven-year-old sister, Lilah, have never been happier. Until recently, they lived with their mom and her boyfriend -- the couple addicted to heroin, or meth, or both, says the girls' grandmother, Cheryl Nunn. To see Cheyenne and Lilah now secure in their grandmother's home outside Salt Lake City, it's hard to believe they once moved from home to home ... to homeless.\n\nBill Whitaker: You remember being homeless?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: A little.\n\nBill Whitaker: Where would you go?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: Under trees.\n\nBill Whitaker: Like camping?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: Yeah.\n\nThe times they did have a roof over their heads, they didn't have much else.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did you have enough food?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: Sometimes but not always. I hid it under my bed.\n\nBill Whitaker: What would you hide?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: Top Ramen. Something easy to cook.\n\nBill Whitaker: How old were you?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: Five, six.\n\nBill Whitaker: How did you know to step up and take care of your little sister and cook?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: I knew that she needed it. So I decided to be what -- something I'm not.\n\nBill Whitaker: Which is?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: A grownup.\n\nBill Whitaker: You decided to be a grownup?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: Yea, I tried to be a grownup for Lilah.\n\nBecause of her daughter's drug addictions, Cheryl told us she knew her granddaughters were in danger. To keep track of them, and to prove in court her daughter was exposing them to drug dens and dealers, Cheryl gave her daughter a van -- with a hidden tracking device.\n\nCheryl Nunn: It would record on Excel spreadsheets her going from meth house to meth house to meth house.\n\nCheryl said her granddaughters were in that van. She knew she had to save them from her own daughter.\n\nCheryl Nunn: Well, the grandchildren are young and innocent. They are basically captives of a parent. Someone has to look out after them. And that person had to be me.\n\nAfter providing tracking records of her daughter's drug-filled nights, a judge named Cheryl guardian of Cheyenne and Lilah.\n\nBill Whitaker: Can you forgive your mom?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: Not till she gives it up.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do you think she's going to stop using the drugs?\n\nCheyenne Nunn: No.\n\nCheyenne and Lilah haven't seen their mom in more than a year.\n\nCheyenne Nunn: Well, I'm not really happy about it. But I know that I have another mom right here. (Laugh)\n\nDown the road in Salt Lake City, Alexia Ansley told us she too had to step up to be a parent for her younger brother and sisters as their mother spiraled down into drug and alcohol addictions.\n\nAlexia Ainsley CBS News\n\nAlexia Ansley: She was never there. And if we wanted to get food, we had to get it ourselves. I think she forgot she had kids some of the time.\n\nBill Whitaker: So you took care of them?\n\nAlexia Ansley: Uh-huh. I would change their diapers. I would feed 'em, feed 'em baby food.\n\nBill Whitaker: When you first started stepping in to be the mom, how old were you?\n\nAlexia Ansley: Younger than 10.\n\nShe's had to sacrifice almost everything. She had to change the whole way that she lived because our mom decided to do drugs.\n\nWhen their mother was around, Alexia said she'd take the kids on excursions to pilfer in the neighborhood.\n\nAlexia Ansley: If we saw somebody with this big giant snow globe and snowman, we'd go over there, unplug it, deflate it, put in in the in the wagon. We would take things.\n\nBill Whitaker: Would you actually go up on people's porches?\n\nAlexia Ansley: If they had something on their porch, yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: Your mom would go sell these things?\n\nAlexia Ansley: Yeah. She'd sell 'em and then she'd go buy drugs. And if she had any money left, she would buy us candy for helping her. Or she'd steal candy. And we're kids. Candy's everything.\n\nWhen Alexia filled in as mom, she managed to give her younger siblings candy thanks to a sympathetic shopkeeper.\n\nAlexia Ansley: Sometimes I would gather up some couch change, and I tried buying them a candy and the guy at the register would let us take the candy if I didn't have enough change.\n\nBill Whitaker: He knew.\n\nAlexia Ansley: (Nods)\n\nBill Whitaker: I heard about couch hopping. What was that?\n\nAlexia Ansley: So we were homeless at a point in time. We would go to my mom's friend's house, just some of her random friends, and we would sleep on their couch for a couple of days. And then once they kicked us out, we'd go to another couch. We mostly stayed at crack houses and just slept on their couches.\n\nBrayden, Mackenzy, Alexia, Ember and Beth CBS News\n\nCouch-hopping ended five years ago when the children were legally taken in by their mom's mother Beth. Alexia is now 16, Brayden is 13, Mackenzy is 11 and Ember is eight. All pitch in at grandmom's house. It's now home.\n\nBill Whitaker: What's better about living with grandmom than living with your mother?\n\nBrayden Klaus: We get regular food and we get, like, nice clothing.\n\nEmber Goode: We have stuffed animals. We don't have a bathroom filled with dirty clothes, up like a mountain.\n\nMackenzy Goode: And we always know that we're going to have a decent meal that'll fill us up, so we're not sleeping hungry.\n\nBill Whitaker: MacKenzy, I heard that you would sleep on the stairs.\n\nMackenzy Goode: Yeah, because so my mom, she would like leave in the middle of the night and go who knows where, and then not come back for—sometimes it would be a couple days. I thought that maybe if I slept on the stairs she would be scared to step on me and so she wouldn't leave.\n\nBill Whitaker: Did that work?\n\nMackenzy Goode: Sometimes. Sometimes she would skip that step and then she would still go out.\n\nSome nights their grandmother Beth would secretly park down the street from where her daughter and grandchildren were staying at the time, to keep watch all night.\n\nMackenzy Goode: It always made me feel safer that she was out there, because we knew that if anything were to happen we could, like, get hold of her really quickly.\n\nBill Whitaker: She's like your guardian angel.\n\nMackenzy Goode: Yeah.\n\nBeing a guardian angel has taken a toll. Beth told us she has wiped out her savings. Alexia got a job to help with the bills.\n\nBeth Klaus: And sometimes I can't pay my electric bill, and I'll have to wait. And I go to the food bank a lot, you know. If I buy 'em things that are used, I wash 'em and put 'em in a box and give 'em to 'em. And they've never—they don't complain.\n\nBill Whitaker: What has your grandmother had to sacrifice to take care of you guys?\n\nAlexia Ansley: Dating. (laugh) She says it all the time. All the time. I haven't dated in years. (laugh)\n\nMackenzy Goode: She's had to sacrifice almost everything. She had to change the whole way that she lived because our mom decided to do drugs.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, home of the Mormon Church, finding a beer used to be a challenge. Now drug use is out in the open. Stoked by the opioid crisis, 21,000 children – just in Utah – live with their grandparents.\n\nBacall Hincks runs a non-profit organization called Grandfamilies that helps grandparents and grandchildren adjust to new family arrangements. There's a growing demand for its services because of the opioid crisis.\n\nBacall Hincks: Unfortunately opioids is a very hard addiction to overcome. So the likelihood of these parents actually overcoming their addictions and coming home and being able to parent is very low.\n\nHincks introduced us to the families we interviewed. She told us, like Alexia and Cheyenne, young children of addicts often assume the role of parent.\n\nBacall Hincks: What we call parentified.\n\nBill Whitaker: Parentified?\n\nBacall Hincks: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: How do you deal with that?\n\nBacall Hincks: I do my best to help them feel like a child again. And grandma and grandpa are there to take care of them now. And they don't need to worry about the safety of their siblings, because that's someone else's job. That's the adults' job.\n\nGrandfamilies has separate groups for young children, older children and grandparents and brings the generations together for holiday parties. Bacall Hincks said it's important for them to see many others are in the same boat.\n\nBeth Hincks CBS News\n\nBacall Hincks: They're able to connect with others who are in similar situations and have friends and don't feel so isolated and alone anymore.\n\nEllie Kligman: We found people that went through the same type of thing and it was really helpful to actually express what was happening to us, and they could relate to what was happening.\n\nWe can't not do it. They are our grandkids. They're our family.\n\nEllie Kligman, her brothers, and grandparents were all aided by Grandfamilies. The kids moved in with their mom's parents after their family fell apart. First, their dad abandoned them. Then, they say, their mom descended into opioid addiction and they ended up homeless. One day the school bus left them at a stop at this gas station. Their mom never came to pick them up.\n\nCindi Rogers: Eliana called and said, Grammy, we're sitting here waiting. And you know my mom hasn't come.\n\nCindi sent their grandfather, Michael, to bring the kids home. They both thought they'd only have them a few days.\n\nMichael Rogers: And then a few days turned into a few weeks. And then (laugh) a few weeks turned to months and here we are.\n\nBill Whitaker: How many years now?\n\nCindi Rogers: Two and a half. Almost three\n\nMichael Rogers: Going on -- going on three.\n\nBill Whitaker: Had you been planning for retirement?\n\nCindi Rogers: Yes.\n\nMichael Rogers: Yes.\n\nCindi Rogers: We were gonna do tiny house, simplify life, and then travel.\n\nMichael Rogers: As it worked out, it didn't work out that way. We became parents instead of grandparents.\n\nCindi and Michael Rogers CBS News\n\n\n\nThe kids said with their mother often sleeping, or out of the house, they could do whatever they wanted. But their grandparents insist on rules.\n\nEllie Kligman: It sucks having rules and chores. But it has to happen for us to actually grow up and be a responsible adult and take charge of our lives.\n\nBill Whitaker: Michael, you are fighting cancer.\n\nMichael Rogers: That's true. I have a terminal cancer.\n\nBill Whitaker: So has this been especially tough on you?\n\nMichael Rogers: Yeah. I have good days and bad days.\n\nCindi Rogers: I worry that I'll miss something in his care and I have.\n\nMichael Rogers: You do wonderful.\n\nThey say being parents again has strained his health, their marriage and their bank account.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what has this done to your savings?\n\nMichael Rogers: Yeah. (laugh)\n\nCindi Rogers: I work full-time and then two part-time jobs.\n\nTheir daughter, they told us, has been in rehab. This isn't the retirement they had expected, but…\n\nMichael Rogers: But we can't not do it. They are our grandkids. They're our family.\n\nProduced by Robert G. Anderson and Aaron Weisz.

Prince Harry and his American fiancée Meghan Markle are revealing new details about their upcoming royal wedding. The ceremony will take place at 12 noon on May 19, at St. George's Chapel in Windsor.\n\nPrince Harry has a special connection to Windsor Castle; he grew up going to school just across the river, and would walk here to have tea with his grandmother, the Queen.\n\nWe now know it will also feature a two-mile carriage procession immediately after the ceremony, reports CBS News' Jonathan Vigliotti.\n\nWindsor Castle's 700-year-old St. George's Chapel has an equally-long history of royal weddings. Most recently, Prince Charles walked down the ancient aisle to get his marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles blessed in 2005. On May 19, it will be Prince Harry and Megan Markle's turn.\n\nThe ceremony will be officiated by the Archbishop of Canterbury before an expected crowd of 800 friends and family.\n\nThe list is still private, but royal correspondent Roya Nikkhah has disappointing news for President Trump.\n\nWe know there'll be about 800 guests, Nikkhah said. Probably the Obamas, because they have become very close friend of Harry's, to his work with Invictus and their charitable foundation. Not Donald Trump, we hear.\n\nLove and marriage will then be followed by a horse and carriage ride. After leaving St. George's Chapel, the newlyweds will travel along the town's main street, then down the so-called long walk, before arriving back at Windsor Castle, giving thousands of spectators a chance to see the couple along the way.\n\nThey want to be able to give the public a chance to share their celebrations with them, be part of the day, Nikkhah said. That was was very, very important to Harry and Meghan when they first got engaged, how would they do that.\n\nIt's a royal procession similar to the wedding of Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, in 1999.\n\nEven the carriage is packed with history. Prince William and Kate rode in it after their 2011 ceremony, as did Prince Charles and Lady Diana before them.\n\nIn this July 29, 1981 file photo, the carriage carrying the Prince and Princess of Wales passes along Trafalgar Square on its way from St. Paul's Cathedral to Buckingham Palace after the royal wedding in London. AP\n\nThe royal couple aren't sticking with all tradition. They're having their wedding on a Saturday instead of a Friday so that more of the public can attend.\n\nThere will also be no kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The newlyweds will be busy attending two receptions.
Pete Buttigieg wants to be president, a task almost as difficult as pronouncing his name (it's BOO'-tah-juhj). But the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana and veteran of Afghanistan likes a tough project, in the right market. Like his 1905 home: It was vacant. And the price was dropping a few thousand bucks every few weeks. And I realized it might actually dip to where I could afford it.\n\nButtigieg, lives there with his husband, Chasten. Now, he has his eyes on a different white house.\n\nOnce a long-shot, the mayor of Indiana's fourth-largest city has been rising in the polls, attracting contributions and attention.\n\nThe South Bend, Ind. mayor, Afghanistan veteran and Rhodes scholar, who's rising in the polls for the 2020 race, hopes to reanimate his party's values for a new era, including a connection with faith. CBS News\n\nIf elected, he says his top priority would be fixing the democratic system, from the electoral college to gerrymandering. Otherwise, he believes progress on climate change and healthcare would be difficult.\n\nBut what most people see in Pete Buttigieg is the man who would become America's youngest president.\n\nCBS News' John Dickerson asked, Do you think because Donald Trump has opened the window of possibilities that you actually benefit, in what's possible in a candidacy, in a presidency?\n\nIn some ways, I mean, I never thought as a 37-year-old mayor that I would be able to say that I have more government experience than the President of the United States, he said.\n\nCBS News' John Dickerson asked, What other part of your life would you point people, who might be concerned given your age, who might say, 'Well, has he been tested?'\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., with CBS News' John Dickerson. CBS News\n\nWell, I remember one moment in Afghanistan, when I was responsible for making sure a vehicle I was driving got to where it was going safely, he said. And you're warned that, for example, a magnetic IED could be placed on your vehicle. And once, it sounded to me as though somebody had attached something to the vehicle I was driving. And for a split second we had to figure out whether to ditch the vehicle, which would've been obviously very risky as well, because you're very obviously a target in the middle of a city where some people are pretty eager to attack you if you got the chance.\n\nTurned out what had happened was, that there was a beggar who had no legs. He was on sort of a dolly. And he would slap the side of the car in order to move himself along. If nothing else, it taught me not to overreact and not to panic when something's coming along that's pretty alarming.\n\nButtigieg is a trained pianist. He's also a Rhodes scholar from Harvard, and has studied the rise of another Democrat, also from Harvard, also a veteran, and also once considered too young for office: If you look at his old campaign poster when he's running for Congress, it's this scrawny, toothy young guy, and the slogan is, 'The new generation offers a leader.'\n\nTruman came out and said, 'Senator Kennedy, I'm sure you're gonna have a great future, but now is not your time,' said Dickerson. The former president urged the young Senator to be patient.\n\nYeah, when you're young, you're always patted on the head and told that you're the future, Buttigieg replied. But I'm interested in what you can bring to the present. And the present has always been shaped in some measure by young people.\n\nElected mayor of South Bend at age 29, Buttigieg took over just after Newsweek declared his hometown one of America's dying cities. Its Golden Age was more than 50 years ago, as home to the carmaker Studebaker. But in the early 1960s, Studebaker shut down, and took much of the town's economy along with it.\n\nPart of the old Studebaker factory is now a tech center. Buttigieg calls it a symbol for what's happened in South Bend under his leadership – and what he'd do for the country as president.\n\nDuring his campaign announcement on April 14, he said, America deserves our optimism, deserves our courage, deserves our hope.\n\nDickerson asked, You've talked about improving the symbolism of the presidency. Why is that important?\n\nBecause the presidency is also a moral office, Buttigieg replied. It calls this nation to its highest values. And it sets the tone for the story that we tell ourselves. Narrative's a very powerful thing. And we need to make sure that everybody in America understands where they fit in this country's story.\n\nBut until recently, the mayor's own story was only half-told.\n\nDickerson asked, When you went to serve [in Afghanistan], you wrote a letter in case you didn't come back. What's in the letter?\n\nI wanted people who cared about me to know that I wouldn't have felt that I'd been cheated, he said. That as tragic as it would be if my life were cut short, that it was so full that I wouldn't have left it with a sense of anger.\n\nBut it's a strange thing to think about, too, because I didn't come out until after I came back. I also packed my bags for Afghanistan having no idea what it was like to be in love. And the richest and fullest part of my life is what happened after I came back and met Chasten and got married. So, thank God I came back.\n\nButtigieg came out publicly during his re-election bid in 2015. Last year he married junior-high teacher Chasten Glezman. Their two rescue dogs, Truman and one-eyed Buddy, have their own social media following.\n\nBuddy interrupted Dickerson' interview with Pete and Chasten. This is like politics, laughed Chasten. This is like the trail. You think you're doing a great job and then someone comes from the left and interrupts everything.\n\nOr the right!\n\nWelcome to politics! Oh, Buddy.\n\nPete and Chasten Buttigieg, with Buddy. CBS News\n\nIt's not the kind of marriage voters have seen before in a presidential campaign, and raises the question: Is the country ready for a gay president?\n\nDickerson asked, Do you feel that your marriage is campaigning as well, because you are doing something that is new in American politics?\n\nI think I'd argue I don't have to answer for it, Chasten replied. I mean, we passed marriage equality. I don't think I have to answer for my marriage anymore.\n\nPete said, I think, 'How could I possibly be doing this if it weren't for Chasten?' If I didn't have someone in my life who just cares about me as me?\n\nThe messenger is the message: the youngest candidate is promising generational change with a campaign built on reanimating his party's values for a new era, including a connection with faith.\n\nDickerson asked Buttigieg if he has a particular favorite passage of scripture: If there's one that I always try to think about when I'm deciding what to do, it's the Beatitudes, he said. I also think about the scripture that says that when you pray, 'Be not like the hypocrites who love standing in the synagogues, in the corners of the streets, that they'll be seen by others and praised for it.' So, you know, there's a lot to turn to and a lot to check yourself in scripture.\n\nAnd there may be a lot to check the political rise of Pete Buttigieg. But in the meantime, for those who have trouble with his name, he says call me Mayor Pete.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Dustin Stephens.
Chris Rock announced in 2015 that he and Malaak Compton-Rock were ending their 18-year marriage, and now the comedian is getting extremely candid about what went wrong.\n\nI wasn't a good husband a lot of the times, Rock told Rolling Stone in a revelatory interview.\n\nThe profile chronicles a number of Rock's live shows where he's been discussing his personal life in detail -- including revealing that he'd cheated on his wife with three different women on a recent tour -- one famous, one semi-famous and one a member of the retail class.\n\nThe comedian, actor and filmmaker has found himself battling misconceptions post-divorce -- even from his closest friends.\n\nWe live in a world where men are assumed to not have feelings, Rock said. All my friends assume I moved into the city after my divorce, away from my girls. When I say I bought a house around the corner, it blows their minds.
FIGUERES, Spain -- Forensic experts in Spain have removed hair, nails and two long bones from Salvador Dalí's embalmed remains to find genetic samples for a paternity test -- a move that opens the possibility for a woman who says she is the surrealist artist's daughter to claim part of the Dalí estate.\n\nOfficials said Friday that the artist's mummified remains were so well conserved that even his famous mustache had survived the passing of time and remained in its classic shape of ten past ten, referring to the positions of the hands on a clock.\n\nDalí was buried in the Dalí Museum Theater in the northeastern Spanish town of Figueres, his birthplace, when he died at 84 years old in 1989. The exhumation followed longstanding claims by Pilar Abel, a 61-year-old tarot card reader, who says her mother had an affair with Dalí in the town.\n\nIn June, a Madrid judge finally ruled that a DNA test should be performed to find out whether her allegations were true.\n\nForensic experts opened the artist's coffin Thursday night in a sensitive operation that involved using pulleys to lift a 1.5-ton stone slab.\n\nLluis Penuelas Reixach, the secretary general of the Gala Dalí Foundation, said Dalí's remains -- including his mustache -- are well conserved, mummified after the embalming process applied 27 years ago. He was speaking to reporters Friday during a press conference in Figueres.\n\nAccording to judicial authorities, only five people -- a judge, three coroners and an assistant -- were allowed to oversee the removal of the samples out of respect for the remains and in order to avoid any contamination.\n\nRepresentatives of the foundation managing Dalí's estate said Friday the evidence backing Abel's claims weren't enough to justify the intrusive exhumation, and that it will continue a legal battle to nullify the paternity test.\n\nDalí and his Russian wife Gala -- whose birth name was Elena Ivanovna Diakonova -- had no children of their own, although Gala had a daughter from an earlier marriage to French poet Paul Eluard.\n\nA general view of Dali's Theater Museum in Figueres, Spain. Getty\n\nAbel, who for a while made her living by reading tarot cards on local television, was born in Girona, a city close to Figueres. She has fought for the exhumation because she wants legal proof that the artist was her biological father after an alleged affair between her mother and Dalí.\n\nIf proved right, she could claim one fourth of the painter's estate which is now in the hands of a public foundation, according to her lawyer Enrique Blanquez. There are no current estimates of the value of that fortune.\n\nIf she is proved wrong, the Dalí foundation will seek financial compensation for the costs of the exhumation.\n\nEither way, minimizing the disruption to the museum's operations and to the rest of Dalí's remains is the priority for the foundation managing Dalí's estate, according to its secretary. It's important for Salvador Dalí to be returned to rest in the interior of his museum's dome, Penuelas said.\n\nDuring a press conference this week, Abel explained how her mother and grandmother told the family secret when Abel was still young. Years later, she said she asked her mother again, who confirmed to her the story was true.\n\nThe foundation and the museum in Figueres took steps to make sure no images of the exhumation may emerge in public. Before work in the crypt began on Thursday, mobile phones were put in a deposit and a marquee was installed under the museum's glass dome to prevent any photography or video from drones.\n\nThe biological samples will travel to a forensic laboratory in Madrid for analysis, a process that could take weeks.
W.S. Merwin, a prolific and versatile poetry master who evolved through a wide range of styles as he celebrated nature, condemned war and industrialism and reached for the elusive past, died Friday. He was 91.\n\nA Pulitzer Prize winner and former U.S. poet laureate, Merwin completed more than 20 books, from early works inspired by myths and legends to fiery protests against environmental destruction and the conflict in Vietnam to late meditations on age and time.\n\nHe wrote rhymes and blank verse, a brief report on the month of January and a book-length story in verse about colonialism and the birth of modern Hawaii. Like his hero, Henry David Thoreau, he was inspired equally by reverence for the planet and anger against injustice.\n\nHe died in his sleep at his home on the Hawaiian island of Maui, according to publisher Copper Canyon Press and the Merwin Conservancy, which the poet founded.\n\nHe is an artist with a very clear spiritual profile, and intellectual and moral consistency, which encompasses both his work and his life, fellow poet Edward Hirsch once said of him.\n\nMerwin received virtually every honor a poet could ask for - more, it turned out, than he desired.\n\nCiting the Vietnam War, he declined a Pulitzer in 1971 for The Carrier of Ladders, saying that he was too conscious of being an American to accept public congratulation with good grace, or to welcome it except as an occasion for expressing openly a shame which many Americans feel.\n\nHe also rejected membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters, now the American Academy of Arts and Letters, but changed his mind five years later, in 1977.\n\nAmong other awards he accepted: a National Book Award for Migration in 2005, a Pulitzer in 2009 for The Shadow of Sirius, and such lifetime achievement honors as the Tanning Prize, the Bollingen Prize and a gold medal from the arts academy. He was chosen the country's poet laureate in 2010 and served a single one-year term.\n\nThe changes in his work were no more dramatic than the changes in his life, which spanned continents and religious faiths. The son of a Presbyterian minister, he was raised in the urban East during the Great Depression, spent years as a young man in France, Mexico, Spain and England and lived his final decades as a Buddhist in a solar-powered house he designed on an old pineapple plantation, surrounded by a rain forest, on the northeast coast of Maui.\n\nThere was something incomplete about the world of streets and sidewalks and cement, he told the Paris Review in 1986. I remember walking in the streets of New York and New Jersey and telling myself, as a kind of reassurance, that the ground was really under there.\n\nWilliam Stanley Merwin was born in New York City in 1927. He soon moved to Union City, New Jersey, living for years on a street now called W.S. Merwin Way, then to Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn a long, autobiographical poem, Testimony, he remembered his father as a weary, disappointed man, subsisting on pinched salaries and traveling sick with some nameless illuminating ill. His mother was orphaned early in life and grieved again when her baby, a boy she meant to name after her father, died when he had scarcely wakened.\n\nIn a household as grim as an abandoned parking lot, the way out was pointed by words, which seemed to float around Merwin like magic bubbles. He would try to memorize scripture he heard his father recite and fairy tales his mother told him. By age 13, he was already composing hymns.\n\nHe received a scholarship from Princeton University, becoming the first family member to attend college, and began meeting some of the great poets of the present and future. Galway Kinnell was a classmate at Princeton, and John Berryman a teacher.\n\nAfter graduating, he lived in Spain and tutored the son of Robert Graves. In London, he became close with Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes and was torn by the collapse of their marriage. Merwin's then-wife, Dido Merwin, would allege that Plath had a crush on him.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., when he was 18, Merwin had a memorable encounter with Ezra Pound, whom he visited at a psychiatric hospital. Pound urged Merwin to write 75 lines a day (advice he did not follow), warned him he didn't have enough experience to write great poetry and advised him to learn another language as a way of better mastering English. Merwin would translate more than 20 books by other poets, from languages ranging from Sanskrit to Swedish.\n\nMerwin's promise was obvious. His first collection, A Mask for Janus, was selected by W.H. Auden for the coveted Yale Series of Younger Poets competition and was published in 1952. Throughout the 1950s, he wrote poems and plays, including a verse production of Rumpelstiltskin.\n\nTimes spent in Boston with Robert Lowell convinced him to concentrate on poetry, and by the end of the decade, he was regarded as a highly talented artist immersed in Old English literature, his verse likened by The New York Times to a broad river flowing through peaceful land.\n\nPeace - the flow of the natural world - was a cause he actively defended. Near the end of World War II, he spent seven months under psychiatric care because he refused to undergo any duties that might lead to violence, which he had feared since the days his father would beat him.\n\nBy the early 1960s, he was marching against nuclear weapons and throwing off the rules of grammar as if they were a suit and tie, inspired by his growing sense that punctuation alluded to an assumed allegiance to the rational protocol of written language.\n\nMeanwhile, Vietnam and urbanization darkened his vision. I/can hear the blood crawling over the plains, he wrote in The Child. In The Crust, the downfall of a tree is a metaphor for the severing of civilization:\n\nand with the tree\n\nwent all the lives in it\n\nthat slept in it ate in it\n\nmet in it believed in it\n\nMerwin examined his own mind in Plane and found it infinitely divided and hopeless/like a stockyard seen from above. His poem Presidents was a roll call of dishonor, for the president of shame, ''the president of lies and the president of loyalty, who recommends blindness to the blind. In Sunset After Rain, he concluded that The darkness is cold/because the stars do not believe in each other.\n\nIn the 1970s, he settled permanently in Hawaii and studied under the Zen Buddhist master Robert Aitken. Divorced years earlier from Dorothy Jeanne Ferry and from Dido Milroy, he married his third wife, Paula Schwartz, in a Buddhist ceremony in 1983. Paula died in 2017.\n\nMerwin's work became sparer, rooted in the Hawaiian landscape and his personal past - how it's often forgotten, how it's never understood at the moment it's lived, how words themselves were imperfect bridges to lost time. In Secrets, he noted that wherever our parents came from is another century/an age which they themselves could barely remember.\n\nA poem from 2010, By the Front Door, is a three-line tribute to simple wonder: Rain through the morning/and in the long pool an old toad singing/happiness old as water. His poem Thanks is another ode to the natural world:\n\nListen\n\nwith the night falling we are saying thank you\n\nwe are stopping on the bridges to bow from the railings\n\nwe are running out of the glass rooms\n\nwith our mouths full of food to look at the sky\n\nand say thank you
For more than 40 years, Daniel Ellsberg has been known as the man who exposed the U.S. government's secrets about the Vietnam War. But there's an even bigger secret he's been keeping about his involvement in planning for an even bigger war. That plan, in his words, was a crime against humanity.\n\nThe plan was to hit every city in the Soviet Union ... and every city in China. There was no plan for fighting Soviets that did not also involve annihilating the Chinese population, he told CBS News' Alex Wagner. The result was a readiness to annihilate 600 million people. 100 Holocausts. When I say crime against humanity it was actually a crime against the existence of the human species.\n\nIn the 1960s, it was Ellsberg's job to update the nuclear plans left by President Eisenhower.\n\nWhat this revealed to me was something about our species that I've had to live with for the next 50 years and try to understand ... They're very normal, ordinary, smart, conscientious, patriotic people. Working in secret can carry out monstrous plans ... But it's the job and you go to work and you do what the boss wants.\n\nEllsberg said he tried to modify the plans to avoid cities.\n\nI tried to get the targeting off cities and off of Moscow and off China automatically. And actually I failed in all of that. ... Not hitting Moscow was just unthinkable, he said.\n\n\n\nEllsberg compares the war plans to the 1964 movie Dr. Strangelove which centers on the existence of a Doomsday Machine meant to automatically respond to a first strike attack with enough nuclear weapons to destroy all life on earth.\n\n\n\nDr. Stangelove was a documentary. It saw the mad humor in the situation. ... It still makes me laugh when I think about it because it's hard to take this seriously, except that it's very serious indeed. Those were and are our preparations for nuclear war, Ellsberg said.\n\n\n\nHe intended to bring the information to the public after the close of the war in Vietnam but found that publishers then – and 30 years later – didn't feel it could sell.\n\nThey don't want to hear anything with the word nuclear in the title … And that was true right up until the present, he said.\n\nMore than 50 years later, Ellsberg has published his experience in The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner. He wrote the book in his bunker-like office, referencing documents from his considerable archives.\n\nNow, the world is paying attention. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been testing intercontinental ballistic missiles with President Trump threatening the full force of the U.S. Military and Russian president Vladimir Putin this week shocked the world, unveiling an updated weapons system – including a new ICBM that he says is invincible.\n\n\n\nEllsberg said the brinkmanship doesn't feel all that different this time around.\n\n\n\nThe brinkmanship has been there. As I've said it was a way of using nuclear weapons without pulling the trigger. Using a gun at someone's head in a confrontation without pulling the trigger. You're using the gun, and to say we haven't used these weapons or that they've proved useless is simply misleading. Trump and Kim (Jong Un) are both using their weapons right now ... and one or the other may back down. Or not, he said. Putin is making similar first use threats. His are threats of crazy action, just as ours are. And it doesn't unfortunately mean that they will never be carried out.\n\n\n\nNow 86, Ellsberg and his wife Patricia have been privately living with this knowledge for as long as their nearly 50-year marriage. Today, it's their fellow citizens who are also living on edge.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, a false alert was sent to mobile phones and televisions warning of an incoming ballistic missile to Hawaii.\n\nWhat Hawaii did, the alert, was to make a million or so Hawaiian citizens aware for the first time of the kinds of dangers that we have all in the world have been living with for half a century without thinking about them and what to do. Some dived into manholes. Many people interestingly sat in bathtubs, a total symbolic action. It's not what I would have done.\n\nWhat Ellsberg would have done?\n\nI would have invited Patricia to lay down with me and kiss for as long as the alarm went on, he said.\n\nAsked if it's a miracle that we haven't had a nuclear Holocaust, Ellsberg said, Yes. Miracles do happen.\n\nIt's not impossible that there will be another 70 years. It would take another miracle. ... What I'm working at is you're trying to alert people to the danger before the alarm sounds to do something about it so the risk will be somewhat less.
RUSKIN, Fla. -- A Florida woman who police say was abducted bound and screaming by her estranged husband has been found alive.\n\nA witness tip on Monday led police to the vehicle police were searching for in connection with the abduction of 37-year-old Alisa Summers from a Tampa parking lot Saturday, according to Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee. Witnesses told Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputies that they saw a screaming woman - her hands tied behind her back - being forced into her SUV on Saturday night in the parking lot of a pharmacy.\n\nPolice had named her estranged husband, Trevor Steven Summers, 39, as the suspect. In a statement, sheriff's officials said the woman didn't return from going to visit Trevor Summers to talk about their marriage. They are separated and have injunctions against each other, according to court records.\n\nThe couple married in 2001. They're now separated and have five children - ages 3 to 14 - who live with Trevor Summers' father, sheriff's officials said.\n\nGee said at one point late Friday Trevor Summers had convinced the couple's 14-year-old daughter to leave the window open at the home so he could come over and talk to her. The daughter complied, and at some point Gee said Trevor Summers allowed the 14-year-old daughter to drive him and the other children to his residence.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how Alisa Summers came to be bound in the back of her vehicle.\n\nPolice received a tip on Monday that a car matching the description of Alisa Summers' had been spotted in the Ruskin area, Gee said during a press conference. The tipster followed the car and led police to a home where the woman was later rescued from the car, which was parked in a garage.\n\nMost of these cases the public paying attention to this is always an important step, and I think this case is no different, Gee said. The public being responsive to these alerts helped us out, no question about it.\n\nGee said Trevor Summers didn't cooperate with police. Alisa Summers, who was in the backseat, ran from the car to officers, he said.\n\nTrevor Summers suffered a self-inflicted knife wound that did not appear to be life-threatening, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff. Alisa Summers suffered a possible knife wound on her wrist that may have been inflicted by her husband, Gee said.\n\nAuthorities were in the process of interviewing Alisa Summers.\n\nShe's obviously very upset at this point and we're taking our time interviewing her, Gee said.\n\nTrevor Summers pleaded guilty to a wire fraud and conspiracy scheme in Philadelphia federal court last September, according to the Times.\n\nA jury also convicted his co-defendant, another man, on similar charges, according to the paper. It said federal prosecutors accused them of falsely claiming to hold patents on straws that could be printed with safe ink and spending $1 million on machines to print those straws. But officials said it was a scheme to defraud investors out of at least $345,000, according to the report.\n\nTrevor Summers is scheduled for sentencing Wednesday in Philadelphia, the report added.\n\nThe Times reported that it was after Summers pleaded guilty that his life in Florida began to unravel.\n\nWATCH LIVE: Investigators give update on Alisa Summers, who was found alive after allegedly being abducted by her husband. http://on.wtsp.com/2mjwMLD Posted by 10News WTSP on Monday, March 13, 2017\n\nOn Oct. 31 his wife asked a Hillsborough County judge for a domestic violence injunction, but it was dismissed on Nov. 10. A month later she filed for divorce. Court records show Alisa Summers filed for another protective order on Feb. 21. In it she claimed that during a meeting at Trevor Summer's home to discuss a divorce settlement, he pulled a knife on her, threatened to bind her with duct tape and rope, and held her against her will for several hours. She called 911 and waited on deputies at a gas station, but no arrest was made.\n\nOn Feb. 22, he filed for a protective order against his wife, claiming the previous day's allegations against him were fabricated. He accused her of angrily pushing their 12-year-old son into a corner.\n\nSheriff's officials confirmed Alisa Summers called for help Feb. 21. An arrest wasn't made because all deputies had to go on were the couple's conflicting statements. The case is still under investigation.\n\nGlaros, the divorce attorney, said he's surprised to hear that his client would visit her husband because she was so scared of him. In fact, she didn't attend the injunction hearing because of her fears.\n\nHe also said the divorce proceedings were on hold until Summers was sentenced in federal court. He faces up to four years in federal prison.\n\nHope Lefeber, Summers' attorney in the federal case, told the Times she was shocked to hear about the latest allegations. If proven true, she said they could impact his federal sentence.\n\nI know he always wanted to work out his marriage, she said.\n\nSummers is in custody on initial charges of kidnapping, grand theft auto and violation of a domestic violence injunction, Gee said. He could face more charges based on the woman's account to investigators.
Veteran talk show host Larry King died early Saturday in Los Angeles, according to Ora Media, a production company King formed. He was 87.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, the company said King died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He was first reported to be hospitalized there in early January after contracting COVID-19, and moved out of the intensive care unit two days later. No cause of death was given.\n\nWhether he was interviewing a U.S. president, foreign leader, celebrity, scandal-ridden personage, or an everyman, Larry liked to ask short, direct, and uncomplicated questions, the statement says. He believed concise questions usually provided the best answers, and he was not wrong in that belief.\n\nA longtime nationally syndicated radio host, from 1985 through 2010 he was a nightly fixture on CNN, where he won many honors, including two Peabody awards.\n\nWith his celebrity interviews, political debates and topical discussions, King wasn't just an enduring on-air personality. He also set himself apart with the curiosity be brought to every interview, whether questioning the assault victim known as the Central Park Jogger or billionaire industrialist Ross Perot, who in 1992 rocked the presidential contest by announcing his candidacy on King's show.\n\nIn its early years, Larry King Live was based in Washington, D.C., which gave the show an air of gravitas. Likewise King. He was the plainspoken go-between through whom Beltway bigwigs could reach their public, and they did, earning the show prestige as a place where things happened, where news was made.\n\nKing conducted an estimated 50,000 on-air interviews. In 1995 he presided over a Middle East peace summit with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He welcomed everyone from the Dalai Lama to Elizabeth Taylor, from Mikhail Gorbachev to Barack Obama, Bill Gates to Lady Gaga.\n\nEspecially after he relocated to Los Angeles, his shows were frequently in the thick of breaking celebrity news, including Paris Hilton talking about her stint in jail in 2007 and Michael Jackson's friends and family members talking about his death in 2009.\n\nKing boasted of never over-preparing for an interview. His nonconfrontational style relaxed his guests and made him readily relatable to his audience.\n\nI don't pretend to know it all, he said in a 1995 Associated Press interview. Not, `What about Geneva or Cuba?′ I ask, `Mr. President, what don't you like about this job?′ Or `What's the biggest mistake you made?′ That's fascinating.\n\nAt a time when CNN, as the lone player in cable news, was deemed politically neutral, and King was the essence of its middle-of-the-road stance, political figures and people at the center of controversies would seek out his show.\n\nAnd he was known for getting guests who were notoriously elusive. Frank Sinatra, who rarely gave interviews and often lashed out at reporters, spoke to King in 1988 in what would be the singer's last major TV appearance. Sinatra was an old friend of King's and acted accordingly.\n\nWhy are you here? King asks. Sinatra responds, Because you asked me to come and I hadn't seen you in a long time to begin with, I thought we ought to get together and chat, just talk about a lot of things.\n\nKing had never met Marlon Brando, who was even tougher to get and tougher to interview, when the acting giant asked to appear on King's show in 1994. The two hit it off so famously they ended their 90-minute talk with a song and an on-the-mouth kiss, an image that was all over media in subsequent weeks.\n\nAfter a gala week marking his 25th anniversary in June 2010, King abruptly announced he was retiring from his show, telling viewers, It's time to hang up my nightly suspenders. Named as his successor in the time slot: British journalist and TV personality Piers Morgan.\n\nBy King's departure that December, suspicion had grown that he had waited a little too long to hang up those suspenders. Once the leader in cable TV news, he ranked third in his time slot with less than half the nightly audience his peak year, 1998, when Larry King Live drew 1.64 million viewers.\n\nHis wide-eyed, regular-guy approach to interviewing by then felt dated in an era of edgy, pushy or loaded questioning by other hosts.\n\nMeanwhile, occasional flubs had made him seem out of touch, or worse. A prime example from 2007 found King asking Jerry Seinfeld if he had voluntarily left his sitcom or been canceled by his network, NBC.\n\nI was the No. 1 show in television, Larry, replied Seinfeld with a flabbergasted look. Do you know who I am?\n\nAlways a workaholic, King would be back doing specials for CNN within a few months of performing his nightly duties.\n\nHe found a new sort of celebrity as a plain-spoken natural on Twitter when the platform emerged, winning over more than 2 million followers who simultaneously mocked and loved him for his esoteric style.\n\nI've never been in a canoe. #Itsmy2cents, he said in a typical tweet in 2015.\n\nHis Twitter account was essentially a revival of a USA Today column he wrote for two decades full of one-off, disjointed thoughts. Norm Macdonald delivered a parody version of the column when he played King on Saturday Night Live, with deadpan lines like, The more I think about it, the more I appreciate the equator.\n\nKing was constantly parodied, often through old-age jokes on late-night talk shows from hosts including David Letterman and Conan O'Brien, often appearing with the latter to get in on the roasting himself.\n\nKing came by his voracious but no-frills manner honestly.\n\nHe was born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in 1933, a son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who ran a bar and grill in Brooklyn. But after his father's death when Larry was a boy, he faced a troubled, sometimes destitute youth.\n\nA fan of such radio stars as Arthur Godfrey and comedians Bob & Ray, King on reaching adulthood set his sights on a broadcasting career. With word that Miami was a good place to break in, he headed south in 1957 and landed a job sweeping floors at a tiny AM station. When a deejay abruptly quit, King was put on the air - and was handed his new surname by the station manager, who thought Zeiger too Jewish.\n\nA year later he moved to a larger station, where his duties were expanded from the usual patter to serving as host of a daily interview show that aired from a local restaurant. He quickly proved equally adept at talking to the waitresses, and the celebrities who began dropping by.\n\nBy the early 1960s King had gone to yet a larger Miami station, scored a newspaper column and become a local celebrity himself.\n\nAt the same time, he fell victim to living large.\n\nIt was important to me to come across as a 'big man,' he wrote in his autobiography, which meant I made a lot of money and spread it around lavishly.\n\nHe accumulated debts and his first broken marriages (he was married eight times to seven women). He gambled, borrowed wildly and failed to pay his taxes. He also became involved with a shady financier in a scheme to bankroll an investigation of President Kennedy's assassination. But when King skimmed some of the cash to pay his overdue taxes, his partner sued him for grand larceny in 1971. The charges were dropped, but King's reputation appeared ruined.\n\nKing lost his radio show and, for several years, struggled to find work. But by 1975 the scandal had largely blown over and a Miami station gave him another chance. Regaining his local popularity, King was signed in 1978 to host radio's first nationwide call-in show.\n\nOriginating from Washington on the Mutual network, The Larry King Show was eventually heard on more than 300 stations and made King a national phenomenon.\n\nA few years later, CNN founder Ted Turner offered King a slot on his young network. Larry King Live debuted on June 1, 1985, and became CNN's highest-rated program. King's beginning salary of $100,000 a year eventually grew to more than $7 million.\n\nA three-packs-a-day cigarette habit led to a heart attack in 1987, but King's quintuple-bypass surgery didn't slow him down.\n\nMeanwhile, he continued to prove that, in his words, I'm not good at marriage, but I'm a great boyfriend.\n\nHe was just 18 when he married high school girlfriend Freda Miller, in 1952. The marriage lasted less than a year. In subsequent decades he would marry Annette Kay, Alene Akins (twice), Mickey Sutfin, Sharon Lepore and Julie Alexander.\n\nIn 1997, he wed Shawn Southwick, a country singer and actress 26 years his junior. They would file for divorce in 2010, rescind the filing, then file for divorce again in 2019.\n\nThe couple had two sons, King's fourth and fifth kids, Chance Armstrong, born in 1999, and Cannon Edward, born in 2000. In 2020, King lost his two eldest children, Andy King and Chaia King, who died of unrelated health problems within weeks of each other.\n\nHe had many other medical issues in recent decades, including more heart attacks and diagnoses of type 2 diabetes and lung cancer.\n\nEarly in 2021, CNN reported that King was hospitalized for more than a week with COVID-19.\n\nThrough his setbacks he continued to work into his late 80s, taking on online talk shows and infomercials as his appearances on CNN grew fewer.\n\nWork, King once said. It's the easiest thing I do.
Edith Windsor, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, has died, her lawyer confirmed to The Associated Press.\n\nShe was 88.\n\nWindsor died in New York, said her lawyer, Roberta Kaplan. The cause of death wasn't given, but Windsor had struggled with heart issues for years.\n\nThe world lost a tiny but tough-as-nails fighter for freedom, justice and equality, said her current spouse, Judith Kasen-Windsor. They married last year.\n\nFormer President Obama, who called to congratulate Windsor when the Supreme Court struck down DOMA, said in a statement that he had spoken to Windsor a few days ago.\n\nEdie Windsor (left) met Thea Spyer in the 1960s. They were together for 40 years and married in Canada in 2007. CBS News\n\nThe day that the Supreme Court issued its 2013 ruling in United States v. Windsor was a great day for Edie, and a great day for America — a victory for human decency, equality, freedom, and justice. And I called Edie that day to congratulate her, Mr. Obama said.\n\nIn a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union called Windsor one of this country's great civil rights pioneers.\n\nOne simply cannot write the history of the gay rights movement without reserving immense credit and gratitude for Edie Windsor, ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said. We were proud to stand with Edie when she took her fight on behalf of same-sex couples everywhere to the Supreme Court.\n\nWindsor became a gay rights pioneer after her first spouse, Thea Spyer, died in 2009. The women had married legally in Canada in 2007 after spending more than 40 years together.\n\nWindsor sued the federal government after Spyer's death, saying its definition of marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman prevented her from getting a marital deduction on Spyer's estate. That meant she faced a huge tax bill that heterosexual couples would not have.\n\nWhen Spyer died, she left her estate to Windsor, and the federal government said Windsor owed $363,000 in inheritance taxes because Windsor, under federal law, was not considered married.\n\nWindsor told CBS News' Jan Crawford in 2013 that if Thea's name had been Theo, I would have paid no taxes.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in June 2013 that the provision in the law was unconstitutional, and that legally married same-sex couples are entitled to the same federal benefits that heterosexual couples receive.\n\nThe opinion gave the nation's legally married gay couples equal federal footing with all other married Americans and marked a key moment of encouragement for gay marriage supporters confronting the nationwide patchwork of laws that, at the time, outlawed such unions in roughly three dozen states.\n\nIt also affronted conservatives who hewed to defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Then-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia predicted the ruling would be used to upend state restrictions on marriage and warned: The only thing that will 'confine' the court's holding is its sense of what it can get away with.\n\nUltimately, the opinion in Windsor's case became the basis for the wave of federal court rulings that struck down state marriage bans and led to a 2015 Supreme Court ruling giving same-sex couples the right to marry.\n\nWindsor was born in Philadelphia and moved to Manhattan in the early 1950s after a brief marriage to a man that ended after she told him she was gay. She received a master's degree in mathematics from New York University in 1957 and went to work for IBM in senior technical and management positions.\n\nWindsor met Spyer in the 1960s in Manhattan. They dated two years and then, Windsor says, made a commitment.\n\nEdith Windsor, center, accompanied by her attorney Robert Kaplan, right, is greeted by Orie Urami, left, as she arrives at the LGBT Center for a news conference, in New York, June 26, 2013. Richard Drew/AP\n\nI said, 'If it goes like this, I think I would like to be engaged for a year, and if that still works and feels this joyous, then I think I'd like to get married and spend the rest of my life with you,' Windsor recalled to Crawford.\n\nSpyer proposed marriage in 1967, according to The New York Times. They were on vacation in Italy when the Stonewall riots — a turning point for gay rights — had occurred. It was a turning point for Windsor too.\n\nUntil then, I'd always had the feeling — and I know it's ignorant and unfair — 'I don't want to be identified with the queens,'  Ms. Windsor told NYU Alumni Magazine in 2011, according to the Times. But from that day on, I had this incredible gratitude. They changed my life. They changed my life forever.\n\nThe pair stayed engaged for 40 years. They held out hope they would eventually get married — especially after Spyer was diagnosed with multiple-sclerosis in 1977. In 2007, Spyer was given a year to live and they married in Canada.\n\n'Marriage' is a magic word, Windsor said on the steps of City Hall at a rally for marriage equality, with Spyer at her side in her chair, according to a 2015 New Yorker profile. Thea looks at her ring every day, and thinks of herself as a member of a special species that can love and couple 'until death do them part.'
Prince Harry is comparing his split from the royal family to his mother Princess Diana's own experience nearly 30 years ago. In a preview of CBS' Oprah with Meghan And Harry: A Primetime Special, the Duke of Sussex says he fears history repeating itself.\n\nYou know, for me, I'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you, with my wife by my side, Harry tells Oprah Winfrey in a 30-second teaser clip of the upcoming interview, which airs Sunday.\n\nBecause I can't begin to imagine what it must have been life for her, going through this process by herself, all those years ago, he continues, with his wife, Meghan Markle, by his side. Because it has been unbelievably tough for the two of us — but at least we had each other.\n\nIn another clip, Harry says that his biggest concern was history repeating itself — another apparent reference to his mother.\n\nDiana, the Princess of Wales, separated from Prince Charles in an excruciating public breakup in the 1990s. She died in a car crash in 1997. Harry has been vocal against the rampant media coverage his mother battled leading up to her death.\n\nThe highly-anticipated two-hour exclusive primetime special airs Sunday, March 7 from 8-10 p.m. ET on CBS. It marks the first interview the couple has given together since they quit working as official members of the royal family last year.\n\nDuring the special, Winfrey discusses a wide range of topics with Meghan, from stepping into life as a member of the royal family, marriage, motherhood, philanthropic work and public pressure.\n\nWinfrey asks Meghan at one point, Were you silent, or were you silenced? Her answer is not revealed in the teaser.\n\nWinfrey also says that there is no subject that's off-limits, adding later, You've said some pretty shocking things here.\n\nHarry speaks about the couple's move to the U.S., as well as their hopes for expanding their family. They recently announced that they are expecting their second child.\n\nLast week, Harry said one of the reasons he and Meghan left the U.K. was because the toxic press was destroying his mental health.\n\nWe all know what the British press can be like, and it was destroying my mental health, Harry told James Corden on The Late Late Show. I was like, this is toxic. So I did what any husband and any father would do and be like I need to get my family out of here.
DUBLIN, Ireland -- Exit polls project voters in Ireland voted overwhelmingly to repeal some of the world's most restrictive abortion laws. It would mark a major shift for a country long dominated by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nMonths of divisive campaigning sparked a record turnout at some polling sites.\n\nVoters selected yes or no on the question of repealing Ireland's 8th Amendment, which banned all abortions except when a mother's life is at risk. In Europe, only Malta and Poland have similar laws.\n\nAmong those casting their ballots were thousands of returning expats like Sorcha Lowry who flew in from New York.\n\nI knew I had to spend this money that I didn't have, she said.\n\nIreland adopted the ban in 1983, but support has waned as the country has grown more liberal, legalizing divorce and gay marriage. A poll by the Irish Times earlier this week gave the pro-abortion rights campaign a 12-point lead. Exit polls showed the repeal camp projected to win in a landslide.\n\nIreland definitely is a beacon for the rest of the world, said Emily Faulkner, an American pro-life campaigner. Faulkner flew in not to vote, but to join the anti-abortion rights campaign.\n\nFaulkner said that even if Ireland votes to legalize abortion, that will never stop our fight. That will just make us fight harder against abortion.\n\nThere has been concern over foreign influence on the vote after revelations of meddling in the U.S. election. Earlier this month, Facebook and Google banned ads from campaign groups outside Ireland.\n\nToday's vote is seen as a referendum on the future direction of the nation. Voter turnout was as high as 70 percent in some areas. The official results will be released on Saturday.
In the face of opposition from both Democrats and Republicans, President Trump signed tariffs on steel and aluminum from every country except Mexico and Canada, declaring a 25-percent tax on steel imports and a 10-percent tax on aluminum imports.\n\nIt's really an assault on our country, Mr. Trump said. It's been an assault.\n\nMembers of Mr. Trump's own party have largely been kept in the dark by the White House on the matter. In fact, even as late as Thursday afternoon, trade staffers in key congressional offices still had not been briefed on the White House tariff plan. Mr. Trump announced the tariffs at 3:30 p.m. ET.\n\nA few congressional GOP members have attempted to change the president's mind on the tariffs, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nI think there's a good chance that we will nullify them at least if I have my way because I just don't see it personally, Hatch said. I think most Republicans are not going to put up with this and I personally believe we may be able to stop it in the Congress, he later added.\n\nPresident Trump poses as he signs a presidential proclamation placing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports while surrounded by workers from the steel and aluminum industries at the White House in Washington on Thu., March 8, 2018. Reuters\n\nMany lawmakers have openly denounced Mr. Trump's decision. Others hope they can at least get him to reconsider or modify the legislation if other countries react poorly.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, who has been the GOP's point person on this issue in the House, unsuccessfully attempted to formulate an alternative plan Mr. Trump could support.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, who is not planning to seek re-election, announced Thursday that he will immediately draft legislation that attempts to block the tariffs.\n\nThese so-called 'flexible tariffs' are a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth – protectionism and uncertainty, Flake said in a statement. Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster.\n\nHowever, any potential legislation to counter the tariffs would have to have enough votes to overcome a potential presidential veto. With this in mind, any Republicans would likely be reluctant to vote against the president, along with several rust-belt Democrats who support the tariffs.\n\nI'm encouraged, I really am and I think it gives us a chance to basically reboot, get jobs back to West Virginia, back to America, said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia. I'm excited about that.\n\nCanada and Mexico are temporarily exempt from the tariffs, although their future is uncertain, and lawmakers are still concerned about how other major U.S. allies will react.\n\nSenate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, called the move an all-out trade war on U.S. allies.\n\nThe sweeping tariffs announced today are like dropping a bomb on a flea, he said in a statement.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said it was absolutely prudent and wise to exempt our allies in North America, referring to Canada and Mexico, but said that he hopes to work with the Trump administration on the matter.\n\nWe want to limit as much unintended consequences and collateral economic damage as possible and we want to work with the administration to do that, he said moments before the president's announcement on tariffs at an employee town hall and press conference at Home Depot store support center in Atlanta.\n\nIn terms of other congressional GOP leadership, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he's concerned about the scope of the proposed tariffs.\n\nI am pleased to see that the administration today made accommodations for some of our trading partners and allies, McConnell said in a statement. However, important questions remain about whether ultimately these tariffs will be sufficiently targeted, tailored and limited.\n\nMeanwhile, although House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi agreed with the intent of Mr. Trump's initiative, she disagreed with the way it was introduced.\n\nWe must be strong and smart in fighting back against trade cheaters' assault on American workers – in a targeted and strategic manner, she said in a statement. It is distressing to see President Trump's chaotic roll-out needlessly maximizing the collateral damage to American workers, consumers and our international alliances. Antagonizing our allies and practically inviting retaliation on American manufacturing was completely unnecessary.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, commented that we've already seen the Europeans threaten tariffs against American products like blue jeans, Harley Davidsons and bourbon.\n\nYou know we're seeing the economy booming right now as a result of tax cuts and regulatory reform, Cruz said. And I sure hope we don't undo a lot of the good we've done in the past year by, by imposing tariffs that threaten those very jobs that have been growing and expanding.\n\nOn the other hand, Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, believes that the tariffs may even out the international playing field.\n\nI don't want to start a trade war, Kennedy said. I don't want to see our friends punished along with our enemies. I think that those who cheat, we need to call their hand. If we're cheating, other countries ought to call our hand. That's why they call it 'free and fair trade,' but I don't want to -- in an effort to try to help our steel workers, who are very important to us.\n\nCBS News' chief congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes and Alan He contributed to this report.
This is the full episode of the CBS Evening N...\n\nThis is the full episode of the CBS Evening News from the June 26, 2015 edition\n\nThis is the full episode of the CBS Evening News from the June 26, 2015 edition\n\nHillary Clinton celebrated the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage Friday evening at a Virginia Democratic Party fundraiser that may as well have been a Clinton campaign rally.\n\nThis morning love triumphed in the highest court in our land, she said, before quoting from the majority decision passed down earlier Friday, and allowed same-sex couples to marry. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right.\n\nClinton took aim at her Republican opponents, chiding them for their objections to the Supreme Court's rulings on both same-sex marriage and, earlier in the week, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMany of the Republican candidates seemed determined to lead us right back into the past, she said. Without naming him, Clinton called out Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has yet to announce his bid for the Oval Office, for his suggestion of a constitutional amendment to reinstate the power of the states to define marriage.\n\nInstead of trying to turn back the clock, Clinton said to applause, they should be joining us in saying loudly and clearly no, no to discrimination once and for all.\n\nHer message for Republican candidates on Obamacare: move on.\n\nClinton has emerged as a vocal candidate on the Democratic side for LGBT rights. She regularly mentions it on the campaign trail and, ahead of the ruling this week, her campaign released an emotional video showing the weddings and engagements of same-sex couples.\n\nHer staff was quick to change the header image on her Twitter account to a rainbow-striped history, featuring her logo's signature letter, following the ruling.\n\nShe told the donors that Americans still needed to follow through on ensuring equal treatment for the LGBT community.\n\nThe Supreme Court has done its work, she said, and now we have to do ours.\n\nThe crowd of 1,800 gathered at George Mason University's Patriot Center in Fairfax, Va., divided into half-capacity by a dark curtain, was fired up long before Clinton took the stage. More than an hour earlier, Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), had to yell over applause and cheers as he praised the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nWe are all Americans, he said. We all have the same rights!\n\nAs Clinton's appearance drew closer, John Legend's version of Wake Up Everybody reverberated through the arena. It was hard to tell whether it was the same-sex marriage news or the candidate that was exciting the crowd. Clinton was introduced by her longtime friend Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.\n\nAfter 226 years, he said, with Clinton standing by his side, It is time for a woman president of the United States!
Bill Gross' 32-year marriage legally ended in October, but the nastiness that came with the billionaire hedge fund manager's divorce continues unabated.\n\nSue Gross won a temporary restraining order against Gross last week, alleging in court documents filed in Los Angeles state court that he'd spent nearly $1 million over nine months to have a security company photograph and videotape her moves. She also claimed that Gross sent security personnel to the homes of her siblings and other family members to intimidate and harass them.\n\nBill Gross, a billionaire known in investment circles as the bond king, founded Pacific Investment Management Company, or PIMCO, more than four decades ago, before abruptly resigning in 2014.\n\nThe court filings also allege that he left the couple's $36 million Laguna Beach, California, mansion in utter chaos and disrepair. That include damaged artwork, stained carpets, water damage, balls of human hair in drawers and foul smells that apparently came from spray bottles found in the garbage and labeled with unappetizing smells including barf, according to the suit.\n\nArt work that Bill Gross' ex-wife, Sue Gross, alleges in court documents was deliberately damaged at the couple's Laguna Beach, California, mansion. Court filings\n\nIn the public documents, she described her longtime partner as a cruel, vengeful and vindictive man with practically limitless financial resources.\n\nSince September 2017, Bill Gross has engaged in the unmitigated harassment and intimidation of Sue, her family and friends, according to the court filings obtained by CBS MoneyWatch, which contend Bill Gross' hired help conducted nonstop surveillance of his former spouse and extended family and friends.\n\nCalling the situation an unmitigated nightmare, Sue Gross wrote in the papers that she was mortified that my loved ones have been subjected to harassment.\n\nBill Gross did not return an emailed request for comment. Janus Henderson Investors, where he works as a portfolio manager, also did not return requests for comment. Empire Intelligence, the security firm allegedly hired by Bill Gross, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA court hearing on the restraining order is set for July 3.
ASHLAND, Ohio -- An occasional drifter linked to the slayings of at least four women in just over a decade could always find a place to stay and someone to give him a lift. Even with little money to his name and a string of arrests in his past, Shawn Grate, 40, was magnetic enough to make friends with almost anyone.\n\nHe just had this way about him that he could draw people in, said Tim Denis, who struck up a friendship with Grate that fell apart nearly two years ago over a loan.\n\nDenis got a string of angry text messages from Grate, ending with a warning that still gives him chills: Meet the other me.\n\nGrate, described by those who know him as a charmer with a dark side, has been charged with killing two women whose bodies were found in a vacant home two weeks ago after another woman called 911.\n\nOn that call, the woman said that she had been tied up, but managed to partly freed herself to make the call from her captor's phone while he was asleep. She is heard whispering to a dispatcher, terrified that she will wake him up.\n\nI've been abducted, the woman said in the call, begging, Please hurry.\n\nGrate pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges outlined in a 23-count indictment, including the killings of the two women -- Elizabeth Griffith, 29, and Stacey Stanley, 43 -- and the abduction in Ashland. He showed no emotion, appearing via video feed as a judge read out the counts against him.\n\nOnce in custody, authorities say Grate told them he had killed another woman earlier this summer and a fourth woman sometime around 2005. Police now are looking at whether Grate was involved in the disappearance or death of a fifth woman over a year ago.\n\nInvestigators also want to know if there could be more victims from his past - a period when Grate piled up a long list of arrests, was married for about a yea,r and started a business making handcrafted wood signs that he sold at craft fairs.\n\nThe indictment says Grate repeatedly raped the woman who called 911. It also alleges Grate kidnapped Griffith and burglarized her home and charges him with abusing her corpse in a way that would outrage reasonable community sensibilities. The indictment accuses Grate of kidnapping, raping and robbing Stanley and destroying evidence.\n\nProsecutors say they'll seek the death penalty if he's convicted. Messages seeking comment have been left with his attorneys.\n\nGrate's legal problems began a year after he graduated high school. He spent four years in prison on a burglary charge from 1996 after violating his probation.\n\nBut most of his trouble centered on his treatment of women, with past charges including domestic violence, aggravated menacing and failing to pay child support. He has two children.\n\nHis former wife, who he had a daughter with, filed a protection order against Grate after they divorced in 2012.\n\nI have been estranged from my ex-husband for four years, and he is not a part of our lives, Amber Grate said in a statement that asked for privacy after his arrest.\n\nAfter his marriage ended, he moved from place to place in Ashland and Mansfield - two cities that sit between Cleveland and Columbus.\n\nHe sometimes lived with women he met or squatted in abandoned homes.\n\nHe was definitely a charmer, Denis said. He was able to get people to do what he wanted.\n\nGrate didn't have a car, he said, so he rode his bicycle or relied on friends to get around.\n\nHe worked a few maintenance jobs, but was determined to make a living selling the wood signs. For a short time, he peddled them at a storefront in Mansfield, but they didn't bring in much money, said Denis, who still has a Home Cookin sign in his kitchen.\n\nOutside of doing his signs, he didn't want to do much else, Denis said. He didn't strike me as motivated to get another job.\n\nThe home in Ashland where the two bodies were found was thought to be vacant. Both women were strangled, according to preliminary autopsy reports.\n\nAuthorities have not said how he met the women.\n\nStanley, of Greenwich, was reported missing five days before her body was discovered. Her son, Kurtis Stanley, said his mother had a flat tire late at night and was at gas station a few blocks from the vacant home.\n\nI think it was just an accidental run in, he said. He was out preying on women and he took my mom.

I am Bob Schieffer and this is FACE THE NATION.\n\nBreaking news overnight as coordinated bombing attacks in Sri Lanka leave hundreds dead. We'll have the latest. Then we'll turn to the news at home.\n\nPresident Trump wasn't taking questions from reporters about the Mueller report's release as he headed to Mar-a-Lago for the holiday weekend with the first lady.\n\nMAN: Sir, why did you think Robert Mueller's appointment would end your presidency, Sir?\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: But Mister Trump did take the time to tweet out a silent video of celebration with his version of the report's conclusions.

Margaret is off today.\n\nIt is a grim Easter Sunday and third night of Passover as we come on the air. There have been eight bombings overnight in and around three cities in Sri Lanka. At least two hundred are reported dead, four hundred and fifty more injured, and those numbers will likely go higher. Our CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports now from New Delhi, India.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nELIZABETH PALMER: On what should have been the most joyful day in the Christian calendar, there was shock and grief. One bomb went off at St. Anthony's Shrine in the capital Colombo. Another at St. Sebastian's Negombo. The blast was big enough to have destroyed the roof. Violence is nothing new here in a country that has suffered years of civil war, but an attack of this scale on Christians is unprecedented. And it appears that foreigners were targeted, too. At the Shangri-La Hotel, a five-star destination for foreign tourists, a bomb shattered the massive plate glass windows the whole length of the second floor while bodies lay around the entrance.\n\nThis complex and coordinated attack has stunned the nation. So far no one has claimed responsibility.\n\nElizabeth Palmer, CBS News, New Delhi.\n\n(End VT)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: We turn now to the Mueller report and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee Congressman Elijah Cummings. He joins us from Baltimore. Mister Chairman, thank you very much for being with us. I want to start with this: the report is out, the partisan divide seems wide or even wider than ever. What happens now?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D-Maryland/@RepCummings/Oversight Committee Chairman): This document, the Mueller document, has now left us with a roadmap to go forward. I think he basically said to us as a Congress, it's up to you to take this further with regard to obstruction and the-- and other matters that might come up.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Well, already, Mister Chairman, Elizabeth Warren, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Maxine Waters, Julian Castro have said we should begin proceedings to impeach the President. Are you there yet?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: I'm not-- I'm not there yet, but I-- I-- I can foresee that possibly coming. But, again, the fact is is that I think we have to do-- be very careful here. The American people-- a-- a lot of them clear-- clearly still don't believe that President Trump is doing things to destroy our democracy and has done a lot of things very poorly. And so I think that we need to make sure the Congress has all the information and then we need to be able to have the public know that information so that they can see that they have a President that basically has been about the business, I think, of doing great harm not only to our country but to our democracy.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: But there is also this reality: at this point there simply are not enough votes in the Senate to remove the President even if the House does move to impeach him. So is it smart to start impeachment proceedings under those circumstances? We all know what happened in the Clinton impeachment.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: Well-- yeah. But I think this is a little different than Clinton's situation. We have a-- a President who-- here, who basically was instructing government employees and non-government employees to commit crimes to tell lies and to be deceitful. He himself was on television constantly railing against our-- the prosecutor and railing against just about anybody who had to do a-- anything to do with this investigation. He went against the FBI agents, CIA, whoever it was that he felt could-- what could-- could play a role in him being indicted.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: It's the numbers that we're talking about here. This is a political act. And if you do vote to impeach him and then the Senate votes not to remove him, won't that look like a victory for him?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: It may very well. But do you know at some time, Bob, I got to tell you, there comes a point in life where we all have to make decisions based upon the fact that it is our watch. And, you know, history, I think even if we did not win possibly, if there were not impeachment, I think history would smile upon us for standing up for the Constitution. You know I hear a lot of people say that they are tired of hearing about the Mueller Report. Well, we don't have time to get tired because the Russians aren't getting tired. They are attacking our electoral system every single day, if not every hour. And so we-- we've got to-- we-- we're going to have to stand up. And the other thing, Bob, is that now that we are-- we know all the information that we-- we-- we know we can't just allow this to go on and on. If the President-- if we do nothing here what is going to happen is that the President is going to be emboldened. He is going to be emboldened because he's said, Well, I got away with that. And then the people who-- his aiders and abettors that is that-- the Republicans in the Congress they will say, Oh, he is pretty strong, and they will continue to go along with him. We cannot afford that, our democracy cannot afford that.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: What intrigued you most about this report? What do you think needs to be investigated now?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: Oh, my God. I-- I think we need-- we need to look at the finances of this President that-- I think we need to look at what he knew, what with-- with regard to the firing of various people, we need to-- to know what, why Mister Barr gave us a-- a one-sided summary which has almost no resemblance to what's actually in the report. And we also need to know something else, Bob, we know-- we need to know from the-- Mister Mueller, exactly what his intentions were. Did he intend for us, as a Congress, to look at this and take some type of action or did-- or did he-- did he feel as if there was truly no collusion or conspiracy? We need to hear that, and then-- and then we also need to hear from people like the counsel for the President and see what Mister McGahn, who was very clearly disobeying the President in many instances and actually by disobeying him, he came to his rescue.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Talk to me about the way the-- this-- this report was released. First, we get a letter that suggests the President hasn't been found guilty of-- of anything and then they choose to release it on Easter weekend when most people are thinking about things other than politics. Was this some kind of a public relations plan to-- to soften the blow of this thing or did it just happen this way?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: No, I don't think it just happened this way. It's too many things that happened. And then don't forget he talked about the Trump campaign being spied upon, and there was so much here. But, clearly, this-- the-- Mister Barr is acting as the defense counsel for the President of the United States. When really, Bob, he's supposed to be our lawyer, the people's lawyer. And I-- and I am appealing to Mister Barr to please do the job that you are supposed to do. There's supposed to be some kind of independence but he bent over backwards to give this President the benefit of the doubt. He even expressed empathy with the fact that the President, when he came in, was under pressure. Well, all Presidents are under pressure and if they're not-- don't expect to be under pressure-- they shouldn't do the job.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: What about McGahn are we-- how do you feel about what he did?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: You know I-- I-- feel pretty good about McGahn, because McGahn stood up to this President, and there-- there are a lot of McGahns out there, and we need more of them to stand up. And-- and, Bob, I'm telling you, I'm going to-- I'm going to fight with everything I've got because I-- as I told the President not long ago when I met with him, I said Mister President the greatest thing that you and I can do is leave a democracy intact for generations yet unborn.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: What did he have to say to you about that?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: He just smiled and put his head down and that was it.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Mister Chairman, and this will be my final question, the investigation itself, did Special Counsel Mueller do a good job?\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: I think-- I-- I think he did do a good job. But I will know better once we see the report, the unredacted report-- report come out. I want to say to everybody, all of my whistleblowers we need your help because the-- the President and his lawyers are blocking all--- every bit of information that we need to do our investigation. He has been trying to block us. I beg you, whistleblowers, come out, help us, call us.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Mister Chairman, thank you so much for joining us this morning.\n\nREPRESENTATIVE ELIJAH CUMMINGS: Thank you.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And we'll be back in one minute with Senator Mike Lee. So don't go away.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Well, for a different view, I assume it's going to be a different view we're going to turn now to Senator Mike Lee who is not only the senior Senator from Utah, but also a constitutional scholar. He's the author of a new book, Our Lost Declaration: America's Fight Against Tyranny from King George to the Deep State. Senator, thank you. We are going to ask you about that book, but we, obviously, have to start with the Mueller Report. You just heard Chairman Cummings. But here's the question: You're on the Judiciary Committee, Democrats seem ready to, some of them at least, ready to impeach right now. Do you believe, as Chairman Cummings, and I think the chairman of your committee, Jerry Nadler, said this morning that what Mister Mueller did was leave you a road map, leave Congress a road map for further investigation?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE (R-Utah/@SenMikeLee/Our Lost Declaration): I suspect that's what the Democrats, particularly in the House of Representatives, are going to want to do. That, of course, is a political question and I think politically speaking it would be a mistake for them to do it. It sounds like some of them are inclined to go down that road. But what we've got to remember, Bob, is that the number one takeaway from this report is that there was no collusion. We've got people, who for the last two years have been using the Russian's attempt to undermine the legitimacy of our electoral process, as an effort within this country to undermine this President, and the process by which he was elected. But there was no collusion. It isn't there. Not a scintilla of evidence supports that. So it's time to move on.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Your colleague, the junior senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, put out a pretty stunning statement yesterday. I just want to read this to you, this is Mitt Romney speaking, I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty by individuals in the highest office in the land, including the President. I am appalled that federal-- fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia--including information that had been illegally obtained, that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement, and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in the Ukraine, close quote. Your reaction.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Well, first of all, I think Senator Romney has some credibility with regard to Russia. Remember it was Senator Romney as a presidential candidate in 2012 who pointed out that we ought to be very concerned about Russia. Sadly, his warnings went unheeded. And under President Obama's leadership over the next four years Russia's activities, its-- its nefarious efforts to undermine our system continued. And it-- perhaps that's some of what's motivating Senator Romney to speak out about this.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Well, do you agree with him?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Look, there's nothing in this report that changes my view of this President. I don't think most Americans, I don't think most senators, most members of Congress, I don't think most Americans will have their view of the President of the United States changed by this report. There's just nothing in there that should do that.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Do you think the Special Counsel, Mister Mueller, was fair to the President?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Well, I think the special counsel certainly was thorough. I-- I-- I find Pete's-- pieces of the report a little bit odd. For example, when he talks about obstruction, I think it's odd to say I'm not going to make a recommendation, but I'm going to sound like I'm making a recommendation. There-- there's-- there's not evidence that I can point to, but, nonetheless, I couldn't get there even if I did. It's kind of strange to spend two years on that and then speak with the sort of a tone that is reminiscent of Pinocchio in the movie Shrek 3. I'm not going to say that I'm not deciding--it's full of double negatives. It's kind of confusing.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Alright. I-- I want to talk about this book a little bit that you've written. I liked it. It's about the great truths expressed in the Declaration of Independence. You argue that the government has gotten too big. I totally agree with you on that. I-- but I'm not as worried about the bigness of government so much as I am about the incompetence of government. And I think some of that has come about simply because the best and brightest in America are turning away from public service and turning away running for office. And I guess I would ask you how can we change that?\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Well, Bob, first of all, I'm not sure those two things are different, and I'm not sure you and I are all that far apart on it. When government gets bigger, it necessarily becomes more incompetent. Human beings are flawed. They're fallible. And one of the reasons why I wrote this book is I wanted to point out that the more things change, the more they stay the same in some ways. Human nature hasn't changed in the two and a half centuries since we became an independent nation. It is still the case that governments have to rely on fallible, mortal human beings. And just as King George III sent forth swarms of officers to harass us and to eat out our substance we always have to be wary of large government agencies. The deep state, if you will, that has a tendency to become this self-perpetuating organism. One-- one that can eat out our substance and harass the very people it's supposed to serve.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Let me just read you what you wrote in this book which I found very interesting, Over the last eight decades, the people's elected representatives have made countless choices that have been steadily diminishing their own power and with the power-- with that the power of the people they represent. In many respects they have done so for a simple, understandable but indefensible reason, delegating to others the difficult and contentious task of making law has a tendency to make re-election easier.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: That's exactly right. What we've seen is a gradual shift of power away from the American people taking place in two steps. First it's moved from the state and local level, where most people have more control over their local government than they do their national government. So it's moved from the people to Washington. Then within Washington, people's elected lawmakers have voluntarily relinquished the lawmaking power. The-- the one job they've got, they've handed over to unelected unaccountable bureaucrats. It's bad for the people, it's bad for the separation of powers, but it's in some cases good for the elected official because it makes it easier to get re-elected when you're not making real laws, making real decisions. And that creates problems.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And-- and this leaves our representatives more worried about getting a primary opponent than legislation that they should be thinking about. They spend so much money, much time raising money now they have no time to legislate. Senator, thank you so much. Congratulations on the book. Hope to see you again.\n\nSENATOR MIKE LEE: Thank you.\n\n(AUDIO CUT)\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: You may have noticed-- we hope you noticed that last week FACE THE NATION was off the air due to the Masters Golf tournament. But here at the broadcast, we did not stop working. After New Jersey Senator Cory Booker officially announced he was running for the Democratic nomination last Saturday, Margaret Brennan caught up with him in Newark.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-New Jersey/@CoryBooker): It really is home.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You think there's too much infighting in the Democratic Party right now?\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: I think that we have-- and saw in the last election-- people-- a lot of infighting that-- that undermined our ability to win that election. I plan on being the nominee, but if I'm not, I'm going to make sure that we unify behind whoever is there. Because, again, we can't fight each other, and as opposed to unifying each other, which was going to make us stronger. And so in this election-- this is why I talk about things like grace. Why I start talking about things about a more courageous empathy for one another. Because there are definitely a politics in this country that believes that they will do better if they can divide us against each other. I'm going to run a race, not getting down into the gutter, not trying to fight darkness with darkness. I'm calling to a more courageous empathy, a more-- a revival of civic grace, for us to get back to what I think patriotism is.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: New Jersey is a pharmaceutical hub.\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: Yes.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You've signed on to Bernie Sanders' proposal of this Medicare for All bill. What happens to all those companies and people employed by those touching the insurance or drug industries?\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: We share a value in America, and that's where we should always start, our common values, that nobody in this country should go bankrupt because they get sick or put aside lifesaving drugs because they can't afford them. That's a value I think all Americans share. So now the question is how do we get there? I think the best way to get there is Medicare for all. But there are a lot of pathways to get to that end, and we've got to start now.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: So what happens though to the private insurance companies and to the private pharmaceutical companies under your vision of this--\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: Under my presidency--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: --plan.\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: --well hopefully in my first hundred days we're going to put forward having a public option for Americans. That means doing things like lowering Medicare eligibility down to fifty-five, which by the way would actually lower costs for even the private insurance because you'd see more older people moving out. Number two, one of the biggest drivers to health care costs in this country is the price of those pharmaceutical drugs. It's unacceptable. So we would use the power of Medicare to negotiate down costs.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But this doesn't mean doing away with private health insurance. This doesn't mean government's setting drug prices.\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: Listen, we-- we live in a country where-- of hundred and eighty million Americans have private insurance and are satisfied with their insurance, and we have unions who have negotiated for their insurance rates. Anybody that's going to come forward with a bold health care plan has to show what the pathway to getting there is. And the first way we can start to earn trust on that way is to create a viable public option.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What is Cory Booker's immigration plan? Do you accept that there's a humanitarian crisis?\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: I-- I accept that there's a humanitarian crisis that is being caused by this President. There is a humanitarian crisis when you throw children into cages and-- and separate families. That's a human rights violation. We can keep our country safe and strong and honor human rights as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you do with the record number of family units that are crossing?\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: Well, first of all, Donald Trump's not even listening to his own people. You-- you have--\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well what does Cory Booker do?\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: Well, I'll tell you what Cory Booker does--the exact opposite of what he's doing. You have a President that is not supporting those places where it's sourcing the immigration in the first place. We do lots of foreign aid from Africa to-- to-- to the-- the-- the Middle East. We should be making sure that those countries that are going through crises that are causing all this immigration that we're doing more to intervene, to support human rights and basic dignity in those countries. That's a lower cost way to do-- to deal with it than to have the horrors of these families with small children trying to make thousands of miles journey to come through our borders. And at our border, we need to make sure that we have an asylum system that actually works as Republicans and Democrats design that asylum system to work.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: What is your view on how the attorney general has described what he has said was spying on the Trump campaign?\n\nSENATOR CORY BOOKER: For the attorney general of the United States of America to make such a claim, back it up with no evidence whatsoever, de-legitimized his position as an independent-- he's not the President's attorney general. He's the attorney general for the United States of America. The highest law enforcement officer in the land. I think what he did was unfortunate and eroded even more of the trust the American people should have in their attorney general.\n\n(End VT)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Margaret's full interview with Senator Booker is available on FaceTheNation.com. And we'll be back in a moment.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Some of our stations are leaving us now, but we'll be right back with a panel of authors all with new books about formidable women.\n\nAnd we'll have an interview with Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Caro.\n\nAnd I'll have some final thoughts on Notre Dame. So don't go away.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And welcome back the FACE THE NATION. I'm Bob Schieffer. Margaret is off today. We have just come through women's history month, and here is some news. Historians are not only taking more notice of women of consequence, but more and more people are reading about them. Example one, Michelle Obama's memoir Becoming. It is on its way to being the biggest-selling memoir of all time.\n\nToday, we're going to focus on three more very different women of consequence who are the subjects of our new books by our panel. Lynne Olson is the author of Madame Fourcade's Secret War. Susan Page's new book is The Matriarch: Barbara Bush and the Making of an American Dynasty. And Evan Thomas is with us to discuss his latest, First: Sandra Day O'Connor. Well, welcome to all of you.\n\nLYNNE OLSEN (Madame Fourcade's Secret War): Thank you.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Evan, I want to start with you, because in a rave review in the New York Times, Jeffrey Toobin, the legal analyst, said that she was perhaps the deciding vote in so many crucial cases, abortion, affirmative action, and the vote that gave the presidency to George W. Bush, for example, that she was the most consequential woman in American history.\n\nEVAN THOMAS (First: Sandra Day O'Connor): Yes, in terms of her impact. I mean, obviously, there have been a lot of great women in American history, so maybe that's a bit too far, but-- but she had a big impact. I mean if you preserve abortion rights and affirmative action for twenty-five years and you're first woman on the Supreme Court in history, that's a lot of power.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Could she have been confirmed today?\n\nEVAN THOMAS: No. I don't think she would be chosen today. She had no particular track record. I don't think that a moderate Republican President, this one or anyone else, would name her because now they want a track record. They want to know how you're going to vote. And with her, it was a guess.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: As you know, Sandra Day O'Connor and Barbara Bush were friends--\n\nSUSAN PAGE (The Matriarch/@SusanPage): Mm-Hm.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: --but they were quite different. As the wife of one President and the mother of another and also the mother of a governor, how influential will she be remembered as?\n\nSUSAN PAGE: She was influential more behind the scenes than in public, but on issues like-- like addressing the AIDS crisis, she played a big role behind the scenes in her-- in her husband's administration. And when it came to the Iraq War, she was a voice who spoke up against the Iraq War and the direction it was taking with her son until he finally told her to stop.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Marie-Madeleine Fourcade, she was beautiful, she was brilliant and she was a woman and, yet, she led the largest intelligence service in occupied France.\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: That's right.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: How did she do that?\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: It's particularly interesting because back then France, well, in some degree it still is, was an extremely patriarchal conservative society. And the idea of a woman doing anything like that was just beyond the pale. And--\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: How did the men react to her?\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: I think part of it was she was as courageous as any man, and she was willing to be in the field with her agents. She was willing to face and she did face the same dangers that they did every day. She was captured twice by the Gestapo and escaped. So I think they got beyond her gender and they saw her for what she was, which was this astonishing leader.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: You know, what I found interesting in all three of these books, these were not books really about icons but about human beings.\n\nEVAN THOMAS: Right.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: There is some good and some bad in-- in all three of these characters. And also what I found interesting, all of these books had love stories. You got a little scoop on that.\n\nEVAN THOMAS: Yes.\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: Yeah.\n\nEVAN THOMAS: It turns out that Bill Rehnquist, the chief justice of the United States, when back in his law school days, actually proposed marriage to then-Sandra Day was her name. Both Sandra Day O'Connor and Bill Rehnquist kept that a secret for the rest of their lives. They didn't tell-- they didn't even tell their families. My wife, Osce, and I found that in a box of correspondence. It wasn't in her regular papers. It was in her chambers in a-- in the basement. I don't think the family knew it was in the box. And there is this love letter, the fourteen love letters, actually. And one says, Sandy, will you marry me? Now, the answer was no. She married John. She married the right guy, and-- and Bill Rehnquist married the love of his life, so it all worked out in the end.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And, Susan-- well, of course, we all know about the love story between Barbara and-- and George Bush, but you found a-- out a lot about that.\n\nSUSAN PAGE: Well, you know, we know that it was, essentially, love at first sight at a high school dance over Christmas in 1941. Long marriage, seventy-three years, ups and downs during the marriage. A very fierce partnership at the end. And at the-- at the very end, when I was interviewing Barbara Bush, she-- she expressed no fear about dying, but she worried about dying before he did.\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: Mm-Hm.\n\nSUSAN PAGE: And-- and-- and two days before she died, they had a-- an incredible exchange where she said, I'm not going to worry about you, George. And he said, I'm not going to worry about you, Barb. He gave her permission to die. She gave him permission to live. And it was kind of the final statement of the love affair that started at that high school dance.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And then, of course, Madame Fourcade, this was quite an unusual love story.\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: This was an unusual love story. And again, like Evan, I didn't find out about it until last year when I was in Paris. Marie-Madeleine Fourcade wrote a memoir, and she talked very lovingly about her number two, her deputy in this network who was a dashing Air Force pilot. When I was reading the memoir, I thought, there's more to it than-- than what she's writing about. And as it turns out, she, in fact, did have an affair with this guy. She fell madly in love with him, he with her. They were both very passionate, charismatic people, and she got pregnant in the middle of the war. She got pregnant in November 1942. And she was on the run from the Gestapo while she was pregnant, you know, going from place the place to place. Finally, had the baby in June 1943 in Lyon. Her-- the love of her life was captured about three months later by the Gestapo and was executed toward the end of the war.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: All three of these women made the most of being underestimated by the men they were dealing with.\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: Yes. She definitely did. Again, you know, the idea of a woman doing what she did was just extraordinary. And-- and she benefited and other women in the resistance, women played a huge role in the French Resistance. They were absolutely necessary. But Germans come from the same kind of society the French do, you know, very conservative, very traditional, very paternalistic. And, of course, women don't do that kind of thing. You know, they are either wives or mothers. And so you don't expect them to be out there, you know, spying or-- and so they got away with a lot initially.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And-- and, you know, Evan, one of the things that struck me in your book is how much Sandra Day O'Connor learned from her mother and how her mother managed her father, especially when he had been drinking too much and how she used that when she was on the court.\n\nEVAN THOMAS: Right. Right. Sandra Day O'Connor was-- I mean, her-- her dad told her about self-reliance and was loving and great, but her dad could be a little rough on her mom at night. And she watched the way her mom was not passive. She didn't roll over. But she avoided stupid fights. She didn't take the bait. You know, she had a way of avoiding provocation, just walking away. This was very useful to Sandra O'Connor in dealing with men. And sometimes she did have to stand up to them. There's a-- a great scene in the Arizona legislature. She is majority leader. The House Appropriations Committee Chairman is a drunk. And she calls him on it. And he says, If you were a man, I'd punch you on the nose. And she said to him, If you were a man, you could. So there were-- she picked the shots. There were times when she did, but at other times she walked away from the dumb fight.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And we'll be back in just a minute.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: We're back now with our biographers, Lynne Olsen, Susan Page and Evan Thomas. Evan, I want to get back to you about how women in those days were dealing with men, and you talked about Sandra Day O'Connor and what she had learned from her mother. But there was one very important issue, and that was abortion, where the way she handled it with Scalia had an impact and-- and turned around that issue.\n\nEVAN THOMAS: Scalia was condescending to her, big mistake. Scalia thought he had five votes to overturn Roe v. Wade. And it looked like he did, but Scalia could be-- could be a condescending person. And he was condescending to Tony Kennedy, who he thought was going to be the vote. She was respectful to Justice Kennedy, and at the end of the day, she formed this little coalition and surprised Scalia, and by being modest and respectful and shrewd, she was able to winkle a vote away to-- to her side and preserve abortion rights in the Casey case in 1992. That was a-- that was a very subtle moment of human intelligence.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Did any of these women consider themselves the feminists, Susan?\n\nSUSAN PAGE: Well, I-- I actually talked to Barbara Bush about that at some length because it seemed to me she walked the walk of a feminist. She was strong-minded, she was forceful, she-- she didn't hesitate to speak up whether you want to hear from her or not sometimes, but she refused to call herself a feminist. And I think that she felt that the women's movement had been disrespectful at least in-- in the early days to women like her who had chosen to stay home and raise her-- their family rather than pursue professional careers. She was mocked at points during her life, and there was a famous case of the Wellesley College commencement, where she was going to give the commencement address which she did, but some of the graduating students had a petition saying she wasn't appropriate role model for them.\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: No, she didn't-- definitely did not consider herself a feminist as we regard it now because feminism wasn't even a blip on the radar screen perhaps back then. She was an extremely strong woman. She padded herself on gathering women like her into the network, but her main goal was to free France from the Germans. It wasn't to further a woman's cause.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Justice O'Connor was sort of a bridge. I mean she had to be careful in Arizona politics not to come across as a woman's libber. So she-- she-- and she was careful about that and smart, but she did care about women's rights. Of course, she did.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: How did these three remarkable women deal with their own vulnerabilities?\n\nLYNNE OLSEN: You can't-- you can't imagine or I can't imagine what it's like to know every day that you could be arrested and executed. I mean, that-- that every day you are risking your life. And not only was she risking her own life, she was risking the lives of thousands of agents, and-- and she felt that responsibility tremendously. So she was very, very aware of her vulnerability.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Susan, you-- you wrote at one point that, yeah, Barbara Bush became so upset that she contemplated suicide.\n\nSUSAN PAGE: That's right. Nineteen seventy-six, she-- she-- she had an empty nest at home. Her husband had taken a job heading the CIA, a job she had encouraged him not to take, by the way. She found herself falling into darkness. She told me that she would be driving her car and have an urge to plow into a tree or to steer into the path of an oncoming car and she would have to pull off the side of the road and stop and wait for the impulse to go away. She told me that she wasn't sure how she came out of this period of darkness after about six months, but one thing she did was she began to volunteer at a hospice. And there is maybe some lesson there that if you hit a rough patch, find somebody who has hit a rougher patch and help them and it will help you.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: How did these three women change in your own minds as you-- the more you got into this research?\n\nEVAN THOMAS: Well, she, to me, became more lovable. I've said earlier she could be a little scary. Journalist-- she was suspicious around journalists and, well, we know rightly so. I found her to be a formidable and a little cold. But as I got to know her and I got to know her family, I realized that I was wrong about that. She was-- she-- she wasn't-- you know, she was a good politician. She could work a crowd. But there was a part of her that she was never going to reveal. I think this is a key actually to her success.\n\nSUSAN PAGE: I admired Barbara Bush. I thought she was formidable and consequential and I thought her story hadn't been told, but one thing I found in-- in writing this book is-- has how much fun she was. Interviewing her was a treat, and telling her-- her telling stories about her relationship with Nancy Reagan, for instance, it was as though she was liv-- reliving their friction from yesterday. It was that--\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: They didn't like one another.\n\nSUSAN PAGE: They did not like each other.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Lynne.\n\nLYNNE OLSON: I think pain and grief really stayed with Marie-Madeleine for the rest of her life. After the war she survived, as did a number of her-- of her top people. They went off. They were men. They went off and-- and formed an airline and they did all these great things. She basically devoted the rest of her life to the agents who survived and especially to the wives and children of those who didn't. She raised money for them until the day she died to make sure that they could continue living, you know, in a-- in a substantive way. France was not willing to give them much money, and-- and she did her best to do what everything she could for them.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Wow. Well, I'm sorry we have to leave it there. Thank you all for a great discussion, and we'll be right back with more.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Robert Caro, the legendary biographer of Lyndon Baines Johnson, has just released a book on an unlikely subject, himself. That seemed reason enough to pay him a call.\n\n(Begin VT)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: So this is where the magic happens?\n\nThe only decorations in Robert Caro's New York City office are the outlines of his next book tacked on the walls and the manual typewriter on which he is hammering it out.\n\nSo why do you do that? Why did you never go to computers?\n\nROBERT CARO (Biographer): To slow myself down. So I write my first drafts over and over-- in long hand because that's the slowest way of committing your thoughts to paper.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: No one can accuse eighty-three-year-old Robert Caro of rushing his work. He's devoted his life to investigating and reporting on just two figures. Robert Moses, the urban planner who never held elected office but whose roads, bridges, and buildings and parks helped shape New York City more than any mayor or governor in the twentieth century. And Lyndon Johnson, who held every high office in Washington, including President of the United States. After more than forty years and four books about Johnson he's trying to complete the fifth and final installment. He says they are not biographies but studies in power.\n\nYou talk about power, and we all know the old thing, power corrupts and all that, but you make a point of saying that it also causes things to happen.\n\nROBERT CARO: What I think power always does, Bob, is reveal. When you are climbing trying to get power, often you have to conceal what you really intend to do or how you're doing it, because if people saw that, they might disagree with your aims or not be afraid of the way you're doing it and not want to give you more power.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Johnson always knew just how far that power would go.\n\nHis first rule was never tell a man to go to hell unless you can make him.\n\nROBERT CARO: Exactly. That-- that was a great rule, yes.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: I've always thought that Johnson not only had a great ability to explain to people why it was in their interest to be on his side--\n\nROBERT CARO: Right.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: --but also why it was not in their interest to be against him.\n\nROBERT CARO: You know, John Connolly once said to me, Lyndon Johnson never forgot and he never forgave. And you didn't want to be on the wrong side of him.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Johnson was never afraid to go against conventional wisdom.\n\nROBERT CARO: You know when Johnson becomes President, Kennedy's assassinated, four days later he has to give a speech to a joint session of Congress, and he-- so he's not even in the Oval Office, yet. Four of his speechwriters are gathered around his kitchen table writing the speech. So sometime late in the evening wearing a bathrobe, Lyndon Johnson comes down and says, how you doing. They said, We only know one thing, don't make a priority of civil rights, don't emphasize civil rights. If you do that, you're going to get the southerners who control Congress angry and they're going to stop your whole legislative program like they did with Kennedy. So it's a noble cause, but it's a lost cause. Don't take it up. Johnson says to them, well, what the hell is the presidency for then? And in his speech, of course, he says our first priority is civil rights.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And he never gave up on that cause.\n\nPRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON: It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life. Their cause must be our cause, too, because it's not just Negroes but really it's all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome.\n\n(Crowd cheering)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Johnson went on to score one legislative victory after another but he also wielded his power to expand the war in Vietnam, and it tore the country apart.\n\nCROWD (in unison): Hey, hey, LBJ, how many people did you kill today?\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: The criticism became so intense in 1968, Johnson decided not to seek reelection, hoping to spend full time on ending the war. But the war would go on for another seven years, eventually, taking the lives of fifty-eight thousand Americans and three million Vietnamese. Caro refuses to compare Johnson to the Current President, but when the airwaves are filled with talk like this--\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: To Robert Caro, it's just old news.\n\nROBERT CARO: I think Lyndon Johnson felt the-- the very same way, I can tell you that. He said no President ever endured what I had to endure. Yeah.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Has any President that you know about ever felt while he was in office that he was getting a good or fair press?\n\nROBERT CARO: Not-- not that I know about.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: In his latest book Working, Caro writes at length for the first time about himself, even sharing some of his best advice, shut up and let the other guy talk.\n\nROBERT CARO: I have to keep reminding myself because I talk too much to shut up. So the way I do it is to write SU in my notebooks. If you looked through my notebooks, you would see a hell of a lot of SUs.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: The one place Caro is never silent is on the page. And he says the end is in sight for his final book on LBJ.\n\nROBERT CARO: Well, this is, a matter of fact, is what I've written so far. This is the manuscript of the last volume as far as--\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Really?\n\nROBERT CARO: --as far as I've got here, the last page is three ninety-two.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Well, let me ask you this: if you had known these books were going to take this long, would you have embarked on this project-- these projects?\n\nROBERT CARO: Pro-- probably not. I had no idea. And I had no idea that Johnson books were going to take-- you just keep coming across things that seem to you to be worth telling people, seem to me to be worth telling people about.\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Well, I think we're glad you did.\n\nROBERT CARO: Thank you.\n\n(End VT)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: And we'll be right back.\n\n(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\n\nBOB SCHIEFFER: Like so many of you, I am sure I sat before my television all day Monday as I watched in profound sadness the burning of Notre Dame. I could not turn away. It was even more compelling to those in Paris. The Washington Post's James McAuley reported that when police ordered spectators to move back from the fire, they could not bring themselves to turn away and instead walked backward. Seeing it go up in flames reminded us of the fragility of old things, that nothing is forever, even people and things we didn't know we would miss until they were gone. Maybe it was more than that, because it had been there so long, Notre Dame had become a symbol of the evolving continuity of Western culture, a reminder of how we became who we are, a symbol of the great truth that runs not only through Christianity but all great religious traditions, that love is stronger than hate. Then in our sadness, within twenty-four hours, we realized that the bell towers of Notre Dame still stood tall, and millions of people had pledged to rebuild it just the way it was. And so it was that Notre Dame reassured us once more that for all the chaos good people had come together to demonstrate again the power of love and to help us understand who we are.\n\nFor FACE THE NATION, this is Bob Schieffer in Washington. Margaret will be back next Sunday. I want to thank you for inviting me into your homes once more. Moderating FACE THE NATION was never a job to me it was a privilege.
An Ohio businessman suddenly faces deportation less than two weeks after immigration officials told him his stay was delayed, CBS affiliate WKBN reports. Now, instead of Amer Al Adi Othman having a meal with his family, he's on a hunger strike from his jail cell Wednesday until the matter is resolved.\n\nOthman, who came to U.S. from Jordan almost 40 years ago, was arrested and detained before what was expected to be a routine hearing on his immigration status at an ICE regional office near Cleveland on Tuesday, his attorney, David Leopold, told WKBN.\n\nLeopold said ICE officials told him Othman would be deported.\n\nWhen Othman showed up for his 9 a.m. appointment, Leopold said, The first thing out of their mouth was, 'We're not going to beat around the bush. We're going to take him into custody.'\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) was at the hearing.\n\nThis is absolutely insane, he said. He would have bought a ticket and packed his bags. He would have left. They put him jail. They're treating him like an animal.\n\nShortly after Jan. 1, Othman was told by ICE officials that he would have to leave the country, but on Jan. 4, he received a stay following outcry from the community and bipartisan effort from politicians.\n\nOthman, who owns a deli and a hookah bar in Youngstown, has contributed to the revitalization of the city's downtown district, according to locals. Youngstown Mayor Jamael Tito Brown told Fox 8 that Othman's deportation is a loss for the city, saying he was a pioneer for the downtown renaissance.\n\nActress and activist Alyssa Millano also retweeted a video featuring Othman and his current situation.\n\nWe need to get serious about protesting these actions, Milano tweeted. This is not only [un-American] it is inhumane.\n\nThe timeline of what will happen to Othman is still unclear, according to his attorney. His wife Fidda Musleh told The Vindicator on Wednesday that the whole situation is not just as Othman continues with his hunger strike.\n\nMusleh told the newspaper his application for a green card in the 1990s was denied over a claim that his first marriage was fraudulent. Othman's first wife filed an affidavit recanting the statement she signed in 1990 stating that the marriage was a fraud, and he has tried to fight deportation for years.\n\nMusleh released a statement on Tuesday, saying her husband was given no warning or opportunity to say goodbye to his four daughters.\n\nAl, who had been willing to voluntarily depart two weeks ago, is now behind bars in county jail for an undetermined period of time. ICE officials could not explain what change of circumstances brought about this cruel and humiliating gesture, she said. Al posed no flight risk, reported to each and every immigration meeting and had no criminal record.
FRESNO, Calif. -- A British man suspected of slashing his wife and mother-in-law to death with a knife at a central California home was found hiding 150 miles away at a coastal homeless camp after a four-day manhunt, police said Wednesday.\n\nA tip from a homeless person led investigators to a sleeping Dave Thomas McCann, 49, and he was taken into custody on suspicion of killing his wife, Tierney Cooper McCann, 36, and her mother, Judith Cooper, 68.\n\nTierney McCann's sister, Cortney Rider, said she was at the home in Clovis on Saturday when Dave McCann kicked down the door and attacked her family. She told KFSN-TV in Fresno that she watched him cut her sister's throat.\n\nHe looked at me and said, 'You're next,' and I immediately ran out the front door and ran to the next door neighbors, Rider told the TV station.\n\nShe said her mother was hiding in a bedroom, but he knocked down the door and slit her throat. McCann's failing marriage and folding business may be what caused him to snap, Rider said.\n\nMcCann's business partners told CBS affiliate KSEE that in the past couple months McCann seemed to be acting differently and that they noticed little red flags. McCann reportedly ran his business, SOS Energy and Property Solutions, out of the same home where he allegedly committed the double murder.\n\nAfter the slayings, McCann drove a moving truck toward the coast, abandoning it two hours away in the city of Paso Robles, police say. From there, he may have ridden a bicycle and hitched rides north to the coastal town of Seaside, investigators said.\n\nMcCann did not use a cellphone and did not withdraw money from an ATM, which could have pinpointed his location, Clovis Police Chief Matt Basgall said at a news conference in Seaside after the arrest.\n\nThis is a case where Mr. McCann went off the grid, Basgall said.\n\nA break in the search came when a homeless person tipped off investigators to McCann's whereabouts. Officers found McCann asleep at the homeless camp, Basgall said.\n\nA day before the slayings, McCann had gone to the Clovis Police Department and asked an officer to accompany him to the home to collect some of his personal belongings, which happened without incident, said Janet Stoll-Lee, a police spokeswoman.\n\nMcCann is a British citizen living in the United States on a green card, she said. She did not know whether he had an attorney yet to comment on his behalf.
This time last year, Marco Villada was stuck in Mexico trying to reenter the U.S., where he has lived since he and his family immigrated from Mexico when he was 6 years old. He is now one of several current and former Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients invited by members of Congress to attend the State of the Union address Tuesday night.\n\nIt's an opportunity to share my story, and to let people know, including decision-makers, that behind every decision, there are consequences, Villada told CBS News. Behind everything, there are families that are affected by these decisions, by these laws.\n\nVillada, who is attending as the guest of Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California, said his presence and that of undocumented immigrants on the House floor to hear President Trump deliver his address will hopefully send a positive message to the American public, lawmakers and the president about the immigrant community. He said immigrants have been demonized with hateful rhetoric and targeted through hardline immigration policies by the Trump administration.\n\nRight now, they are painting the immigrant community as something that we are not, he added.\n\nFormer Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient Marco Villeda, right, was invited to attend the State of the Union address by Congressman Lou Correa, D-California. Camilo Montoya-Galvez\n\nVillada, a former DACA recipient from California, legalized his status after marrying his husband Israel Serrato in 2014, six months after the Supreme Court struck down the controversial Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) — which defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriage licenses from states where they were legal.\n\nBut the process of adjusting his status has not been smooth-sailing. After marrying Serrato and filing paperwork to obtain permanent U.S. residency through his spouse, Villada said he was instructed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to travel to Mexico for a consular interview. He traveled to his country-of-birth in January 2018, but shortly after, a consular official denied his visa application to reenter the U.S. Villada said USCIS has approved a provisional waiver which should have allowed him to return to his home in California.\n\nVillada remained in Mexico for approximately six months while the National Immigration Law Center and other groups filed a lawsuit to compel the government to allow him to reenter the U.S. and spearheaded a campaign of activism to raise awareness about his case. It was difficult for not only us, but for our loved ones. There are a lot of people who depend on me, Villada said, noting that he could not take care of his autistic brother while in Mexico.\n\nIt flipped our lives upside down, Serrato added. My spouse was stuck in a country, a foreign country, that he didn't grew up in.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, before a judge ruled on the lawsuit, consular officials reversed their decision and allowed Villada to reenter the U.S. He has since obtained his green card.\n\nAlthough he considers himself lucky for having the opportunity to legalize his status, Villada urged current DACA recipients not to give up hope on one day doing the same, saying ongoing negotiations between lawmakers can prove fruitful.\n\nDACA was instituted by President Barack Obama through executive order in 2012. The program allows young undocumented immigrants, dubbed Dreamers, to obtain work authorizations and driver's licenses if they meet certain requirements, including having arrived in the U.S before they were 16 and obtaining an American high school diploma, a GED or serving honorably in the military.\n\nAfter several conservatives states threatened to sue the Trump administration if it kept DACA alive, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a gradual winding down of the program in the fall of 2017. But the Second, Ninth and D.C. Circuits blocked the government from completely dismantling DACA and a prolonged court battle has kept the initiative alive. USCIS currently allows more than 700,000 DACA recipients to renew their protections — valid for two years — but it is not accepting new applications.\n\nAlthough some lawmakers from both parties have floated the idea of putting DACA recipients on pathway to citizenship in exchange for border spending to avert another government shutdown in the coming weeks, the president has signaled he wants to wait until the Supreme Court rules on the lawsuit against the program before including DACA protections in negotiations with Congress.\n\nVillada said young undocumented immigrants should not be used as bargaining chips to allow the White House to finance the construction of wall on the southwestern border or increase immigration enforcement against non-violent undocumented immigrants.\n\nThey deserve DACA. It shouldn't come at the expense of building a wall or having to separate families, he said.
There is no federal law in the United States that mandates or regulates sex education. Instead, it is a local issue, and each state can decide on its own whether sex ed merits teaching in the classroom.\n\nAs a result, only 24 states and Washington, D.C. require by law that sex ed be taught in public schools. What's even more shocking is that only 13 of those states require the information taught to be medically accurate. That means the majority of American schools can teach kids whatever they want — whether it be based on science, effectiveness, faith, shame, or nothing at all.\n\nIn the current environment, far too few opt for comprehensive sex ed, which includes coverage of sexual decision-making, consent and the proper use of contraceptives. Abstinence-only sex ed is taught in 37 of the 50 U.S. states, and far too often, it utilizes a slew of shame-based and misogynistic metaphors to scare kids away from premarital sex by comparing those that have it to ruined objects that have lost their worth.\n\nThe tape\n\nOne of the shame-based metaphors most prominent in abstinence-only sex ed throughout the country is that of tape that has lost its stickiness. In this popular demonstration, exemplified in the YouTube clip below, a volunteer — almost always a teenage boy — is asked to come to the front of the class and have sex with his girlfriend. For the purposes of the demonstration, that simply means an instructor sticks a piece of tape to his arm. The tape, which is meant to represent his high school girlfriend, bonds to the boy's arm immediately. This is meant to represent how sex immediately bonds two people together.\n\nHowever, in keeping with the national statistics on high school sweethearts, the teen volunteer and his girlfriend ultimately break up. This means he is asked to rip the piece of tape off of his arm. When he does, the instructor holds the piece of tape up for the rest of the students to see. Once transparent, adhesive and new, the piece of tape is now covered in hair, skin, lotion, cologne and anything else the volunteer had on his arm.\n\nThe instructor then calls up additional male volunteers to date the teenage girl. However, when those boys attempt to stick the piece of tape to their arms, parts of it fall off as it has been sullied and lost its ability to stick.\n\nThis is what happens when we have multiple partners before we get married, Shelly Donahue, who has created a national abstinence curriculum that has been taught in 48 states and 7 foreign countries, explains in the YouTube clip below. We give up our ability to bond.\n\nThe spit cup\n\nIn another popular shame-based metaphor taught throughout the country, an instructor holds up a glass of clear water for a room of students. She then passes the cup down the rows of desks, asking students — again, mostly male students — to take a sip, swish it around in their mouths, then spit the water back into the cup. When the cup finally reaches the front of the room again, it is no longer clear, but rather a murky mess of cloudy liquid and food particles.\n\nIn many of these demonstrations, the instructor then pulls a new, unsullied glass of water out from behind her desk and holds it up next to the spit cup. Which one of these girls would you want? she asks. The pure one or the one who has had multiple partners before marriage?\n\nThe rose\n\nYet another lesson popular in abstinence-based curricula is that of the rose. In this demonstration, an instructor will show a beautiful red rose to a classroom full of students. He will smell it, feel the smooth texture of its pedals between his fingers. Then, the instructor will tell the students to pass the rose around and do the same.\n\nAfter the rose has made its rounds through the many desks of teenagers — or occasionally the pews of a church — the instructor will ask for it back. Now, the rose is much worse for the wear. Its stem is often broken, its pedals disheveled and falling off. And the demonstration culminates with the instructor, much like the minister detailed in the YouTube clip below, asking the students, Who would want this?\n\nThe chewed up piece of gum\n\nIn this example, an instructor will tell children they are all like pieces of gum and that having sex is like being chewed. If you then have sex with multiple partners, you became a piece of gum devoid of flavor and without worth. And who would want an old piece of gum?\n\nIn 2014, during a poignant and emotional speech at Johns Hopkins University, Elizabeth Smart revealed she had received this abstinence-only sex education lesson prior to her being kidnapped from her room as a child. While in captivity, she was then repeatedly raped by her captor. And that lesson – that teacher who told her that she would be a worthless, old piece of gum if she engaged in premarital sex – not only stayed with her, but it also made her wonder whether there was any point in trying to escape.\n\nFor me, I thought, 'Oh my gosh. I'm that chewed up piece of gum,' Smart told the audience of gathered listeners. Nobody re-chews a piece of gum. You throw it away. And that's how easy it is to feel like you no longer have worth, you no longer have value. Why would it even be worth screaming out? Why would it even make a difference if you are rescued, if your life still has no value?\n\nIn all of these shame-based examples, people who engage in premarital sex are presented as tarnished objects. There is no mention of consent, and no reference to how LGBTQ couples can engage in healthy sexual relationships. And all too often, these heteronormative demonstrations make it clear that the tarnished object in question is meant to represent the woman involved in the act. Consequently, students may leave with the impression that women who have sex with multiple partners are damaged goods, while men do not share the same set of consequences.\n\nAmericans today know all too well that that is not the case. And as the country grapples with both the #MeToo movement and the epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses, it might be prudent to take a closer look at the lessons we're teaching American children about sex. Otherwise, we are sewing the seeds of sexual violence – and acting surprised when those seeds bloom.
Last week, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. Today, the first official weddings are underway, marking a historic day for the country.\n\nAfter years of debate, Taiwan's legislature passed a law last week allowing same-sex marriage. The vote allows same-sex couples full legal marriage rights, including in areas such as taxes, insurance and child custody.\n\nThe new laws went into effect Friday, and hundreds of couples eagerly seized their first opportunity to finally tie the knot. According to the Associated Press, Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior said 500 same-sex couples registered their marriages across the island on Friday.\n\nClad in matching pink suits, Shane Lin and Marc Yuan were one of the first couples to marry in Taipei Friday. Their wedding was officiated by gay rights activist Chi Chia-Wei. I feel very lucky that I can say this out loud to everyone: I am gay and I am getting married, Lin told Reuters. I am extremely proud of my country Taiwan,\n\nThis is the right that we deserved from a long time ago, Chia-Wei told Reuters. As a beacon in Asia, I hope Taiwan's democracy and human rights could have a ripple effect on other countries in Asia.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Lin and Yuan have been together for 12 years and were the first to register at the Household Registration Office in Taipei. The couple — along with dozens of others — walked down a rainbow aisle at a party to celebrate the historic day, surrounded by friends, family, diplomats and reporters.\n\nTaiwans gay activist Chi Chia-Wei signs a wedding certificate for Shane Lin and Marc Yuan.

Surprise! Kathy Griffin just married longtime beau Randy Bick. The couple wed in a New Year's wedding ceremony at home – and actress Lily Tomlin helped them tie the knot.\n\nHappy New Year. And – surprise – we're getting married, the couple said in unison in a video posted on Twitter on December 31. Griffin told fans they'd be getting married after midnight and it would be very atypical, very fun.\n\nYou're going to die when you see the officiant, the comedian said in the video. Shortly after that video was posted, Griffin shared video of the nuptials.\n\nWe are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage of Randy Bick and Kathy Griffin, Tomlin said. What was supposed to be a shallow, tooted and booted, one-night-stand, has grown and flourished to something far more meaningful. They stayed together, then they couldn't stay away from one another.\n\nThe entire ceremony was just under 14 minutes but I have to give you guys the uncut first 75 seconds. LOVE IT! We promised you atypical. We are in love and we cannot stop laughing. Thank you @LilyTomlin and Jane Wagner!#HappyNewYear pic.twitter.com/O5vOss3TCD — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) January 1, 2020\n\nGriffin only posted a short clip of the wedding but said the whole thing lasted about 14 minutes. She also shared a photo of herself and Bick on their first date, in 2011.\n\nWe are in the back of a limo provided by the one only @GloriaEstefan because her team arranged for me to surprise her as a back up 'dancer' when she performed at the Alma awards! Griffin shared.\n\nShe also let fans in on a detail about her wedding dress, which is seen in that photo.\n\nI asked Randy to pick out which ever one of my long dresses was his favorite for any reason. He picked out this dress and showed me this photo. Romance is hotttt again, she tweeted.\n\nA) This was our first formal date in September 2011! We are in the back of a limo provided by the one only @GloriaEstefan because her team arranged for me to surprise her as a back up dancer when she performed at the Alma awards! pic.twitter.com/Z9kNaQHFpY — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) January 1, 2020\n\nGriffin starred in the show, Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List until 2010. In 2017, her career took a hit after she shared a controversial photo of herself holding a mask of President Donald Trump dripping with what appeared to be fake blood. This year, she made a comeback with a new documentary, Kathy Griffin: A Hell of a Story.\n\nGriffin and Tomlin seem to have been friends for a while. In 2016 Tomlin and her wife, Jane Wagner, promoted Griffin's book on their Facebook page. And in 2009, an episode of Griffin's reality show was titled I Heart Lily Tomlin.
With six states holding contests on March 10, Michigan is the biggest delegate prize at stake in this next batch of primaries. Because of a 2018 ballot measure, Michigan now allows for absentee ballots without needing a reason, reports CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. It has led to a spike in absentee ballot requests and returns. As of 8:00 p.m. ET on Thursday night, 599,644 absentee ballots had been returned of the 924,340 that were requested. Five days before the 2016 primary, when no-reason absentee voting was not allowed, 357,733 absentee ballots were returned of the 484,173 that were requested. Michigan law also allows people to spoil their ballot if the candidate they voted for dropped out or for any other reason. A voter can have a new ballot mailed to them or vote in person on Tuesday for a different candidate. As of 2:00 p.m. ET on Friday, the Secretary of State's office says there were 24,109 requests to spoil ballots, which would allow a voter who sent in an absentee ballot to recast his or her ballot. If a voter is spoiling their ballot by mail, the request must be received by 2:00 p.m. ET on Saturday. It can also be done in person at a clerk's office by 4:00 p.m. ET on Monday.\n\nON THE DEBATE STAGE\n\nAnd then there were two. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee announced its qualifications for the next Democratic presidential debate in Arizona on March 15, and it appears Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will be the only candidates qualified to participate, reports CBS News political associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the new rules, candidates must have been allocated at least 20% of the total number of pledged delegates across all of the contests that will have taken place by 9 a.m. ET on the day of the debate. Those totals will be calculated by adding together all the delegates allocated by the Associated Press or CNN. While Tulsi Gabbard does have two delegates by CBS News' count so far, it does not appear likely that she will have received 20% of all delegates by the time of the debate, leaving Biden and Sanders the final two candidates to go face-to-face. The next debate takes place in Arizona two days before the state's Democratic primary, March 17.\n\nCANDIDATE COVERAGE\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nSanders continued to stress that Biden's record does not hold up to the scrutiny, reports CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. He specifically cited Biden's past votes on NAFTA, the Defense of Marriage Act, the Hyde Amendment and Medicaid.\n\nNow Trump lies all of the time. So despite what he is doing in his budget, he is claiming that he supports Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, which of course he does not, Sanders said at an airport gaggle. But he is already attacking Joe Biden, for the fact that Biden has been on the floor of the Senate in years past, calling for cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and veterans programs as a part of a Bowles Simpson approach and balanced budget efforts. And these are issues that Trump will certainly be emphasizing in the campaign.\n\nCBS News political broadcast associate Aaron Navarro adds that the line of attack comes after a strong showing from Biden on Super Tuesday, essentially leaving it to a two-man race between Sanders and Biden. When asked about if he can expand his electorate, Sanders said he has a unique campaign and that the healthcare industry was very excited because Joe did well on Super Tuesday.\n\nI have my doubts as to how significantly we can rally the base, rally the American people when Joe is a candidate who has received funding from over 60 billionaires, has a super PAC, is now, I guess receiving support from Mike Bloomberg, Sanders said. Do they really think that that is the kind of reality that's going to energize the American people?\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nThe Trump campaign filed a libel lawsuit against CNN on Friday, claiming that they published false and defamatory statements, reports CBS News political broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The lawsuit targets a June 2019 opinion piece about the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, specifically the phrase in that piece that claimed the campaign assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table.\n\nThe statements were and are 100 percent false and defamatory, Jenna Ellis, senior legal adviser to Trump, said in a statement. The campaign was motivated by the fact that the publications recklessly published false statements which caused harm and intentionally mislead their readers.\n\nThe campaign said they sent a written demand to CNN on February 25 to retract and apologize for the article, to which the complaint says CNN refused. CNN joins The New York Times and the Washington Post in being sued over opinion articles about Russia.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nBiden picked up endorsements from three more House Democrats in competitive districts, California's Harley Rouda and Michigan's Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin. This brings Biden's total count of these Frontline endorsements to 13, reports CBS News political broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Both Rouda and Stevens previously endorsed Mike Bloomberg, who spent millions in helping House Democrats get elected in 2018. Remaining holdovers from Bloomberg's list who haven't officially announced their next endorsement are Lucy McBath of Georgia, Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Max Rose of New York and Ben McAdams of Utah. In her statement, Slotkin took similar slights that moderates have done against Sanders' policies. I hear from my constituents every day that they want an end to the all-or-nothing politics that have so polarized our country. All-or-nothing doesn't get us lower drug costs or more affordable healthcare, she said. In Michigan, we have a rich tradition of hard work, decency, and passionate pragmatism. Sanders, who has endorsements from eight House members in safely Democratic districts, will be hold a rally on Saturday in Dearborn, Michigan, just south of Slotkin's district. In Minnesota, longtime Democratic Congressman Collin Peterson is expected to announce his run for reelection, as first reported by Politico. Peterson, one of two Democrats in Congress to vote against both articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, has been in Congress since 1990. The district has become more conservative and although Peterson's last two elections were within 5 points, Mr. Trump won it by over 30 points in 2016.
Molly Ringwald became a teenage Hollywood icon in the 1980s, starring in John Hughes' classic movies including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and Sixteen Candles. But in All These Small Moments, her new movie out in theaters Thursday, Ringwald plays quite a different role — a mother in an unhappy marriage.\n\nTo me, she was really exciting to play because she was real. I've played a lot of moms. I am a mom. I know what that's like, and this is a mom who's in crisis, Ringwald said. Her marriage is falling apart, she loves her kids, but you know, frankly, it's hard to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nI think we've all been there at different moments in our life, she added.\n\nAll the characters are flawed, but there is no villain, Ringwald said.\n\nThere are people who, you know, they treat each other badly. The husband's betraying the wife. This person is betraying that person. But that's just real life. It's so, to me, it's so perfectly named, she said.\n\nThese vulnerable moments could be meaningful to wider audience like teens.\n\nThere're so many teenagers who have parents that are at war or divorced. And you know, I think that it's really wonderful to have that shock of recognition and see other families that are going through the same things, Ringwald said.\n\nLast April, the actress wrote a New Yorker article reflecting on The Breakfast Club and her other films in the context of today's #MeToo movement. If attitudes toward female subjugation are systemic, and I believe that they are, it stands to reason that the art we consume and sanction plays some part in reinforcing those same attitudes, Ringwald wrote.\n\nShe said certain scenes really bothered her, not only with the John Bender character peeking under his skirt, but also how he rails against her character when he is rejected.\n\nThat's a little problematic. Because at the end, you're really happy to see us together. And there's no mention, really, about that behavior, Ringwald said, adding that by no means is she denouncing the films.\n\nI just feel like it's a conversation. I feel like times have changed. And I want people to still look at them and still realize the way things were at a time and kind of have a conversation about it and move on, she said.\n\nAll These Small Moments opens in theaters Thursday, Jan. 17. It will also be available on demand and digital on Friday.
MORRO BAY, Calif. -- A man who had to be rescued when he climbed a California cliff to propose to his girlfriend via cellphone video later was acting erratically and was found to be high on methamphetamine, authorities said Friday.\n\nMorro Bay Fire Chief Steve Knuckles said that 27-year-old Michael Banks was arrested on suspicion of possessing methamphetamine.\n\nKnuckles said Banks climbed to the top of the cliff early Thursday to propose. Banks got stuck on the way down. No one has spoken to the girlfriend.\n\nKnuckles said Friday that he didn't know if the proposal was real only that Banks told several people during the rescue that he had asked for her hand in marriage. Police were not immediately available for comment.\n\nBanks took a different trail down, much steeper and became stranded, said Capt. Todd Gailey. He couldn't go any direction, on a sheer ledge, with his feet dangling 80 feet off the ground.\n\nRescuers called in a helicopter, and a crew member descended by cable to hoist Banks from the narrow ledge.\n\nBanks was calm for most of the ordeal, but a little unnerved at that part, Gailey said. He was not hurt.\n\nAbout 4 p.m. Thursday Banks was arrested when witnesses reported he was acting erratically. CBS affiliate KCOY reported Banks was also cited for misdemeanor trespassing.\n\nMorro Rock is a 600-foot landmark just offshore from the community of Morro Bay. Climbing is banned, but some go anyway, and there have been several fatal falls over the years. Banks will be charged for the chopper ride.\n\nBanks said nothing during the rescue about any second thoughts on his choice of setting for the proposal, Gailey said.\n\nHowever, the fire captain said others should consider a place where you're not in danger of falling off a cliff.\n\nBanks has been booked into jail and isn't available for comment.
Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant has in the past lamented the lack of a Fortune 500 company in his state, saying its low corporate tax rate and union membership should make it an attractive market for a major company to locate its headquarters.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bryant found the Magnolia State to be the latest facing a corporate backlash after he signed a measure making it legal to deny goods and services to gay people. Mississippi now joins North Carolina in drawing an outcry after adopting an anti-gay measure, while Nathan Deal, Georgia's two-term governor, recently vetoed a bill offering barriers to same-sex marriage after dozens of corporate heavy-hitters urged him to do so.\n\nBryant had been urged to veto the measure by the 2,100-member Mississippi Manufacturers Association, or MMA. We have seen the negative attention that Georgia and North Carolina have received on this issue and have now seen the attention shift towards Mississippi, the trade group said Monday in a statement. It called on Bryant to reject the bill before it causes any more harm to Mississippi's image.\n\nSaying it feared future economic development opportunities will be jeopardized if HB 1523 is signed into law, it listed some of Mississippi's largest employers such as Nissan (NSANY), Toyota (TM), and Ingalls Shipbuilding (HII) as opposing the law.\n\nIn the wake of Bryant's signing the bill into law, the association said its position continues to reflect the concerns manufacturers have with this bill and its potential to conflict with their policies of diversity and inclusion. However, the MMA respects the wishes of the legislature and governor.\n\nMGM Resorts (MGM), which employs about 4,400 people at two resorts in the state -- Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike Casino Resort in Tunica -- said it was disappointed that the legislation had become law and warned that it would hurt tourism and the state's economy.\n\nWe respect the diversity of our employees, our guests and the people in our communities, an MGM Resorts spokeswoman said in an email. Laws that permit businesses to decline to provide services to individuals because of this diversity will result in discrimination, decreased tourism and harm to the state's economy.\n\nNissan, which employs about 6,500 people at an assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi, said the law runs counter to its principles. It is Nissan's policy to prohibit discrimination of any type, and we oppose any legislation that would allow discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, the automaker said in an emailed statement.\n\nAnother large employer in Mississippi, Huntington Ingalls Industries, also objected, saying it's committed to creating an inclusive environment where diversity is not only respected, but is considered to be of value. Therefore we do not support any efforts, including legislation, that does not support that.\n\nHuntington employs about 11,500 workers at a shipbuilding facility in Pascagoula, Mississippi.\n\nAT&T supports our freedom of speech and religion just as vigorously as we oppose discrimination, an AT&T (T) spokesman said in an email. Legislation that permits discrimination against any of our employees or customers conflicts with our core values. Our position on discrimination is simple; we oppose it.\n\nToyota, which employs roughly 2,000 at a manufacturing plant in Blue Springs, Mississippi, also voiced its displeasure, saying in a statement: Toyota does not condone discrimination in any form and believes that inclusive treatment of all people is good for the workplace, marketplace and society as a whole.
Nike (NKE) faces a growing firestorm over anti-gay comments made by boxing legend Manny Pacquiao.\n\nPacquiao denounced gay relationships in a TV interview in the Philippines, according to TMZ.com. They know how to distinguish male from female. If we approve [of] male on male, female on female, then man is worse than animals.\n\nThe remarks quickly drew protests on social media. I lost all respect for you, wrote Jason Collins, the first openly gay NBA player, wrote on Twitter. Bigoted people like you (& yes you are one) should never hold an office in politics.\n\nPacquiao, 37, is running for a seat in the Philippines senate.\n\nIn another sign of the potential backlash for Nike, a petition on Change.org urged people to boycott the company until it drops Pacquiao as a client.\n\nI'm sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals. Please forgive me for those I've hurt. God Bless! pic.twitter.com/bqjRcWqp8R — Manny Pacquiao (@mannypacquiao) February 16, 2016\n\nPacquiao on Tuesday expressed regret for the slur, saying in a statement posted on his Twitter feed that I'm sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals. Please forgive me for those I've hurt.\n\nOn his Facebook page, Pacquiao also said he remains against same-sex marriage, while insisting that he is not condemning lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. God Bless you all and I'm praying for you, he wrote. Pacquiao, who has previously come out against same-sex marriage, also cited several Biblical passages against homosexuality.\n\nTMZ reports that Nike is planning to end its commercial ties with Pacquiao, although no official decision has been made. Nike sells t-shirts, shorts, shoes and other gear emblazoned with the fighter's brand, Team Pacquiao.\n\nA spokesman for Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company is expected to issue a statement later today.
Meghan Markle: American Princess, a CBS News special anchored by CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King, explores the life of Markle, the future wife of Prince Harry. The two married on May 19, 2018.\n\nMeghan Markle: American Princess is an engaging, inspiring look at the extraordinary woman who first stood out as a grade school student because of her passionate efforts to right wrongs. She went on to become a successful actress and then one-half of a global power couple for a new era. Her story is told through intimate, revealing interviews with the people who know her best -- sorority sisters, high school teachers, fellow actors from the TV series Suits, and more.\n\nCBS This Morning co-host Gayle King explores the life of American Meghan Markle ahead of her Markle's marriage to Britain's Prince Harry CBS News\n\nCBS News royal contributor Tina Brown and royal experts weigh in on the couple, their upcoming marriage, and what their fairy-tale relationship means for the British monarchy and the world.\n\nThese two are going to be the premier global philanthropists in the world, says Brown.\n\nThey're just a young couple in love, says photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who was commissioned by the royal family to . It's the most beautiful thing to see. And I'm a cheeseball so I love that kind of stuff.\n\nIn his only U.S. television network interview, Lubomirski tells King he and the couple shared their passions for humanitarian work and Botswana, where he grew up.\n\nActor Wendell Pierce, who played Markle's father on Suits, reveals what he told Markle when he heard the news she was engaged.\n\nI said, 'I just want you to know. I know all the stuff that's gonna happen to you. And it's gonna be crazy. Just in a quiet moment, just know, I'll always be your friend. There's someone thinking about your best interests. And we care about you,' Pierce says.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have captured the attention of the world in recent months, but friends and others, including corporate giant Procter & Gamble, knew of Markle long before. For example, when she was just 12, Markle took issue with a P&G commercial for dishwashing liquid that struck her as sexist, and she wrote the company. She also wrote to Linda Ellerbee, then the executive producer and anchor of Nick News, on Nickelodeon. Ellerbee profiled young Markle. The company changed its marketing.\n\nI knew after that story that this little girl wasn't going to change, Ellerbee says. That she was going to change her world.\n\nChristine Knudsen, a teacher at Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles, saw that same determination in young Markle.\n\nShe didn't see things as roadblocks – and I think she loved to rise to challenges, Knudsen says. And, OK, this door is closed. Let's find a window.\n\nI just always remember saying that she, like, looked like a princess, I don't know how else to describe it, says Northwestern University sorority sister Erica Bethe Levin. She just radiates like, this, ridiculous aura.\n\nMeghan Markle: American Princess looks insode couple's courtship and through preparations for the wedding on May 19, 2018, including a look at the famed St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, where the couple will be married. The special also explores how Markle, who is biracial and divorced, helps advance the monarchy in today's world.\n\nEverything that could have gotten you beheaded 500 years ago, that's why this engagement, this marriage, has already brought the monarchy well into the 21st century, says Vanity Fair writer Sam Kashner, who wrote the first major profile of Markle for the cover of the magazine.\n\nCBS News will have full coverage of the royal wedding on May 19, starting at 4 a.m. ET, anchored by Gayle King and Entertainment Tonight's Kevin Frazier. CBS News will also present Royal Romance: The Marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, a two-hour special to air May 19 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.
With theatres around the world closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, international film festivals have joined together virtually, with We Are One: A Global Film Festival, kicking off May 29 on YouTube.\n\nThe 10-day festival will screen more than 100 films — for free — including world and North American premieres. The lineup ranges from narrative features, documentaries and short films, to recorded panel discussions with leading filmmakers, and virtual reality presentations.\n\nFilms will be streamed at youtube.com/WeAreOne.\n\nThe festival was conceived last month when the Tribeca Film Festival (which was to have kicked off in April) and other festivals around the world started cancelling their plans. Tribeca co-founder and CEO Jane Rosenthal said Thursday, To put on a film festival and do this and collaborate with our colleagues globally, that wasn't a challenge. It was an opportunity for us to do something that is bringing us all together, and also raise funds for these organizations that are helping the world fight this virus.\n\nMouhcine Malzi and Nadia Kounda in Volubilis. Marrakech International Film Festival\n\nThe slate of offerings has been co-curated by 21 leading international festivals, including Berlin, Cannes, London, Mumbai, New York, Sundance, Tokyo, Toronto, Tribeca and Venice.\n\nThough films will be available to stream for free, donations are requested for COVID-19 relief efforts, to support a collection of organizations, including Save the Children, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders, World Health Organization, and others.\n\nTribeca co-founder Robert De Niro said Thursday that when the idea was first broached, There was a little bit of inertia, because of, who really knew where we were [with the pandemic] and where we'd be and how serious the whole outcome would eventually be? But once people started seeing what was going to happen, this was a great thing to do.\n\nThe films being featured characterize the flavor of each contributing festival. One of the Indian features presented by the Mumbai Film Festival, Arun Karthick's Nasir, was originally supposed to have its North American premiere at the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York this spring, until that festival was canceled.\n\nThe action film Crazy World was featured at the Toronto International Film Festival's Midnight Madness section last year. Its filmmakers will do live social media as they present the film in We Are One.\n\nA scene from the Ugandan action flick Crazy World. Toronto International Film Festival\n\nCameron Bailey, Toronto's artistic director, spoke of the energy and humor of Crazy World, an example of Uganda's Wakaliwood genre films: These remarkable young people who are making films with whatever they have at hand, they're influenced by Hollywood action movies, by Bollywood, by Asian action movies, and they make their own versions for essentially sometimes hundreds of dollars!\n\nFestival directors — who might ordinarily compete with one another for premieres and events on the festival circuit — were hopeful that We Are One would represent a complementary venue for filmmakers and film lovers alongside traditional, real world festival screenings. Smriti Kiran, artistic director of the Mumbai Film Festival, said, This is something we should explore going forward as an annual event.\n\nIn terms of what the future of film festivals may be, Rosenthal said, We've found this in-between stage for us to gather together and be able to help inspire and instigate imaginations. Hopefully film festivals will go on again — what date, who knows? But doing something in a virtual world and the real world, one doesn't preclude the other. They can happen in unison.\n\nWho know where it will go in the future with things like this? said De Niro. I don't know if it's the new normal, but it possibly could be. I can't wait to see how it turns out.\n\nFeature film lineup\n\nComedy\n\nLate Marriage (France/Israel: 2001) — A handsome Ph.D. student is marketed by his family as an eligible bachelor, while he hides his affair with a Moroccan divorcée (May 30).\n\n(France/Israel: 2001) — A handsome Ph.D. student is marketed by his family as an eligible bachelor, while he hides his affair with a Moroccan divorcée (May 30).

Elton John criticized the Vatican after it decreed Monday that the Catholic Church cannot bless same-sex unions since God cannot bless sin.\n\nThe music legend ripped the Church on Instagram, resurfacing reports that the Vatican invested more than a million euros on the Oscar-winning film Rocketman — a biopic based on John, who is openly gay and married to producer David Furnish. He posted side-by-side photos of both news reports, calling it hypocrisy in a hashtag.\n\nHow can the Vatican refuse to bless gay marriages because they are sin, yet happily make a profit from investing millions in Rocketman — a film which celebrates my finding happiness from my marriage to David?? he wrote.\n\nThe Vatican's orthodoxy office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a formal response Monday to a question about whether Catholic clergy can bless same-sex unions. The answer, contained in a two-page explanation published in seven languages and approved by Pope Francis, was negative.\n\nCatholic teaching holds that marriage, a lifelong union between a man and woman, is part of God's plan and is intended for the sake of creating new life. Since same-sex unions are not intended to be part of that plan, they cannot be blessed by the Church, the document said.\n\nThe news did not sit well with the British pop star, who cited claims first reported by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in 2019 that some of the Vatican's investment money — more than 4 million euros — went into the production of Rocketman and Men in Black: International through the Centurion Global Fund, in which The Holy See is a main investor. According to Box Office Mojo, the films grossed more than $195 million worldwide and $253 million, respectively. Much of the money the Vatican reportedly poured into the investment fund came from donations from Catholic faithful.\n\nCBS News reached out to the Vatican for further information on the ties, but they did immediately respond.\n\nThe Vatican is currently embroiled in a financial scandal linked to the fund. The Peter's Pence funds — usually offered during an annual collection at Mass — have come under scrutiny amid an investigation by Vatican prosecutors into the Secretariat of State's 350 million euro investment in a London real estate venture, some of which was apparently funded by the Peter's Pence. Several Italian brokers and dealers, as well as some Vatican officials, are under investigation on suspicion they fleeced the Holy See of millions in fees.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. Disclaimer: Rocketman was produced by Paramount Pictures, a division of ViacomCBS.
It's official: After teasing her marriage at the Grammys, when she thanked her husband during her acceptance speech, Adele has announced that she and her longtime partner Simon Konecki are indeed married.\n\nAs she was at the Grammys, Adele was casual about revealing her news. She mentioned it during her concert in Brisbane, Australia, on Saturday. She was discussing her song, Someone Like You, which describes her feelings following a breakup. She told the crowd that she's addicted to the feeling when you first fall for someone. Adele says she can't have that feeling because she's married now.\n\nAdele and Konecki have a 4-year-old son, Angelo.\n\nAdele picked up five awards at the Grammys, and said during her acceptance speech for Album of the Year, My husband and my son -- you're the only reason I do it.\n\nBritish tabloids reported rumors that the two married over Christmas, but Adele never mentioned the marriage until Grammys night.
NEW YORK - Callan Olive is about as adult as you can get for a 26-year-old.\n\nShe and her husband, Isaac, who is also 26, own a house near Chicago where they live with their 4-year-old, 2-year-old and newborn. She has her own private therapy practice; he works for a major retailer. They pay their own cellphone bills and car insurance.\n\nWe are solidly in the grown-up phase - in a lot of ways, we feel out of the norm, Callan Olive said recently.\n\nThere are 4.75 million more 26-year-olds like the Olives out there right now, which makes young adults born in 1990 the largest single age group in the United States today, according to Census Bureau data. They are now mostly out of school. Some are married with children, but the bulk are still single.\n\nHere is a sampling of how 26-year-olds are tackling their biggest financial priorities:\n\nA MONTHLY DRAG\n\nU.S. student debt, which exceeds $1 trillion, is holding back some members of the United States' biggest age group. A case in point: Joseph Lawson, who is living one version of the millennial dream by working for a major tech company in Seattle. However, Lawson owes more than $50,000 in student loans, which eats up $536 of his monthly pay.\n\nRent keeps skyrocketing, and he had to move to control costs. Lawson now lives with his girlfriend, but marriage and a house are still just dreams at this point, as is grad school and someday putting his interest in Russian history to use.\n\nWe're adults now -- you have to do what you have to do, Lawson said.\n\nTHE FUTURE LOOMS\n\nVictoria Schuyler, a 26-year-old who just started a job for a real estate website in New York, graduated without debt, thanks to help from her parents.\n\nBut that does not make the struggle to make it in the big city any easier. Her first sticker shock: paying a 15 percent broker's fee to land an apartment.\n\nWhat confounds Schuyler the most about her finances is how best to save for the future when she has so many needs right now. Like most people her age, she received no formal financial education in high school or college. When Schuyler has questions about finances, she asks her parents or her boyfriend, who just passed his exam to become a certified financial planner.\n\nI add a little bit every month to savings, but mostly it's paycheck to paycheck, said Schuyler.\n\nThis is a dynamic that financial planner Shannon Pike, president of the Financial Planning Association, sees often among his clients, who often get paralyzed when trying to put their funds into too many different buckets at the same time.\n\nYou have to take each dollar and divide it into chunks, Pike advised.\n\nPARENTAL INFLUENCE\n\nStaying on family plans for phones seems nearly ubiquitous among single millennials.\n\nI'm financially independent except for that ever-existing cellphone plan, said Nick Hogan, who works in public relations in Chicago and is just about to turn 27.\n\nIt's one of those things, a lot of parents might forget about. It's also a really easy way to help out a little bit, said Rachel Rabinovich, head of the financial planning team for Society of Grownups, an online financial education resource. Her own 24-year-old is still on her family plan.\n\nEven young adults as independent as Callan and Isaac Olive say they piggyback on their parents' Netflix accounts. Many also stay on family car insurance plans.\n\nCurrent healthcare law allows children to stay on their parents' medical insurance until they turn 26. But sometimes there are hitches.\n\nLise Deal, 26-year-old from Davenport, Iowa, remained on her father's insurance even after she got married, and then realized the plan did not cover her pregnancy as a dependent.\n\nDeal has since switched to her husband's plan at work, and is working on how to balance their needs and wants - with saving for a house, retirement, and college for their son at the top of the list. What she wishes for her toddler son to eventually learn about money is this: Money is what helps you get your priorities.\n\nFinancially, we're chipmunking away, Deal says. But even at our poorest, we get fun money each month. If all the dollars go to grown-up things, you will go crazy and not stick to your budget.\n\n(Editing by Lauren Young and Jonathan Oatis)
Chicago — The United Methodist Church worldwide conference made a decision Tuesday that pleased traditionalists, but raised doubts about the church's modern motto: open hearts, open minds, open doors.\n\nOn Tuesday, after three days of debate, church officials and lay members voted to place a ban on gay and lesbian clerics and the officiating of same-sex marriages.\n\nTraditionalists said loosening the faith's ban on same-sex marriage and ordination of gay and lesbian clergy defied the word of God. Reverend Keith Boyette, the Wesleyan Covenant Association first president, said LGBT members are welcome into the church — up to a point.\n\nI believe that those who engage in the practice of homosexuality are not living a life that pleases God, Boyette said.\n\nAmid an emotional debate among the United States' third-largest faith community, new standards were adopted to stiffen punishment for heretics: Clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings could be suspended without pay for a year, and defrocked if they do it again.\n\nProtestors chant during the United Methodist Church's special session of the general conference in St. Louis, Tuesday, Feb. 26, 2019. America's second-largest Protestant denomination faces a likely fracture as delegates at the crucial meeting move to strengthen bans on same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBT clergy. AP\n\nThe church leaders and members who support LGBT involvement wanted local congregations free to write their own rules on homosexuals. Reverend Thomas Berlin, who is the lead pastor of Floris United Methodist Church in Herndon, Virginia, said tradition for tradition's sake is self-destructive.\n\nYou will be putting a virus into the American church that will make it very sick, and it will be sick quickly, Berlin said. Many of us have members who will leave and have already notified us to tell us so.\n\nBut delegates were mindful of where the church is growing -- 30 percent of members are from Africa -- where many nations outlaw homosexuality itself.\n\nMatthew Pearson, an openly gay methodist minister from California who rejects the traditional plan, said it's possible a new church is being born.\n\nWe are prepared to live into our full calling as a church, Pearson said. What that looks like at this point, I don't know.
President Trump denied Thursday that he had used campaign funds to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, to keep quiet about an alleged affair in 2006. He tweeted that payments made to his personal attorney Michael Cohen were part of his monthly retainer and not from the campaign.\n\nThe president said that Cohen was reimbursed as part of a private contract between two parties, known as a nondisclosure agreement or NDA.\n\nMr. Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA. These agreements are..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2018\n\nHe said such NDAs are very common among celebrities and people of wealth. Mr. Trump then said that funds were used for damages against Ms. Clifford to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair already having signed a detailed letter admitting there was no affair.\n\n...very common among celebrities and people of wealth. In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford (Daniels). The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2018\n\n...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2018\n\nMoney from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll (sic) in this transaction, he said.\n\nMr. Trump's tweets come after his newest attorney Rudy Giuliani told Fox News' Hannity that the president had personally repaid Cohen for the $130,000 payment to Daniels. Giuliani also said that the money used wasn't from the campaign and that the payment is going to turn out to be perfectly legal.\n\nIn the past, Mr. Trump has ignored questions surrounding the adult film star, who is suing over a nondisclosure agreement that she signed but claims is invalid because Mr. Trump never signed it.\n\nThe president previously denied ever being aware of payments Cohen had made to Daniels, telling reporters last month, You'll have to ask Michael Cohen. Mr. Trump also said he had no idea where Cohen obtained the money for the payments. Cohen has maintained that the money came from his own personal funds.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also repeatedly denied that the president was ever aware of such payments being made. During a March 7 press briefing, when asked if Mr. Trump knew about the payments to Daniels at the time, Sanders replied: Not that I'm aware of.\n\nI've had conversations with the President about this. And, as I outlined earlier, that this case has already been won in arbitration and that there was no knowledge of any payments from the President, and he's denied all of these allegations, said Sanders at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Giuliani was back on Fox News Thursday morning, defending Cohen as helping the Trump family during the allegations of the affair and being a good man.\n\nIt wasn't for the campaign. It was to save their marriage! Not their marriage as much as their reputation, Giuliani told Fox and Friends.\n\nHe added, However, imagine if that came out on October 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton. Cohen didn't even ask. Cohen made it go away. He did his job.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders meanwhile dodged questions on the payment altogether both on Fox News and in a gaggle with White House reporters Thursday morning. When Sanders spoke with reporters this morning, she cited ongoing litigation to decline to answer questions no less than five times.\n\nLook, Mayor Giuliani is part of the president's legal team. He has got visibility and insight into this issue. He spoke at length both last night and this morning. I would refer you back to his comments, particularly given the fact this is on going litigation. This is something we at the White house can't comment on and I would refer you to his comments and president's tweets from earlier this morning, Sanders said on Fox News.\n\nWhite House staffers are still stunned by what Giuliani said about the president Wednesday night. They're now trying to clean up what one aide referred to as Giuliani's dumpster fire, CBS News' Jacqueline Alemany reports. Asked why he would be put on TV again today, the source said it was thought that Giuliani could help with the cleanup.\n\nWhile staffers were stunned by Giuliani's performance Wednesday night, they were not entirely surprised. It's certainly not the first time Giuliani In the midst of the fight over the president's travel ban, Giuliani said Mr. Trump had asked him to implement a Muslim ban, although at the same time, the rest of the White House was insisting that the travel ban was in fact not a ban on Muslims.
Esquire magazine dropped the cover story for its March issue on Tuesday, and many people expressed their frustration with the 17-year-old boy profiled in the article. The author of the cover story, Jennifer Percy, says the presentation for her feature story was misleading.\n\nThe Life of an American Boy at 17 follows Ryan Morgan and, according to the cover, what it's like to grow up white, middle class, and male in the era of social media, school shootings, toxic masculinity, #MeToo, and a divided country.\n\nIn an email to CBS News, Percy wrote the article shows how much work we still have to do to educate boys about inherited white male privilege. It also shows that the teenage years are an ideal time to make change.\n\nEsquire magazine's March cover story about a white male teenager has come under fire. The writer called the cover misleading. Esquire\n\nI did not approve the cover image or cover text and found the presentation misleading, Percy wrote.\n\nSeveral social media users were outraged that the magazine would release a story that highlights white males during Black History Month. Many people pointed out that Esquire's profile gives a voice to a subject that is often represented in America media, instead of an underrepresented individual.\n\nWhile the profile of Morgan is just part one in a series growing up in America today, many felt the magazine missed the mark in choosing the typical American boy. Others felt the magazine was sympathizing with white men and what they have to go through in today's political climate.\n\nMorgan, who grew up in the middle class town of West Bend, Wisconsin, has conservative parents, doesn't exactly know what the #MeToo movement is, and is still confused about what he can and can't do, the interview reveals. Some readers felt the profile was not thought-provoking and that its white male point of view was a questionable choice to promote during Black History Month.\n\nHappy Black History Month, everybody.

I would assume that most of their readers are alreeady connected to white middle-class teenage boys - and therefore already know what it is like being one of them. pic.twitter.com/JH0donQpFT — Eugene Scott (@Eugene_Scott) February 12, 2019\n\nIn an editor's note, Editor in Chief Jay Fielden said that 26 years after the magazine profiled the daily life of a 10-year-old American boy, they decided to follow that model but to enlarge it into a series on growing up now — white, black, LGBTQ, female — that will continue to appear in coming issues. The first installment, by Percy, looks at the divided country through the eyes of one kid, Fielden writes.\n\nHe's white, lives in the middle of the reddest county in Wisconsin, and, as you will see, he is an unusually mature, intelligent, and determined young man, Fielden's note on the story read. I'd like to thank Ryan here for the time he spent with Jen and photographer Justin Kaneps. He may be only seventeen — and as infallibly human as the rest of us — but I admire the courage he's shown in speaking with us so openly about his life, and for agreeing to be on our cover.\n\nNumbers-wise, this IS the average American boy. Obviously he doesn't represent EVERY American boy. Notice, it says 'An American Boy,' not 'THE American Boy.' Stop being hypocritically racist, and let EVERYONE tell their story. @zara915 — Daniel K. Driskill 🚀 (@danthedoozy) February 12, 2019\n\nI feel like @JenPercy and @esquire are taking a lot of heat for their story about the life of a 17 year-old white boy in a red state. But I read it, and I thought it was worth reading and worth writing and worth publishing.https://t.co/Zkk8Bcl4yG — David F Porteous (@dfpiii) February 12, 2019\n\nIn the profile, the teen admits he isn't well versed in women's rights, but says he identifies as a conservative-leaning moderate, and shared his opinion on several other social and political issues.\n\nHe supports the death penalty, and limits on foreign goods. He doesn't support welfare, unless those who receive it are made to get a job. He doesn't support needle exchanges, Percy writes for Esquire.\n\nOn issues of gender, Ryan is mixed. He doesn't think abortion should be legal. He doesn't support condom distribution in high schools to prevent pregnancy. If a man and a woman earning the same salary have a child, and if one of them must quit their job to raise it, Ryan thinks it should be the woman. But he supports marriage equality and the right to enlist in the military regardless of sexual orientation, Percy writes.\n\nSome people thought releasing the now-controversial cover was a strategy to get people talking about Esquire's continuing series, which will later profile other, more diverse people. Some defended Esquires choice in subject, saying Morgan is, in fact, the typical American boy.
NEW YORK — Jason Mraz always loved musical theater and even thought of it as a career option, but he was worried he would fail and end up a waiter. Now, the pop singer is making his Broadway debut in Waitress, but he won't be playing a waiter. The two-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter whose hits include I'm Yours and I Won't Give Up will take to the hit musical's stage starting Nov. 3.\n\nIt's classy, it's classic, it's whimsical, it's kitsch, it's funny, its scandalous — it's got a little bit for everyone, said Mraz. I love that I get out of my routine and try on a new routine that requires me to show up in a different way.\n\nWaitress, the musical adaptation of the 2007 film with songs by pop star Sara Bareilles, tells the story of Jenna, a waitress and pie maker trapped in a small-town diner and a loveless marriage.\n\nMraz will play Dr. Pomatter, a gynecologist and Jenna's love interest. He'll have several duets with actress Betsy Wolfe, including the steamy Bad Idea, the adorable It Only Takes a Taste and the aching You Matter to Me. Mraz has already recorded Bad Idea and You Matter To Me with Bareilles on her Top 10 album What's Inside: Songs From Waitress.\n\nI love Sara, I love the music, I love the story, I think Dr. Pomatter is a very likable guy even though he's somewhat scandalous in the plot. He's a likable character and his songs are so enjoyable, said Mraz.\n\nThe Virginia-born singer who briefly attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy before focusing on his own music said he weighed a career in musicals but feared he'd be auditioning for the rest of his life.\n\nThat scared me and I thought, 'I'm going to be a waiter. I'm going to be a waiter for the rest of my life.' So at 18, I decided, 'I'm going to write my own music and essentially write my own life musical, he said.\n\nI said, in the back of my mind, 'Maybe in my 40s or 50s, when I'm older and I have life experience, there might be more parts available for me. And, sure enough, two months after I turned 40, my phone rang and I got an invitation to come to New York. He laughed: The universe is cashing in the rain check.\n\nMraz joins other stars from pop and rock to join Broadway shows, including Panic! at the Disco's singer Brendon Urie in Kinky Boots, Josh Groban in Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812, Sting in The Last Ship, Carly Rae Jepsen in Cinderella and Bareilles herself, who has played Jenna.\n\nI hope I live up to the hype, said Mraz.
As Dr. Mohammad Abu-Salha calmly, clinically, described reviewing the autopsy reports for his murdered daughters and son-in-law, members of the House Judiciary Committee clasped their hands over the mouths, stifling tears.\n\nI must be one of a few physicians, if not the only one, who read his own children's murder autopsy reports and details. They are seared into my memory, Abu-Salha testified Tuesday at the committee's hearing on hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism.\n\nThe Feb. 10, 2015 murders of 21-year-old Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, her 23-year-old husband Deah Shaddy Barakat, and 19-year-old sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, shocked the Chapel Hill, North Carolina community where they shot in their home. The U.S. Department of Justice investigated the deaths as a hate crime, but the suspect Craig Hicks was ultimately charged with three counts of first-degree murder. He has not yet stood trial.\n\nAs Mohammad Abu-Salha described reading their autopsies, members of Congress could be seen staring at a poster-sized photo of the three victims smiling together at a graduation.\n\nBullets macerated Yusor's and Razan's brains. Deah took many bullets to his arms and chest before he fell down to the ground. After that, the murderer saw that he was still breathing and shot him again in the mouth, said Abu-Salha, a Clayton, North Carolina-based psychiatrist. In a written statement presented to the committee, he said the gun nozzle left marks on the women's hijabs and skin.\n\nMembers of the House Judiciary Committee are brought to tears during the testimony of Mohammad Abu-Salha, whose daughters and son-in-law were gunned down in Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 2015. CBS News\n\nThe last time we saw them in their coffins, Yusor's forehead was bulging and her hazel eyes had turned grey and lifeless. What was once Razan's warm and smiling face filled with life was now a lifeless stone cold and deadly pale, Abu-Salha said.\n\nHe wrote that his son-in-law, while taking his last breath, he raised his index finger which is what we consider a sign of prayer.\n\nHe recalled an officer trying to comfort him at the scene of the murder.\n\n(The) officer whispered: 'They didn't suffer, it was swift, one shot to the back of the head.' His statement did not make it more bearable; nothing did, Abu-Salha testified.\n\nAbu-Salha described the six weeks between the marriage of his daughter and son-in-law as the happiest days of our lives... followed by one of the most painful days, filled with the greatest heartache we have ever experienced.\n\nHe described his daughters as committed to volunteering — at a dental clinic for Syrian refugees, and for a program that fed the homeless, among others.\n\nMy wife and I raised them to be Muslim-Americans, proud of their country and their community. As Muslim as apple pie... I'm sorry, as American as apple pie. That can be Muslim, too, he said, eliciting laughter and smiles. But he said it was their Muslim identity that got his daughters killed.\n\nYusor had previously told her father about their condescending neighbor, Hicks, who told her he hated how she looked and dressed, Abu-Salha said.\n\nI am afraid for our country. In 2016 the FBI recorded a 67 percent increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes, and just weeks ago a young man in Indiana was shot in the back of the head by a man shouting anti-Muslim slurs, Abu-Salha testified.\n\nThe hearing was called in part as a response to the live-streamed mass murders last month at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. During questioning, Abu-Salha recounted some of the hateful messages he saw online after his children's deaths.\n\nHe described seeing a tweet that said three down, 1.6 billion to go, referring to the global Muslim population. Another tweet he recalled was in praise of his children's accused murderer: Greg Hicks should be given the Medal of Honor and released from custody.\n\nAmong those at the hearing was Facebook's public policy director, Neil Potts, who spoke about efforts by the company to stem hate speech online in the wake of the Christchurch attack.\n\nOur rules have always been clear that white supremacists are not allowed on our platform under any circumstances, and we have banned more than 200 white supremacist groups under our Dangerous Organizations policy, Potts said.\n\nFacebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for the company and other tech giants to face regulation in an opinion column on March 30. On Monday, Britain took steps to be the first country with an independent regulator focused on holding tech companies accountable for reducing online harms.\n\nIn his testimony, Abu-Salha urged the U.S. government to take similar action.\n\nWe miss our children so much. At times the pain is just as sharp now as when they died. I ask you, I truly plead to you, not to let another American family go through this because our government would not act to protect all Americans, Abu-Salha said. Please remember them, Yusor, Deah and Razan. They are my children and they are gone.
She's SEVENTY ... and she's in Harper's Bazaar! Alina Cho talks with a model mom:\n\nEven without makeup, Maye Musk is radiant. But after an hour in the chair with a top hair and makeup team, along with a glamorous selection of gowns and shoes, she's ready for her closeup.\n\nYeah, I know, at age 70 I think it's about time I was in Harper's Bazaar! she laughed.\n\nYes, last month, Musk celebrated her 70th birthday.\n\nCover girl Maye Musk. CBS News\n\nSeventy years young – how's it feel? asked Cho.\n\nFabulous. I feel great.\n\nAnd how many grandmothers would dare to do this?\n\nStanding on an apple box, and the gown low down, and I'm saying, Have they no respect for age? she chuckled. I mean, what's this about?\n\nApparently, these days, it's all about Maye. Not only is she featured in this month's Harper's Bazaar, she's also in the June issue of AARP. She walked the runway at a recent Dolce & Gabbana show, and even made an appearance in a Beyoncé video…\n\nAnd then there's this TV commercial – as the oldest Cover Girl ever.\n\nThey say at a certain age you just stop caring. I wonder what age that is.\n\nCho asked, Did you ever think that, at 70, you'd still be modeling?\n\nIf I'd said that when I was 28, they would have said, 'We can't use her again. She's a bit crazy,' Musk laughed. So, no, you don't think that at all. And now, at 70, I'm doing the best work I've ever done.\n\nMost fashion models are considered over the hill in their 30s. Actually, I was told, at 15, that I'll be over the hill at 18!\n\nMaye Musk has been before the camera since age 15, and has never really left. CBS News\n\nThere may be another reason you know her name: Maye Musk is the mother of Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur, founder of high-end electric car maker Tesla, and Space X, the largest private maker of rockets.\n\nExploration is in their genes. Maye's adventurous parents picked up and moved the family from Canada to South Africa when she was just two.\n\nHer father was a pilot: An extraordinary one, the only person to fly from South Africa to Australia in a single-engine plane. My mother was the navigator. So, they went all the way up Africa. Now, this is with a compass and a map.\n\nShe started modeling at age 15. Along the way, she fell in love with Errol Musk, an engineer. They wed when she was 22.\n\nI got married and fell pregnant on honeymoon, she said. So then I had the three kids.\n\nThree highly-accomplished children: Elon; younger brother Kimbal (now a pioneer in the farm-to-table movement); and the youngest, Tosca (a film producer and director).\n\nMaye Musk and her children: Elon, Kimbal and Tosca. Maye Musk\n\nCho asked, At this point in their lives, do they listen to you?\n\nIf there's something they're doing that I'm not happy about, I would certainly say it. I do discipline my grandchildren! Maye laughed. They have to show good manners. And not only do they clear their plate, they have to clear my plate and anybody else's plate, too. But the kids are good. I don't want them to feel entitled.\n\nShe's been been modeling since the age of 15, but today, at age 70, Maye Musk is more in-demand than ever. CBS News\n\nYou might have been a disciplinarian with your children, said Cho.\n\nYeah, I'm thinking I probably was. Because I don't tolerate bad manners.\n\nRaising the kids wasn't always easy. After nine years of marriage, she divorced and eventually returned to Canada, where she and the children lived in a rent-controlled apartment, paycheck-to-paycheck.\n\nI would say, anyone who knows me says they don't envy my life. I've just been through very hard times, Maye said. I had to pay the rent. I needed the roof over our head and food for us to eat.\n\nYou said, 'Poverty makes you work hard,' Cho said.\n\nYes. People asked, why was I motivated? I would say, I wanted to survive.\n\nAt a photo shoot with Maye Musk. CBS News\n\nShe worked part-time as a model while earning her second master's degree in nutritional sciences – not always listening to her own advice. She actually 50 to 60 pounds, and for a while worked as a plus-sized model.\n\nWell, what happens is, I was really under stress. Ice cream, chocolate, fries, burgers, I loved it! he laughed.\n\nAnd then, at some stage, my weight will stop going up. And it didn't. It just kept on going up until I got over 200 pounds.\n\nCho asked, At what point did you decide, 'I'm going to lose the weight?'\n\nWhen I was increasing my risk for disease.\n\nEven today, she says it's still a struggle.\n\nCho asked, You don't trust yourself?\n\nNo! You can't trust yourself! You know how weak you are. When someone brings a box of chocolates to me, they say, 'You can have one every day.' It's not in my genes. I'm incapable of having one chocolate a day.\n\nWatch Maye Musk dance to Beyoncé's hit song Single Ladies, and you see a woman at the top of her game, and quite content with being, well, single.\n\nWhen asked about her love life, Musk said, Well, I'm really too busy for that, yes. And secondly, yeah, I haven't met someone that's of interest to me, who would tolerate my schedule.\n\nCho asked, Are you open to it?\n\nNo.\n\nOh, come on.\n\nI know! I just don't see – when would I have time?\n\nMaye, if the right man came along …\n\n'If the right man …' she laughed. But I've never met the right man. Never.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Jay Kernis.
Irving Plaza in New York City is one of the venues that helped establish singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco as a singular talent. Independent, adored and prolific, DiFranco's latest Revolutionary Love is her 22nd album. Critics are calling the album searing and hopeful. Revolutionary Love is also heavily influenced by jazz.\n\nFor me, it's basically about showing up to the hard labor of good change, of truth and justice with love in your heart, she told CBS News' Jeff Glor.\n\nOne of the videos for the new album got her cited for trespassing on oil company land, an act of artistic activism that put DiFranco before a judge.\n\nYou just got arrested recently and were in court this morning? Glor asked.\n\nYes. Zoom court. Zoom court is about as fun as Zoom anything, DiFranco laughed.\n\n.@anidifranco shares her thoughts on tuning out the negative noise to stay focused on the creative process. pic.twitter.com/xtMSbKajeT — CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) February 20, 2021\n\nHer passions have taken her around the world many times over. The Buffalo, New York-born singer-songwriter grew up in a house with no walls, which she said did not work so great because her family was not at peace.\n\nMy mother was an architect and my father an engineer. And this was their baby. This was their project, this house. It was a carriage house that they turned into our family abode, she said. And their vision was to have no walls. To have only intimacy and togetherness, I guess. The only door was on the bathroom.\n\nAt the age of nine, DiFranco met a local musician who introduced her to the Buffalo folk scene. She moved out of her house when she was 15 years old and, by the early 1990s, wound up in New York City, where she became an indie star.\n\nSixteen years ago, she made a move to New Orleans, finding motherhood and a hard challenge for her: marriage. DiFranco said she wrote her new album while in her second marriage.\n\nAnd it was really difficult for my fella for a lotta years when the kids were little, and he was holding down the fort all by himself. And, you know, you are struggling in these different spheres, and you grow apart. And resentments build. But this album, this new album of mine, is sort of like the breakup album without the breakup. We made it through, she said.\n\nDiFranco has produced and distributed every single one of her albums independently on Righteous Babe Records. She said she sometimes regretted not doing a major record studio album and working with a big producer.\n\nI look back at some of the things that I've recorded forever, and I think, 'Dang. Those are some good songs, and I didn't do them justice,' she recalled. And if only I had brought in the team of professionals, you know, I was just a kid with ... a stubborn kid who was just like, 'I'm not gonna wait around for the team of professionals. I'm gonna do it. It's not perfect, but hey.' But sometimes I do look back at my records, and I think, 'Sorry, songs.'\n\nDiFranco's brutal honesty is something her dedicated fans have seen for more than three decades, and she said she hopes she made a difference.\n\nI hope that I have helped more than I've harmed, DiFranco said. It always felt ironic that I was described again and again and again for decades as an angry woman, you know? 'Cause, you know, and then...\n\nIt's an easy label. It's an easy label, Glor said.\n\nYeah. But I feel like I've always come from that place of revolutionary love. I love my country and that's why I fight for it in my way you know it is all out of love, she said.
CHELSEA, Mass. -- The husband of a Massachusetts elementary school teacher has pleaded not guilty to killing her in their home.\n\nSobbing family members reportedly filled the courtroom as Andrew MacCormack was arraigned Wednesday in Chelsea District Court on a murder charge. He was ordered held without bail and cried in court during the hearing.\n\nProsecutors allege MacCormack, 29, killed 30-year-old Vanessa MacCormack in their Revere home on Saturday. They say he then withdrew $100 out of an ATM, bought cocaine with the couple's baby in the car, and returned home, where he allegedly tried to clean up the scene before calling 911.\n\nThe medical examiner's office has found that Vanessa MacCormack suffered blunt force injury to the head, sharp force injuries to the neck and asphyxiation. Prosecutors say she was found strangled with a trash bag over her head.\n\nVanessa MacCormack, left, and Andrew MacCormack, right CBS Boston\n\nPolice found the bathroom had been cleaned with bleach, reports CBS Boston.\n\nProsecutors allege the couple's marriage was falling apart because of Andrew MacCormack's expensive drug problem, and Vanessa MacCormack had recently been talking about divorce, the station reports.\n\nBefore the slaying, Andrew MacCormack had allegedly fueled his drug habit by taking money from their bank accounts and blaming hackers or selling jewelry while claiming it was stolen from their house, the station reports.\n\nProsecutors say text messages show that the couple had recently argued about finances.\n\nThe texts back and forth show that very recently Vanessa was enraged at the defendant for botching their finances, for being irresponsible, according to her, a prosecutor said.\n\nAndrew MacCormack's attorney says someone else killed the victim and police were too quick to blame the husband.\n\nHis DNA and his fingerprints are going to be all over the house. So why would he be bleaching the house? I think it's a lot more likely that an assailant from outside the home bleached the house, the attorney said.\n\nVanessa MacCormack taught second grade in Lynn, Massachusetts. The couple has a 1-year-old daughter.
Part 2 of Sunday Morning anchor Jane Pauley's two-part interview with the vice president-elect:\n\nAnd how may we address him? You can call me Doug.\n\nBut of course he isn't just Doug. Douglas Emhoff will be making history as the first husband of a U.S. vice president.\n\nFirst gentleman? asked CBS News' Jane Pauley.\n\nSecond gentleman! said Emhoff. First second gentleman.\n\nI'm afraid for the next week or month or year of your life, you're going to be doing something like you just had to do with me.\n\nYeah, it's all good, he said.\n\nVice President-Elect Kamala Harris said, There was a whole conversation, mostly among his friends, whether he should just be called the 'first dude'!\n\nAnd other names that I can't repeat on national television, Emhoff added.\n\nThe two met in 2013, a blind date set up by a friend of hers.\n\nPauley asked, When you first got the friend who said, 'There's a guy…' (and maybe your friends were doing this to you all the time) 'There's a guy, and he's a good one. And don't Google him.' You totally Googled him, didn't you?\n\nOoh. This is a reveal! Emhoff smiled.\n\nI've never been asked that. I did! Harris laughed. Oh, that's so funny you asked me that question. So, yes, my best friend set us up on a blind date. And she said, 'Just trust me. Just trust me. Just don't …' You know, she wanted me to just kind of go into it, and she said, 'Don't Google him.' I did!\n\nDouglas Emhoff and Kamala Harris married in 2018. CBS News\n\nShe found he was a Los Angeles lawyer. Of course, he knew she was California Attorney General.\n\nHe made the first move. One of my buddies was in town, and we went to a Laker game. And so, you know, we [had] a couple of beers, I told him the story. I said, 'What do you think I should text her?' So, we sat there in the stands and we came up with this text, which was something like, 'Hey, it's Doug. Awkward! I'm texting you.'\n\nHarris asked, You guys composed it together?\n\nWe did. So, that's my reveal! And she, which is funny, she said something like, 'Yay, Lakers. Go Lakers.'\n\nAnd I'm a Warriors fan.\n\nBiggest Warriors fan out there, he laughed.\n\nThe next morning, early, he called: So, I left this ridiculous voicemail, which she has saved and plays back to me on our anniversary every year. I thought I'd never hear from her again, but ...\n\nBut it was just, it was adorable, she laughed. And it was just, I mean, the thing about Doug is that he is exactly who he is. He's just fully authentic and clear about the things he cares about. And it's family, it's his work …\n\nYou, he added.\n\nAnd me! she smiled.\n\nThey married in 2014, her first. He was by her side as she was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he found out what it's like to be a +1 to a powerful politician.\n\nThere were Senate spouses who welcomed me, he said. And I went to some, you know, lunches and events.\n\nAnd plenty of misters? asked Pauley.\n\nAmy Klobuchar's husband, Elizabeth Warren's husband, who kinda put their, you know, arms around me to show me the ropes.\n\nHarris said, There're very few husbands that are Senate spouses. They do find each other.\n\nVice President-Elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff. CBS News\n\nEmhoff plans to teach law classes at Georgetown University, much like the incoming first lady, Jill Biden, who plans to continue as a community college professor.\n\nPauley said to Emhoff, You strike me as a very centered person. And a calming presence.\n\nThank you. I understand the role she's taking, and the role that Joe and Jill are taking on, too, and become very close with them. So, like I support her, I support them. And that's important, 'cause what they're doing is so much. And they're walking into so many different crises. The American people hired them for change and to get us outta these things. And I'm gonna do everything I can to help them.\n\nAnd to relieve the stress of the Washington pressure-cooker, the couple hopes to keep cooking. They are, Harris confirmed, both kitchen people.\n\nYou cook? Pauley asked.\n\nWell, he has learned, Harris said. He's a good sous chef.\n\nNow, outta necessity during COVID, he added.\n\nHow much cooking will there be in your life to come? Pauley asked.\n\nWell, I am charting that course and making sure that at least for Sunday family dinner, said Harris. It's too much a part of our family life. And that's important to me, to keep that stability.\n\nAnd we had to ask about that fashion choice, surely a first for a vice president: The Converse Chuck Taylor sneakers, a.k.a. Chucks.\n\nPauley said, I gotta tell you, when you walked in, I checked out, Is she wearin' 'em? You're not wearin' your Chucks today!\n\nNo.\n\nWhat is the story?\n\nIt became a story. I've always worn Chucks! she laughed. It's my casual go-to. You know, grew up with Chucks. I just love them. They're comfortable.\n\nI can attest. There [are] several closets full of them, Emhoff laughed.\n\nHe's exaggerating!\n\nBut, this wasn't just some thing that she started doing on the campaign. When I met her, it was Chucks and jeans when she met the kids.\n\nWhat did it say to you? Pauley asked.\n\nShe's down-to-earth. People ask me all the time, like, 'What's she really like?' I said, she's shockingly normal. And I think that is really an extension of who she really is.\n\nHarris and Emhoff have blended their families together, including children Ella and Cole from his first marriage. Their Sunday evening Zoom calls are a striking picture of diversity:\n\nHarris said, We have family in Italy. My sister-in-law married an Italian, so they live there with their two children. India, we have an aunt and an uncle there. Canada. Brooklyn! Oakland.\n\nEmhoff added, My parents, they live in the desert out in California.\n\nAnd for the next four years, add the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington to the list, which will be home to the Vice President and her family.\n\nIt reflects America, Emhoff said. And that's what it should be. It should just be about love and unity.\n\nClick here for Part 1 of Jane Pauley's interview with Kamala Harris.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Alan Golds. Editor: Ed Givnish.
Pop star Britney Spears and her efforts to be free of her father's control of a court-ordered conservatorship of her finances have landed an unlikely supporter in Congress: conservative Congressman Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, who is wondering if Spears is being overprotected and whether authority over her finances should be returned to her. Spears would like her father to be replaced as permanent conservator by an adviser who is a fiduciary, specifically, by Jodi Montgomery, who has been installed on a temporary basis.\n\nIn a toxic legal battle, Spears' case to wrest control of her finances from her father has sparked the viral hashtag #freebritney and was the subject of a recent documentary. Now, Gaetz and House Judiciary Ranking Member Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, are calling for a hearing on the conservatorship process.\n\nThe most striking example is perhaps the case of multi-platinum performing artist Britney Spears, Gaetz and Jordan wrote in a letter this week to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, Democrat of New York. Since 2008, Ms. Spears has been under a court-ordered conservatorship. The facts and circumstances giving rise to this arrangement remain in dispute but involve questionable motives and legal tactics by her father and now-conservator, Jamie Spears.\n\n#NEWS: @Jim_Jordan and @RepMattGaetz demand @RepJerryNadler hold a hearing on court ordered conservatorships. The most striking example is perhaps the case of multi-platinum performing artist Britney Spears. pic.twitter.com/tfE8KJAZ4s — House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) March 9, 2021\n\nThe Judiciary Committee has yet to commit to or decline the hearing request but Nadler isn't exactly saying, gimme more on the subject. The Chairman has received the request, a committee spokesperson told CBS News. This Congress, the Committee will work to advance critical legislation to protect and strengthen civil rights and civil liberties for all Americans.\n\nSpears landed in conservatorship in 2008 after a period when she struggled with mental health issues after her marriage ended in 2007. Her father argues the court put conservatorship in place because people were taking advantage of his daughter while her life and health were at risk.\n\nFrom the beginning, the court has closely monitored Britney's situation, including through annual accountings and in-depth reviews and recommendations from a highly experienced and dedicated court investigator who annually meets at length with Britney and all involved in her conservatorship, Vivian Thoreen, an attorney for Mr. Spears told CBS News. Any time Britney wants to end her conservatorship, she can ask her lawyer to file a petition to terminate it; she has always had this right but in 13 years has never exercised it. Britney knows that her Daddy loves her, and that he will be there for her whenever and if she needs him, just as he always has been — conservatorship or not.\n\nGaetz and Jordan want Congress to probe the process of conservatorships over concerns about their use to deprive Americans of personal freedoms by others through the courts, according to their letter. They cite a 2010 GAO report that identified examples of guardians improperly obtaining millions of dollars as well as hundreds of allegations of physical abuse, neglect and financial exploitation by guardians in 45 states and the District of Columbia between 1990 and 2010.\n\nBritney Spears has not responded to a request for comment. Her next court date is set for March 17.
Check out clips and interviews below with the five nominees for this year's Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nWinners of this year's Oscars will be announced on Sunday, February 9, at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center in Hollywood.\n\nAntonio Banderas, Pain and Glory\n\nWinner of the Best Actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival, Banderas gives a subtly-shaded performance as a director who believes he can no longer direct, who has withdrawn into himself as he feels the increasing physical deprivations of age, and who turns to the past by delving into memories and regrets as he enters what may be the last act of his life.\n\nBanderas is terrific as a stand-in for director Pedro Almodóvar (with whom he had collaborated numerous times over the past 40 years), who has conjured a story that is ultimately positive and resistant to doubt, as his protagonist focuses on the aging of the body (which can defeat the artistic will) and the power of memory (which can rescue it).\n\nIn an interview with Stephen Colbert on CBS' The Late Show, Banderas talked about how his heart attack in 2017 left him much more uninhibited in expressing his emotions. Everything made me cry, he said. I'm not a crier, believe me. But ever since that time, it was almost like somebody peeled the skin out of me. Everything was more raw. Pedro Almodóvar saw that, and he said to me, 'Don't try to hide that. Show that in the character, please. Because I felt like that when I was suffering all those pains and that isolation.'\n\nSo, you know, we actors, we just suck from everything that is surrounding us. And that was a good experience, in a way. I know that a heart attack is a horrible thing, especially if you don't survive it, obviously! But it could be a good thing. … And actually it was one of the best things that ever happened in my life, because it taught me so much about myself.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood\n\nQuentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood tells of the unsettling changes that were underway in Hollywood in the late 1960s, when the studio system was collapsing, and the film and TV industries were desperate to attract a more youthful audience. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), the fading star of the cancelled TV western series Bounty Law, dreams of making the transition into movies. And when he does get a job, every shot, every take, could mean career life or death.\n\nIn the scene below, Dalton plays a western villain holding a young kidnapped girl (Julia Butters) for ransom. DiCaprio does a wonderful job of playing an actor improvising and trying to gauge how much is too much when portraying a boo-hiss evil character. At the end, he gets what every actor must crave.\n\nDiCaprio, an Oscar-winner for The Revenant (he'd received four other acting nominations), told Variety that, in his preparation for the film with Tarantino, he keyed into the careers of three notable TV and B-movie actors of the 1950s and '60s: Ty Hardin (TV's Bronco), Edd Byrnes (77 Sunset Strip), and Ralph Meeker (Kiss Me Deadly). Once we honed in on Ralph Meeker, I started obsessively watching his work, because there was a vulnerability and sensitivity to him, and a sort of pathos in his work, that I felt Rick had the potential to emulate in his own career. … I think we both mutually decided that, yeah, there is a depth to Rick's work, and applying himself and digging deep, he can give a great performance.\n\nDiCaprio also asked for a scene in which he (purposely) screws up a take while filming a western, forcing Rick Dalton to re-do the scene midway. Tarantino shot it both with and without the interruption: And then once we did it with the f***up, it was so amazing that of course we're going to use it, the director told Variety.\n\nOnce Upon a Time… in Hollywood is available On Demand and on Blu-ray and DVD, and to stream via Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube\n\nAdam Driver, Marriage Story\n\nIn Noah Baumbach's dramedy about the dissolution of a marriage and the ugly psychic wounds that are peeled back as a divorce inches closer to legal finality, Adam Driver plays Charlie, a theatre director who is resistant to the notion that his wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), an actress, has justifiable reasons to leave him. But he is also barely cognizant of the incalculable anger that boils underneath the surface at the thought that their child will now be split between two parents on two coasts...\n\n... until this scene, when Charlie and Nicole have the confrontation that basically spills out every slight and disagreement they have felt during their married life, every rationalization for bad behavior, and the queasy determination over whether there is a winner and a loser in a divorce case. The technically and emotionally difficult scene, scripted at 11 pages, was shot over two days. Driver and Johansson's powerful performances made the scene the centerpiece of the film's emotional battle between their characters.\n\nDriver, who earned his first Oscar nomination last year for Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman, told Variety that the fight scene was kind of claustrophobic, because it was just one camera and a bunch of people in one small room. But even though it kind of felt like theatre – it felt like theatre for that group of people, and the theme of theatre and performance is also a theme that runs throughout the movie anyway … the ritual of going through a divorce, you're kind of putting on a performance, taking human moments, writing them down and turning them into weapons, performing them for a judge to make a decision – it kind of lends itself to that scene.\n\nIn this interview with Stephen Colbert on CBS' The Late Show, Driver called the film a love story about divorce:\n\nMarriage Story is available to stream at Netflix\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, Joker\n\nIn this origin story for Batman's arch nemesis, a somber character study of how a damaged soul can rebuild itself in an even more damaged fashion, Joaquin Phoenix (who has previously been nominated three times, for Gladiator, Walk the Line and The Master) maintains his position as one of the very best actors around. He brings an effective pain and dislocation to his performance as Arthur Fleck, a victim of child abuse whose doleful job as a clown only sets him up for continued humiliation. Fleck feels crushed by a society in which violence and nihilism reign, yet isn't attracted to fighting forces of violence and nihilism, and even ignores an opportunity to come to a young woman's aid when she is harassed by jerks on a train. But when their attention turns to him, suddenly his will to lash out has no limits. He becomes, like Batman, a vigilante, one whose actions inspire a mob to burn Gotham down.\n\nEspecially powerful is a scene following Fleck's first murders, in which he dances to music only he, apparently, can hear. The scene, in which he hides in a bathroom, was unscripted. A music track, by composer Hildur Guðnadóttir, had been sent to director Todd Phillips the day before, and so Phoenix improvised a dance signifying his metamorphosis into a new, terrifying personality. [Not surprisingly, Guðnadóttir is also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score.]\n\nThere were times where I really felt for him, Phoenix said of his character to Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes. And there were times where I was disappointed and repulsed by his behavior, right? And I liked that.\n\nI think oftentimes people feel like I identify and I'm expressing something of my own experience through the character; I think it's the opposite, Phoenix said. I think it's because oftentimes the characters have these lives and experiences that are so foreign to me that it breaks my heart.\n\nJonathan Pryce, The Two Popes\n\nAs Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina, Jonathan Pryce received his first Oscar nomination in Fernando Meirelles' story of conversations between the future Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI (Best Supporting Actor nominee Anthony Hopkins), a conservative who reveals he intends to retire from his position as the Holy See's leader. Coming at a time of scandal within the Catholic Church, the move is ground-shattering, and potentially damaging (or healing) for the Vatican.\n\nIn this scene Bergoglio argues against Benedict breaking the papal tradition of staying in his position until death:\n\nPryce, a Tony Award-winner whose films credits include Brazil, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Evita, Tomorrow Never Dies and The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, brings tremendous poignancy to his role as a man of faith whose questioning of the church's political functions butts up against his appreciation of the majesty of the divine, as represented by the church's history and rituals.\n\nThe veteran stage and screen actor's resemblance to Pope Francis had not gone unnoticed: The day he was created pope, the internet was full of images of the both of us next to each other recognizing the likeness, Pryce told Sunday Morning correspondent Tracy Smith. Even one of my sons called and said, 'Daddy, are you the pope?'\n\nMore Oscars 2020:\n\n\n\nFor more info:

Nice to be here.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo David, I want to start a little bit with your background, how did you get interested in journalism, how did you end up as a journalist?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nJournalism was really the only thing I was ever, to be honest, any good at. I wrote for my high school newspaper, I got good grades, but that was the thing that I enjoy, that I felt I had a natural aptitude for. I used to go to the Howard Theatre here, in Washington, and interview The Temptations for my high school newspaper.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWow.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nJunior Walker and the All Stars, that was the lengths to which I would try play my journalistic card back then.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, most student reporters don't get those kind of opportunities.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, I would go there in my white shirt and tie and my school blazer, and I think people kind of rolled their eyes, 'What was this kid doing?' But I remember going to the basement of The Temptations' hotel room, and he opened the door, and you could imagine the smells that wafted out of dope, and that people who were dancing, and he said, I think it's time for this interview to be over.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo what would you tell a group of young people today, who might be interested in journalism, about the profession?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nYou need to really love it, because it's difficult. It's difficult in the sense that it's not very well paid. The number of places that you can do good journalism, alas, seems to be shrinking, certainly in print. It's great to be doing podcasts, and that opens up new ways for people to do journalism.\n\nBut you have to love it, you have to be prepared for a profession that doesn't always love you back. You have to be tough minded. That's what journalists need to do, they need to ask hard questions, and take their criticism. And I think, finally, you need to have good judgment. We see lots of things in the world that are news, but we need good judgment in making sense of them, and not going crazy, not being hysterical, not looking to our readers and viewers as if we're biased, as if we're starting off knowing what the right answers are.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhat would you say the fundamental mission is of a journalist?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nTell the truth. Tell the truth, provide accountability for powerful people, help readers to make sense of a world that's increasingly difficult to make sense of. You know, I'd add just for these times, to the extent possible, avoid being infected by the craziness that's all around us. Keep your balance, don't be predictable, don't be on one team or another in the partisan debates that divide us. I think journalists, we have our own team, it's called journalism.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDo you find it difficult to stay in that sweet spot in these times that we live in?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nSo Michael, I think one of the things that worries me most is that people vote with their clicks or where they decide to tune in for the kind of news that they want. And increasingly, it seems as if they want news that confirms their biases.\n\nNews that challenges their biases, news that is unpredictable, that just comes with the story, try to make sense of it, seems to be failing out to news that makes you feel good about, tells you the people you hate are really awful, and the people you love are great. And so people are choosing up which news team they want to be on.\n\nI think that's just poisonous for us. I think it's poisonous for the country, too. But I think that's one of the dilemmas, the people we're hiring, who seem to be getting the clicks, sometimes are more tendentious.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo David, I consider you to be an expert in the Middle East. I consider you to be one of the leading, if not the leading, commentators, columnists on the Middle East. How did you get interested in the region?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nIt was really almost a process of accident, initially. I had been working for The Wall Street Journal in Pittsburgh. I was hired by the Journal, bizarre as this may sound, to cover the biggest labor union in America, the steelworkers. So I went to Pittsburgh, and wrote about the union, and then about the steel industry. I was promoted then to Washington, and covered the Justice Department, began covering the C.I.A. And in 1980, the job of Middle East correspondent for The Wall Street Journal came open.\n\nAnd I was asked by the foreign editor and the managing editor if I would have any interest, and I said, 'I've never been there, I don't speak any of the languages, I don't know much about it.' And they said, You're perfect. In other words, they wanted somebody who would come at this who was fresh.\n\nI was then 29, 30, really still just starting out my career. So I spent the next three years covering the Middle East, I spent most of that time in Beirut. And it was a real education for me. Obviously, covering conflict, the Lebanese Civil War was going on, and the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the aftermath with the U.S. Marines, the bombing of our embassy, the bombing of our Marine barracks, just taught me a lot about that. But also, to be honest, it just got under my skin, I became fascinated by it. Especially fascinated by Lebanon.\n\nAnd over these many years, I just haven't been able to detach myself. I began writing novels that were set in the Middle East, that added a new dimension for me. As you know, because you've been interested in it also, it's a heartbreaking part of the world. It's a place, as a colleague told me many years ago, where pessimism pays. You know, if you bet that things aren't going to work out, you're usually right. But all these years later, 40 years later, it still fascinates me.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAn affection? Would you say you have affection for the region?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nI do have. I have a deep affection.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, so do I.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nI think the Middle East is a place where you make friends, and if you work at it, you keep them. I still see some of the people I met in 1980, through the years. And you grieve with them for the terrible burden of suffering that they bear. That's a part of our problem, I think, as Americans, is it engages our interests, but also our idealism. We really want to help people in the Middle East. And we seem often in that process to make things worse, I'm sorry to say.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo David, I want to break this into kind of two pieces, your writing as a columnist, and then your writing as a novelist. You have a twice a week column in the Post on foreign affairs. And I think you're unique in that your column both is news, you often break news. And then your column is also, has an editorial aspect of it, which are your views. Do you see yourself as unique in this space?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, I think there are other columnists who try to offer news, not just opinions. I'm surprised there aren't more. When I was starting out in journalism, growing up, the typical Washington columnists, especially on foreign affairs, tried to break news in every column.\n\nThey competed, Joe Alsop, Joe Kraft, Evans and Novak, these are names people have probably forgotten these days, but their columns were full of news. And I've always thought that's the most fun part of my job. I'm surprised there aren't more people competing in that space. I think it'd be good for me, and it'd be good for journalism. But I probably have a fundamental defect as an opinion columnist, which is, I'm not that interested in opinions, including my own. I'm interested in new information.\n\nIf I were to just write a column that's just kind of buzzing around the same hive that everybody else is, it just bores me. So I always want to look for something that's new, tell you something you don't know. And that's what keeps me going. Otherwise, I'd find another job, I'd be bored.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDo you have a process that you go through to identify what you want to write about, or do the ideas just come to you?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, sometimes I'll come into the office on a day that I have a column due, and I won't really be sure what I'm going to write about. Sometimes those are the best, you just let something preconscious take over your under severe deadline pressure, and it just happens, and you speak with a voice that comes from deep thoughts you have that you weren't maybe consciously aware of. Those can be fun. There's columns I spend weeks and weeks working on, or some months, where I would be working a subject, working sources, gathering string.\n\nThese days, I can write longer columns, I can let them run to 3,000 words or more online, and I'll cut them down to a tight 750 word version for the newspaper. But that's great. There's a part of me, I got started doing investigative reporting. I've never lost that interest. And thanks to the infinite space of the internet, I get to go back to writing longer form.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, that's great. I want to ask you a couple of things about the Middle East, in particular, and my sense is that just looking at my questions here, that you've written about all of these in the last few weeks. I'd love to get your thinking for our listeners on the U.S.-Iran relationship in general, and the strike that killed General Soleimani, in particular.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nThe relationship, through all of my career as a journalist caring about the Middle East, the U.S.-Iran collision, has been a central fact of life. It's been the destabilizing element in the Middle East. The rage of the Iranian revolution of 1979 continues to destabilize the Middle East. And we have not, over that time, found an effective way, really I think, to deal with that regime.\n\nWe've tried different ways, we've tried being tough, virtually going to war during the Iraq-Iran War, on the side of Iraq. We've tried being generous in the negotiations that President Obama conducted for the nuclear agreement, and nothing's quite seemed to work. The most extreme action we've taken, probably, was the targeted killing of Qassem Soleimani, Iran's leading military strategist and covert action intelligence officer, and we killed him. And we tried to kill his key deputy the same day. An unusual step. So far, it hasn't had the repercussions that many--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhat was your reaction when you heard?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nMy reaction when I heard was, first, that we had crossed a line. The killing of a senior military commander, at a civilian airport, in a drone strike takes warfare into a different place. And I worried, and I'm worried to this day, that anybody who thinks that this will be a unique example of countries using drones to kill generals of countries they don't like, that is wrong. We opened the door into a space that others are sure to follow. And we won't like the results, and that's one of the reasons that people exercise caution. On the question of whether it would be radically destabilizing, I think I share the fears of many people that Iran would retaliate in ways that would make our problems worse. So far, that hasn't happened. So you have to say -- we took, no question, that he was a killer, that he was a person who had brought much destruction to the region and to Americans.\n\nAnd it's good that he's off the battlefield. Will it end up being a net positive or negative from the standpoint of U.S. interests? It's one of those questions, it's too early to say, but you'd have to say, we are in a new era, other people will try the same thing, that should worry us. The immediate repercussions have been less than expected, and that's good for us.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBut this might not be over yet, right?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nThis is in the Middle East.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nNothing's ever over.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nNo, nothing is ever over.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo David, similar kind of question on President Trump's proposal for peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, I saw the peace proposal, so-called, as essentially an invitation to the Palestinians to accept, ratify their defeat in this long struggle against Israel. It dates back really to the foundation of Israel in 1948. And over time, the Palestinians have been defeated not simply on the battlefield, but through, I think, extraordinary mistakes on their part, that failed at the diplomatic table. So they've turned down many peace offers, offers far better than this one. This really is a rejection of every fundamental demand that they've had. The bet that President Trump and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, and senior counselors crafted this over three years' making is that the pressure from other Arab countries that want to get on with it.\n\nAnd normalize relations with Israel will be so strong, that in the end, the Palestinians, if Trump is reelected, because this is a second term strategy, the Palestinians will have no choice but to go along with it. I think that's the idea that Kushner and company have in mind. Is that realistic?\n\nAll wars end eventually, but I don't see any signs that this one is ready to yet. I think the depth of Palestinian rage, the idea that a people who prize dignity as much as the Palestinians do, will accept the public shame of essentially granting Israeli annexation of what they think of as their land. I don't think we're there yet.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThere's this view out there that if just President Abbas were to move on, and the Palestinians had new leadership, that we might be in a different place. Do you share that view, or do you think the dynamics that you're talking about run much deeper among the Palestinian elite and the Palestinian people?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nI think Abbas is exhausted as a leader. I think he has so much invested in saying no that the idea of him being a creative partner really is gone. I think if the Palestinians had better leadership, the possibility that they would then generate trust among Israelis.\n\nAnd there'd be an ability to move toward some better negotiations to be more favorable to the Palestinians, I think is possible. Right now, the Israelis say, even Israelis who really want a two-state solution say, the other side just isn't trustworthy, isn't a partner. And looking at Mahmoud Abbas, it's hard to argue with that. So as with any country, including ours, the biggest question is, what political leadership will be there, and will it be able to creatively change what's seen to be the fundamentals? And I hope the Palestinians have good leaders going forward, they need them.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDavid, one of the things that you and I have talked about quite frequently is Saudi Arabia, and Mohammad Bin Salman, and where he is taking that country. Your thoughts on that?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, this is a hard question for me to answer, because Mohammad Bin Salman, I believe, is responsible for the murder of my colleague and friend, all of your listeners know, that Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist, a contributor to my newspaper, The Washington Post, was murdered in October, 2018.\n\nAnd I have tried to continue in my journalism ever since then, so more than a year, to try to understand how that happened. And I continue to believe that MBS, as the Saudi Crown Prince is known, and one of his top aides, Saud al-Qahtani, were involved in the approval of the operation that led to Khashoggi's death.\n\nSo that has to be my starting point when I talk about Saudi Arabia. I do think that Mohammad Bin Salman is appealing to a younger generation of Saudis, in the way that a modernizing autocrat does in the Middle East. I watched this for a period with Saddam Hussein, who was the great modernizer of Iraq. I watched this at various times in Egypt, where you had modernizing dictators.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSyria. Syria, too.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nSo this is something that we know, and I think Saudi people are as hungry for change as people anywhere. I think Saudi young people like the new culture that's more open, where the religious police are not stalking the markets, where you can go to public entertainment. You know, they have country music shows, and UFC cage fighting, and all the things that people around the world seem to love.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nYou can now get it in Saudi Arabia. I was in Saudi Arabia in July of this year, and went for a walk in Jeddah, in the old city, and I was just amazed to see families out, women in various stages of veil, unveiled, quasi-veiled. It's a different Saudi Arabia than I've ever seen. So I have to say, those changes are good. The problem is that the political bedrock in Saudi Arabia is getting more and more authoritarian.\n\nThere's no sign that I see that MBS realizes that he's building a police state. And once you build one, then you need even more police to enforce it. And that, I think, is a tragedy. I think a Saudi Arabia that changes, that moves into the future, we should all endorse that. And that part of what's going on, we should say, That's great. But the worry is unless he broadens his base, unless he governs by something other than raw fear among people, it's not going to work.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nI'm sure you saw the piece that Martin Indyk, from the Brookings Institution, wrote in The Wall Street Journal. And in that, he argued that U.S. interests in the region have declined significantly over the last several years, and therefore, what we're willing to invest in the region should decline as well. I just wanted to get your reaction to that.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, I thought it was a brilliant piece. Martin Indyk is the rare person who's really devoted much of his adult life to trying to bring peace and progress to the Middle East, on the National Security Council staff, the State Department, as Ambassador to Israel, he has really been laboring in the vineyard to try to do good things.\n\nSo when he reached this point of basically saying, 'Enough. You know, this isn't worth the trouble, the anguish that we experience,' I took it very seriously. I think many thousands of people that you and I talk to, or write to, think with, had the same experience. If Martin says that, we need to take it seriously. I think I would stop short of where Martin ended up. I think we have more strategic interests in continuity of American power in that region than Martin suggested. I think we've seen what happens when we kind of walk away, and say, 'Enough, I've had it.' Others who are very mischievous take advantage of that.\n\nAnd although we don't need Middle East oil the way we used to, the idea of ceding that part of the world and others to kind of permanent hegemony by others, and the instability that will go along with that, I just don't see that in America's interests. So it was a great piece, in that it made us all think. Anybody who hasn't read it should go out and get a copy, and then think, 'Well, is Martin right? Is it time for us to bail out of this region? Or if not, what are the limits we're going to draw?'\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt's a great thing to have a debate about, right?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nBecause we need to have a debate about this. Because we are slowly polling in that direction.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nThe country is just fed up, and I'm struck by, in both parties, obviously Trump says he wants out, it's tougher, thank goodness, to do than he'd like. Because he would've created vacuums in Afghanistan and Syria by now, if he'd had his way.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nLet me ask, David, one more question about substance, before we switch to talking about your books, which are absolutely fantastic. I presume you still talk to folks in the IC, you and I talked frequently. I actually learned a lot from those conversations in my office.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nI doubt that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nNo, I absolutely did. How do you think the IC is holding up in the current political environment?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, the basic answer is, I don't know, because their performance, like everything they do, is secret. I'm told by people from other countries who deal with them, in liaison relationships, that they're basically as good as ever.\n\nThat the operations, officers, their sense of mission, all the different technical collection that we do through other agencies, is still robust and confidently managed. There's no way for me to judge, but I take that as a good thing. We need a strong, self-confident intelligence agency. I do worry that getting battered now, it's been three years, of pretty much ceaseless assault on these agencies, is going to take its toll, not least in people being afraid to be visible and accountable in a way that they need to be. I'll give you an example. The C.I.A. and the director of National Intelligence have essentially asked the Congressional Intelligence Committees for permission not to testify in public about their annual threat assessment.\n\nThis is one of the big events, as you know, Mike, you had to prepare this many times. It's one of those moments where the intelligence agencies really level with the country about what's going on. And sometimes what they say is at odds with what policymakers say, and that's why it's so important.\n\nLast year, the testimony by Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence, made President Trump angry, because it contradicted him on North Korea, on a couple of other instances. So this year, they don't want to be in that situation. I get it, you know, they want to be careful, they want to avoid offending the man in the Oval Office. But that situation, I think, should really grate people. It's good for them to have to stand up and speak the truth to power, not be afraid of what the power will say. That's really the heart of their mission. And so here's one small example of the toll that we're beginning to pay.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, I agree 100% with you. There are great benefits for the country, and for the intelligence community, in that annual event happening. And I worry greatly that it might not, for all the reasons that you said.\n\nSo David, you're also a fiction writer, and a very good one. You've written ten books, the 11th is on its way.\n\nI must tell you that I get asked frequently by young people who are interested in C.I.A., particularly the operational C.I.A., about what books should they read? What book comes closest to what it's really like? And without hesitation, I tell them Agents of Innocence, which was your first book.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nI'm flattered. Thank you.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd it's an amazing book. A couple of questions. How do you find the time to be a novelist and also to be a journalist at the same time?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, obviously, the wonderful thing about writing novels is it gives me a chance to take things that interest me in the world of fact, as I report my columns, as I travel around the world, and then explore them on a much broader tableau in fiction.\n\nSo in a sense, the two worlds interpenetrate. I try to avoid either contaminating the other, and I just want to say, this is for fiction, and it's made up. And I hope my columns are fact only. Ever since my first novel was published in 1987, back then, I said to myself, okay, that novel was well-received.\n\nAnd people said, You ought to be a novelist. And I remember thinking, I have to make a choice. I have to decide I'm going to do this, be a novelist, or do this, be a journalist. And I just didn't make the choice. I never could figure out what the right way to go was. I thought the kind of novels I wanted to write would never have a big enough readership that I could really make a living, and send my kids to school, and do all the things that we want to do. So I wanted to keep my day job, in part, for financial reasons. But it's one of those moments, sometimes the best choice to make is not to choose. And that's why I continue to do both.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDo you do both at the same time? Or do you take a break to write a novel?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nA novel is like a physical thing that it's growing in your imagination. You know, you're building a world, characters, a whole world that begins to become real, it just takes up more space. So when I'm beginning working on book, I'll work on it two days a week, maybe three. By the end, I fall asleep thinking about it, I dream about it, I wake up thinking about it. I don't have a set time from 6:00 to 9:00, it's just every minute I can grab in my seven-day week, that novel wants to take, it's like a hungry baby. It just wants all the intellectual nourishment. So it's always a rush. Part of what's fun about this is\n\nwhen the book just takes, it's living you, as opposed to you living or writing it.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDo you have the whole arc of the story laid out in your mind? Or does that evolve?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nI usually start with an idea, yes, where I want the story to end up. And that changes as you get to know the characters better, as you understand better, the world they're living in, the dilemmas, some of the particular twists and turns change. But I think it's important to start with some basic tracks laid down, and then let yourself switch and imagine and reimagine.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDo you have a favorite?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nOf my books?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nUh-huh (AFFIRM).\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nWell, you know, it's like asking which child is your favorite. You love them all. The first novel, that you mentioned, Agents of Innocence, it was based on real life. It was based on a story I used to say was all made up. But it wasn't, it was based on real events.\n\nAt one of the most amazing intelligence operations the United States ever ran, where we recruited and ran as an asset the chief of intelligence of our leading terrorist adversary at the time, the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n\nHe was for ten years operating as our guy in the PLO. And the people who did that, the way it was done, just overwhelmingly interesting to me. I wanted to find a way to tell the story, and fiction was the only way. So that book, where I kind of taught myself how to write a novel. The first draft of that was rejected by every publisher in America.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nReally?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nOften derisively, you know, Wow, Mr. Ignatius, how interesting that you would think you could write a novel. See you later. But finally, somebody took a risk, and then I rewrote it a couple times. I think writing fiction is an iterative skill, you learn to do it by doing it. And as I said, just glad I had the chance, and then that I let myself keep doing it. And parts of my books, the new one, The Paladin, there are parts of it I love. My firstborn novel is my favorite.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo The Paladin, what's it about?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nThe Paladin is about a C.I.A. officer, he's on the kind of blue-collar side of the agency. He's a technical officer, a guy who plants bugs, hacks systems, whose life is destroyed, his career at the agency is wrecked. His marriage is shattered, he loses his family, he loses everything.\n\nBecause, as we discover through the novel, he's been assigned to conduct an operation which, it's decided, is illegal. He is asked to invade the computers and space of an American journalist, in quotation marks, overseas.\n\nAnd he is abandoned by the people he thought had promised him that he'd be safe doing this. But as the novel progresses, we learn that he, in some ways, is the architect of his own difficulties. That rage that he begins the book with, at others, is in part directed toward himself. This character, his name is Michael Dunn, was interesting to me because if listeners have read the book, Hillbilly Elegy, about an angry person from the industrial heartland, this book's character, Michael Dunn, is very much that kind of person. He's from McKeesport, Pennsylvania, old steel town.\n\nI mentioned earlier in our broadcast that I started my career covering the steel industry. So it's a part of America that I know pretty well. And the angry people there, like Michael Dunn, my character, those are the people who elected Donald Trump.\n\nSo there's a way in which this is a kind of allegory about what we're living through. I won't tell you where Michael Dunn ends up, but you won't be surprised if he doesn't end up with a Make America Great Again hat on.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo I got an early copy, and I read it this weekend, and it is absolutely terrific. And I won't give away the ending either. Can folks preorder it now?\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nIt's on Amazon now, and they're welcome to go and preorder it. And you know, if Amazon delivery doesn't work, if you live in any ZIP code near mine, I'll hand deliver a copy.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDavid, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nDAVID IGNATIUS:\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *
A Washington, D.C. couple followed through with their long-planned wedding, even in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. Rather than postponing their event because of the capital's lockdown, Sara and Marco Sylvester got creative so that they could still celebrate their special day and share it with their loved ones.\n\nPrepared for marriage, ready for marriage, Sara told CBS News' Christina Ruffini.\n\nHer new husband Marco said the couple had decided under no circumstances would [they] postpone, and so they said their vows on Tuesday, March 31 before a mostly-empty church, while streaming the ceremony on Instagram Live. D.C.'s stay-at-home order went into effect less than 24 hours later, just after midnight on April 1.\n\nJust 48 hours before the entire city was put on lockdown, Sara called trombone player Travis Gardner, who was supposed to play at their reception. She asked him if he could perform at the church on their new wedding date, as a surprise for Marco.\n\nThey called me like, hey, we're going to elope, Gardner said.\n\nShe asked him to play the 1961 Elvis Presley song Can't Help Falling In Love, which Gardner had not known how to play at the time.\n\nI learned the song that night, he said.\n\nSoon after, he was playing the song on his trombone from a street corner while a procession of cars sent well wishes to the couple, who were standing outside the church in the rain.\n\nI felt like I was in a movie, and then I looked at her and she was just sobbing. So then I made sure to grab her and start dancing with her, Marco said.\n\nSara called the wedding the most beautiful, special experience, and said she would not have had it any other way.\n\nRight now, the world just needs love. If everybody loves and comes together, we can beat anything, Gardner said.
Dale County District Attorney Kirke Adams and Assistant DA Jordan Davis spent years building a case against Carl Harris for the murder of his ex-wife, Tracey.\n\nTracey Harris was a hardworking, young mother that disappeared March 7th, 1990, said Adams.\n\nA week later, her body was found in a nearby river. Her death was ruled a homicide.\n\nI think from the very get-go, there was only one suspect in this case … said Davis. … Carl Harris.\n\nThe couple had recently divorced, and Carl had a girlfriend.\n\nCarl Harris did have a reputation for being very violent in particular towards Tracey Harris, said Davis.\n\nAbout a dozen witnesses gave investigators statements describing Carl Harris's physical abuse of Tracey—something Carl denies.\n\nI never put my hands on Tracey ... Never, he told 48 Hours correspondent Maureen Maher.\n\nSo, all those people were lying? Maher asked. Yes, ma'am, he replied.\n\nTracey Harris, 22, was a young mother from Ozark, Alabama. She was a very sweet friend ... a very shy person, said friend Selina Dodson. ... people really liked her and respected her. Dale County District Attorney's Office\n\nDespite the suspicion, no arrest was made and the case languished. Then, in 2015, an Ozark Police cold case unit took another look at Tracey's murder, and again zeroed in on Carl.\n\nThe evidence was circumstantially strong, said Adams.\n\nMore than 26 years after Tracey Harris was killed, Carl Harris was arrested for her murder.\n\nThe prosecutors were confident in their case -- until they got in touch with a potential witness for the trial who would upend Carl Harris' murder trial just days before it was to start, and point prosecutors to the real killer.\n\nA HORRIFIC DISCOVERY\n\nTracey Harris, 22, disappeared on March 7, 1990.\n\nKirke Adams| Dale County District Attorney [by the river]: Tracey was alive when she came to this location and traveled down this access road to the beachy area.\n\nA week later, her body was found in the Choctawhatchee River, a few miles from her home in Ozark, Alabama. The area around the river was a place Tracey and her friends would get together.\n\nKirke Adams: It was certainly one of the first places that investigators were looking for Tracey. … Her body … had come to rest upon a log after the water started to recede a bit.\n\nThe autopsy revealed that Tracey had drowned, but also noted marks around her neck likely indicating strangulation. The missing person case became a homicide, and Ozark police started interviewing those close to Tracey and her ex-husband Carl, with whom she still lived.\n\nKirke Adams: Carl had let the police in his house a couple of times for them to look around.\n\nCarl was believed to have been the last person to see Tracey, picking her up the night she disappeared from the restaurant where she worked as a waitress. He then dropped Tracey off at their house and headed out to his job at a supermarket.\n\nKirke Adams: There were not any clues at home … It didn't appear that anybody had taken her by force.\n\nThe Choctawhatchee River was several miles away from Tracey Harris' house. Around the river was a sandy beach area where Tracey would get together with her friends, but friends say she would never get in the water because she didn't know how to swim Dale County Sheriff's Office\n\nPolice thought that location by the river might provide more clues. They learned that while Tracey might have enjoyed spending time by the river, she would never have gone in the river.\n\nKirke Adams: Every witness we spoke with, she could not swim. She was terrified of water.\n\nSelina Dodson: She was so scared of the water … when she was baptized and she went under, she was hysterical.\n\nSelina Dodson and Tracey were about 11 years old when baptized. They were childhood friends, spending a lot of time together at church. It was there she first saw Tracey with Carl.\n\nSelina Dodson: Tracey and Carl started dating when we were … probably 16, 17 years old. … I was happy for her that she had a boyfriend and somebody that she really liked.\n\nIn her senior year of high school, Tracey became pregnant, and she and Carl, who was three years older, married.\n\nSelina Dodson: When she had Carolyn, she was adorable … everybody just loved her. … She was like Tracey. She looked like her and she had a personality like her. … Tracey's mother, was taking care of Carolyn … You know young parents, you could tell, you know, that her and Carl, you know, struggled some.\n\nCarl and Tracey Harris with their daughter Carolyn. Carolyn Aznavour\n\nMaureen Maher: Tell me about your family as a young family, you and Tracey and Carolyn.\n\nCarl Harris: We was all happy and everything. … didn't have a problem with each other or nothing like that.\n\nThe picture Carl painted of a happy home though was not what police found when they started questioning friends and family.\n\nJordan Davis | Dale County Assistant District Attorney: There was about 14 different people that had come forward, that witnessed some types of domestic violence between Tracey and Carl.\n\nOne of those people was Dawn Beasley. She and her soon-to-be husband Jeff, who worked construction with Carl, lived with the Harrises for about a month.\n\nDawn Beasley: Tracey and I were a lot alike.\n\nDawn, who was pregnant at the time, and Tracey, a young mother, quickly became friends\n\nDawn Beasley: I think that she appreciated having someone, you know. Carl was real controlling and, you know he didn't want her to have a lot of friends.\n\nMaureen Maher: What did you see going on between Carl and Tracey?\n\nDawn Beasley: One time (we were sitting at the table and) … she told Carl, hey, listen, I'm going to need some money for the water bill. …And he flew into a rage. … He's got her bent over backwards with his hands around her throat.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did he verbally threaten her?\n\nDawn Beasley: He threatened to kill her in front of me … And I intervened. I'm telling him, let her go.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did she talk to you about it at all?\n\nDawn Beasley: Yes … She just wanted to be a family. … she felt like if she could just get through the rough stuff, you know, that it would be OK.\n\niDawn Beasley told police in 1990 that she had witnessed Carl abuse Tracey and that Carl threatened to kill Tracey in front of her. Carolyn Aznavour\n\nDawn told police about those altercations she said she saw -- and her feelings about Carl.\n\nDawn Beasley: Well, they asked me … so what do you know about Carl Harris? And I said, well, I know he's a rat bastard. … he was not good to Tracey … He asked me about fights I'd seen … and I made a statement. And I signed it. And every word of my statement was true.\n\nMaureen Maher: There are quite a few people who said that they saw you being abusive to Tracey. … Were you abusive to Tracey?\n\nCarl Harris: No, ma'am, I was not.\n\nDawn Beasley: We all saw it. … Everyone in town was talking about it. I did my grocery shopping … and I'm in the milk section and there's a couple standing there talking about it. The husband said, well, looks like that boy done finally killed that girl.\n\nDespite all the talk in town, Tracey never filed police reports about the alleged abuse.\n\nKirke Adams: Back then, the domestic violence law was much different … if the police arrived and nobody wanted to make a report … there was just no reports done.\n\nIt wasn't just stories about abuse that made law enforcement take a hard look at Carl there was that young girlfriend.\n\nJordan Davis: He did have a 17-year-old girlfriend at the time who several people said he had had conversations with about marrying her, but that she couldn't -- he couldn't leave Tracey because he'd have to pay child support.\n\nKirke Adams: He also made comments prior to her going missing and after including … come back whenever. Tracey won't be home.\n\nCarl admits to having a girlfriend and talking to her about Tracey but says any comments he made were misunderstood.\n\nCarl Harris: Honestly, wasn't any of their business\n\nMaureen Maher: You didn't tell anybody that she wasn't coming back?\n\nCarl Harris: No, ma'am, I never said that.\n\nJordan Davis: It was just so many things, most of all which were circumstantial, but they all pointed at Carl Harris.\n\nBut no arrest was made, and the case went cold. Carl claims through the years he occasionally called authorities to ask about the investigation, but they say otherwise.\n\nMaureen Maher: Has there ever been a time that Carl Harris said, I want you to find out who killed Tracey?\n\nKirke Adams: Never.\n\nMaureen Maher: Does that strike you as odd?\n\nKirke Adams: Strikes me as very odd.\n\nWHO KILLED TRACEY?\n\nSelina Dodson: A lot of people, you know, just assumed Carl would be arrested -- assumed he did it and were waiting for him to be arrested.\n\nFor years, Selina Dodson wondered if there would ever be justice for her friend Tracey Harris, who in 1990 was found murdered in Alabama's Choctawhatchee River. Selina's thoughts would often wander to Tracey and Carl's daughter.\n\nSelina Dodson: So, I would wonder, I wonder what happened to Carolyn. I wonder what she looks like. I wonder what she's doing.\n\nCarolyn was just 4 years old when she lost her mom. She was raised by her grandmother in Texas and didn't have contact with her father. Carolyn Aznavour\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: I was four years old when my mom was murdered … I was 4 or 5, I would cry nonstop if I would get in trouble … and say, I want my mom, I want my mom.\n\nCarolyn was immediately adopted by Tracey's mother. They soon left Ozark, hoping to start over, and moved to Texas.\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: I do not have any memories of her. ... Family would always bring up stories about her, how sweet she was, how shy she was. … We had pictures throughout the house.\n\nMaureen Maher: What did you grow up thinking happened to your mom?\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: I knew my mom was murdered … And then, as the years went on, I found out it had to do with my dad.\n\nMaureen Maher: What did people tell you about him?\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: I've always heard that he was very abusive towards my mom … that he was just a bad individual.\n\nTracey met Carl Harris when she was in high school. They married in her senior year in 1986. Their daughter, Carolyn, was born a few months later. Rumors about domestic violence in the couple's relationship spread around Ozark quickly. Dale County Sheriff's Office\n\nCarolyn had no interest in a relationship with her father, who she did not see while growing up. Her grandmother provided a loving a home and, Carolyn says, that was more than enough.\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: She was like the best. Like she did everything for me [crying].\n\nWhen Carolyn was about 21, she says Carl did reach out and they met, but did not talk about Tracey.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did you want to ask him about her?\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: Yeah, I've always wanted to ask questions, but the way that everybody portrayed him to be, I didn't think that he would tell me the truth.\n\nStill, Carolyn wondered about her mother – wanting to know what really happened.\n\nI have tried to piece it together … that's what I do -- I try to piece everything together and make it all make sense, said Carolyn Aznavour, Tracey Harris' daughter. CBS News\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: I have tried to piece it together … that's what I do -- I try to piece everything together and make it all make sense.\n\nJordan Davis: This was definitely something Carolyn was passionate about … she wanted some type of justice for her mom.\n\nWhen her grandmother died in 2015, Carolyn returned to Ozark to bury her next to her mother.\n\nShe started asking people in town what they knew about Tracey and the investigation.\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: And there was one lady. She said that her son happened to be best friends with the sheriff.\n\nCarolyn spoke with the sheriff, who put her in touch with the Ozark Police Department. At the same time, the cold case unit was starting to reopen the investigation. As it turned out, their No. 1 suspect had not changed.\n\nKirke Adams: There was nobody whose name had ever come up that had any reason to kill Tracey Harris. And I think when they reopened the case, they were just trying to prove Carl did it, not look for anybody else.\n\nJordan Davis: And so, they went back through all the witnesses that had given statements in 1990. … all the ones that they could find, they got back in touch with. … Most of them remembered their statements and told the investigators almost exactly what they did in 1990.\n\nAmong those who police went back and interviewed -- an acquaintance of Tracey and Carl's, and Tracey's aunt:\n\nWOMAN: He said, the police are so dumb, I can kill somebody and get away with it. TRACEY'S AUNT: Because it kind of shocked me, because he was saying, it was like he was smarter than the police, you know?\n\nInvestigators also tracked down that girlfriend of Carl's, who was 17 when Tracey was murdered.\n\nEX- GIRLFRIEND: I was a young, naive teenager… INVESTIGATOR: Did Carl at any time tell you that you didn't have to worry about Tracey showing up again to the house? EX-GIRLFRIEND: He could have … INVESTIGATOR: And when do you think he said that? EX-GIRLFRIEND: I don't know.\n\nAlthough she recalled little about her time with Carl, she did remember learning Tracey was dead …\n\nEX-GIRLFRIEND: I just couldn't believe that she was dead.\n\n… and the realization that, perhaps, her boyfriend was a murderer.\n\nEX-GIRLFRIEND: I just remember thinking that, you know, people were talking … and it even took me being questioned to even think that maybe he could have done it. … But after it all happened, we just stopped seeing each other.\n\nJordan Davis: There was also several people that they found since then that he had made statements to that were incriminating.\n\nWhile police were reinvestigating the case, Carl was trying to get on with his life. Several years after Tracey's murder, he had left Ozark, feeling like the cloud of suspicion had destroyed his life.\n\nCarl Harris: I had to go out of town to get jobs, where people don't know me.\n\nHe worked as a bouncer, in construction, had a girlfriend and another daughter. By 2016, he had moved to South Carolina, where investigators gave him a call.\n\nSeveral years after Tracey's murder, Carl Harris had left Ozark, feeling like the cloud of suspicion had destroyed his life. Everybody thought I killed her. Everywhere I turn, they you know, you hear them whispering in background, 'there's the man that killed Tracey. ' CBS News\n\nCarl Harris: I thought it was good news … I thought they found somebody they were looking at … And when they told me they was looking at me as a suspect again … they came up two weeks later, arresting me.\n\nMore than 26 years after Tracey Harris's body was found, Carl Harris was arrested on September 13, 2016 for her murder.\n\nDavid Harrison: There's absolutely no evidence at all that connects Carl Harris to this murder, none whatsoever.\n\nDavid Harrison is Carl's defense attorney. He says Carl's arrest was motivated by politics and nothing more.\n\nDavid Harrison: In 2016 … in this area … there were unsolved murders. They have a lot of political pressure to charge somebody … the environment of Ozark, Alabama was we need to do something.\n\nMaureen Maher: Were you worried that there was some new piece of evidence that they had?\n\nCarl Harris: No. I was never worried, never, because I was innocent.\n\nWhile Carl may not have been worried, there was someone who, for years, was: Dawn Beasley, that friend of Tracey's, who, with her then fiancé, briefly lived with the Harrises.\n\nDawn Beasley: Every time I would have a police officer get behind me I would wonder… is this where we're all of a sudden … they know what's happening. This is the moment.\n\nIN SEARCH OF ANSWERS\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: I've always wondered what happened to my mom since I can remember.\n\nFor decades, Carolyn wanted to know more about the 1990 murder of her mother, Tracey Harris. And in 2016, with the arrest of her estranged father Carl, Carolyn thought, finally, she would get some answers.\n\nMaureen Maher: How do you react when the thing you want is justice for your mom, but it's your dad who's been charged with her murder?\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: It's a relief that we found somebody. But then in the back of my mind, I'm like, was it really him? Could he have really done this? Why?\n\nAssistant D.A. Jordan Davis and District Attorney Kirke Adams CBS News\n\nMotive was also a question prosecutors Kirke Adams and Jordan Davis thought about, as they prepared their case against Carl.\n\nJordan Davis: I don't think there was one particular motive. I think that the domestic violence was definitely in the back of our heads … But also, the 17-year-old girlfriend that he had.\n\nBased mostly on statements from the interviews originally done back in 1990, an investigator from the Ozark police put together this scenario of what he thought happened the night Tracey went missing:\n\nIt was determined that Carl Harris left his job at Super Food [sic], sometime around 9 p.m. ... and went to his home … Carl Harris jumped on top of Tracey Harris and began chocking [sic] her … Carl Harris then placed her seemingly dead body into his vehicle and subsequently drove her to the Choctawhatchee River and placed her body into the water.\n\nPolice say Carl then picked up a friend, reportedly at 9:30 p.m. Making all those stops, Carl would have traveled about 20 miles.\n\nDavid Harrison: You can take all the statements of anybody you want to put together in this investigation here. There is no evidence whatsoever that that is true. … When you put the timeline in this case … Maureen, unless he was on a Learjet, that was impossible.\n\nDefense attorney David Harrison says the entire investigation is not just flawed, but that the police narrative is fabricated.\n\nDavid Harrison: This officer made this up to make this arrest.\n\nThe defense also offered up an alternate suspect: that friend police say Carl picked up the night Tracey disappeared named Bobby Herring.\n\nDavid Harrison: Bobby Herring … was convicted of raping a woman in a sister county.\n\nBut prosecutors say Herring had an alibi for the time Tracey was murdered. And they remained confident that Carl was their man.\n\nMaureen Maher: What's different in 2016 that wasn't there or obvious in 1990?\n\nKirke Adams: I think the major thing was getting these witnesses together, which is what we did for the grand jury presentation … And once you heard those people … It was very clear that Carl was violent. He had threatened Tracey. He had said … one of these days, I'm going to kill you. Those things just add up.\n\nAs they prepared for trial, Kirke and Jordan sifted through statements, looking for more potential witnesses to testify.\n\nJordan Davis: I was actually 3 when this happened, so from 1990 -- and we're trying to track down witnesses … We were dealing with people that had moved all over the country. Several had passed away … there was a lot to go through. So, we just kind of started with a long list … And we just started trying to narrow it down.\n\nThe prosecutors also visited the area around the river where Tracey's body was found.\n\nKirke Adams [at the river]: Part of our job is to paint that picture for a jury, and I think it is always important to try to get a feel for the area.\n\nThey spent time on the bridge where police believed Carl threw Tracey into the river.\n\nKirke Adams [standing on the bridge]: This location is approximately 7 miles from where Carl and Tracey Harris lived, it's very quiet, very rural.\n\nThey also went to the area under the bridge where people would sometimes gather.\n\nKirke Adams: There's a lot of graffiti under this bridge -- a lot of names as well.\n\nPutting the case together was an arduous process -- one filled with continuances and delays. Carl Harris was out on bail, having spent two-and-a-half weeks in jail after his arrest. As confident as the prosecution was, so was the defense.\n\nDavid Harrison: I've tried 140 criminal jury trials. I know a bad one from a good one, and they never had a shot with this case.\n\nMaureen Maher: But they maintain that the case was … specifically built on the statements of all the people who said that they saw Carl being abusive to his wife, his strange behavior afterwards. Was that a concern for you as you were preparing a defense?\n\nDavid Harrison: Never, never. Because the credibility of the people that were going to testify … they had no credibility, none whatsoever.\n\nBut Carolyn, who traveled to Ozark for every single hearing, was convinced of her father's guilt.\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: I was ready to put him behind bars -- ready to see it happen.\n\nFinally, more than three years after Carl's arrest, the trial was scheduled for January 13, 2020. The week before trial, Jordan continued to scour over old witness reports, deciding who should testify. That's when one statement from 1990, not followed up on, caught her attention.\n\nJordan Davis: The one in particular that we found that they hadn't talked to in 2016 was this Dawn Hulbert now Beasley. … And she had witnessed domestic violence while living in their home. What we thought was interesting was that she had witnessed it in the same manner as how Tracey was actually killed.\n\nAs prosecutors prepared for trial, Dawn Beasley's statement from 1990, not followed up on, caught prosecutor Jordan Davis' attention. Dale County District Attorney's Office/CBS News\n\nIt took Jordan several calls to wrong phone numbers to find Dawn Beasley.\n\nDawn Beasley: And she says … My name is Jordan Davis, I'm with Dale County D.A. … this is about Carl and Tracey Harris.\n\nDawn, who had moved away from Ozark and was now divorced, says she didn't even know there was an arrest for the murder of her friend Tracey, until that call.\n\nDawn Beasley: They asked me … we need you to testify. And I said, no, I can't possibly do that. My job is very stressful.\n\nJordan Davis: I texted her the next morning and said, … We really would like for you to come. … she texted me back … and said that she was going to decline our invitation … that she couldn't help us.\n\nMaureen Maher: So, Jordan, for you … This wasn't an invitation. This is a murder trial.\n\nJordan Davis Right … I was aggravated … I simply got a subpoena ready, and we gave it to our investigators the next day. … And she made a scene and was very dramatic.\n\nDawn Beasley: I was very unhappy. I said, you're ruining my life and you don't understand why. You guys don't want me to testify.\n\nA SECRET REVEALED\n\nDawn Beasley: It was unbelievable to me that I should end up … with this incredible secret.\n\nDawn Beasley's secret weighed on her when she was asked to testify in the 2020 murder trial of Carl Harris. Dawn refused to come, saying she was too busy. Then, after being subpoenaed, she called prosecutor Jordan Davis again.\n\nDawn Beasley: I told Jordan, I have given you … completely honest reasons why I don't want to testify, but … the most important reason I can't testify is because you have an innocent man on trial.\n\nJordan Davis: I thought, wow … she's coming up with a crazy story as to why she can't get here.\n\nDawn Beasley: And she said, well, how do you know he's innocent? I know he's innocent because the man that did commit the crime … confessed it to me the night he did it. …That's my ex-husband, Jeff Beasley.\n\nDawn Beasley revealed to ADA Jordan Davis that her ex-husband was Tracey Harris' killer. CBS News\n\nDawn told Jordan about the night of March 7, 1990, when Tracey went missing. Dawn, about to celebrate her 21st birthday the next day, was pregnant with her first child. Her fiancé, Jeff, came home, waking her in the middle of the night.\n\nDawn Beasley: And he said, I accidentally hurt her and now she's dead. Who? Tracey. … What happened? … I went over to Carl's to talk to Carl, Carl wasn't there. I talked to Tracey. I tried to talk her into leaving him. She got mad at me. We had a fight. We tussled and I accidentally hurt her and now she's dead.\n\nDawn Beasley: He said he took her down to the river because he didn't want them to come home and find her body.\n\nDawn says she told Jeff they needed to go to the police, but he insisted they keep quiet.\n\nDawn Beasley: I had an impossible choice to make … And I really struggled … Tracey deserves justice. … But the cost was going to be so high.\n\nMaureen Maher: What was the cost going to be, if you went to the police?\n\nDawn Beasley: I was going to have to throw my entire life away. I'm about to get married, I'm pregnant … This baby deserves a chance at a life with a loving family and a mom and a dad.\n\nAnd so, Dawn made her decision. She would stay quiet, she says, out of her desire to keep her life intact, and also out of fear that police might not believe her.\n\nDawn Beasley: They're going to ask him some questions. He's going to deny it. … Then what happens to me?\n\nDawn says she was honest when police questioned her after Tracey's body was found and described the abuse -- seeing Carl grab Tracey by the throat and threaten to kill her.\n\nDawn Beasley: And every word of my statement was true. They just never asked me, who do you think did it? … I walked out, and I do remember the sense of relief because I hadn't actually had to lie.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did it feel like you were lying, though, by not telling them?\n\nDawn Beasley: Sure … I've gone back, Maureen, and questioned that decision over and over and over and over and over again.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did you feel badly at all that he was under such scrutiny and suspicion?\n\nDawn Beasley: I would like to say that I did, but I didn't. Carl made Tracey miserable.\n\nWhile Ozark police questioned Dawn, they never got a statement from Jeff, even though they both spent time together living with the Harrises.\n\nJordan Davis: They had a statement from Dawn and that was things that they had witnessed while living in the home together. I'm sure they thought that Jeff's statement would be very similar to Dawn's.\n\nI never talked about it ever to another living soul, not even Jeff, Dawn Beasley said of her ex-husband's confession the night Tracey died.\n\nBut Jeff Beasley should have raised some red flags for police; he had a criminal record. Dawn met Jeff shortly after he was released from prison, having served four years for burglary and escape attempts. But Dawn was willing to overlook his criminal past, and the information about killing Tracey, as they married and started their own family, keeping the secret to themselves.\n\nDawn Beasley: I never talked about it ever to another living soul, not even Jeff.\n\nMaureen Maher: You and Jeff never talked about it ever again?\n\nDawn Beasley: Never once.\n\nMaureen Maher: You just pulled a dark curtain over and that was it? It was done?\n\nDawn Beasley: We just pretended it never happened.\n\nMaureen Maher: Were you ever concerned that you might get into trouble having not gone to the police right from the beginning?\n\nDawn Beasley: Sure. Yeah, of course.\n\nDawn says she worried, yet life proceeded, mostly, as if nothing had happened. Dawn and Jeff would have another child. Her growing family eventually made her think of Tracey's daughter, Carolyn.\n\nDawn Beasley [crying]: I should have been sorry for Carolyn and I was sorry for me.\n\nEven after Jeff was arrested again, in 1991 for burglary, and spent 5 years in prison, Dawn kept the secret, wanting her family life to be normal when he got out.\n\nDawn Beasley: Jeff comes home from prison … But very quickly I realize that this is not going to be what I anticipated it was going to be.\n\nDawn claims Jeff became abusive. After 13 years of marriage and four children, she and Jeff divorced. And as time went on, she did think about ways to tell authorities what she knew.\n\nDawn Beasley: Maybe I do it on my deathbed. Maybe I make an anonymous phone call. Maybe I write a letter.\n\nBut, she says, the fear of upending her own children's lives always stopped her. That, however, changed with Jordan's insistence that she testify at Carl's murder trial. She dreaded what she had to do -- tell her adult children that their father killed someone, and that she kept it quiet for 30 years.\n\nDawn Beasley: The only thing I was ever afraid of was how they were going to respond, and they responded with support and love and understanding.\n\nMeanwhile, the prosecutors, on the Friday before the start of the trial, were also processing what Dawn had just told them.\n\nKirke Adams: I knew we couldn't have a trial Monday because we had to figure out what's going on here.\n\nJeff Beasley's name, until they spoke to Dawn, was unfamiliar. But they did remember something from that trip to the river where Tracey's body was found.\n\nKirke Adams [at the bridge]: While we were here, we were looking under the bridge. And in big, huge spray paint letters was the last name Beasley.\n\nTo prepare for trial, investigators went back to the scene where Tracey Harris' body was found. They found the name Beasley spray-painted in big letters. Prosecutors do not know why or who spray-painted the name under the bridge. CBS News\n\nKirke Adams: But it doesn't mean anything at that time because on the statement Dawn's name was Dawn Hulbert. It didn't even say Beasley.\n\nProsecutors do not know why or who spray-painted the name Beasley under the bridge.\n\nCarl Harris's trial was put on hold. Police tracked down his old friend Jeff Beasley, who was living in Ozark, working as a trucker, and brought him in for questioning.\n\nJEFF BEASLEY [Interrogation]: I'm being accused of, of, of murder, of, of taking someone's life -- I couldn't. I wouldn't.\n\nTHE REAL KILLER EMERGES\n\nKirke Adams: Can we really do this? Can we really solve this for Carolyn? Can we really give her peace?\n\nProsecutors Kirke Adams and Jordan Davis spent more than three delay-filled years putting together their case, seeking justice for Tracey Harris. Now, with Dawn Beasley's revelation that her ex-husband Jeff told her that he killed Tracey, they hoped to learn the truth.\n\nINVESTIGATOR: Did you hurt Tracey in any way? JEFF BEASLEY: No.\n\nJeff Beasley had not only agreed to talk to investigators, but also, to take a lie detector test:\n\nINVESTIGATOR: Are you the person that caused the death of Tracey Harris that night?\n\nHe maintained his innocence, even after being told he failed the polygraph.\n\nJEFF BEASLEY: I didn't, I didn't do this. This was not me.\n\nFor more than four hours, Beasley insisted he had nothing to do with Tracey's death:\n\nJEFF BEASLEY: It seem like you guys are wanting me to say I did something, when I didn't … INVESTIGATOR: I'm not, I'm not going to put a word in your mouth. Only you know. And that's what I need. JEFF BEASLEY: I don't know …\n\nAnd then:\n\nJEFF BEASLEY: I want it done.\n\nHe confessed, claiming he and Tracey were having an affair.\n\nJEFF BEASLEY: We went down to the river. JEFF BEASLEY: She said she was leaving Carl and wanted me to leave Dawn and I wouldn't. And said she was telling Dawn.\n\nJeff Beasley confesses to the 1990 murder of Tracey Harris. Dale County District Attorney's Office\n\nJeff said he and Tracey had been wading in the river.\n\nJEFF BEASLEY: And we got into an argument. We was in the river. INVESTIGATOR: So, tell me what happened. JEFF BEASLEY: She went down and didn't come back up.\n\nBut some things in Beasley's story were not adding up. Dawn said Jeff had told her that Tracey and he fought at the Harris home. And those who knew Tracey, did not believe she was having an affair.\n\nKirke Adams: Not one witness we had ever mentioned that she was possibly seeing someone else because it was clear from the witnesses that Carl wouldn't allow that.\n\nDawn Beasley: I cannot imagine that she was cheating, with Jeff or anyone else. … He told me it was an accident, you know? But … Now, sitting here … I think that … maybe he hit on her, maybe she rebuffed his advances, maybe she said, I'm going to tell her. … And maybe he freaked out and made sure she wasn't going to ruin his family.\n\nAnd there was the issue of why Tracey, known to be terrified of water, would voluntarily go in the river.\n\nINVESTIGATOR: Everybody in the case who knew Tracey says she was scared of water. JEFF BEASLEY: No, we went to the river a couple of times.\n\nThey also wanted Jeff to explain those bruises the autopsy noted on Tracey's neck -- marks authorities felt were consistent with strangulation.\n\nINVESTIGATOR: One of the pathologist's reports said that she was possibly strangled. JEFF BEASLEY: I didn't strangle her. … I remember taking her, pushing her under water …I mean if the autopsy says it, I don't, I guess … INVESTIGATOR: Was it an accident? JEFF BEASLEY: Yeah. I would hope. Yeah.\n\nBut police and prosecutors did not believe it was an accident, and Jeff Beasley was charged with the murder of Tracey Harris.\n\nKirke Adams: He confessed … in a way that matches the evidence … I don't know how many times that happens -- when you get a confession from the real killer technically 17-18 hours before trial.\n\nThe DA's broke the news to Carolyn.\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: Jordan called me to come to the police station, that they had to tell me something. … And I broke. … We finally did it. We finally found out who killed my mom.\n\nKirke Adams: You could just see so many emotions going through her … she'd been told all her life, your dad did this … But to find out he didn't do it, you could tell not only was she relieved … but you could tell she was so grateful that somebody had solved this case.\n\nOn January 13, 2020, the day prosecutors had planned to be in court starting Carl Harris's trial, instead, they held a press conference.\n\nDA KIRKE ADAMS [to reporters]: - I have dismissed the murder case against Carl Harris. … An arrest has been made of 54-year-old Jeff Beasley of Ozark with the murder of Tracey Harris.\n\nKirke Adams: It hurt our pride that we had the wrong person … you've got to, you know, check your ego at the door, because what's important is the right person got charged.\n\nCarl Harris heard the news that he was a free man from his attorney.\n\nCarl Harris: It just blows my mind. … I was happy that I was standing my ground and I was telling the truth the whole time and they finally caught the boy who did it.\n\nBeasley pleaded guilty and received a 30-year sentence.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did you ever consider filing charges against Dawn?\n\nKirke Adams: No.\n\nMaureen Maher: There are a lot of people who are going to say, maybe she should be charged with something.\n\nJordan Davis: I think it was extremely difficult for her to come forward. … But the fact is she could have kept that secret for forever. She could have come up here and -- she could have lied on the stand.\n\nKirke Adams: The goal was to find the truth and to seek justice for Tracy Harris, and ultimately Dawn did that.\n\nMaureen Maher: Was there any relief for you after all this time?\n\nDawn Beasley: It was extraordinary relief\n\nCarl Harrison, with his attorney David Harrison, filed notice that he plans to sue the City of Ozark for $6 million for damages including false imprisonment, and pain and suffering. CBS News\n\nFor Carl Harris, his relief is mixed with anger. Along with his attorney David Harrison, they held their own press conference.\n\nDAVID HARRISON [to reporters]: I think it's negligence. I think its incompetence … We're talking about an innocent man.\n\nAlleging that police fabricated information, like that investigator's report describing how Carl killed Tracey, Carl filed notice that he plans to sue the City of Ozark for $6 million for damages including false imprisonment, and pain and suffering. 48 Hours wanted to ask Ozark police about the investigation, but they declined, citing the pending claim.\n\nJordan Davis: We were mortified that we were that close to putting the wrong man on trial. … we were very confident that we would be able to get a conviction in this case. … I do think about that all the time. And that's kind of nauseating, to be honest, that we were that close. … And I think we definitely learned a lesson with this case.\n\nTracey Harris's murder 30 years ago has left many wondering what might have been -- especially Carolyn. She still has no relationship with Carl.\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: Carl has not come forward and actually been truthful to me about the abuse. And I can't forgive him if he can't be man enough to look at me and tell me what he did and that he's sorry for it.\n\nCarolyn's focus remains on the mother she never had the chance to get to know.\n\nCarolyn Aznavour [in tears]: Everybody I've talked to said that she was so quiet. She was so modest. She was the sweetest person that they've ever met.\n\nMaureen Maher: Do you wonder what your mom would be like today?\n\nCarolyn Aznavour: Every day. Every day.\n\nDawn reached out to Carolyn to apologize.\n\nCarolyn responded, but says she isn't ready to talk.\n\nProduced by Ruth Chenetz. Michelle Sigona is the development producer.

What kind of ring does a billionaire get for his fiancee?\n\nAsk Mariah Carey, who just got engaged to her Australian businessman boyfriend, James Packer, reports ET. He got her a 35-carat diamond ring -- that's bigger than both Kim Kardashian West's and Beyonce's rings combined. Vogue has a photo of the ring, if you want to see what a 35-carat rock looks like.\n\nIt's certainly not the first expensive gift Packer has given the diva; she wore a blinged-out Van Cleef & Arpels necklace to an interview with Steve Harvey back in November. The 45-year-old singer said that she and Packer, 48, hit it off when they met in Aspen at the Hercules premiere. Packer's net worth is valued at $3.5 billion.\n\nCarey and Packer made their first red carpet appearance at The Intern premiere in September.\n\nJames was leading Mariah through the theatre room and had his hand on her back. Mariah looked very proud to be there with James, an eyewitness told ET at the time. He seemed a little more under the radar than she is but looked at her very adoringly and happy.\n\nIt will be the third marriage for both Packer and Carey. Packer has three children from his marriage to Australian model and singer Erica Baxter, and Carey has 4-year-old twins with ex-husband Nick Cannon.\n\nIt's safe to say Carey won't be on Match.com anymore.
BOSTON - Bill Cosby's wife refused to answer dozens of questions during a combative deposition in a defamation lawsuit filed by seven women who say the comedian branded them liars after they accused him of sexually assaulting them decades ago, according to a transcript released Friday.\n\nCamille Cosby was subjected to intense questioning by the women's lawyer, who repeatedly pressed her to say whether she believes her husband acted with a lack of integrity during their 52-year marriage. The lawyer also asked if her husband used his position and power to manipulate young women.\n\nCamille Cosby did not answer those questions and many others after her lawyer cited marital privilege, the legal protection given to communications between spouses.\n\nAbout 50 women have publicly accused Bill Cosby of forcing unwanted sexual contact on them decades ago. Cosby has denied the allegations. He faces a criminal case in Pennsylvania, where prosecutors have charged him with sexually violating a former Temple University employee, Andrea Constand. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nCamille Cosby answered questions in the deposition on Feb. 22 and again on April 19 after her lawyers argued unsuccessfully to stop it. A judge ruled that she would have to give a deposition but said she could refuse to answer questions about private communications between her and her husband.\n\nCamille Cosby's lawyer, Monique Pressley, repeatedly cited that privilege and advised her not to answer many questions asked by the women's lawyer, Joseph Cammarata. The exchanges between Cammarata and Cosby became testy at times, and she admonished him: Don't lecture me. Just keep going with the questions.\n\nUsing a transcript of a deposition Bill Cosby gave in a civil lawsuit filed by Constand in 2005 and a transcript of an interview she gave to Oprah Winfrey in 2000, Cammarata asked Camille Cosby about extramarital affairs her husband had.\n\nWere you aware of your husband setting up trusts for the benefit of women that he had a sexual relationship with? Cammarata asked.\n\nShe didn't answer after her lawyer cited marital privilege.\n\nCammarata asked her about Shawn Thompson, a woman who said Bill Cosby fathered her daughter, Autumn Jackson, in the 1970s. Jackson was convicted in 1997 of attempting to extort money from Bill Cosby to prevent her from telling a tabloid she's his daughter. He acknowledged that he had an affair with her mother and had given her money.\n\nWas it a big deal when this came up in the 1970s that your husband had - big deal to you that your husband had an extramarital affair and potentially had a daughter from that extramarital affair? Cammarata asked.\n\nIt was a big deal then, yes, Camille Cosby replied.\n\nThe Cosbys have a home in Shelburne Falls, about an hour's drive from Springfield, where the lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages, was filed. They have four children; a fifth died.\n\nAn attorney handling a separate lawsuit against Bill Cosby revealed Friday that Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner provided sworn testimony on Wednesday.\n\nIn the sexual battery lawsuit filed in Los Angeles, Judy Huth says Cosby forced her to perform a sex act on him at the Playboy Mansion around 1974, when she was 15 years old.\n\nBill Cosby's former lawyers have accused Huth of attempting to extort him before filing the case and have tried unsuccessfully to have it dismissed. Huth's attorney, Gloria Allred, said Hefner's testimony will remain under seal for now.\n\nHefner also was named as a defendant in a case filed Monday by former model Chloe Goins, who accuses Bill Cosby of drugging and sexually abusing her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008.\n\nThe Associated Press generally doesn't identify people who say they're victims of sexual abuse, but the women accusing Cosby have come forward to tell their stories.
Fox News host Tucker Carlson is facing new pressure after transcriptions of past radio appearances were published in which he compared women to dogs and described them as extremely primitive.\n\nThe radio interview transcriptions were published by Media Matters for America, a liberal-leaning nonprofit group that monitors politically conservative media. Carlson made the comments between 2006 and 2011, when he called into shock-jock radio program Bubba the Love Sponge, the group said.\n\nThe comments sparked new calls for an advertising boycott of Carlson's show. The controversy comes only months after his show lost sponsors following the conservative host's comments about immigrants making the U.S. poorer and dirtier. At the time, advertisers including personal finance website NerdWallet and Pacific Life insurance pulled spots from the show.\n\nCarlson, who defended his track record in a tweet, said he wouldn't give the usual ritual contrition after his previous comments about women surfaced. Instead, he invited viewers to watch his show to understand how he thinks.\n\nOn Monday, consumers posted lists of his show's advertisers, citing Allstate and AstraZeneca among them. Some wrote to Carlson's advertisers directly on Twitter, asking why they were supporting the conservative host. Allstate didn't immediately return requests for comment.\n\nAstraZeneca said it stopped advertising on Carlson's program earlier this year. We will not be advertising on this program in the future, the company said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nHe should be fired by @FoxNews & the companies advertising during his show should boycott — immediately! one consumer wrote on Twitter.\n\nCarlson's comments on Bubba the Love Sponge overlaps with his hiring at Fox News in 2009. During his radio appearances, he used misogynistic terms to describe women as a gender and to single out specific women, such as singer Britney Spears, politician Hillary Clinton and journalist Arianna Huffington. Carlson also made comments that appeared to minimize statutory rape and underage marriage.\n\nBelow are some of Carlson's comments, transcribed by Media Matters for America, that are triggering calls for an advertiser boycott:
Helen Viola Jackson's 1936 marriage to James Bolin was unusual to say the least: He was 93 and in declining health, and she was a 17-year-old schoolgirl.\n\nBolin was also a Civil War veteran who fought for the Union in the border state of Missouri. Jackson was almost certainly the last remaining widow of a Civil War soldier when she died Dec. 16 at a nursing home in Marshfield, Missouri. She was 101.\n\nHelen Viola Jackson is shown this April 2017 photo. Nicholas Inman / AP\n\nSeveral Civil War heritage organizations have recognized Jackson's quiet role in history, one that she hid for all but the final three years of her life, said Nicholas Inman, her pastor and longtime friend. Yet in those final years, Inman said, Jackson embraced the recognition that included a spot on the Missouri Walk of Fame and countless cards and letters from well-wishers.\n\nIt was sort of a healing process for Helen: that something she thought would be kind of a scarlet letter would be celebrated in her later years, Inman said.\n\nJackson grew up one of 10 children in the tiny southwestern Missouri town of Niangua, near Marshfield. Bolin, a widower who had served as a private in the 14th Missouri Cavalry during the Civil War seven decades earlier, lived nearby.\n\nJackson's father volunteered his teenage daughter to stop by Bolin's home each day to provide care and help with chores. To pay back her kindness, Bolin offered to marry Jackson, which would allow her to receive his soldier's pension after his death, a compelling offer in the context of the Great Depression.\n\nJackson agreed in large part because she felt her daily care was prolonging his life, Inman said.\n\nThey wed on Sept. 4, 1936, at his home. Throughout their three years of marriage there was no intimacy and she never lived with him. She never told her parents, her siblings or anyone else about the wedding. She never remarried, spending decades harboring this secret that had to be eating her alive, Inman said.\n\nAfter Bolin's death in 1939, she did not seek his pension.\n\nShe also realized the stigma and potential scandal of a teenager wedding a man in his 90s, regardless of her reason. In an oral history recording in 2018, Jackson said she never spoke of the wedding to protect Bolin's reputation as well as her own.\n\nI had great respect for Mr. Bolin, and I did not want him to be hurt by the scorn of wagging tongues, she said.\n\nInman and Jackson were longtime friends. She was a charter member of the Methodist church where he serves as pastor. One day in December 2017, she told Inman about her secret marriage to a much older man. She mentioned in passing that he fought in the Civil War.\n\nI said, 'What? Back up about that. What do you mean he was in the Civil War?' Inman said.\n\nInman checked into her story and found that everything she told him was spot on. Officials at Wilson's Creek National Battlefield sent him copies of Bolin's service information. She identified where he was buried, in Niangua.\n\nShe also kept a Bible that he gave her - in which he wrote about their marriage. Those written words were good enough for the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War and other heritage organizations to recognize Jackson's place in history.\n\nAfter a lifetime of avoiding her past, Jackson embraced it in her final years, Inman said. She spoke to schoolchildren and had a Facebook page dedicated to her. She enjoyed getting cards and letters.\n\nShe also found new peace. A stoic nature that kept her from shedding tears at her own siblings' funerals seemed to evaporate.\n\nAfter Bolin's relatives found out about Jackson's role in his life, they went to the nursing home and presented her with a framed photo of him.\n\nShe broke down and cried, Inman recalled. She kept touching the frame and said, 'This is the only man who ever loved me.'
The parents of Joycelyn Savage, one of two young women in a relationship with R. Kelly, held a press conference Wednesday morning claiming Kelly lied in his interview with CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King. They reiterated their belief that the R&B singer has kept their daughter estranged from her family for two years.\n\nJoycelyn, we went from seeing you, talking to you weekly, to not seeing you for two years, her mother, Jonjelyn Savage, said during the press conference in Decatur, Georgia. So that is a clear indication to us, and as a mother, that something is definitely wrong with this situation.\n\nThe allegations Mr. Kelly has brought against my family is very horrific, Joycelyn's father, Timothy Savage, said. We are a solid family, we care about our daughter. From day one the only thing we wanted to do was actually to see our daughter, hear from our daughter, and make sure she's fine.\n\nKelly is currently in a relationship with 23-year-old Savage and 21-year-old Azriel Clary. Both of them live with Kelly at his Chicago home. The parents of both women believe the 52-year-old R&B star has brainwashed their daughters into being a part of his alleged sex cult. In an earlier statement released to the public, the Clary family attorney called Kelly a liar, manipulator and sociopath.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CBS This Morning's Gayle King that aired Wednesday, Kelly said he met Joycelyn Savage after her father brought her to one of his concerts when she was 19.\n\nI didn't go looking for a Joycelyn Savage. I was doing my show ... he brought her and asked a friend of mine to put her on the stage with R. Kelly, make sure she's on the stage, he said.\n\nThat is absolutely not true, the Savage family attorney Gerald Griggs said Wednesday morning during the press conference, stating, that at no point has Mr. Kelly ever met Mr. Timothy Savage.\n\nKelly was indicted February 22 and turned himself in to Chicago police. He was charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving four victims, three of whom were underage. He is being prosecuted by the Cook County state's attorney. Sources tell CBS News federal and state authorities in at least two states — New York and Illinois — are now investigating a variety of allegations.\n\nAllegations of sexual abuse have trailed Kelly over the past 25 years. He married the late singer Aaliyah in 1994 when he was 27 and she 15; it was later discovered that she lied and listed her age on the marriage certificate as 18. The marriage was annulled in 1995. Kelly settled out of court with three different women in 1996, 2001 and 2002 over claims he had sexual relationships with them when they were minors.\n\nIn 2002, Kelly was indicted on 21 counts of child pornography for participating with a minor in a sex tape. After years of delays and a reduction to 14 counts, in 2008 Kelly was found not guilty of all charges after the jury deliberated for a day.\n\nThe recent Lifetime series Surviving R. Kelly drew new attention to the years of allegations against him. The Savage and Clary families fear his relationships with the two women, nearly 30 years younger than him, are cause for concern.\n\nWe are in a battle to make sure she is not a victim to the allegations that we've heard and now the charges that we've heard against Robert Sylvester Kelly, Griggs said Wednesday, as the Savage family stood beside him.\n\nWhen Gayle King asked Kelly about the families' claims, Kelly pointed the finger right back at them.\n\nYou're with two women right now. You love them, they say they love you. What kind of love is it that keeps these young women away from their families? King asked in the CBS This Morning interview.\n\nI'm going to answer your question. What kind of father, what kind of mother, will sell their daughter to a man? Kelly said.\n\nAsked by King if he was saying that Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage's parents handed their daughters over to him, Kelly said, Absolutely. Are the cameras still going? Absolutely.\n\nHe also said, How come it was OK for me to see them until they wasn't getting no money from me? Why would you take your daughter — if I'm going to take my daughter and she's 19 years old to a 49-year-old icon, whatever, celebrity or R. Kelly concert or whoever it is, I'm not going to put her on the stage and leave her. I'm going to take her to the concert. Their father is more into my music and know about my music than they do.\n\nThe Savage family denied being in it for the money.\n\nWe want the record to remain clear that at no point did Tim, Jonjelyn Savage ever request, ever demand, ever receive any financial compensation from Robert Sylvester Kelly, Griggs said during his press conference with the family.
Did an item found in many medicine cabinets lead to a homicide?\n\n\n\n\n\nMario Muñoz/ Muñoz Photography After a millionaire is poisoned with eye drops, his death is ruled a homicide. Did this inspire a copycat crime? Lana and Steve Clayton had been married for five years, and were living in Lake Wylie, S.C. According to Steve's family they had a loving marriage.\n\nMount Vernon Replica CBS News The Clayton's lived on waterfront property in this home, modeled after President George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate.\n\nA Horrifying Discovery Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office On Saturday July 21, 2018, Lana Clayton says she walked inside after mowing the lawn and discovered her husband unresponsive at the bottom of these stairs.\n\nLeading up to Steve's Death Rosie Clayton-Leslie Lana said Steve had been ill and bedridden with vertigo for three days.\n\nWhat Killed Steve Clayton? Willy Thompson/ York County Solicitor's Office Lana wondered if Steve had fallen down the stairs, but the coroner saw no signs of a fall and ruled it a natural death resulting from a possible heart attack.\n\nStrange Evidence Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office Steve's nephew, Nick French, came to the scene on the day Steve died. Nick — a police officer in a nearby town — did a walkthrough of the house and found it odd that Steve's bed was soaked with urine.\n\nSuspicions Mount CBS News Steve's nephews, Nick French and Kris Phagan, sensed something was not right. Steve's cell phone was also missing.\n\nDocuments Destroyed Rosie Clayton-Leslie The morning after Steve's death, neighbors told Steve's nephews they watched Lana setting a fire in the backyard fire pit. Kris believes this is where Steve's will was destroyed.\n\nA Call To The Coroner CBS News When Steve's family learned Lana had requested a cremation, they immediately called the coroner's office. They say if they hadn't requested an autopsy and toxicology report they may have never discovered the truth about Steve's death.\n\nA Strange Substance CBS News The toxicology report revealed there was an extremely large amount of tetrahydrozoline in Steve's blood. Tetrahydrozoline, known as THZ, is a chemical found in many over-the-counter eye drops. The coroner ruled this was not a natural death. Pictured is toxicologist Demi Garvin, left, and Coroner Sabrina Gast.\n\nLana's Eye Drop Knowledge Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office On August 29, 2018, a little over a month after Steve's death, Lana was interviewed by the York County coroner. When the coroner brought up THZ, Lana knew right away this was a chemical in Visine.\n\nClues At The Mansion Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office Investigators found Visine in the Clayton home. During her interview, Lana said Steve liked to put Visine in his coffee to help him go to the bathroom. She said he had been doing it for years, a statement that seemed very odd to the coroner.\n\nA Surprising Admission Willy Thompson/York County Solicitor's Office Lana returned home later that day where investigators say she made a stunning admission: she confessed to a York County sheriff's detective that she had put Visine in Steve's water. She even said she wanted him to suffer. She was arrested the following day.\n\nA Copycat Case?

Hunsucker is awaiting a trial date. His attorney says his client is innocent and the allegations will be strenuously opposed.
Former Republican Representative Aaron Schock, who had voted against LGBT protections while in Congress, came out as gay Thursday in a post on his website. The one-time Illinois congressman said he would be fighting for LGBT rights now if he was still in office.\n\nI am gay, Schock, 38, wrote in the lengthy post.\n\nThe fact that I am gay is just one of those things in my life in need of explicit affirmation, to remove any doubt and to finally validate who I am as a person. In many ways, I regret the time wasted in not having done so sooner.\n\nThe post describes Schock's religious upbringing in the rural Midwest and how he didn't want to think about his sexual orientation as he grew up. I always preferred to force my thoughts in other directions, leaving a final answer about that for another day, he said.\n\nSchock represented Illinois' 18th congressional district from 2009 to 2015, when he left office over a spending scandal that led to federal charges which were eventually dropped. He was only 27 when he entered office, making him the youngest person in Congress.\n\nDuring his tenure, Schock voted against several LGBT protections, including the legalization of gay marriage, the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell military policy and an amendment to federal hate crime laws covering sexual orientation and gender identity. In a study of lawmakers' support for LGBT causes, the Human Rights Campaign gave Schock a score of zero.\n\nSchock also earned notoriety in Congress for his media profile, which included appearing on TMZ, posting workout photos on Instagram and showing off his six-pack abs on a Men's Health cover that called him America's fittest congressman. There were rumors at the time that Schock was gay, which he denied, saying the speculation was not worthy of further response.\n\nIn his coming out post, Schock did not apologize for his votes or further explain them. But he said other gay people in politics had cautioned him about what to expect when he comes out. Where was I, they will ask, when I was in a position to help advance issues important to gay Americans? he wrote.\n\nThe truth is that if I were in Congress today, I would support LGBTQ rights in every way I could, Schock added. I realize that some of my political positions run very much counter to the mainstream of the LGBTQ movement, and I respect them for those differences. I hope people will allow for me the same.\n\nSchock said his family disowned him when he came out and still sends him emails about conversion therapy, but his mother appeared to become more accepting and he was optimistic about his future.\n\nSchock resigned in March 2015 amid scrutiny over his lavish spending with taxpayer and campaign money, which he used for expenses like private flights, Super Bowl tickets and remodeling his congressional office with a Downton Abbey theme.\n\nA federal grand jury in November 2016 indicted him on 24 counts, including theft of government funds and filing false tax returns. Schock reached an agreement with prosecutors in March 2019 to drop the charges if he paid back his taxes and reimbursed his campaign. Schock said after the agreement that he was not ruling out a return to politics.
Ewan McGregor and his wife, Eve Mavrakis, have reportedly split after 22 years of marriage. The couple have four children together.\n\nPeople reports that McGregor and Mavrakis have been separated since May. Over the weekend, The Sun published photos of McGregor and his Fargo co-star, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, kissing in London.\n\nWinstead and her husband Riley Stears announced their breakup in May, after being married for seven years. At the time, Winstead said the split was amicable.\n\nWe have spent our lives together and it has been full of joy and warmth every day, Wintead wrote in a now-deleted Instagram post that included a photo of herself kissing Stears on the cheek. We've decided to move on from our marriage, but we will stay best friends and collaborators for all our days. We are still ride or die, just in a different way now. I love you always, Riley.\n\nMcGregor and Mavrakis, a production designer, married in 1995.

A priest in Rhode Island, Reverend Richard Bucci, made national headlines last week by banning lawmakers who supported the state's abortion rights bill from receiving communion at his parish. Now, he is doubling down on that decision with a statement that's sending shockwaves through social media.\n\nThe 72-year-old priest recently passed out fliers to parishioners listing the names of all 44 members of the legislature who voted for the Reproductive Privacy Act, which was signed into law last spring. The flier stated that those individuals would also be banned from acting as witnesses to marriage, serving as godparents, and performing readings at weddings and funerals, citing 2,000 years of Catholic teachings.\n\nHere's a photo of the notice received by lawmakers including @repmcentee33 pic.twitter.com/diBYuAVod9 — Ian Donnis (@IanDon) January 31, 2020\n\nThen, in an interview Sunday, Bucci's rhetoric went further.\n\nPedophilia doesn't kill anyone and this does, he told local station WJAR, claiming that more children have been killed by abortion than have been abused.\n\nThis statement didn't sit well with State Representative Carol Hagan McEntee, a Democrat who championed Rhode Island's law to extend the statute of limitations for child sex abuse survivors.\n\nWhen he says that pedophilia doesn't kill people, well, he clearly doesn't understand, she told CBS News. He should've come to the statehouse and listened to the testimonies because there are lot of victims who are no longer with us. The injured voices that I heard — they've stolen their childhoods. They've practically destroyed their lives. And the ones we still hear from are the lucky ones because they're the ones who are still alive; they didn't die of an overdose or suicide. You know, there's plenty of those that never made it long enough to come forward.\n\nHer colleague, State Representative Julie Casimiro, whose name was also published in the flier, agrees.\n\nThe Catholic Church needs to take a look at themselves and ask why they are closing churches and losing worshipers, Casimiro wrote in a statement to CBS News. Could it be because Fr. Bucci's most recent statement was that 'no one has ever died from pedophilia?' Fr. Bucci and the diocese need to take a look from within. They need to get their own house in order. The Pope should make a visit to Rhode Island!\n\nCBS News has reached out the Diocese of Providence for comment, but has not yet heard back.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of distributing the flier, Bucci told the Providence Journal that local lawmakers were upset because their names and votes were made public: If they are proud of what they have done, why do they want to keep it a secret?\n\nThe issue, however, is not that the votes were made public. In fact, one Democratic state representative called that laughable, because their votes on every issue are already listed on the General Assembly's website as soon as they are tallied.\n\nRather, for some, it's about the separation of church and state.\n\nThey have a problem with the lack of respect for the separation of church and state, and for our votes on behalf of our constituents being punished by a church who protected child abusers. — Justine Caldwell (@Justine4RI) February 1, 2020\n\nFor others, it has to do with the Catholic Church's handling of its own pedophilia scandal and the hypocrisy they perceive in the discrepancy.\n\nMcEntee has had a long and fraught relationship with Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick, Rhode Island, where Bucci now presides. She and her older sister, Ann Hagan Web, attended Sacred Heart School from kindergarten through the eighth grade. And Ann alleges that she was repeatedly sexually molested by a priest there, who is now deceased, for approximately seven years, beginning when she was just 5 years old.\n\nMcEntee tells CBS News that she believes Bucci's letter is less a response to the Reproductive Privacy Act than it is a reaction to her work with child sex abuse survivors.\n\nI just think it's concerning that this is the church that is taking issue with this, out of all the churches in Rhode Island, she told CBS News. Personally, I feel this is a continued attack by him on me and my family because of what happened to my sister. And he's come up with this latest way.\n\nHer colleague Julie Casimiro points to the time lag between the final vote on the bill last June and Father Bucci's letter in January as proof of that point.\n\nFr. Bucci would love to have you all think this is about the codification of Roe V Wade, she wrote to CBS News. If it was, why wasn't the list published last year when we took the vote? Why did only a few lawmakers receive the mailing at home? This is retribution to the Hagen-McEntee family for shining the light on sexual assault within the Catholic Church and Sacred Heart, in particular.\n\nIn a fiery Facebook post after the flier was made public, Casimiro went a step further, suggesting that the General Assembly should respond to Father Bucci's list of lawmakers not welcome in his parish by posting a list of pedophile priests not welcome at the State House. That is a much longer list.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church, will now baptize children of parents who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, the church announced Thursday. In 2015, the church stopped baptizing children of LGBT couples until they turned 18 and disavowed same-sex relationships.\n\nChurch leaders announced the policy change in a statement during the church's 189th Annual General Conference. Children of same-sex couples may now be baptized at 8 years old.\n\nUnder the new policy, the church will no longer view marriage between members of the same sex as apostasy, which had made same-sex couples subject to excommunication.\n\nWhile we still consider such a marriage to be a serious transgression, it will not be treated as apostasy for purposes of Church discipline, the church's leaders, known as the First Presidency, said in the statement. Instead, the immoral conduct in heterosexual or homosexual relationships will be treated in the same way.\n\nIn this June 2, 2013, photo, members of the Mormons Building Bridges group march during the Utah Gay Pride Parade in Salt Lake City. Rick Bowmer, AP\n\nThe new policies do not represent a shift in Church doctrine related to marriage or the commandments of God in regard to chastity or morality, the leaders said. The doctrine of the plan of salvation and the importance of chastity will not change.\n\nThe church was founded on April 6, 1830, by Joseph Smith in Fayetteville Township, New York. Smith claimed to have received spoken messages from the Christian angel Moroni and published the Book of Mormon. His successor, Brigham Young, led 148 Mormon followers to settle in Salt Lake City in 1847. Today, the Church has nearly 17 million members.
A judge ordered Johnny Depp to stay away from his estranged wife Amber Heard after she filed a domestic violence restraining order against the actor on Friday. Heard accused her husband of hitting her and leaving her face bruised, reports the AP.\n\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Carl H. Moor also ruled that Depp shouldn't try to contact Heard until after a scheduled June 17 hearing. Heard said in a sworn declaration that Depp hit her with her cell phone on her cheek and eye during a fight on Saturday. She also said Depp pulled her hair, screamed at her, hit her and grabbed her face and that he was high and drunk during the assault.\n\nI live in fear that Johnny will return to (our house) unannounced to terrorize me, physically and emotionally, Heard wrote in a sworn declaration.\n\nMoor, however, rejected Heard's request that Depp attend anger management classes for a year and that the protective order extend to their dogs. Heard stated that there was another incident in April during which Depp showed up unannounced at her birthday party and pushed her on the floor. She wrote that she did not see her estranged husband for a month after the altercation.\n\nHeard filed for divorce on Monday, after a year of marriage, saying they had separated the day before. The two actors cited irreconcilable differences for the breakup. On Friday, she appeared in court in Los Angeles with her lawyer, Samantha Spector, claiming that Depp attacked her several times during her marriage, CBS News can confirm. She submitted a picture of her bruised face when she applied for a restraining order Friday.\n\nDepp's attorney, Laura Wasser, declined to comment, but wrote in a court filing that Depp was out of the country and would agree to a mutual stay-away order.\n\nHeard submitted the photo below of her bruised face along with the filing.\n\nThe split has become increasingly messy. Depp asked the court determine that he should not pay spousal support to Heard. He also wants the actress to pay her own attorney fees and requested separation of certain assets, including miscellaneous jewelry, earnings made after their separation and, as stipulated in the response, additional separate property assets and obligations of the parties, the exact nature and extent of which are not presently known.
NEW YORK — Paulina Porizkova and Ric Ocasek have separated after 28 years of marriage. The model and actress announced on Instagram on Wednesday that she and the Cars rocker have not been a couple for the past year.\n\nThey first met while filming the music video for the Cars song Drive in 1984 and were together last month when 74-year-old Ocasek was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The couple have two children.\n\nThe 53-year-old Porizkova made an apt analogy, saying their family is a well built car. But she says that as a bicycle, my husband and I no longer pedal in unison.\n\nShe implied that the split is amicable and promised fans, The love we have for one another is so wide and deep it's practically tangible, and that sort of love can never disappear. Expect to keep seeing happy family photos.
(CBS News) Imagine your real life experiences from the age of seven made into a series of documentaries. For a group of people in Britain there is no imagining -- they've been watching their lives unfold on the screen for half-a-century, with the latest installment scheduled to run on PBS on October 14th. Their personal stories are our Cover Story, reported by Lee Cowan:\n\nAn earlier version of this story was originally broadcast on January 6, 2013.\n\nIt looks like any other group of kids in the early 1960s, but it wasn't just a dance party. It was a sociological experiment for a British documentary called Seven Up!\n\nThe idea was to gather 7-year-olds from widely different backgrounds, and look at Britain's class system through their eyes.\n\nAt one end of the extreme: Upper-class seven-year-olds, like the trio of John, Andrew and Charles attending a boarding school.\n\nJohn: I read the Financial Times.\n\nAndrew: I read the Observer and the Times.\n\nCharles: What do you like about it?\n\nJohn: Well, I usually look at the headlines, and then read about them.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum: seven-year-olds who were less privileged, like those growing up in a charity group home.\n\nInterviewer: What do you think about rich people?\n\nSymon: Well, not much.\n\nAfter it first aired in 1964, the boys and girls -- 14 of them in all -- became mini-celebrities for their infectious wit and charm.\n\nInterviewer: What do you think of girlfriends at your age?\n\nAndrew: I've got one, but I don't think much of her!\n\nThe man who plucked them from obscurity all those years ago was Michael Apted, a 22-year-old researcher on the project.\n\nIt was very funny, the original one, but it was also alarming, Apted told Cowan. You could see that people's views of the world were totally determined by where they were coming from. And those who had somewhat impoverished backgrounds had a very narrow view of the world, and those who were in power had this grand view, not just of the world, but of their lives.\n\nHe was so struck by what they said that he vowed to track the same group down every seven years ever since. The latest installment, 56 Up, is the continuation of a series that the late critic Roger Ebert called one of the best films of all time.\n\nCowan asked, what is it that makes this so compelling?\n\nWell, 'cause I think people identify with it, Apted replied. You see 13, 14 stories up there, and there's elements in some of them that hit home on every life. Everybody who watches it can identify with something.\n\nSuzy is one of his favorites. When she was seven, the series pried into her thoughts on boys. Over the years Apted kept asking:\n\nInterviewer: Tell me, do you have any boyfriends Suzy?\n\nSuzy at 7: Um, yes. ... He lives up in Scotland. I think he's 13.\n\nInterviewer: Have you got any boyfriends, Suzy?\n\nSuzy at 14: Glares.\n\nInterviewer: What is your attitude toward marriage?\n\nSuzy at 21: I don't know, I haven't given it a lot of thought because I'm very, very cynical about it.\n\nInterviewer: Now you seem happy, what's happened to you over these last seven years?\n\nSuzy at 28: I suppose Rupert.\n\nNow at 56, Suzy is still married to Rupert, with two grown sons and a daughter.\n\nThere are great moments in the film, aren't there, when you cut from one generation to another, and it's night and day, said Apted.
Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman accused of setting a fire to her family home and murdering her husband, speaks out for the first time in a interview with 48 Hours correspondent Erin Moriarty, in the The Death of Todd Stermer airing Saturday, November 21 at 9/8c on CBS.\n\nOn January 7, 2007, Linda Stermer says she was doing laundry in the basement of her family's home when she heard her husband Todd let out a chilling scream and ran upstairs to find their living room engulfed in flames. Todd, says Linda, was in the middle of the room attempting to fight the fire. Unable to get to him, she says she fled the burning house with no shoes, jacket or cellphone.\n\nIn an interview for 48 Hours, Erin Moriarty asked Linda Stermer, You didn't think about calling 911? That wasn't my first thought, answered Linda. My first thought was to get out. Todd's gonna get out … As long as he knows I'm out … he's gonna get out.\n\nLinda and Todd Stermer\n\nThe Stermer home was in a rural area outside Kalamazoo, Michigan, with an electrified fence surrounding the large property to help keep the couple's 31 horses safe. Without a cellphone, Linda says the only way for her to get help that day was to jump into her husband's van, which always had the keys inside, and drive to the nearest neighbor. But just as she was about to take off in the van, Linda says she saw that her husband Todd had escaped the burning house, and that she got out of the van to help him. He's jumping around and he's patting himself. His skin is burnt terribly … I'm screaming at him, get in the van ... And he won't get in the van … I can't touch him … And, so, I get back in the van … And I lost sight of him.\n\nAccording to weather reports for that day, there was some light rain and snow in the area. Linda says their driveway was so wet and muddy that it was hard for her to get the van moving. The tires were just spinning … so I couldn't get any traction, she says — but what happened next is something she still cannot explain. Did you know you had run over your husband, asked Erin Moriarty. No, says Linda Stermer. Investigators would later find Todd's blood on the van's front bumper and undercarriage. Linda had hit her husband with his own van.\n\nEmergency workers tried to save Todd Stermer, but he died on the scene from his burn injuries. Van Buren County Sheriff's detectives investigated the fire and Todd's death for a little over two years. Then, on June 5, 2009, the prosecutor's office felt it had enough evidence to arrest Linda Stermer and charge her with arson and the murder of her husband. Linda maintains she is innocent, but the couple's sons say that over time they came to feel that their mother was guilty.\n\nOn January 7, 2007, while Linda and Todd Stermer were in their Lawrence, Michigan, home, their house burst into flames. Michigan State Police\n\nWhat do you believe happened, Moriarty asked 28-year-old Trevor Stermer.\n\nOur mother murdered our father, he answered. She set the house on fire, doused him in gasoline, then after the fact when he managed to get out of the house, she ran him over with her van.\n\nThe evidence presented at trial was mainly circumstantial. Among other things, a gas station clerk testified that she saw Linda on the morning of the fire seemingly pumping gas into a gas can at the back of her SUV. Her sons testified that when Linda got home from the gas station, she woke them and gave them money to go to the movies. A formerly close friend testified that Linda had talked about wanting to kill Todd by running him over, and accused Linda of having an affair with a coworker.\n\nLinda's defense countered with testimony from the brother of that former friend, who told the jury that his sister has a history of psychiatric illness and cannot be trusted. As for pumping gas into a can that morning, Linda says it was cold out and she went to the back of her SUV to get gloves to pump gas into her car. Nothing more. She also insists that the reason she sent her sons to the movies that day is that she and Todd were in the throes of a heated argument. She was planning on leaving Todd that day, says Linda, and did not want her sons there to see it.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, the jury convicted Linda Stermer. A month later, Linda was sentenced to life in prison without parole — but after serving nearly 9 years, she was once again free, at least temporarily.\n\nErin Moriarty and I first met Linda Stermer and her new attorney Wolfgang Mueller at the 2019 Innocence Network Conference. A federal judge had overturned Linda's conviction in December of 2018 and set her free. Judge Arthur J. Tarnow declared that Linda did not get a fair trial and said he found prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nThe State of Michigan immediately filed an appeal to reinstate Linda's conviction and put her back behind bars. Prosecutors declared that if they lost, they would retry her.\n\nOn May 15, 2020, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Linda Stermer and upheld Judge Tarnow's decision to overturn her conviction. The Van Buren County Prosecutor's office have since refiled murder charges against Stermer. Her new trial is scheduled to begin on March 9, 2021.\n\nIn a family divided, Linda's sons say they will testify against her and vow they will never speak to her again. Their half-sisters — Linda's daughters from a previous marriage, Ashley and Brittany — believe their mother is innocent and say they are praying that she remains free.\n\nJudy Rybak is a producer for 48 Hours | @JudyRybak
The former fiancée of slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi says the heir to the Saudi throne should be punished without delay after a U.S. intelligence report published by the Biden administration pinned the blame on him for the writer's brutal murder. The intelligence report, which was compiled months ago but only made public on Friday by the White House, concludes that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey, to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nCBS News' Margaret Brennan and Ed O'Keefe reported that the Biden administration is preparing to institute a new policy aimed at punishing future attacks by foreign governments on journalists working for U.S. news outlets. The U.S. Treasury said separately that it would hit one Saudi military unit and an ex-intelligence official from the country with sanctions for their roles in Khashoggi's murder.\n\nBut the White House is not planning to sanction the crown prince, often known by his initials MBS, individually.\n\nBin Salman has already taken over many of the duties of running the conservative Islamic kingdom from his father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud. Saudi Arabia has for decades been a key U.S. ally in the Middle East — a strategic partner helping to keep its arch rival, Iran, in check. The Kingdom is also the biggest buyer of American-made military hardware.\n\nKhashoggi was brutally murdered in 2018 after being lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, on the pretense of collecting documentation for his planned marriage to Turkish national Hatice Centiz.\n\nHis former fiancée has campaigned for justice since the murder, and the measures announced thus far by Washington to hold the Saudi royal to account for his actions have clearly left her wanting.\n\nIt is essential that the Crown Prince, who ordered the brutal murder of a blameless and innocent person, should be punished without delay, Cengiz said in a message posted to Twitter. If the Crown Prince is not punished, it will forever signal that the main culprit can get away with murder which will endanger us all and be a stain on our humanity.\n\nStarting with the Biden administration, it is vital for all world leaders to ask themselves if they are prepared to shake hands with a person whose culpability as a murderer has been proven, she said.\n\nKhashoggi had close connections to some members of the Saudi royal court, but he had become a harsh critic of the ascendant crown prince with his work for The Washington Post and other American outlets.\n\nCBS News reported in 2018 that the CIA had concluded MBS ordered Khashoggi's death, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The crown prince has denied any involvement in Khashoggi's killing. In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Norah O'Donnell specifically asked him whether he'd ordered the killing.\n\nThe Crown Prince responded: Absolutely not. This was a heinous crime. But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by individuals working for the Saudi government.
A Michigan woman will remain free, after judges with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday to uphold a federal judge's decision to overturn her conviction. Linda Stermer was convicted of murder and arson in the 2007 death of her husband, Todd Stermer.\n\nAuthorities have long believed she set the family home on fire to kill her husband and then ran him over with a van when he escaped the flames. Detectives spent two years investigating - focusing on a troubled marriage, and the fact that Linda ran Todd over when he escaped the fire. She was arrested and charged in 2009.\n\nYou must know, Linda, that it's very difficult for people to believe that your husband is burned in a fire, he escapes, he's still alive, badly burned and then you hit him with a car, Erin Moriarty asked Linda in an interview for The Death of Todd Stermer. What, you just happened to have that kind of bad luck?\n\nBad luck doesn't even describe it, Linda said.\n\nAfter her conviction, Linda wrote her own petition to the federal court. In part, she blamed her conviction on her own defense attorney, who had chosen not to hire a fire expert.\n\n48 Hours spoke to veteran fire investigator Robert Trenkle, who says he would have testified there was not enough evidence to prove the fire that killed Todd Stermer was deliberately set. The investigation was inadequate, he said, adding that the evidence does not support the state's theory that Linda doused Todd with gasoline and then set him on fire.\n\nI've asked probably 30 or 40 people who are firefighters, investigators, he said. They all laughed when I told them about somebody getting out of a building after they ... had gasoline poured all over them.\n\nA federal judge who called an evidentiary hearing found the prosecutor was wrong telling jurors that Linda had two cell phones inside the van, when there was no evidence of that. He also found fault with the defense, saying the attorney failed his client by not calling a fire expert.\n\nIn 2018, nearly 12 years after the fire, the federal judge ultimately decided Linda Stermer didn't get a fair trial. He vacated her conviction and Linda was released from prison.\n\nMichigan's attorney general had appealed the federal decision, asking that Linda's conviction be reinstated. In delivering the court opinion, released Friday, Judge Eric Clay, with one judge joining him, weighed heavily on the improper remarks made during trial. The other judge dissented.\n\nThe state says the prosecutor's statements were rooted in the evidence, writes Clay. In reality[,] they were predominantly based on the prosecutor's own assessment that Stermer's version of events was not credible.\n\nJudge Clay noted that the prosecution's case was not impossibly weak. He acknowledged that circumstantial evidence - while possibly explained by Linda - could point toward her guilt. But he concluded that given the relative weakness of this evidence, the fairness of her trial was irreparably undercut by the prosecutor's closing, in which he repeatedly opined that Stermer was untruthful and called her 'a diabolical, scheming, manipulative liar.'\n\nFriday's ruling is not the end for prosecutors, who have 120 days to decide if they will try the case or have it dismissed. Van Buren County Prosecutor Michael Bedford says he plans to retry the case if in fact that is necessary.\n\nHe points out that the appellate process is not necessarily over. The Attorney General can decide to appeal the decision to overturn Stermer's conviction with the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nBedford tells 48 Hours, Once that part of it is final, we will work with the trial judge in our county to get the ball rolling for a new trial if necessary.
More Democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than America has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020.
Twenty couples gathered Sunday in St. Peter's Basilica to say I do with Catholic Church leader Pope Francis presiding over the nuptials.\n\nBut as CBS News correspondent Don Dahler reports, the ceremony raised some eyebrows because, according to the church, some of the couples Pope Francis wed were technically living in sin.\n\nMany had been living together prior to getting married, which is forbidden in Catholicism. Some even have children.\n\nBut none of that mattered to Pope Francis, who has been more progressive with his views of the church and its relationship with the modern world.\n\nLots of people feel alienated from the church, they don't feel welcome there, said Candida Moss, theologian professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nBut it seems like Francis is saying that the church has to be more progressive, it needs to be more practical and it needs to be more compassionate, Moss said.\n\nThe mass wedding is another example of how progressive Pope Francis has been during his tenure as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. It was the first time he led a group wedding since he was elected 18 months ago. Some say it's a sign that the pope wants the Catholic Church to be more inclusive.\n\nThe symbolic ceremony comes just weeks before the Synod of Bishops, a major meeting on issues of the family. There, catholic leaders are expected to discuss everything from marriage to divorce and even contraception.\n\nThey're also expected to discuss the issue of allowing divorced parishioners to receive communion, something deeply important to Catholics. The Vatican does not allow divorced Catholics to receive the sacrament.\n\nIf the rules change, we would see a huge increase in the number of people eligible to take communion, therefore we would see a huge increase in the number of people going to church, Moss said.\n\nFather Gilbert Martinez is pastor of a Catholic church in New York. He said divorce can end more than the marriage -- it can affect the couple's relationship with their church.\n\nTheir hearts are broken and then they feel like they've been rejected for not being able to receive communion, Martinez said.\n\nThat meeting of bishops is set to take place from October 5th through the 19th. Pope Francis' approach of family issues differs greatly from his predecessor, Pope Benedict, who said that threats to traditional family undermine the future of humanity itself.
Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana mayor and latest Democrat to throw his hat into the 2020 presidential race, says he's got more experience in government that the president of the United States, which he says makes him qualified for the highest office in the land. The 37-year-old, gay Navy veteran told CBS This Morning that while he might be the youngest person in the race thus far, it's his unconventional background that makes him the best candidate.\n\nI've got more years of executive experience than the vice president and I have more military experience than anybody who's arrived behind that desk since George H.W. Bush. I get that it's not a conventional background, but I don't think that it's time for conventional backgrounds in Washington right now, the mayor said.\n\nButtigieg, who ran unsuccessfully in 2017 to lead the Democratic National Committee, announced earlier this month that he would be forming an exploratory committee to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. While the last time a sitting mayor was nominated for president to a major political party was in 1812, his role in local politics, according to Buttigieg, gives him the instinct to do the job.\n\nWhether we're talking about the presidency or a job like governor or mayor, there are three parts to it, it's bringing people together, it's implementing good policies and it's capably running an administration, he said. All of those have been missing right now in Washington.\n\nHe later told CBSN that more mayors deserve a place in the national conversation. When you have the executive experience of leading a city of any size, you have a better sense of the job or any executive leadership role to bring people together, to pass good policies, to competently run an organization or an administration, said Buttigieg.\n\nThe mayor also said he's prepared for any attacks he might face if elected as the country's first openly gay president.\n\nAll I can do is try to do the right thing, come forward with big ideas. [I'm] definitely proud of who I am, I'm proud of my husband and our marriage is one of the most important things, the most important thing in my life, he told CBSN.\n\nHe added, I grew up in Indiana and I'm gay so I'm used to dealing with bullies, I've been deployed in a war zone I'm used to dealing with attacks, I think I'll be ready for it.\n\nAs Buttigieg joins a chorus of other Democratic hopefuls in the 2020 race, he says his party and politics as a whole have largely ignored the experience of the industrial Midwest, something he says has come at a terrible cost.\n\nOur party has a tendency to lead with the policies, first we got to explain our values and explain why Democrats are committed to freedom to democracy, to security, he said. That democracy piece has to be fix before anything will go well in this country.\n\nButtigieg also called for ending the electoral college process. The electoral college needs to go because it's made our society less and less democratic, he said.\n\nButtigieg also told CBS that he supports more progressive-leaning Medicare-for-all proposals, saying the idea of universal coverage is the norm in most developed countries.
Eva Longoria is a married woman!\n\nThe 41-year-old actress married José Pepe Antonio Bastón in Valle de Bravo, Mexico, a lakeside town about 88 miles from Mexico City, on Saturday, according to local reports.\n\n@evalongoria and her Mama Ella!!! LaBoda ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ A photo posted by MELANIE (@melanie_griffith57) on May 22, 2016 at 2:36pm PDT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lavish event took place at a private home, with fireworks reportedly coming after the ceremony. Photos posted by the Telemundo news program Al Rojo Vivo show Longoria and Bastón exchanging their vows in front of a giant cross under a canopy of white flowers. The Telenovela star can be seen wearing a white gown that appears strapless, as well as a long veil.\n\nThe star-studded guest list was said to have included her BFF Victoria Beckham -- who was rumored to be creating Longoria's wedding dress -- and her husband, David Beckham. Longoria's Desperate Housewives co-star Felicity Huffman was also said to be in attendance, as were Penelope Cruz, Ricky Martin, Katy Perry, Melanie Griffith and Prison Break star Amaury Nolasco, according to People.\n\nAhead of the nuptials, Longoria posted a number of gorgeous shots on Instagram regaling her stay in Mexico. The first was a stunning beach shot that she geo-tagged as Puerto Vallarta on Thursday...\n\nA photo posted by Eva Longoria Baston (@evalongoria) on May 19, 2016 at 6:45am PDT\n\n\n\n...which was followed by a semi-blurry shot of a resort in Acapulco.\n\n💃🏽 A photo posted by Eva Longoria Baston (@evalongoria) on May 20, 2016 at 7:28am PDT\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was also no rest for the bride, who made sure to get in an early morning yoga session with her favorite instructor, Craig Fields.\n\nEarly morning yoga with my favorite instructor @craig_fields! A photo posted by Eva Longoria Baston (@evalongoria) on May 20, 2016 at 9:34am PDT\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been a very busy couple of weeks for Longoria -- she made a number of glam turns during the 69th Annual Cannes Film Festival in France before returning\ to Los Angeles on May 14.\n\nLongoria and Baston -- who've been dating for nearly three years -- got engaged while vacationing in Dubai last December.\n\nBoth have walked down the aisle before. Longoria was previously married to NBA star Tony Parker from 2007 to 2010, as well as to General Hospital star Tyler Christopher from 2002 to 2004. As for Baston, who's the president of Televisa, he has three children from a previous marriage.
In a break from some of his most conservative supporters, President Trump said he thinks it's great to see Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg onstage with his husband, Chasten.\n\nIn an interview with Steve Hilton for The Next Revolution on Fox News, Mr. Trump, taking note of the fact that some people might object, the president said he thought it was a good thing to see the two together.\n\nI think it's great. I think that's something that perhaps some people will have a problem with. I have no problem with it whatsoever. I think it's good, Mr. Trump said, in response to a question about Buttigieg's candidacy as a symbol for the progress gay rights have made in the U.S.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump's most prominent surrogates are evangelical Christian leaders who vehemently oppose same-sex marriage, like Jerry Falwell Jr. and Franklin Graham. Graham voiced his objection to Buttigieg in a tweet last month, suggesting he should repent for being gay.\n\nMr. Trump has expressed tolerance towards gay people since his campaign. However, the Trump administration has faced criticism for its policies towards LGBT Americans, such as the ban on transgender soldiers from serving in the military.\n\nButtigieg has feuded with Mr. Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, for his conservative Christian views and anti-LGBT policies as governor of Indiana.
A southeastern Missouri preacher went on leave from his church and is seeking professional counseling after giving a sermon that chastised married women who let themselves go and held up former first lady Melania Trump as the pinnacle of feminine beauty. A video widely circulated on social media shows Pastor Stewart-Allen Clark's sermon before the 1st General Baptist Church in Malden in the state's bootheel. The sermon was roundly panned as sexist and counter to Christian teachings.\n\nPastor Stewart-Allen Clark Reagan Williams/Facebook\n\nIn the video, Clark berated wives who gained weight after marriage and admonished that they should look good for their husbands, adding, it's important that he thinks you're hot!\n\nI'm not saying every woman can be the epic - the epic – trophy wife of all time like Melania Trump, Clark said, as a photo of the former first lady appeared behind him on a screen. Most women can't be trophy wives, but you know ... maybe you're a participation trophy.\n\nCBS affiliate KMOV-TV reports the original video was deleted from the church's website, but a woman who was watching the sermon that day managed to post the video to Facebook.\n\nMen have a need for their women to look like women. Sweatpants don't cut it all the time. Wearing flip flops and pajamas to Walmart – that ain't going to work. Ain't nothing attractive about that. It' ain't, Clark said in his sermon. And men want their wives to look good at home and in public, can I get an Amen!\n\nThe church's website said Clark began his leave on March 2 and is seeking professional counseling.\n\nA statement from the General Baptist Council of Associations, with which Clark's church is affiliated, also condemned Clark's sermon.\n\nGeneral Baptists believe that every woman was created in the image of God, and they should be valued for that reason, the statement said.
If getting healthy is one of your top New Year's resolutions, it may be time to rethink your eating habits. While fad diets will come and go, there are some tried-and true healthy eating plans that can help get you on the right track.\n\nU.S. News & World Report, in collaboration with a panel of health experts, evaluated and ranked 41 diets. To be top-rated, a diet had to be safe, relatively easy to follow, nutritious and effective for weight loss. It also had to be proven to help prevent heart disease and diabetes.\n\nHere's a closer look at the highest-ranking diets overall.\n\n1. Mediterranean diet\n\nThe Mediterranean diet got the top ranking in U.S. News' list. The heart-healthy diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains, along with healthy fats like olive oil, nuts and avocados.\n\nResearch has shown the Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of heart disease and may have numerous other health benefits, including reduction of LDL, or bad, cholesterol, as well as a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and cancer. In fact, one recent study published in British Journal of Nutrition found adhering to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a 25 percent lower chance of death from any cause.\n\n2. DASH diet\n\nThe DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was designed to help manage blood pressure, but experts say it has many overall health benefits, helping it nab the number 2 spot on the best overall diets list.\n\nThe diet emphasizes healthy food sources, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, skinless poultry and fish, and nuts and legumes. It also limits red meat, salt, and sweets.\n\nIn addition to lowering blood pressure, research suggests the DASH diet may help reduce the risk of diabetes and may also help fight depression.\n\n3. Flexitarian diet\n\nFlexitarian is a marriage of the words flexible and vegetarian. The term was coined by registered dietitian Dawn Jackson Blatner in her book The Flexitarian Diet: The Mostly Vegetarian Way to Lose Weight, Be Healthier, Prevent Disease and Add Years to Your Life. U.S. News ranked it high on the list for being nutritionally complete, easy to follow, and providing long-term weight loss as well as heart health benefits.\n\nIn the book, Blatner says you don't have to cut out meat entirely to reap the health benefits of a vegetarian diet. Eating a diet that's mostly vegetarian while also allowing for an occasional burger or steak to satisfy a craving can help with weight management and improve overall health, Blatner says.\n\n4 (tie). MIND diet\n\nThe MIND Diet combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.)\n\nDesigned by researchers from the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, the aptly named MIND diet was developed specifically for brain health. In fact, one study found the diet may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it moderately well reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third, the researchers found.\n\nThe eating plan features a wide variety of options, including fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, poultry, and fish.\n\n4 (tie). WW (Weight Watchers) diet\n\nThe Weight Watchers diet tied for fourth place with the MIND diet. Although designed to help people lose weight, experts say its focus on healthier living makes it a smart overall diet to follow.\n\nThe WW Freestyle program was launched in 2017 and builds off the company's signature SmartPoints system, which assigns every food and beverage a point value, based on its nutrition. The new program expands dietary options. The plan also involves in-person meetings or online chats designed to support those in the program and keep them accountable.\n\nLow-ranking diets\n\nA number of popular diets, including the keto diet, Dukan diet, and the Whole30 diet received some of the lowest rankings on U.S. News' list.\n\nLack of scientific evidence for health benefits and severe restriction of foods – including certain healthy foods – were listed as reasons for low scores.
Iowa Congressman Steve King is facing his toughest primary race in years on Tuesday, as Republicans who usually safeguard their incumbents have either shied away from defending him or backed his challengers.\n\nWhile King has drawn headlines for years for his controversial comments, the message from those hoping to unseat him has focused more on what King isn't able to do in Washington.\n\nIn 2019, King was stripped of his House committee assignments after comments he made about white nationalism and white supremacy, which prompted a swift bipartisan backlash. White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive? King said in a New York Times interview in January 2019.\n\nRepublican candidates and outside groups have honed in on King's waning influence. He has not only lost his committee assignments, but Republicans aren't even listening to his opinions, says Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa Republican leader who has endorsed King's main primary opponent, Iowa state Senator Randy Feenstra.\n\nHe can't even influence the committees because they're not accepting his voice, said Vander Plaats, who is president and CEO of the Family Leader, a Christian conservative group in Iowa. Just because you can scream conservative issues really, really loud in the middle of the street, the fact is, if nobody's listening to you, it doesn't make a difference anymore.\n\nKing has chalked up his white nationalist comments in The New York Times to a misquote and weaponizing of the term. At a debate on Tuesday, he said the backlash and his removal were ginned up by the never-Trumpers.\n\nThere's powers that be, some of them are money powers, not all of them, that want Steve King out of the way, because they don't want to have to do battle on life, on marriage and on budgets and on guns…and on the border, King said.\n\nDuring that debate, King repeated a claim that House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy would advocate for King to regain his status and committee seats, which McCarthy promptly denied.\n\nCongressman King's comments cannot be exonerated, and I never said that, McCarthy said at a May press conference. He left the decision about his membership status to the Republican Steering Committee, but added, I think he'd get the same answer that he got before.\n\nAs King seeks his tenth term in Washington, he's facing a major cash crunch compared to his opponents. According to the latest FEC filings, King currently has a little over $32,000 cash on hand compared to Feenstra's $126,000. King was outraised by his Democratic opponents in 2014 and 2018, but has never been outpaced by a Republican challenger this close to a primary. Feenstra's cash advantage has given him the ability to spend $266,300 on ads, according to Kantar/CMAG data, while King has not put up a television ad.\n\nPriorities for Iowa, a super PAC supporting Feenstra, has spent nearly $290,000 on television ads, including one featuring Vander Plaats stressing that King is no longer effective. Another ad from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has put $200,000 into this race, says, It's been rough for Iowa farmers, and when we've needed him most, Steve King has let us down. He got kicked off the Agriculture Committee, hurting our farmers.\n\nPublic and internal polls have shown Feenstra steadily closing the gap between him and King. A poll in late April showed Feenstra down by 7 points while the latest poll, backed by the anti-King American Future Fund organization, had him ahead of King, 41% to 39%. There are two other candidates in the race and some Republicans noted that could split the vote enough among King's challengers to give him a win.\n\nOne wrinkle in the primary this year is increased absentee voting. Iowa mailed absentee ballot requests to registered voters and nearly eight times as many Republicans in the district have returned absentee ballots as in the 2018 primary. Data obtained by CBS News also shows that a large number of Republicans requesting ballots in Iowa haven't voted in the past four primaries, which some people believe could benefit Feenstra.\n\nKing has comfortably held the rural, conservative Iowan district since 2002, but in 2018 his seat was very much in play. First-time congressional candidate Democrat J.D. Scholten lost to King by just three points and Scholten is poised to be the Democrats' nominee again in 2020. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, meanwhile, won the district by 20 points that year.\n\nWe lost two congressional seats in Iowa (in 2018), why would we put this seat at risk by renominating him? said David Kochel, a longtime Iowa Republican strategist who has contributed to Feenstra and helped Priorities for Iowa. We know that the Democrats want him to win the primary because it's the only way they've got a shot at this seat.\n\nLast Friday, President Trump tweeted endorsements for two other Iowa Republican Congressional candidates. Notably, King did not receive an endorsement from the president, something that the Feenstra campaign's latest ad seized upon.\n\nPresident Trump just doesn't trust Steve King, and it's hurting Iowa, the ad says.\n\nSenators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst have also stayed out of the primary. So has Reynolds, who told the Sioux City Journal editorial board in January 2019, I just hope he is doing some serious reflection on what is best for the people of the 4th District.\n\nScott Reed, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's chief political strategist, said they got involved in the race to avoid King from hurting Senator Ernst's re-election campaign and becoming a real albatross around her neck.\n\nIt could jeopardize the U.S. Senate if King is the nominee in the fall, and Joni Ernst has to fight for every single vote in rural Iowa. We can't afford to have this problem, he told CBS News.\n\nBut King isn't without loyalists in the Fourth District. Vander Plaats noted that King has worked tirelessly during his time in Congress to travel the district and meet constituents. Story County Republican Chair Brett Barker, who is staying neutral in the race, adds that King is very engaging with voters one on one and says that helps insulate him from some of the media controversies that he's had.\n\nIn deeply Republican Sioux County, where King got 72% of the vote in 2018 and 80% in 2016, Republican county chair Tammy Kobza is backing King. He's the one that will best defend America, its greatness and Donald Trump's agenda, she said.\n\nKobza hears from people who are upset King was stripped of his committee assignments because it was based on lies. And as for the outside money pouring into the primary, she says, Fourth District people don't like outside people trying to tell us who to vote for.\n\nIt's one of many factors, Kobza said about whether that spending would motivate people to support King. Not only that, it's Steve King's record, Steve King's integrity, Steve King's leadership and his backbone.
DALLAS – A former Catholic priest suspected of sexually abusing as many as 100 boys in the late 70s and 80s, spent his last seven years in the Dallas-Fort Worth area where he used an alias on social media to meet young men. CBS DFW reports that James Brzyski, considered one of the worst abusers in the history of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, was found dead in September in a Fort Worth motel room.\n\nAn autopsy revealed Brzyski suffered from heart disease and was full of vodka and anti-depressants at the time of his death.\n\nRecords, obtained through the Texas Public Information Act, show that police recovered a laptop, thumb drives and a cell phone from Brzyski's room. Fort Worth Police detectives, however, said they found nothing further to investigate.\n\nFort Worth motel where James Brzyski was found dead. CBS DFW\n\nBut while Brzyski's death may have been an accident, the CBS DFW found the life he led, to his very last days, is worth investigating.\n\nThis man was a monster, said John Delaney, who was raped by Brzyski in the early 1980s at Saint Cecilia Parish in Philadelphia.\n\nAs bad as you could possibly imagine it could be, that's what happened, said Delaney, who was 11-years-old when the assaults began. It broke me as a kid.\n\nDecades later, when the Catholic Church sex scandal began to unfold, a grand jury investigation revealed Brzyski sexually abused at least 17 victims and noted that he may have abused as many as 100 boys. The 2005 report released by the grand jury called Brzyski one of the most brutal abusers in the Philadelphia archdiocese.\n\nBrzyski was kicked out of the church, but eluded prosecution due to the statute of limitations.\n\nIt was swept under the rug, Delaney told CBS DFW.\n\nAfter years of living the life of a nomad, Brzyski made his way to Dallas in 2010. He first lived in southeast Dallas where he roomed with a man who, himself, was just years before arrested for sexually assaulting a boy. Brzyski then lived at two other Dallas apartments, most recently across from Top Golf on Park Lane in northeast Dallas.\n\nA month before his death, a reporter and photographer with The Philadelphia Inquirer confronted Brzyski at his Park Lane apartment. The newspaper was working on a story about Brzyski's 1980s victims committing suicide, but the former priest declined to answer their questions.\n\nThe priest's Park Lane neighbors say they knew nothing of his dark past, but do recall that a young man from Australia moved in with Brzyski in late 2014.\n\nCBS DFW discovered the two not only lived together, but also married in Oklahoma in December 2014. Brzyski was 63 and his partner 21 when they wed, according to their marriage license.\n\nFights between the two brought police out to their Dallas apartment just weeks after their marriage. A police report from January 2015 questions whether the Australian was in fact 21. The report lists him as 15. Brzyski told the officers that the two met online, but didn't mention they were married. While CBS DFW found no evidence of a divorce, it appears the two broke up in early 2015. CBS DFW located the Australian's family. Their attorney told CBS DFW they did not want to talk about the relationship.\n\nMr. Brzyski caused great harm and trauma to many people, they wrote in an email.\n\nCBS DFW's investigation found that Brzyski — using aliases like Joshua Williams and Joshua in Dallas — appears to have connected online with many young men during his time in Dallas. Brzyski had at least seven social media accounts, including Facebook, Instagram, Tumbler and Twitter. The accounts are filled with pictures of overweight young men, some who appear to be boys.\n\nI am a feeder in Dallas, reads a May 2016 tweet by @joshuawillie3. I will fatten you without limit. The tweet then provides an email address and phone number.\n\nPlano Det. Jeff Rich, a nationally-known child exploitation investigator, said what stands out to him is that nearly all of Brzyski's online friends are young males.\n\nI don't see a lot of adult activity on there, Det. Rich said. I see a certain type of individual that he certainly is seeking to be friends with and those are typically more vulnerable types in our society.\n\nA photo of a painting posted to Brzyski's Instagram in July 2017 brings back horrible memories for Delaney. The painting depicts a naked boy being feed through a funnel.\n\nJohn Delaney CBS DFW\n\nThat's the one that has never sat right with me, said Delaney, who recalls seeing the painting as a child in Brzyski's home. It represents to me that the man is a pedophile. He's attracted to children.\n\nBrzyski was buried in a pauper's grave in Arlington in October. Even with him gone, Delaney said he still fears that there are unknown victims in North Texas and elsewhere.\n\nIt's sickening to me that they allowed this to happen and because they are keeping everything silent, he said of the Catholic Church. It afforded him the opportunity to travel around the country and abuse more children.\n\nDuring his seven years in North Texas, Dallas police officers made contact with Brzyski on at least five separate occasions, none of which were related to child sexual assaults.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Philadelphia wouldn't specifically say if they ever alerted North Texas police about Brzyski.\n\nAppropriate steps are taken to notify local law enforcement of a change of address when a priest, who has been (defrocked) due to a substantiated allegation of sexual abuse of a minor, changes residency, Archdiocese of Philadelphia spokesman Ken Gavin said in an email.
COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Prince Henrik, the French-born husband of Danish monarch Queen Margrethe who publicly vented his frustration at not being the social equal of his wife or their son in line to become Denmark's king, died late Tuesday. He was 83.\n\nHe was diagnosed with dementia last year and was hospitalized late last month with a lung infection. Earlier in the day, Henrik was moved from a Copenhagen hospital to the family's residence north of the capital, where the royal palace said he wished to spend his last moments.\n\nA later statement said Henrik died at 11:18 p.m. in his sleep and that the queen and their two sons were at his side.\n\nThe royal family has lost an anchor, Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen said in a statement, who said Henrik kept his good spirits till the end.\n\nPrince Henrik of Denmark seen in his vineyards around Caix Castle, in Caix, Cahors region, southwestern France, on September 24, 2009. AP\n\nFlags were at half-mast on public and private buildings across Copenhagen, including the city's famed downtown amusement park Tivoli. National radio channels changed their morning programs to broadcast more austere music interrupted by titbits and anecdotes about Henrik's life.\n\nCrown Prince Frederik, an International Olympic Committee member, had left Pyeongchang before the official opening of the Winter Games to rush home because of his father's worsening condition. During Henrik's final illness, Danes wrote on the royal household's Facebook page, offering warm thoughts to his family.\n\nThe Danish royal family has no political authority, but is one of the world's oldest kingdoms and prides itself on stability. Henrik, however, caused a scandal last August by announcing that when he died he didn't want to be buried next to Margrethe in the cathedral where the remains of Danish royals have gone for centuries. The queen already had a specially designed sarcophagus waiting for the couple.\n\nBorn on June 11, 1934, in southwestern France to parents with the noble titles of count and countess, Henri Marie Jean Andre de Laborde de Monpezat married Denmark's future queen in 1967.\n\nHenri became Henrik and converted to Denmark's state Lutheran Church. However, he found it difficult to fit in with Denmark's egalitarian lifestyle.\n\nHe was titled prince consort - the husband of a reigning queen but not a king - and he wasn't in the line of succession - his oldest son Frederik being the heir.\n\nShortly after the royal marriage, media criticized Henrik because he had openly aired his views that spanking was good for children. In the mid-1980s, Henrik publicly said he wanted a paycheck instead of relying on the queen, who gets annual allowances.\n\nThe law was eventually changed to give him roughly 10 percent of the annual allocation Parliament makes to royals each year.\n\nIn a 2002 interview, Henrik again stunned Danes by saying he felt he had been pushed aside in his own home, not only by his wife but also by his son. This followed the annual royal New Year's reception for foreign diplomats, where Frederik had been host because his mother was unavailable due to a broken rib.\n\nFor many years I have been No. 2, Henrik told Danish tabloid B.T. I have been satisfied with that role, but after so many years in Denmark I don't suddenly want to become number three and become some kind of wearisome attachment.\n\nHenrik lived his first five years in France's Asian colonies. He graduated from universities in Paris, learned Mandarin and Vietnamese and spent a year at the Hong Kong University from 1958-1959.\n\nAfter his move to Denmark, Henrik, a keen pianist, was active in different organizations and wrote poetry, memoirs and books, including a coffee table book on French gastronomy in 1999.\n\nMargrethe and Henrik also owned a chateau in southwestern France where they retreated every summer.\n\nUnder Denmark's Constitution, the royal family has no political power and is barred from involvement in party politics. As a royal, Henrik held honorary ranks of general in the Danish army and air force, and was an admiral in the navy.\n\nMette Jensen, a 33-year-old office clerk, said that while the Danes had a love-hate relationship with Henrik, I think we will miss him.\n\nIn September 2017, the palace announced that Henrik had undergone tests at Copenhagen's university hospital. The diagnosis was dementia and the extent of the cognitive failure is greater than expected, the palace said.\n\nIn January, he was admitted to a hospital with a lung infection and later was said to have a benign tumor.
Samantha Bee and Jason Jones are both known for their comedy, but it turns out they're especially good at improvising. Their weekly program on TBS, Full Frontal, usually tapes in New York City, but when coronavirus shut it down, they headed upstate, taking their three kids, and their show, with them.\n\nAnd now, after 19 years of marriage, it's togetherness like never before.\n\nCorrespondent Tracy Smith asked, I mean, you guys are old pros that kind of, being in each other's business, you've worked together for a long time now. So, is it different now that you are locked down?\n\nI think the biggest thing I realized is that she chews too loudly, Jones replied.\n\nThat's true, said Bee. And Jason sleeps too loudly.\n\nI do! I'm a loud sleeper. I don't snore. I'm just a loud sleeper. I make sounds.\n\nComedian Samantha Bee and her husband, Jason Jones, are doing what any couple would do while in lockdown together: put out a TV show from their home. CBS News\n\nKidding aside, For Bee and Jones, and the other 60 million or so married couples in America, the past eight weeks have been a real eye-opener.\n\nThe vows might say 'Til death do us part, but they don't say anything about being together all day, every day.\n\nSmith asked psychotherapist Lori Gottlieb, This is a time when people are losing their lives, there are people risking their lives going to work every day. Is it a little indulgent for us to be talking about romance?\n\nNot at all, Gottlieb replied. There's no hierarchy of pain. Pain is pain, and suffering is suffering. So, for some people, they're suffering loss of life. Other people are losing out on things, like they're not gonna go to their child's graduation. And those are real losses. And so, I think it's important that this isn't the grief Olympics. We don't need to measure it on some kind of scale of whose [pain] is higher on this hierarchy.\n\nGottlieb is the author of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, and right now, a lot of married folks are talking to her.\n\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt\n\nWhat is she hearing from couples? What's interesting is we talk so much about isolation. And I'm hearing a lot from couples about not having enough space.\n\nJason jones said, I used to make fun of George W. Bush when he used to go down to the ranch and clear brush. That was his thing, right? I get it now. Yeah, totally get it.\n\nYeah, Jason's, like, a hole digger, said Bee.\n\nThere are no holes a thousand miles away in Memphis, Tennessee, in the backyard of DeVonté and Alyssa Payton, but they have some of the same issues. And with three kids, and another due in August, privacy is nearly impossible.\n\nMy tub is my sanctuary, said Alyssa. The bathtub and, yes, sometimes the toilet. I just lock the door and just be quiet, and it's the only door that locks in our room.\n\nAnd having a door that locks might be important for other reasons. Gotlieb notes, Touch is so important. What we're experiencing right now is 'skin hunger.' It's a phenomenon where our nervous systems get activated when we don't have physical touch. Because we're not getting that out in the world with the normal sort of hugs and handshakes in the ways that we would normally get that, it's really important that we're getting that from the people that we're social distancing with in our own households.\n\nSmith asked the Paytons, There's actually something called skin hunger that we all as humans need touch.\n\nPhysical touch is my love language, said Devonté.\n\nAnd mine, not so much, said Alyssa. How we made it to four children, I don't know!\n\nOf course, not every marriage is quite as strong as the Paytons': The most recent government figures say the divorce rate actually dropped in the past ten years, but now there's speculation that the quarantine could make those divorce numbers jump.\n\nLaura Wasser, a family law attorney in Los Angeles, described the meaning of corona divorce: We're getting a lot of calls from people at their wits' end with their spouses or live-ins and, you know, we try to kind of talk them off the ledge.\n\nWasser knows her way around a divorce court. Among her past clients: Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp, and Maria Shriver. What's more, two of the stars of Marriage Story – Laura Dern and Scarlett Johansson – both hired Wasser for their real-life break-ups.\n\nThere have been situations where I have seen how people behave and I think, 'They're not gonna, there's no amount of counseling that they will make this through,' Wasser said.\n\nSmith asked, Is there one particular attitude or something that you could pinpoint?\n\nYeah, but I would have to use profanity.\n\nThat's okay.\n\nIt's somebody being a real a*****e, said Wasser.\n\nSo, if you just have to get away, and can't afford her $950-per-hour fee, she has a website called It's Over Easy that'll take you through the divorce process for around $1,500.\n\nBut Wasser also told us that, even when the quarantine is lifted, she's not expecting a big stampede for the divorce court.\n\nWithout sounding too Pollyann-ish about it, I really do think that if people are about to communicate and use tools and get, you know, more intimate with each other, both intellectually and physically during this time, they might come out of the quarantine stronger, she said.\n\nYou say that as a divorce lawyer? asked Smith.\n\nI do. I've been doing this for a long time, and I see human nature and human relationships, and I do think that if people can make it through a situation like this – like they say, 'If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger'? The same goes for a relationship.\n\nAnd she may be on to something.\n\nSmith asked Bee and Jones, I'm trying to think of a word that isn't corny; are there 'gifts' of this lockdown?\n\nIt is a gift, Bee replied. Turning to Jones, she said, Don't even look at me when I say this, but I'm enjoying … I feel very close to you. I love you. It's fun working with you. Sorry! This is where I married you because I enjoy you, right? I apologize for being real!\n\nSmith asked Gottlieb, Are you hopeful about relationships and how everybody's gonna end up when we're finally allowed outside again?\n\nI feel like people are now looking at what is really important to me, and who matters to me, and what can I do to nurture those relationships, she replied.\n\nWe're treasuring it a little more?\n\nWe're not taking each other for granted any more, Gottlieb said.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by John D'Amelio.

Vatican City — Pope Francis called George Floyd by name, twice, and offered support to an American bishop who knelt in prayer during a Black Lives Matter protest. Cardinals black and white have spoken out about Floyd's death, and the Vatican's communications juggernaut has shifted into overdrive to draw attention to the cause he now represents.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Floyd's killing at the hands of a white police officer and the global protests denouncing racism and police brutality might have drawn a muted diplomatic response from the Holy See. But in a U.S. election year, the intensity and consistency of the Vatican's reaction suggests that, from the pope on down, it is seeking to encourage anti-racism protesters while making a clear statement about where American Catholics should stand ahead of President Donald Trump's bid for a second term in November.\n\nFrancis wants to send a very clear message to these conservative Catholics here who are pro-Trumpers that, 'Listen, this is just as much of an issue as abortion is,' said Anthea Butler, a presidential visiting fellow at Yale Divinity School.\n\nPope Francis stands with President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, President Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband and White House senior advisor Jared Kushner during a private audience at the Vatican, May 24, 2017. Alessandra Tarantino / AFP/Getty\n\nButler, who is African American, said the Vatican is telling Catholics to pay attention to the racism that is happening and the racism that is in your own church in America.\n\nThe Vatican has long spoken out about racial injustice, and popes dating to Paul VI have voiced support for the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King Jr.'s message of nonviolent protest. History's first pope from the global south is no different. He quoted King at length during his historic speech to the U.S. Congress in 2015 and met with King's daughter, as his predecessor had done.\n\nBut the degree to which Francis and the Vatican have seized on Floyd's killing is unusual and suggests a coordinated messaging strategy aimed at a national church that Francis has long criticized for its political and ideological partisanship, said Alberto Melloni, a church historian and secretary of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies in Bologna, Italy.\n\nIt's not like seven people had the same type of reaction by chance, Melloni said.\n\nLast week, Francis denounced the sin of racism and twice identified Floyd as the victim of a tragic killing. In a message read in Italian and English during his general audience, Francis expressed concerns about violence during the protests, saying it was self-destructive.\n\nSacredness of every human life\n\nHe also said, We cannot close our eyes to any form of racism or exclusion, while pretending to defend the sacredness of every human life.\n\nIt was a clear effort to call out some conservative Catholics for whom the abortion issue is paramount, while other life issues dear to Francis — racism, immigration, the death penalty and poverty — play second fiddle at the ballot box.\n\nFrancis has firmly upheld the church's opposition to abortion. And polls show a plurality of American Catholics support significant restrictions on legal abortion.\n\nBut Francis has also lamented that the U.S. church is obsessed with abortion, contraception and gay marriage to the detriment of its other teachings. Mr. Trump is staking his outreach to Catholic voters largely on his anti-abortion platform.\n\nFrancis spoke out June 3 after Mr. Trump posed in front of an Episcopal church near the White House, Bible in hand, after law enforcement aggressively forced protesters away from a nearby park.\n\nA day later, Mr. Trump visited the St. John Paul II shrine, a visit denounced by the highest-ranking African American prelate in the U.S., Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Washington, D.C., whom Francis appointed to the politically important position last year. Gregory said he found it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated.\n\nIn that vein, the pope's phone call to Texas Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso last week appeared quietly significant. Seitz has taken a leading role in demanding fair treatment for migrants attempting to cross the southern U.S. border, a cause Francis has championed in ways that have fueled tensions with Mr. Trump.\n\nFrancis called Seitz unexpectedly after he was photographed kneeling in prayer at a Black Lives Matter protest. Seitz said the pope thanked him without mentioning the demonstration, but the context was clear: My recent words and actions on the events that are taking place in the country now after Floyd's killing.\n\nA photo provided by the Catholic Diocese of El Paso shows Bishop Mark Seitz, center, kneeling with other demonstrators at Memorial Park holding a Black Lives Matter sign in El Paso, Texas, June 1, 2020. Fernie Ceniceros/Catholic Diocese of El Paso/AP\n\nFrancis was not alone in making the Vatican's views known.\n\nWhile the Holy See would be loath to be seen as picking sides prior to the U.S. election, its media operation has made clear its backing for peaceful protests, denouncing injustices suffered by black Americans and underlining its longtime support of King's message.\n\nSunday's L'Osservatore Romano newspaper featured three Floyd-related stories on its front page. The first was that 1 million people were expected to protest that day in Washington.\n\nA second story was about a video showing two U.S. police officers shoving 75-year-old Martin Gugino, a white Catholic protester, to the ground in Buffalo. Go watch it, please, the article said.\n\nIts third story was about a prayer service presided over by the highest-ranking American at the Vatican, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who decried how America's constitutional ideals were failing its black citizens.\n\nIn an interview, Farrell said he has spoken to Francis in the past about America's race problems, which he saw up close as an auxiliary bishop in Washington. Farrell said Francis is well versed in King and American history.\n\nFrancis knows what the principle was and he knows what the struggle was, Farrell said.\n\nNatalia Imperatori-Lee, a professor of religious studies at Manhattan College, said the Vatican's message is having an effect on American Catholics.\n\nWe are starting to see a kind of fissure emerge, she said. Whether that's going to be long lasting or whether it is a sign of a paradigm shift, I think it's too early to tell.\n\nA poll from the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute last week found that the share of white Catholics holding favorable views of Mr. Trump had dropped by double digits since last year, registering 37% in the last week of May compared with 49% across 2019.\n\nThe test, Imperatori-Lee said, will be if priests are still preaching about racism in six months. And beyond that: I guess we'll know if this works when Catholics go to the polls in November.
You've got the ring and the dress. You've set the date, and perfected the seating chart. But, before you walk down the aisle, you might want to make an appointment for you and your fiance to stop by a wedding therapist.\n\nThere may not be deal-breaking issues preventing your union, but psychotherapist Annie Block Pearl warns that joining lives with someone -- even if you've previously lived with them -- means major changes that could lead to problems past your wedding day.\n\nI realized that people, when they get married, they get involved with the gown, with the planning, with the flowers and how everything is going to look, and don't think as much as the incredible transformation they are going through in their lives, she told CBSNews.com.\n\nPearl emphasizes that wedding therapy -- which is a branch of couples counseling -- isn't just for people who are constantly fighting. Instead, she likes to call it premarital counseling, since the t-word carries such a negative connotation. Clients range from people who are embarking on the marriage journey for the first time to people who have had multiple marriages and don't want to make the same mistakes as they did with their previous spouses.\n\nWhere a wedding therapist comes in is to help couples manage and negotiate what they want both for the big day and for the rest of their lives. Couples need to understand that they are going to still be two separate people, but they will have to collaborate together. While it's easily said, it doesn't mean that the situation is simple.\n\nWhat people don't tell you in advance is that planning a wedding and combining lives tends to be an extraordinarily stressful thing, New York clinical psychologist and wedding therapist Jocelyn Charnas told CBSNews.com. Nine times out of 10, it comes with stress and anxiety, and it can be very difficult to manage that.\n\nPart of what makes getting married so difficult is that two people are bringing their own personal cultures and rituals and are expected to become one unit, Pearl explained. Families impart their own traditions and history, and partners need to compromise and find a new way that combines both people's beliefs. Charnas said this is especially hard today, since a lot of couples are getting married later. They've been their parents' children for a long time, meaning those values are very deeply ingrained. They're in their mid-30s, and they're making this decision to separate individually for the first time, she explained.\n\nWhen you marry someone, you don't just marry them: You really marry who they come from as well, Pearl added. You need to embrace their family's role in their life. It's not a transition that occurs naturally and easily.\n\nOften times, people will take out their stress and anxieties over these issues by over managing their weddings. Charnas has had couples fight over the difference of one word in the wedding invitations, and she tries to get them to understand that it's not about the minutia but perhaps other issues they want to address.\n\nWhat it boils down to for most couples is that they need to get a reality check on their expectations. It's important to know what each person wants from a husband or wife, what kind of lifestyle they want, what kind of family they want, where they seem themselves living and what they see for themselves in the future.\n\nEven if they've lived together for a while, they still may not be concurrent with one another with these pictures, Pearl explained.\n\nShe pointed out the example of her mother, who told her that one of Pearl's friends wasn't going to have a successful marriage because she's not making dinner for her husband every night. While that is what Pearl's mother expected the role of a wife to be, it wasn't the vision the newlywed couple saw for themselves.\n\nPearl said the number one topic that most couples often need to work out revolves around children. While most people will discuss whether they want kids before the big day, couples sometimes don't bring up how many children they want or at what age they want to have them. Whose religion they and their potential offspring are going to follow or if they even want to have a religion is a close second.\n\nCharnas said money and finances -- from who is going to pay for the wedding to how much is appropriate to spend on a wedding to later concerns including joint accounts -- tends to be the number one issue for her clients. Family planning is their second major concern.\n\nYou'd be surprised how many couples don't have those conversations before they get married, Charnas admitted.\n\nBoth therapists emphasize that the goal of wedding therapy isn't to solve problems, but more importantly to stop potential issues from growing into big deals. Charnas pointed out that the problem isn't if couples fight -- because all couples will fight -- but how they deal with the issues they have a divergent opinion on. Wedding therapy gives couples a solid foundation on how to sort through their differences.\n\nThink of it as preventative medicine, she said. We go to the dentist not only when we have a tooth ache, but twice a year to get our teeth cleaned. Think of it as preventative psychology.

A New York Times report alleged seven women have claimed singer-songwriter Ryan Adams offered to help them with their music careers but then turned things sexual, and he sometimes became emotional and verbally abusive.\n\nIn Wednesday's story, titled, Ryan Adams Dangled Success. Women Say They Paid a Price, a 20-year-old female musician said Adams, 44, had inappropriate conversations with her while she was 15 and 16. Identified by her middle name Ava, she said Adams exposed himself during a video call.\n\nAdams' ex-wife, actress and singer Mandy Moore, said Adams was psychologically abusive toward her throughout their marriage. Their divorce was official in 2016.\n\nThe Times said the accounts have been corroborated by family members or friends who were present at the time.\n\nManagers for Adams didn't immediately return an email seeking comment from The Associated Press, but his lawyer denied the claims to the Times.\n\nMr. Adams unequivocally denies that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage, Andrew B.

LOS ANGELES -- Chris Pratt and Anna Faris announced Sunday that they are separating after eight years of marriage, sparking a wave of shock and sadness online about the demise of one of Hollywood's most popular power couples.\n\nThe actors announced their breakup on social media in a joint statement confirmed by Pratt's publicist.\n\nWe tried hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed, the actors wrote. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.\n\nPratt, who stars in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise and Faris, who stars on CBS' comedy Mom, married in 2009. They have a 4-year-old son.\n\nThe actors were publicly supportive of each other in their work and on social media. Pratt guest-starred as Faris' love interest on Mom earlier this year, and the couple laughed and kissed in April when Pratt was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nTheir breakup quickly became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter, where the pair had frequently shared messages about each other and their family.\n\nPratt, 38, has become an international superstar in recent years and is the face of two major franchises: Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy films and a new slate of films based on the Jurassic Park universe.\n\nHe spoke about balancing his home life and his career in an interview with The Associated Press earlier this year before the release of Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, which went on to become a blockbuster.\n\nFor the first part of our relationship, we put our careers at the top, Pratt said of his relationship with Faris. We were like, 'Honey, if you get a job and you have to go to Istanbul for six months, you're going. I'll help you pack. I'll Skype with you every day. You're living your dream, I'm living my dream. That's what we do.'\n\nHe said, at the time, that starring in two major franchises made it easier for them to strategize what roles they would take.\n\nFaris, 40, has starred in Mom for five seasons opposite Emmy-winner Alison Janney. The actresses play mother-daughter who are both recovering drug addicts and are trying to navigate sobriety and relationships together. She is also the voice of the Jailbreak character in recently-released The Emoji Movie.\n\nLegal separation can be a precursor to a divorce filing, but it doesn't mean one is imminent.\n\nSeveral celebrity couples have in recent years announced their separations before filing any legal paperwork. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their separation in June 2015 but didn't file to end their marriage until April. Affleck's younger brother, Casey, and his wife announced they were separating in March 2016, but did not file divorce petitions until July 31.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin announced their breakup in March 2014 and said they were going through a process called conscious uncoupling, but a divorce filing wasn't made until the following month. Their divorce was finalized last year.\n\nComedians Amy Poehler and Will Arnett announced they were separating after nine years of marriage in 2012, but it wasn't until 2014 that a divorce petition was filed. Their divorce was finalized in August 2016.
The letters between poet T.S. Eliot and a woman long-believed to be his muse, Emily Hale, were made public this week, 50 years after her death. The letters reveal an intimate relationship between the two, although Eliot left a statement to be released upon the unveiling of the letters that said, Emily Hale would have killed the poet in me.\n\nEliot and Hale exchanged letters starting in the early 1930s until his second marriage in 1957. The two met in 1912, according to Eliot's statement. Letters from the early 1930s — contained in the first of 14 boxes — show Eliot confessing his love for her, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThey are extremely passionate, said Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, who was among the first people to see the letters. It's really more than what I expected. They are very emotional, claiming that she inspired a lot of his poetry. She obviously played a really important role in his poetic life.\n\nEliot's copies of his letters were destroyed by a colleague at his request. Hale donated her letters to Princeton University, to be unsealed 50 years after they both died — Eliot died in 1965, and Hale in 1969. The 1,100 letters were first taken out of the wooden boxes that housed them in October, and were made available for public viewing on Thursday.\n\nEmily Hale and T.S. Eliot pose in a 1946 family photo in Dorset, Vermont. After more than 60 years of sitting sealed up in a storage facility at Princeton University Library, about 1,000 letters written by poet T.S. Eliot to confidante Emily Hale will be unveiled, revealing the extent of their relationship that scholars have speculated about for decades. Princeton University Library via AP\n\nThere are still hundreds to be read.\n\nYou have made me perfectly happy: that is, happier than I have ever been in my life, Eliot wrote in one of the letters, according to The Guardian. I tried to pretend that my love for you was dead, though I could only do so by pretending myself that my heart was dead.\n\nEliot said in his statement that he believed he told Hale he loved her before he left for Germany and France in 1914. But, in 1915, he married a woman named Vivienne Haigh-Wood, who suffered from mental illness. Eliot and Haigh-Wood separated in 1933. Hale and Eliot reconnected when he visited California in the early 1930s.\n\nEliot said he realized later his marriage brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land and it saved me from marrying Emily Hale.\n\nEmily Hale would have killed the poet in me; Vivienne nearly was the death of me, but she kept the poet alive, Eliot said. In retrospect, the nightmare agony of my seventeen years with Vivienne seems to me preferable to the dull misery of the mediocre teacher of philosophy which would have been the alternative.\n\nDespite the intimacy of the letters, Eliot said in his statement that as time went on, he realized more and more how little Emily Hale and I had in common. Further, he writes, I never at any time had any sexual relations with Emily Hale.\n\nI had already observed that she was not a lover of poetry, certainly that she was not much interested in my poetry; I had already been worried by what seemed to me evidence of insensitiveness and bad taste, he wrote. It may be too harsh, to think that what she liked was my reputation rather than my work.\n\nEliot scholar Anthony Cuda told the AP that was a cold and untrue statement.\n\nHe pursued her, he said. His earliest letters were ardent declarations of love. It's not as if she chased after him.\n\nAfter his first wife's death in 1947, Eliot said he began to realize he no longer loved Hale. I came to see that my love for Emily was the love of a ghost for a ghost, and that the letters I had been writing to her were the letters of an hallucinated man, a man vainly trying to pretend to himself that he was the same man that he had been in 1914, Eliot said.\n\nMichael Wood, an emeritus professor of English at Princeton, who was present when the letters were unsealed in October, told The New York Times it was a big surprise that Eliot was so angry.\n\nI don't know what he's trying to do, Wood said. He's trying to tell a story that he thinks would correct the story the letters would tell on their own. He seems to have rewritten the whole relationship with Emily.\n\nIn this Oct. 14, 2019, photo, letters between poet T.S. Eliot and longtime confidante Emily Hale are displayed in Princeton, N.J. Thursday, Jan. 2, 2020 marks the first day that students, researchers and scholars can go to the Ivy League school in New Jersey to see these letters that many are saying may reveal more intimate details about Eliot's life and work. Shelley Szwast/Princeton University Library via AP\n\nCuda said Eliot wrote the harsh statement because he feared the embargo would be broken.\n\nHe was looking back on this and felt embarrassed and ashamed at the openness and vulnerability he allowed to come through at the time, Cuda said. He tried to do damage control.\n\nCuda said Eliot also wanted to protect his second wife, Valerie, who he said transformed the world for him.\n\nBut it's a strange protectiveness, Cuda said. He was so devoted to Valerie and she to him. What the Emily Hale letters reveal - (Valerie) wasn't the unique love of his life. He had a unique and tense experience before her.\n\nThe letters also reveal other private details of Eliot's life, including his craving for alcohol.\n\nCuda said the letters are all we could have hoped for.
For one famous football player of the recent past, to prevail in games on the field he first had to prevail in some mind games in his own head. Armen Keteyian paid him a visit:\n\nWatch him hang out with his family in the backyard, and you get glimpses of the athletic grace and swagger that lifted Steve Young into pro football's Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 15 seasons in the NFL, Young redefined the position of quarterback as a double-edged sword, carving up teams with his arm and legs.\n\nHe told Keteyian that he had a voice in his head before the games: A loud one!\n\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt\n\nBut what teammates and fans never saw was the battle Young fought just to get himself on the field, now revealed in a new memoir, QB: My Life Behind the Spiral (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt).\n\nAt its worst, Keteyian asked, how did it make you feel?\n\nYou wake up and you see the crack of the morning dawn, and you're like, 'Ohhhhhh.' And you'd have this dread, like, 'Ohhhh, not another one.'\n\nFrom the very beginning, Young kept his anxiety secret. At Greenwich High in Connecticut, he was a straight-A student; captain of the football, baseball AND basketball teams; and a devout Mormon -- the great-great-great-grandson, no less, of Brigham Young, the pioneering leader who brought the faith to Utah.\n\nAt Brigham Young University he rose from 8th-string quarterback to All-American.\n\nIn the pros he earned the nickname Crash for his kamikaze style of play -- a quarterback who refused to go down easy, as he showed in the 1988 run that announced his arrival in San Francisco:\n\nAt its root, Young said, is this desperation, like, I gotta make something happen. So why not run out of bounds? Well, because I can't run out of bounds!\n\nNot an option?\n\nStuff's gotta happen!\n\nYoung actually began his pro career in 1984 in the short-lived United States Football League, where he quickly earned another nickname before he stepped on the field for the L.A. Express, coming in as the $40 million man. Biggest contract in the history of pro sports -- you're tormented by it, Keteyian said.\n\nBrutal! he said. The idea that I had to carry this horrific, in my mind, weight of being highly-paid and the expectations that come with that -- it just felt too much.\n\nFormer quarterback Steve Young with correspondent Armen Ketetyian. CBS News\n\nThe expectations were just beginning.\n\nWhen the USFL folded two years later, Young headed to Tampa Bay and then the 49ers, and a storied rivalry with four-time Super Bowl champ Joe Montana, a saint in San Francisco. That only added to the voices roaring inside Young's head.\n\nOnly one of his teammates knew the extent of Young's anxiety: Brent Jones. This guy's the man, he's one of the best quarterbacks in the league, Jones said. What does he have to be anxious over, or fearful of?\n\nJones, who played 11 seasons as a tight end with the 49ers, became Young's best friend, confidante and pre-game shrink.\n\nWe spent 10 years of our life in room 9043 at the Marriott, Jones said.\n\nAt the hotel in the shadow of Candlestick Park -- the 49ers' home field during Young's entire career -- every player had his own room. Everyone, except Young and Jones.\n\nThe thing that used to drive me most crazy, Armen, was he never, ever wanted to watch football, said Jones.\n\nAnd I'm like, that's the last thing I could -- like, get me a movie! Young said. Get me something to take my mind off of it. And the guy would just turn the football off and put on a movie … 'City Slickers,' for a lot of weeks.\n\nI knew every line, every word, Jones said. I'm like, 'Dude, are we seriously gonna watch 'City Slickers' again?' He'd go, 'Yup. Yup.'\n\nThen they'd go over game plans, marriage plans, anything and everything, just to get Young ready for game-day.\n\nLots of second-guessing, lots of talking, lots of going over things, said Jones. It's funny, because I think a lot of guys on our team thought that I was his roommate so I could get in his ear about throwing me more passes!\n\nYoung eventually saw a psychiatrist, who diagnosed a fiendish form of separation anxiety-turned-pre-performance anxiety buried in the roots of the family tree.\n\nAs a kid, I was fearless during the day, Young said. But at nighttime, I needed to be home. People would say, 'Hey, sleep over Eddie's house.' 'No.' I don't want to do that. I didn't know what that was. But as I learned in my 30s, it's a genetic thing. It's sprinkled all throughout my mom's family.\n\nWhether despite or perhaps because of his inner demons, by the end of his career Young would be a two-time league Most Valuable Player, and Super Bowl champion.\n\nBut there was another part of the Steve Young puzzle that had been missing. He had become a world-famous face of the Mormon church, and 60 Minutes wanted to talk to him when it profiled the church. Correspondent Mike Wallace zeroed in. The then-34-year-old was still single, and looking hard for a Mormon mate.\n\nBrigham Young once said, right here on these grounds, that anyone over 27 years of age that's not married is a menace to society, Young told Wallace. So here's my grandfather telling me to get with it. You don't think I feel the pressure?\n\nThree years after that 60 Minutes interview, as Young's pro career was winding down, he met a model named Barbara Graham.\n\nHe was such an anomaly from what I knew of other athletes, Barbara said. I had friends who dated athletes then. And he just was so intelligent and so grounded and so spiritual, and we would talk for hours.\n\nA year later, they were married, and now have four children.\n\nToday, Young is still a Mormon cover boy. But the shortness of breath, the sleepless nights, the voices in his head, he says, are long gone.\n\nIt really is in the rearview mirror, he said. My life is completely different. And that part of anxiety, I just don't feel it.\n\nThe anxiety may be a memory. But the spirit of the quarterback who wouldn't give up, remains.\n\nHe's all-in, said Barbara Young. He is 100% all-in in everything he does. I'm gonna cry. He's not gonna take a knee. He's not gonna slide. He's gonna turn in always. And he'll take on anything head-on.\n\n\n\nFor more info:
In a number of ways, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding is a gift to their nation that keeps on giving. In addition to directing would-be gift givers to seven charities of their choosing instead, it was just revealed that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex donated their nuptial flowers to the patients at St. Joseph's Hospice in London.\n\nOur hospice smells and looks gorgeous, a post from St. Joseph's read on Facebook. Such a lovely gesture.\n\nPauline Clayton holding a bouquet of royal wedding flowers. St. Joseph's Hospice, Hackney\n\nOne of the patients at St. Joseph's, Pauline Clayton, is no stranger to royal family weddings. As a 19-year-old, Clayton, now 89, worked for royal dressmaker Norman Hartnell and helped embroider the wedding dress of Queen Elizabeth II, according to the BBC. Clayton worked with three other girls, earning nearly 50 hours overtime on the dress' train alone.\n\nI really liked working for the Queen Mother and I helped to make many of her dresses during my 20-year career with Norman, she told the BBC. With my royal connections it's such a lovely coincidence to be at St. Joseph's and receive these wedding flowers.\n\nThe hospice has historically been a cause of royal patronage, dating back to its founding in 1905 with support from Queen Alexandra and Princess Victoria.\n\nPrince Harry hand picked his bride's bouquet himself, containing white roses and forget-me-nots from the private garden at Kensington Palace.\n\nWe are learning more about Meghan Markle's wedding dress -- including the flowers that she carried. Prince Harry picked flowers for the bouquet from Kensington palace's garden yesterday. It included forget-me-nots, Princess Diana's favorite flower https://t.co/OvLScRZ1ps pic.twitter.com/RCA03cG9QT — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 19, 2018\n\nThe flowers were favorites of the late Princess Diana, and the bouquet, in royal wedding tradition, was laid at Westminster Abbey's famed grave of the unknown warrior.

He's traveled thousands of miles from home, trekking through some of the world's roughest and most dangerous territory in search of a new life. But when Shahab Shahbazi finally crossed the U.S. border and asked for asylum, he discovered his journey was far from over.\n\nWe first met Shahab in the spring of 2017 as he, along with a small group of other migrants and the smugglers guiding them, hiked through the Darién Gap, an unforgiving swath of jungle straddling the border between Colombia and Panama.\n\nShahab said he had fled his homeland, Iran, after being beaten and jailed for converting from Islam to Christianity. After a stay in Venezuela, he was determined to reach the United States.\n\nI got to go. I need life. I need more life, he told CBS News' Adam Yamaguchi of his quest, which was chronicled last year in the CBSN Originals documentary The Darién Gap: A Desperate Journey to America.\n\nAt that point he still had over 2,000 miles to go and seven more borders to cross. Many don't make it. But Shahab survived the grueling journey. When Yamaguchi caught up with him again two months later in Tijuana, Mexico, he said faith had gotten him through.\n\nGod helped me. Jesus Christ helped me. It's very good. Thanks to God, he said.\n\nShahab Shahbazi in the jungle of the Darién Gap in the spring of 2017, part of his arduous journey to the U.S. CBS News\n\nAs Shahab approached the U.S. border crossing and asked officers for entry into the country on humanitarian grounds, he joined a growing number of migrants seeking asylum in the United States. Unlike other immigrants who may want to move to the U.S. for jobs or personal reasons, those seeking asylum come here in fear for their lives.\n\nAmerica grants asylum protection to those who can prove that they fled their countries based on a credible fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.\n\nFor Shahab, that was religious persecution as a Christian in Iran. For many others, including members of a group that made headlines this spring in a caravan heading for the border, the threat is rampant violence in Central American nations like El Salvador and Honduras.\n\nSeeking asylum is not a privilege, it's a right, said Luís Mancheno, an immigration lawyer with The Bronx Defenders in New York. Every single human being in the world has that right. People think it's a gift. It's not. It's an obligation.\n\nThat obligation is laid out in federal law as well as United Nations agreements signed by the U.S. and more than 140 other nations on the treatment of refugees.\n\nMancheno has a personal connection to the asylum process. In 2009, he was attacked for being gay in his home country of Ecuador. He sought asylum in the U.S., and is now an American citizen.\n\nYamaguchi asked him about the process — and the perception that some people try to take advantage of it.\n\nA.Y.: When we were trudging through the jungle a number of people said the U.S. was the place to seek asylum because it was easier and you'd be entitled to more. If we make it too easy or too appealing, we're just gonna attract more and more people who may not necessarily need to be in the U.S. L.M.: If I would make you speak to any of my clients who are seeking asylum here the last thing they would say that it's easy. It's a very long and complicated process. A.Y.: So you wrote here recently in this essay, Don't come here if you have no place to go. Don't pick this country, it is not safe for you anymore. For somebody who came here and found refuge, to write this message ostensibly to other asylum seekers, is pretty powerful. L.M.: It's me screaming for help, in desperation. I think that I'm also trying to inform the people, my fellow asylum seekers coming to the U.S., that it is not as easy, not as great as people paint.\n\nShahab spent six months in immigration detention after he asked for asylum. That's a routine procedure while the government investigates an asylum seeker's claims of fear of persecution.\n\nThe number of these credible fear screenings, as they're called, increased from about 5,000 a decade ago to over 95,000 in 2016, according to DHS.* The surge has led to overcrowding in detention facilities and a massive backlog in the system. The process can drag on for years, with a growing number of asylum seekers being released into the community while their cases are still pending.\n\nBy March of 2018, Shahab was living in San Diego and feeling deeply discouraged.\n\nBefore, I'm thinking America is very, very perfect. But right now I'm looking — not perfect. I'm nervous because I don't know. I don't know nothing about my future, he said.\n\nShahab Shahbazi says he left Iran to escape persecution after converting from Islam to Christianity. CBS News\n\nHe is required to check in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials every two weeks. And for the time being, he does not have permission to work. Without any income or family, he gets by with help from fellow asylum seekers he met in detention and the occasional kindness of strangers. A friend of a friend lets him sleep on his couch.\n\nI feel very poor because I need job, he said. He thought he might get some help from the government, but nothing, nothing.\n\nIs he happy he came?\n\nHappy for what? he sighs. When I can say 'I'm happy'? [If] I have a job, I have future, I have something. Right now, I can't say. I can't say I'm happy or not. No, I'm not happy right now.\n\nLuís Mancheno understands. It's not easy to leave your home, to leave your family, to leave your community, to leave your language, he said. Desperate migrants have no real understanding of what our asylum laws are, but all they know is that if they don't come to the U.S., their lives will end.\n\nIn detention, Shahab met Reza Kavali, an asylum seeker from Afghanistan who's fighting a deportation order from 2017. Reza is hoping to get the immigration court to recognize his recent marriage to an American woman named Christina and let him stay.\n\nLike all those released from detention, he's required to wear ankle bracelets equipped with GPS trackers. The devices blare loud alerts if he forgets to change the batteries every eight hours, which Reza considers worse than being in jail because people look at you [like] you are criminal. He tries to avoid leaving the apartment except to attend English classes nearby.\n\nI want to live this country so I have to speak English. Yeah. I have to learn it, he said.\n\nReza Kavali fled Afghanistan and met his wife Christina in the U.S. CBS News\n\nHe and Shahab swap insights into the sometimes inscrutable asylum process. Asylum seekers are not legally entitled to an attorney, and lacking money or resources, a majority end up facing the immigration judge and government lawyer alone. Fewer than 4 percent of those without attorneys win their case, compared to a 70 percent success rate for those with a lawyer.\n\nThe burden is on asylum seekers to prove they'd face genuine peril if they were sent back.\n\nHarmed, killed, tortured — for example in Iran, if you're born Muslim and you convert to Christianity, the law says they're allowed to execute you. They're allowed to kill you. They're allowed put you in prison, said Reza's attorney, Natalie Ghayoumi.\n\nReza and Shahab's cases are just two among roughly 700,000 asylum claims that are currently in the backlog nationwide, and more people are arriving every day. Some are held up for weeks at the border; immigration officials say facilities are stretched beyond capacity.\n\nWhen the migrant caravan arrived in April amid a swirl of media attention and political debate, several hundred people — including many children — took shelter in bare-bones conditions, sleeping on the floor and seeking guidance on their next steps.\n\nThe caravan of migrants in Tijuana included many children. CBS News\n\nThe first thing that the person does, he says, 'I am here in the U.S., I am not in my country of origin, and I am afraid of going back to my home country because I'm being persecuted, Mancheno explained.\n\nA few weeks ahead of his next court date, Shahab has managed to secure a lawyer free of charge and is feeling better about his prospects.\n\nOver a dinner of take-out enchiladas, Yamaguchi raised a difficult question. You were in jail for six months. You had security, you had food, you had medical care. American taxpayers, who work and pay taxes, that's our money paying for your services. So a lot of people say, 'Just go home. Why do I have to pay for you?'\n\nToday you help me, tomorrow I help in another way, Shahab replied. Another tomorrow, helping other ways, you know? So if you're feeling you're human, you have to help everybody.\n\nSo you think you can help America?\n\nYeah. Of course. Why not?\n\nYet when asked if he'd advise would-be migrants in Tijuana to follow in his footsteps and seek asylum in the U.S., he hesitates.\n\nI don't know. It's so hard. Not easy, he said. But America has very good security for people. America is good.\n\n* Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that there were over 95,000 credible fear screening referrals as of 2016, not 10,000.\n\nHow to help\n\nMany groups in communities around the country offer humanitarian assistance, educational resources, and legal aid to asylum seekers.

TOKYO -- Japan's Cabinet approved Friday a bill to let 83-year-old Emperor Akihito abdicate and allow his elder son Crown Prince Naruhito to ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne.\n\nThe abdication would be Japan's first in 200 years.\n\nAkihito indicated his desire to abdicate due to his age and health concerns last August, reviving a longstanding debate in Japan over the issue of imperial succession in the 2,000-year-old monarchy.\n\nAkihito was 56 years old when he ascended the throne in January 1989 after the death of his father, Emperor Hirohito. Naruhito is 57.\n\nWomen cannot succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne, and the government has avoided divisive issues such as whether women should be included in the current male-only succession.\n\nThe only child of Naruhito is a girl. His younger brother Prince Akishino has a young son and two daughters.\n\nThe shrinking royal family will lose another member with the coming marriage of Princess Mako, one of Akishino's daughters. When she marries a commoner, she will become one herself.\n\nJapanese Princess Mako leaving her home in Tokyo on May 18, 2017 Str / AFP/Getty Images\n\nChief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga told reporters he expected smooth passage of the abdication bill, which would only apply to Akihito. Media reports have said officials are considering his abdication at the end of 2018, when Akihito turns 85 and marks 30 years on the throne. Suga refused to comment on timing and other details of the legislation.\n\nThe legislation for Akihito's case was needed because the Imperial House Law does not provide for abdication. The last emperor to abdicate was Kokaku in 1817.
Former Vice President Joe Biden was cheered Saturday by a crowd at the Delaware Democratic Party dinner where he said he has the most progressive record of anybody running. He quickly corrected himself and said, anybody who would run — and then added, I didn't mean it.\n\nBiden is one of the last high-profile holdouts in the race for the Democratic nomination after former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke announced Thursday that he was running for president. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons told CBS News podcast The Takeout recently that Biden is 95 percent ready to run for president and an announcement should be coming in the coming weeks.\n\nSome of the Democrats who have already jumped into the race have highlighted their progressive records, especially Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nBiden has faced criticism from the left-wing of the Democratic party, especially after he called Vice President Mike Pence a decent guy. He acknowledged in his speech Saturday that he gets criticized by the new left, but he said we don't treat the opposition as the enemy.\n\nWe Democrats, we choose hope over fear, we choose unity over division, and we choose truth over lies, Biden said. Folks it's still our century, we have to remember that.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the First State Democratic Dinner in Dover, Delaware, on Sat. March 16, 2019. Reuters\n\nBiden also repeatedly railed against President Trump for stoking division and anger.\n\nAs Americans, we are much bigger than ourselves and this president snares at those values and thinks that we are weak, but he is wrong ... it is these values that make our country strong and you can't define any American by religion race or gender, Biden said.\n\nBiden, 76, has long been known for gaffes — in 2012, he said he was absolutely comfortable with legalizing gay marriage. The comment sent the White House scrambling since then-President Obama had yet to actually publicly declare his support, according to Jo Becker's book Forcing the Spring. Mr. Obama said later that Biden had got out a little bit over his skis, but out of generosity of spirit.
Phil Spector, the eccentric and revolutionary music producer who transformed rock music with his Wall of Sound method and who later was convicted of murder, has died. He was 81.\n\nCalifornia state prison officials said he died Saturday of natural causes at a hospital.\n\nSpector was convicted of murdering actress Lana Clarkson in 2003 at his castle-like mansion on the edge of Los Angeles. After a trial in 2009, he was sentenced to 19 years to life.\n\nWhile most sources give Spector's birth date as 1940, it was listed as 1939 in court documents following his arrest. His lawyer subsequently confirmed that date to The Associated Press.\n\nMusic producer Phil Spector seen Friday, May 29, 2009. Jae C. Hong, Pool via AP\n\nClarkson, star of Barbarian Queen and other B-movies, was found shot to death in the foyer of Spector's mansion in the hills overlooking Alhambra, a modest suburban town on the edge of Los Angeles.\n\nUntil the actress' death, which Spector maintained was an accidental suicide, few residents even knew the mansion belonged to the reclusive producer, who spent his remaining years in a prison hospital east of Stockton.\n\nDecades before, Spector had been hailed as a visionary for channeling Wagnerian ambition into the three-minute song, creating the Wall of Sound that merged spirited vocal harmonies with lavish orchestral arrangements to produce such pop monuments as Da Doo Ron Ron, Be My Baby and He's a Rebel.\n\nHe was the rare self-conscious artist in rock's early years and cultivated an image of mystery and power with his dark shades and impassive expression.\n\nTom Wolfe declared him the first tycoon of teen. Bruce Springsteen and Brian Wilson openly replicated his grandiose recording techniques and wide-eyed romanticism, and John Lennon called him the greatest record producer ever.\n\nThe secret to his sound: an overdubbed onslaught of instruments, vocals and sound effects that changed the way pop records were recorded. He called the result, Little symphonies for the kids.\n\nBy his mid-20s his little symphonies had resulted in nearly two dozen hit singles and made him a millionaire. You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling, the operatic Righteous Brothers ballad which topped the charts in 1965, has been tabulated as the song most played on radio and television — counting the many cover versions — in the 20th century.\n\nBut thanks in part to the arrival of the Beatles, his chart success would soon fade. When River Deep-Mountain High, an aptly-named 1966 release that featured Tina Turner, failed to catch on, Spector shut down his record label and withdrew from the business for three years. He would go on to produce the Beatles and Lennon among others, but he was now serving the artists, instead of the other way around.\n\nIn 1969, Spector was called in to salvage the Beatles' Let It Be album, a troubled back to basics production marked by dissension within the band. Although Lennon praised Spector's work, bandmate Paul McCartney was enraged, especially when Spector added strings and a choir to McCartney's The Long and Winding Road. Years later, McCartney would oversee a remastered Let it Be, removing Spector's contributions.\n\nA documentary of the making of Lennon's 1971 Imagine album showed the ex-Beatle clearly in charge, prodding Spector over a backing vocal, a line none of Spector's early artists would have dared cross.\n\nSpector worked on George Harrison's acclaimed post-Beatles triple album, All Things Must Pass, co-produced Lennon's Imagine, and the less successful Some Time in New York City, which included Spector's picture over a caption that read, To Know Him is to Love Him.\n\nSpector also had a memorable film role, a cameo as a drug dealer in Easy Rider. The producer himself was played by Al Pacino in a 2013 HBO movie.\n\nThe volume, and violence, of Spector's music reflected a dark side he could barely contain even at his peak. He was imperious, temperamental and dangerous, remembered bitterly by Darlene Love, Ronnie Spector and others who worked with him.\n\nYears of stories of his waving guns at recording artists in the studio and threatening women would come back to haunt him after Clarkson's death.\n\nAccording to witnesses she had agreed, somewhat reluctantly, to accompany him home from the Sunset Strip's House of Blues in West Hollywood, where she worked Shortly after their arrival in Alhambra in the pre-dawn hours of February 3, 2003, a chauffeur reported Spector came out of the house holding a gun, blood on his hands, and told him, I think I killed somebody.\n\nHe would later tell friends Clarkson had shot herself. The case was fraught with mystery, and it took authorities a year to file charges. In the meantime, Spector remained free on $1 million bail.\n\nWhen he was finally indicted for murder, he lashed out at authorities, angrily telling reporters: The actions of the Hitler-like DA and his storm trooper henchmen are reprehensible, unconscionable and despicable.\n\nAs a defendant, his eccentricity took center stage. He would arrive in court for pretrial hearings in theatrical outfits, usually featuring high-heeled boots, frock coats and wildly styled wigs. He arrived at one hearing in a chauffeur-driven stretch Hummer.\n\nOnce the 2007 trial began, however, he toned down his attire. It ended in a 10-2 deadlock leaning toward conviction. His defense had argued that the actress, despondent about her fading career, shot herself through the mouth. A retrial got underway in October 2008.\n\nHarvey Phillip Spector, in his mid-60s when he was charged with murder, had been born on Dec. 26, 1939, in New York City's borough of the Bronx. Bernard Spector, his father, was an ironworker. His mother, Bertha, was a seamstress. In 1947, Spector's father committed suicide because of family indebtedness, an event that would shape his son's life in many ways.\n\nFour years later, Spector's mother moved the family to Los Angeles, where Phil attended Fairfax High School, located in a largely Jewish neighborhood on the edge of Hollywood. For decades the school has been a source of future musical talent. At Fairfax, Spector performed in talent shows and formed a group called the Teddy Bears with friends.\n\nHe was reserved and insecure, but his musical abilities were obvious. He had perfect pitch and easily learned to play several instruments. He was just 17 when his group recorded its first hit single, a romantic ballad written and produced by Spector that would become a pop classic: To Know Him is to Love Him, was inspired by the inscription on his father's tombstone.\n\nA short, skinny kid with big dreams and growing demons, Spector went on to attend the University of California, Los Angeles for a year before dropping out to return to New York. He briefly considered becoming a French interpreter at the United Nations before falling in with the musicians at New York's celebrated Brill Building. The Broadway edifice was then at the heart of popular music's Tin Pan Alley, where writers, composers, singers and musicians turned out hit songs.\n\nHe began working with star composers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who had met at Fairfax High a few years before Spector arrived. Ultimately, he found his niche in producing. During this period he also co-wrote the hit song, Spanish Harlem, with Ben E. King, and played lead guitar on the Drifters' On Broadway.\n\nI had come back to New York from California where there were all these green lawns and trees, and there was just this poverty and decay in Harlem, he would recall later. The song was an expression of hope and faith in the young people of Harlem ... that there would be better times ahead.\n\nFor a time he had his own production company, Philles Records, with partner Lester Silles, where he developed his signature sound. He assembled such respected studio musicians as arranger Jack Nitzsche, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, pianist Leon Russell and drummer Hal Blaine, and gave early breaks to Glen Campbell, Sonny Bono and Bono's future wife, Cher.\n\nIn the early 1960s, he had hit after hit and one notable flop: the album A Christmas Gift to You, released, tragically, on Nov. 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was assassinated, the worst possible time for such a joyous record. A Christmas Gift, featuring the Ronettes singing Frosty the Snowman and Love's version of White Christmas, is now considered a classic and a perennial radio favorite during the holiday season.\n\nSpector's domestic life, along with his career, eventually came apart. After his first marriage, to Annette Merar, broke up, Ronettes leader singer Ronnie Bennett became his girlfriend and muse. He married her in 1968 and they adopted three children. But she divorced him after six years, claiming in a memoir that he held her prisoner in their mansion, where she said he kept a gold coffin in the basement and told her he would kill her and put her in it if she ever tried to leave him.\n\nWhen the Ronettes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, Spector sent along his congratulations. But in an acceptance speech by his ex-wife, she never mentioned him while thanking numerous other people.\n\nDarlene Love also feuded with him, accusing Spector of failing to credit her for her vocals on He's a Rebel and other songs, but she did praise him when inducted into the Hall.\n\nSpector himself became a Hall member in 1989. As his marriages deteriorated, recording artists also began to quit working with Spector and musical styles passed him by.\n\nHe preferred singles to albums, calling the latter, Two hits and 10 pieces of junk. He initially refused to record his music in multichannel stereo, claiming the process damaged the sound. A Spector box set retrospective was called Back to Mono.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Spector had largely retreated from the music business. He would emerge occasionally to work on special projects, including Leonard Cohen's album, Death of a Ladies' Man and The Ramones' End of the Century. Both were marred by reports of Spector's instability.\n\nIn 1973, Lennon worked on an album of rock 'n roll oldies with Spector, only to have Spector disappear with the tapes. The finished work, Rock 'n' Roll, didn't come out until 1975.\n\nIn 1982 Spector married Janis Lynn Zavala and the couple had twins, Nicole and Phillip Jr. The boy died at age 10 of leukemia.\n\nSix months before his first murder trial began, Spector married Rachelle Short, a 26-year-old singer and actress who accompanied him to court every day. He filed for divorce in 2016.\n\nIn a 2005 court deposition, he testified that he had been on medication for manic depression for eight years.\n\nNo sleep, depression, mood changes, mood swings, hard to live with, hard to concentrate, just hard — a hard time getting through life, he said. I've been called a genius and I think a genius is not there all the time and has borderline insanity.
Want to ride like a big-time mafia boss? You can. But it comes with a price. Al Capone's former vehicle, a bulletproof 1928 Cadillac, has been listed for $1 million.\n\nCelebrity Cars, the company selling the vehicle, says the infamous gangster's car is among the earliest surviving bulletproof vehicles, fitted with glass almost an inch thick and lined with nearly 3,000 pounds of armor plating. The four-speed manual transmission vehicle has logged 1,111 miles.\n\nCapone apparently purchased the Cadillac from Emil Denemark, a relative by marriage who owned a dealership in Chicago. According to Celebrity Cars, it has a rear window rigged to drop quickly, allowing occupants to fire upon would-be pursuers. The modified windows are also designed so the glass can be raised an extra inch or so, revealing a circular cutout large enough to accommodate the muzzle of a machine gun.\n\nCelebrity Cars says the Cadillac's history has been documented since 1932 and can be tracked through references in old newspapers, IRS records, and accounts provided by its more recent owners. The car was initially armored in a body shop owned by Ernest Capstran, his son Richard Capstran told Celebrity Cars.\n\nAccording to Capstran, when the scope of the work was explained, his father said, 'We don't do that kind of work here.' And they (Capone's men) said 'you do now.' He also said that when the car was dropped off, Capone's men directed that the car be backed into the shop so no passersby could see the nature of the work being carried out.\n\nCapone showed up in person to settle the bill and paid Ernest Capstran double the asking price, Celebrity Cars says on its website.\n\nAl Capone was one of the most notorious gangster in American history. During the height of Prohibition, Capone's multimillion-dollar Chicago operation in bootlegging, prostitution and gambling dominated the organized crime scene. Capone had built a fearsome reputation in the ruthless gang rivalries of the period, according to the FBI, until he was finally busted on tax evasion charges.
How did Meghan Markle become the world's most talked about celebrity?\n\nAuthor Andrew Morton -- the man behind the 1992 book Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words -- is turning his attention to a new royal in Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, out now. The unauthorized biography takes a look at the 36-year-old actress' life before she got engaged to Prince Harry.\n\nWhile Morton did not interview Meghan herself, he did speak with former childhood friends, old coworkers and estranged family members to offer insight into her California upbringing as well as her struggle to make it in Hollywood.\n\nHere are the biggest bombshells from Morton's book:\n\n1. Meghan saw Princess Diana as a role model\n\nAccording to the book, at age 16, Meghan watched the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana with her friends, and it quickly became a topic of discussion at her high school, Immaculate Heart, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nMorton claims that Meghan and her friend, Suzy Ardakani, became fascinated with the royals and went back and watched Diana's wedding to Harry's father, Prince Charles, in 1981.\n\nShe saw [Diana] as a role model. Inspired by the princess, she and Suzy collected clothes and toys for less privileged children, Morton writes. In fact, such was Meghan's interest that Suzy's mother, Sonia, even gave her a copy of my biography, Diana: Her True Story, which remained on her bookshelves for the next few years.\n\n2. How being a child of divorce impacted her\n\nLike Harry, Meghan's parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Radlan, also divorced when she was very young. She was just two years old when they separated and seems to have split her childhood pretty equally among her two parents.\n\nI know that was difficult for her, a former teacher from her high school is quoted as saying. One parent over here, one over there, neither particularly fond of each other.\n\nBeing a child of divorce did come with some life lessons. She is very poised, a former school friend says. It could be hard for her. Sometimes she felt she had to pick sides.\n\n3. Meghan didn't seem that into her Deal or No Deal gig\n\nMeghan became briefcase girl number 24 in season two of the hit game show hosted by Howie Mandel. According to another briefcase girl at the time, Tameka Jacobs, the job paid $800 per episode.\n\nShe was a super sweet, adorable, a little sheltered, wholesome with a good head on her shoulders, Tameka tells Morton. Looking back, it was clear that she had a brand and wanted to protect that brand for a future career as a serious actor.\n\nThe future royal seemed to keep some distance from her coworkers and for that, she stood out. According to Morton, she never joined in nights out in West Hollywood, never brought her boyfriend to the set like the other women, avoided office gossip and indulged in pizza or bags of chips while the other women sucked hard candy and ate raw vegetables backstage.\n\n4. Before The Tig, Meghan had a secret blog\n\nAs a struggling actress looking for her next big break, Meghan needed an outlet to express herself. She started an anonymous blog called Working Actress in January 2010. While Meghan never confirmed that she was the one behind it, Morton's sources identified The Suits star as the writer.\n\nAnd a sampling of the posts don't sound too far off from the voice Meghan cultivated on her lifestyle blog, The Tig: I'm not gonna lie. I've spent many days curled up in bed with a loaf of bread and some wine. A one-woman pity party. It's awful and ridiculous ... All you're doing is setting yourself up for heartbreak.\n\nAlso like The Tig, Working Actress was short-lived, shutting down in 2012.\n\n5. Inside Meghan's first marriage\n\nBefore Prince Harry swept her off her feet, Meghan met film producer Trevor Engelson in a West Hollywood dive bar. A hustler born in Great Neck, New York, his drive to succeed in Hollywood matched Meghan's perfectly -- with her running to audition after audition, while he read script after script looking for his next big hit.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Trevor whisked Meghan away to a beach resort in Belize just after she finished shooting the pilot for Suits\n\nin New York City. It was here that he proposed (no cozy night roasting a chicken here!) after six years of dating.\n\nOn Sept. 10, 2011, the two married at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios. It was such a moving wedding, recalls one of her bridesmaids in the book. I started crying the moment I saw her in her dress.\n\nThe book notes that the two recited vows that they had written themselves and the ceremony ended with the traditional Jewish Hava Nagila, sung while the bride and groom were lifted up in chairs. In addition, there were also numerous parties and beach wheelbarrow races. And best of all? Meghan was able to outsource all the wedding planning to the in-house wedding coordinator. Quite a different story from Meghan's current situation.\n\n6. Can Meghan's divorce be traced back to a $500 blender?\n\nWhile many describe the end of Meghan and Trevor's divorce as sudden, Morton writes that it all became clear one fateful day: when Meghan packed up the $500 Vitamix blender from the couple's L.A. home and moved it to Toronto, where she was relocating to shoot Suits.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Morton claims Meghan's friends told him that they were shocked to learn that she and Trevor were divorcing after two years of marriage.\n\nAccording to one source in the book, Meghan sent her diamond wedding and engagement rings back to Trevor by registered post. Another source claims that her decision to end her marriage felt like it came totally out of the blue.\n\nAbby Wathen, who costarred with Meghan in a low budget movie, offers this take on the split: We both went through divorce, so we bounded on that too. I was destroyed, but she was empowered. She took her power back. It wasn't the right relationship for her, so she moved on.\n\n7. When Harry met Meghan ...\n\nWe all know the of the royal couple's fated meeting by now -- a blind date set up by Violet von Westenholz, a Ralph Lauren PR executive -- Meghan was working with the brand at the time -- and Harry's friend.\n\nShe was immediately sensitive to him, aware that this was a man who, beneath the banter and the surface chatter, was looking for a safe harbor, reads a line out of the book. The question she asked herself after that first intoxicating meeting was could she provide it -- and all that entailed.\n\n8. Meghan wins over the queen\n\nQueen Elizabeth had to sign off on Harry's engagement before he could even pop the question. According to the book, Meghan practiced afternoon tea when she visited the Rose Tree Cottage in Pasadena, California, a few months before the big meeting.\n\nHarry and Meghan joined his grandmother for a one-hour afternoon tea meeting in her private sitting room in Buckingham Palace. They arrived so discreetly that senior palace staffers didn't even know about the meeting until a few days later, according to Morton. And it would be another week until the news made it out to the press.\n\nThe queen was quick to give her approval to her grandson. Morton writes that a former senior royal official told him that were it a few years ago, this would have been a grim, unhappy confrontation, but Harry has since built up a trust with his grandmother.\n\nThe queen trusts her grandsons. She has confidence in them in a way that she never has had with her eldest son, a courtier told Morton. They have really established themselves as being in touch with the public. [Prince] William and Harry have star quality, and are believable and authentic heirs to the monarchy.\n\n9. The inventive way Prince Harry showed the queen Suits\n\nA question that's long been on royal watchers' minds: has the queen seen Meghan in Suits. The USA network drama certainly featured some racy scenes that would be sure to make anyone's grandmother blush. So how did proud fiancé Prince Harry go about showing off Meghan's work?\n\nAccording to Morton: Prince Harry made an edited YouTube version of her show 'Suits' to set before the queen and Prince Philip so that they could understand more clearly what their grandson saw in her.\n\n10. There's a novel inspired by Meghan\n\nMeghan has apparently already inspired literature. According to Morton, the Suits star's best friend, Lindsay Roth, wrote a novel titled What Pretty Girls Are Made Of that follows the life of Alison Kraft, a girl who grows up wanting to be an actress and struggles to nail auditions.\n\nMorton writes that Roth sent a copy to Meghan's future sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, at Kensington Palace, to which she received a thank-you card from the Duchess of Cambridge. This was reportedly long before Meghan and Harry even met.\n\nAs fans eagerly pore over Morton's book, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, here's a look at what we can expect from the royal wedding on May 19:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding: All the famous guests to expect\n\nRoyal wedding countdown: All the details on Meghan Markle's dress, wedding party and more!\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle decide on wedding florist
Performing now on Broadway, a most distinguished member of British acting royalty: Dame Diana Rigg. She talks this morning with Anthony Mason:\n\nIn the rousing revival of the musical My Fair Lady at New York's Lincoln Center, one of Britain's most acclaimed actresses makes her return to Broadway. Dame Diana Rigg plays Mrs. Higgins, whose son Henry has taken in Eliza Doolittle:\n\nMrs. Higgins: Is it a love affair?\n\nColonel Pickering: Heaven's, no. She's a flower girl. He picked her up off the curbstone.\n\nMrs. Higgins: Oh, Henry, a flower girl!\n\nDiana Rigg as Mrs. Higgins and Allan Corduner as Colonel Pickering in the revival of the Lerner & Loewe musical My Fair Lady. CBS News\n\nShe's up for a Tony Award, her first nomination since 1994, when she won for her performance as Medea.\n\nMason asked, Do awards mean anything to you?\n\nOf course they do, and anybody who says they don't is talking rubbish!\n\nAnd at 79, Dame Diana has found a new generation of fans, with her Emmy-nominated performance as the conniving Queen of Thorns in Game of Thrones.\n\nDiana Rigg as Lady Olenna Tyrell and Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister in Game of Thornes. HBO\n\nI'm thrilled young people identify with this naughty old bag I was playing, she said.\n\nActing is the only career Diana Rigg has ever wanted. But in the beginning, she says, she was never confident as an actress: Never. God, no. You see, I came from a Yorkshire family, and compliments were never given. Their way of loving you was telling you what was wrong with you.\n\nBut at 17, she earned admission to drama school in London, and then the Royal Shakespeare Company. But suddenly in 1965, she shocked her Shakespearean colleagues and left it all – for a TV show. She said she was despised for doing so.\n\nMason asked, So why did you do it?\n\nI knew I had to broaden myself. I was young.\n\nIn The Avengers, she played Emma Peel, sidekick to suave secret agent John Steed, played by Patrick Macnee. The British series made Rigg an international sensation.\n\nDiana Rigg as Mrs. Emma Peel in The Avengers. Photofest\n\nWhy do you think Mrs. Peel was embraced the way she was? Mason asked.\n\nBecause she was ahead of her time, Rigg replied. Because she was highly intelligent, capable, witty, sexy, independent.\n\nDid you enjoy it?\n\nI loved it, and I loved Patrick.\n\nYou were not a fan, I gather, of the leather catsuits, though?\n\nSmirking, Rigg replied, Hot.\n\nMason said, You've said over the years you were not all that comfortable with your looks.\n\nI was uncomfortable with being a sex symbol. That I was, because how is a sex symbol supposed to behave? I haven't got a clue! she laughed.\n\nAfter just two seasons, she exited The Avengers. Why did you decide to leave? Mason asked.\n\n'Oh, 'Another dead body…' What do you say?\n\nAnd the next year she became the only woman to marry James Bond, when she starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\n\nWhat made her want to be a Bond girl? Oh, come on! she deadpanned. I mean, it was fun to do. That sequence where I'm driving around this ice rink. I did drive! It wasn't a double. Yeah, that was fun -- not for the cameraman!\n\nDiana Rigg crashes a stock car race in the James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. MGM/UA\n\nIn a stroll around New York's Metropolitan Museum, Dame Diana is curious and playful, but admits some of it is a performance to protect her private life:\n\nI've just got stuff I don't want to talk about, it's very simple, she said.\n\nDiana Rigg with correspondent Anthony Mason at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. CBS News\n\nMason said, One of your directors said something to the effect that candor was kind of your camouflage … You use it to keep people away.\n\nYes, very much so.\n\nShe was deeply wounded by a British tabloid story in 2002 , and sued the newspaper that portrayed her as a retired recluse, still bitter over the collapse of her second marriage. It almost brought me to my knees financially, but I won in the end, she said.\n\nWas that satisfying?\n\nNo, the pain had been too great.\n\nWhat was the most painful part of it for you?\n\nThat she'd resurrected the details of my marriage breaking up, and the fact she'd 'retired' me, Rigg said. I don't think they know how damaging to the psyche they are.\n\nBut I get the sense you're pretty tough.\n\nI'm a pussycat, except when I'm fighting for what I believe in. And then I'm a tigress.\n\nRigg then asked Mason, Do I strike you as being tough?\n\nWell, you say what you think, which doesn't necessarily mean you're tough.\n\nWell, that's the point.\n\nDo you not want be seen as tough?\n\nNo. I wanna be seen as me.\n\nShe is a proud mother, whose daughter, Rachel Stirling, is following in her footsteps. She's a very good actress, Rigg said of her daughter, but then, I would say that!\n\nAnd in her seventh decade on stage, Diana Rigg is a dame in demand.\n\nMason asked, Would you say you're driven?\n\nNo. If I'm not working, I'm entirely happy.\n\nBut you work a lot.\n\nJust hit me at a very late age -- one after the other, wham, wham, wham! she laughed. And I'm just sitting there saying to myself, 'Well, thank you very much. What kept you?'\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Kay Lim.
He was a joyful actor who played both the argumentative mother of the man who was not Jesus Christ, and an obscenely obese man who explodes after eating just a little too much. British writer, director and actor Terry Jones, a founding member of the comic troupe Monty Python, was more than happy to put on a woman's dress (or, as in the case of his Nude Organist, nothing at all) in the pursuit of the absolutely silliest comic ideas. His willingness to go to extremes knew no bounds.\n\nJones' specialty as a writer was a nonsensical premise presented as if it were totally ordinary, even mundane. The Spanish Inquisition (which nobody ever expects) suddenly pops up in people's houses and they don't bat an eye. And why wouldn't a café offer nothing on the menu except Spam, enjoyed by singing Vikings?\n\nAnd the characters he played could be exquisitely silly, from a government cabinet official who delivers an address while strip-teasing, to a mousey little man whose every utterance, even contemplations of suicide, causes people to collapse in fits of laughter. He was also comfortable in the director's chair, having helmed the Pythons' last two films, Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life, perhaps the only person who could wrangle the group's myriad comic sensibilities.\n\nTerry Jones directing Life of Brian in Tunisia. Python (Monty) Pictures\n\nAnd while he was the last to want to let go of Python when the group ceased producing television shows and films, it turned out that Jones' solo pursuits put him leagues ahead of the others in terms of his breadth. He directed the non-Python films Erik the Viking, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, and Personal Services, and an episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.\n\nAnd it was not just about getting laughs: He published books of his research on history and literature, including an academic treatise on Chaucer. He presented TV documentaries about the Crusades and medieval history, silent films, cartography, and economics (this one told with puppets). And he wrote political and anti-war op-eds for newspapers. He's got the widest spread of all of us, fellow Python John Cleese has said.\n\nJones died Tuesday at age 77, four years after he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a condition that robbed his loquacious, boisterous and inquisitive personality of speech. It was not unlike Beethoven losing his hearing, a defining part of his personality and gifts. It was a tragic turn of events for one whose entire life was the pursuit not just of laughs but of human engagement.\n\nEric Idle, another founding member of Python, told CBS News, It hit me harder than I expected even though we were expecting it. There's no simple way to say how much I loved him. All those years. Funny and honorable. Since 1963. Too sad.\n\nTerence Graham Parry Jones was born on February 1, 1942 in Colwyn Bay, Wales. Though his family later moved to Claygate in the English county of Surrey, his Welsh temperament never strayed far (as evidenced by his arguments with the very British Cleese over the minutest tangents of comedy). He attended Oxford, studying history, and it was there that he began writing and performing in comedy revues with future writing partner Michael Palin. After graduation, the two began contributing to David Frost's BBC comedy series, The Frost Report, where they came into contact with Cambridge graduates John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle.\n\nDuring the 1960s Palin and Jones wrote for several comedians, including Marty Feldman, and were sometimes shocked at how their material would be changed, ruining the comedic effect. That fueled their desire to perform their own work. They wrote and starred in the parody The Complete and Utter History of Britain, and (with Idle) Do Not Adjust Your Set. But even then, Jones was dissatisfied with how directors often framed or edited their sketches, which prompted him to take courses in directing at the BBC.\n\nIn 1969 Jones, Palin, Idle and American Terry Gilliam (who contributed cartoons and animation to Do Not Adjust Your Set) teamed with Cleese and Chapman to produce their own BBC series. Inspired by Goon Show creator Spike Milligan, whose '60s TV series Q had broken more than a few barriers in storytelling and presentation, Jones wanted to bring a stream-of-consciousness style to their show, so that explosions of humorous ideas wouldn't be constrained by situation comedy characters or a sketch show straitjacket of set-up followed by punchline. It wouldn't be a musical/variety format with guest stars, either. It would be its own thing, and as TV viewers soon learned, Monty Python's Flying Circus wasn't like anything else.\n\nThe Spam sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus:\n\nPerhaps Jones' greatest contribution to the TV show (apart from his willingness to dress up as rather unflattering, dowdy women) was his undying passion and enthusiasm for comedy. This would often lead to fights with Cleese — whose writing partnership with Chapman resulted in aggressive/absurd material that was quite different from Palin and Jones' silly/absurd material — about what was funny. It was his willingness to argue for the ridiculous, and to maintain a high quality in filming and editing, that drove the train that was Python, and it was his energy and enthusiasm, his eagerness to insert himself into the editing process, and his passion for fighting battles (and re-fighting them) about material, that kept the group together as long as they were.\n\nEver protective of their work, he was even responsible for having a line added to the Pythons' initial contract with the BBC that would, years later, result in the group owning their own shows — a rarity in TV.\n\nMonty Python's Flying Circus: Clockwise from top left: Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin, John Cleese and Terry Jones. BBC\n\nAfter two seasons of Monty Python's Flying Circus, Cleese was already angling to leave the show, fearing they were beginning to repeat themselves, but Jones argued for another year. By the time of the show's fourth series, in 1974, Cleese bowed out of performing, but kept with the group to appear in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. And it was in the films that Jones' contributions shined the brightest.\n\nHaving worked under director Ian MacNaughton on their 1971 movie And Now for Something Completely Different, a compilation of Flying Circus sketches aimed at the American market, Jones and Gilliam opted to co-direct Holy Grail, with each bringing their own particular bent — Jones, a love of performing and of medieval history; Gilliam, a love of stark visuals and earthy textures — to a knockabout farce involving King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. The film was a hit and remains perhaps the most authentic-looking depiction of medieval life, even if what was being depicted was remarkably silly. In addition to directing, Jones played Sir Bedevere, Prince Herbert (who only wants to sing!), and an old woman who argues with King Arthur about collectivism and the monarchy.\n\nHaving butted heads too often during the Holy Grail shoot, Jones and Gilliam decided it'd be best if Jones handled directing duties on their next film, Life of Brian, himself. The Pythons' Bible-era story of a man mistaken for the Messiah would draw condemnation from evangelical groups who hadn't bothered to see the film, but it stands today as one of the greatest comedies ever made. Jones also starred as Mandy, the mother of Brian, who gets to admonish a crowd following her son, He's not the Messiah; he's a very naughty boy!\n\nAs the Pythons' collective output lessened, with each member pursuing their own solo projects, Jones seemed the most resistant to letting go of the group, as if he were not confident that he could have the same level of success on his own. He fought hardest for their last film together, The Meaning of Life, which contained some of the group's most esoteric bits, and Jones' most memorable character, Mr. Creosote, a glutton who eats practically everything on the menu at a fancy restaurant, only to top off his meal with a wafer-thin mint, upon which he explodes. (It's safe to say it was the only film in history featuring projectile vomiting that won a top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.)\n\nBut after Meaning of Life, which was released in 1983, Jones pursued projects that were extensions of his catholic interests in literature, history, science and film, including writing children's stories and a true-crime book, Who Murdered Chaucer? His fantasy book Evil Machines became the basis of an opera. And in 2008 he presented the BBC's annual April Fool's joke, as host of a nature film about flying penguins.\n\nFinancial hardships (the Pythons had lost a court case over royalties connected to the Broadway musical Spamalot) led to their 2014 reunion. The five surviving members (Chapman had died in 1989) appeared in ten sold-out shows at London's O2 Arena, a performance beamed via satellite around the world. He performed the gang's immortal sketches with the same zeal, but memory issues began to become apparent. The following year, at an on-stage reunion in New York City at the Tribeca Film Festival, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Holy Grail, Jones seemed disengaged and tongue-tied, an extremely unusual state for the voluble and effervescent man.\n\nFrom left: Michael Palin, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam attend the Monty Python and the Holy Grail screening during the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival, at the Beacon Theatre on April 24, 2015 in New York City. Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images\n\nIt was at that point in time — having just directed the film Absolutely Anything and the documentary Boom Bust Boom — that he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a condition that affects parts of the brain controlling language and social behavior. Jones grew increasingly inward, unable to speak, and even though he would attend business meetings with the Pythons, and participate in the Alzheimer Society's Memory Walks, he soon retreated from public life.\n\nPalin spoke in 2018 of visiting his friend and longtime writing partner: He'll smile every now and then, there'll be a little chuckle, but you're not quite sure what it's connected to, but it's still something to be treasured.\n\nJones leaves behind two children, Sally and Bill, from his 42-year marriage to Alison Telfer, and a daughter, Siri, born to Anna Soderstrom, a Swedish-born Oxford graduate who'd met Jones at a book signing. (The two married in 2012.)\n\nIn a statement, Palin said, Terry was one of my closest, most valued friends. He was kind, generous, supportive and passionate about living life to the full. He was far more than one of the funniest writer performers of his generation; he was the complete Renaissance comedian — writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children's author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have. I feel very fortunate to have shared so much of my life with him and my heart goes out to Anna, Alison and all his family.\n\nToday Idle tweeted about memories of So many laughs, moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him.\n\nI loved him the moment I saw him on stage at the Edinburgh Festival in 1963.

Reality star Courtney Stodden and actor Doug Hutchison are expecting their first child after five years of marriage.\n\nThe reality star told ET, I feel happy about it but extremely overwhelmed.\n\nI'm going through a lot at the moment. This wasn't a planned pregnancy, the 21-year-old explained. But life happens.\n\nStodden and Hutchison got married in 2011, setting off a media firestorm when it was revealed that Stodden was just 16 years old; Hutchison was 51. The two met when Stodden sent Hutchison an e-mail through his website, starting a correspondence. With Stodden's mother's approval, the couple got married in Las Vegas. It was Hutchison's third marriage.\n\nHutchison and Stodden sat for a Nightline special that year about their May-December romance. The then-teenager also released viral music videos on YouTube, and the couple released many provocative photos on social media. The two have remained at least on the fringes of the limelight since then; they also split for several months in 2013 before reconciling.\n\nThere's never an ordinary day for the Stodden-Hutchison family, it seems. Stodden and her mother, Krista Keller, are now on Lifetime's The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition. Keller recently admitted on the show that she told Hutchison she was in love with him.
HOUSTON -- Doctors treating former President George H.W. Bush for pneumonia considered whether to take out a breathing tube inserted two days ago to clear his airway.\n\nHis wife, Barbara, diagnosed with bronchitis, was feeling 1,000 percent better on Thursday after a dose of antibiotics and rest.\n\nThe 92-year-old former president and the 91-year-old former first lady both were being cared for at Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\nMr. Bush was feeling well enough Thursday to tweet about a newly-elected baseball Hall of Famer:\n\nHearty congrats to a good friend and great player, Jeff Bagwell, on his well-deserved induction into @baseballhall. pic.twitter.com/PvRb7UOX89 — George Bush (@GeorgeHWBush) January 19, 2017\n\nFamily spokesman Jim McGrath said Thursday the 41st president remained in stable condition. Mr. Bush was hospitalized on Saturday and has been in the intensive care unit since Wednesday, relying on a ventilator to breathe.\n\nRemoving the tube - a procedure known as extubation - would enable Mr. Bush to breathe on his own. He was struggling to breathe when he was admitted to the hospital Saturday.\n\nWe are hopeful he will be discharged from the ICU in a few days, McGrath said.\n\nBarbara Bush was admitted Wednesday after feeling fatigued and coughing for weeks.\n\nThe couple received an uplifting visit from longtime friends former Secretary of State James Baker and his wife, Susan, who also live in Houston, McGrath said.\n\nPresident-elect Trump and President Obama have sent their well wishes, via Twitter and a news conference, respectively. Former President Clinton also tweeted: 41 and Barbara - thinking about you both and sending wishes for a speedy recovery. Love, 42.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush offered thanks on Instagram Thursday for messages of love and support for Mother and Dad.\n\nYour prayers are working: 41 and Mom are doing much better today and fighting on, he said in his first public comments about their illnesses.\n\nMr. Bush said he and former first lady Laura Bush look forward to representing them at Mr. Trump's inauguration Friday in Washington while they continue to recover in Houston.\n\nThe Bushes were married Jan. 6, 1945, and have had the longest marriage of any presidential couple in American history. At the time of their wedding, he was a young naval aviator. She had been a student at Smith College.\n\nAfter World War II, they moved to the Texas oil patch to seek their fortune and raise a family. It was there that George Bush began his political career, representing Houston for two terms in Congress in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, also served as CIA director and Ronald Reagan's vice president.
Under a brilliant moon, a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket flashed to life and vaulted away from Cape Canaveral late Sunday, boosting the European Space Agency's $1.5 billion Solar Orbiter probe out of Earth's gravitational grip for a multi-year voyage around the sun that will give scientists their first glimpse of the star's poles.\n\nThe long-awaited mission marks the first time that we send a satellite out to take images of the sun's poles and in addition, getting the first ever data of the polar magnetic field, said Daniel Mueller, ESA project scientist with the Solar Orbiter mission. We believe this really holds the keys to unraveling the mysteries of the sun's (11-year) activity cycle.\n\nWe will also monitor the far side of the sun, which we cannot see from Earth, and combine that with data from satellites and ground-based telescopes to provide a full 3D view of our star. And so the orbiter is really a laboratory; we have a suite of 10 sophisticated instruments that we will (operate) together to track the evolution of eruptions on the sun from the surface out into space, all the way down to Earth.\n\nAn ESA graphic highlighting how the Solar Orbiter, left, and NASA's Parker Solar Probe will work in concert to study the sun's powerful magnetic field and the electrically charged solar wind that directly impacts Earth's environment. ESA\n\nThe Solar Orbiter mission comes a year and a half after the launch of NASA's Parker Solar Probe, a spacecraft that periodically flies through the sun's super-heated outer atmosphere, or corona, enduring extreme temperatures that rule out the use of sun-facing cameras.\n\nInstead, Parker's instruments are focused on studying the sun's complex electric and magnetic fields, the electrically charged particles making up the supersonic solar wind and the mechanisms that heat the corona to millions of degrees.\n\nThe Solar Orbiter will fly periodically inside the orbit of Mercury, within 26 million miles of the sun, facing temperatures higher than a pizza oven. But that's far enough out to enable cameras and telescopes, looking through peepholes in the spacecraft's heat shield, to capture what should be spectacular views.\n\nAlong with four instruments to study the solar wind, We have six telescopes that observe the light from the sun in different parts of the rainbow spectrum, Mueller said. Two of those are so called coronagraphs where we block out the light of the sun itself to image the faint emission of the environment around the sun, the so-called corona.\n\nIn addition, we have these sensors that measure, for example, ions in space. Elements on the sun are not only hydrogen and helium, but also sprinklings of heavier elements like iron, oxygen, neon. We measure those at the location of the spacecraft, we really weigh the particles, but we can also measure the light that they emit on the surface and thereby we have a unique way of linking the two.\n\nIf all goes well, the Solar Orbiter and the Parker Solar Probe will study the sun at the same time from different vantage points to help unravel some of the star's deepest mysteries.\n\nIt's really a perfect dream marriage (made) in heaven, said Guenther Hasinger, director of science for the European Space Agency.\n\nA time exposure captures a brilliant moon and the Atlas 5's fiery climb away from Cape Canaveral. William Harwood/CBS News\n\nThe Solar Orbiter mission cost roughly $1.5 billion, including the Atlas 5 rocket provided by NASA. The U.S. space agency also spent about $70 million building one of the spacecraft's instruments and other components, including a sensor that NASA's current science director, Thomas Zurbuchen, helped design.\n\nLaunch of a flagship science mission like the Solar Orbiter normally would be center stage for NASA, but thanks to a few minor processing delays, the flight ended up on the same day NASA planned to launch another mission with important, if less lofty, ambitions.\n\nFirst up Sunday in a space launch doubleheader was a Northrop Grumman Antares 230+ rocket carrying a Cygnus cargo capsule loaded with 8,000 pounds of supplies bound for the International Space Station. But that launch, from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport - MARS - on Virginia's Eastern Shore, was called off and rescheduled for Thursday due to trouble with ground support equipment and a poor forecast early in the week.\n\nThere were no problems at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, and the Solar Orbiter's Atlas 5 rocket thundered to life on time at 11:03 p.m. EST and climbed away to the east atop 1.2 million pounds of thrust and a brilliant jet of exhaust.\n\nFifty-two minutes later, the rocket's Centaur upper stage released the spacecraft on an Earth-escape trajectory that eventually will carry the spacecraft within the orbit of Mercury.\n\nTo get there, Solar Orbiter will fly past Venus in late December, using the planet's gravity to adjust its trajectory. After a second Venus flyby in August 2021, the spacecraft will whip past Earth the following November, setting up the third of eight planned Venus flybys through September 2030. Science observations will begin next year.\n\nThe Solar Orbiter will require multiple flybys of Venus, using the planet's gravity to adjust its elliptical orbit and eventually put it in position to observe the sun's poles. ESA\n\nThe gravity-assist flybys will eventually raise the tilt of the probe's orbit with respect to the sun's equator by about 35 degrees, enabling the spacecraft to see the star's polar regions. The first polar pass is expected in March 2025 when the Solar Orbiter reaches an inclination of 17 degrees.\n\nSolar Orbiter is special because it's really the first mission to try to link the sun to the heliosphere and establish a cause-and-effect relationship between what happens on the sun and what we observe in the near-Earth environment, Mueller said. In particular, we want to find out in detail about how the solar magnetic field works.\n\nThe only way to find out is to really fly to an altitude above the sun where we can look down on the sun's poles. And that's what we will do for the first time.\n\nZurbuchen said in an interview that studying the sun's polar regions and learning more about the fundamental physics of the magnetic engine of the sun, the so-called dynamo, will lead to improved space weather forecasts and possibly even early warning of potentially destructive solar flares and coronal mass ejections that can play havoc with power grids, communications and navigation.\n\nIt's like your hurricane season, he said. There's going to be a forecast sometime this year that says this hurricane season it's going to be nominal, super strong and so forth. So that comes from observations of ocean temperature, from flows and so forth. We think the ingredients of the solar cycle are in the polar regions. We think if we understood that, we could predict that on a macroscopic level.\n\nBottom line: We would expect that in 10 years we have a substantially better understanding of how to predict, to model space weather, to look at the signs, the signature of the solar surface in a way that we can use it to improve models.
Tony Bennett's I Left My Heart in San Francisco, Fleetwood Mac's Rumours among additions to National Recording Registry\n\n\n\n\n\nSinger Tony Bennett (left), and cover art from the Fleetwood Mac album, Rumours. AP/Warner Bros. Tony Bennett, Kenny Rogers, Fleetwood Mac, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine, The Temptations, Groucho Marx and Run-DMC are just a few of the artists whose work has now been marked for preservation by the Library of Congress. On March 21, 2018, the Library named 25 audio recordings to be inducted to its National Recording Registry, a compendium of sound recordings to be preserved as representative of America's artistic, cultural and historic treasures. Ranging from rock, pop, jazz, classical and gospel to musical theatre, film soundtracks, radio broadcasts and comedy albums, the recordings have been recognized as vital to our nation's audio legacy, and are now required to be preserved for future generations. Click through this gallery to listen to audio samples from each of this year's inductees, presented in alphabetical order. With this year's additions, the Registry now numbers 500 historic recordings - just a small part of the Library's collection of recorded sound numbering nearly three million items. Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said, This annual celebration of recorded sound reminds us of our varied and remarkable American experience. The unique trinity of historic, cultural and aesthetic significance reflected in the National Recording Registry each year is an opportunity for reflection on landmark moments, diverse cultures and shared memories -- all reflected in our recorded soundscape.\n\nAlice's Restaurant Massacree (1967) Reprise Based on true events - a fated trip to a city dump in Stockbridge, Mass., on Thanksgiving Day, that resulted in a detour to jail - Arlo Guthrie's humorous monologue/folk song Alice's Restaurant, about Good Samaritanism running afoul of the law, and of the draft, has regaled generations. The massacree (a humorous telling of an improbable story) was a whopping 18 minutes long - too long for Top 40 radio airplay, but not for adventurous FM stations that made it a favorite. Since its debut, the song has become a Thanksgiving Day tradition, and not just in the Berkshires. And while the tale inspired a 1969 movie starring Guthrie, the song has also undergone revisions over the years, as Guthrie changed lyrics during concert appearances to accommodate the politics of the day.

He later returned and joined the Navy, and after the war worked as a janitor in Harlem. He received a gift of two tickets to the theater, a trip that would mark an epiphany for him: Something so inordinately powerful just sucked me in. He began taking acting classes, paid for by his singing, which he did at New York City haunts like the Village Vanguard, where he sang folk songs from Jamaica, Trinidad, Haiti and elsewhere. The success of his third album, Calypso, surprised him. I didn't quite understand what had happened, he said. 'Cause it was not slated to go anywhere other than to satisfy a tenacious appetite I had for wanting to do that album. It became the first LP to sell a million copies.

Musical Concepts A virtuoso of the classical repertoire, including music of Brahms, Chopin, Liszt and Mozart, the Czech-Austrian pianist Artur Schnabel (1882-1951) was the first to record the complete cycle of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas, for HMV, during the years 1932-1935. In 1985 The New York Times declared the Schnabel set the standard by which all subsequent performances have been judged ... prized for their intelligence and inner repose rather than for technical command (there was no tape splicing in those days, and the master hit his share of clinkers). And the U.K. magazine Gramophone lauded the performer's (and the composer's) astonishing physical and imaginative daring. Play excerpt from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 10 in G, Op. 14.

On May 6, 1972, Groucho, then 81 years young, performed at New York City's Carnegie Hall, mixing jokes and outrageous tales with some of his most memorable songs, including Hello, I Must Be Going, and Lydia the Tattooed Lady. The two-disc LP of that concert also preserved the musical accompaniment by pianist Marvin Hamlisch, and an introduction by talk show host and ardent Groucho fan Dick Cavett. It would be the final one-man show by the comedian, who passed away in 1977.

His collection Folk Songs of the Hills, released on 78 rpm discs, featured such compositions as Sixteen Tons, Dark As a Dungeon, John Henry and Nine Pound Hammer. Later reissues of the album expanded the track listings, including Travis' recordings of Barbara Allen, This World Is Not My Home, and Possum Up a Simmon Tree. It would be one of Travis' most critically-acclaimed albums, and a resource to be mined by other artists, including Tennessee Ernie Ford (who would cover Sixteen Tons in 1955).

Written by Don Schlitz, a night shift computer operator who tried for years to peddle his music in Nashville, the song was first recorded by Bobby Bare in 1978, and then by Johnny Cash. But it was Rogers' 1978 recording that hit #1 on the Country chart, and would win a Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. It became Rogers' signature song - not the least for his beautifully dramatized evocation of a wizened old gambler whose life lessons sound to have come the hard way. The song would inspire four TV movies, in which Rogers starred. Play an excerpt from The Gambler Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nHow I Got Over (1950) Clara Ward. Library of Congress Gospel singer Clara Ward founded the Ward Singers, who made dozens of recordings from the late 1940s to the mid-'70s. An inspiration to singers Marion Williams and Aretha Franklin, Ward's alto was a powerful instrument, as heard in this 1950 recording of her gospel hit, How I Got Over, composed by Ward. The song would later be covered by Franklin, Mahalia Jackson, and the Blind Boys of Alabama.

Tony Bennett likewise will be forever linked to his signature tune, I Left My Heart in San Francisco, despite his New York City roots, and the song's ignominious launch - released as the B-side of Once Upon a Time. But San Francisco proved more enticing to radio DJs, and a hit was soon born. The recording won the Record of the Year Grammy, and earned Bennett a Grammy for Best Male Solo Vocal Performance.

Charter at the Veterans' War Memorial Building in San Francisco, June 26, 1945. UN Photo/Yould As the war in Europe was drawing to a close, and Allied forces were driving Japan to the brink of surrender, delegates from around the world attended the United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO) in San Francisco, to draft a charter as the basis of the United Nations. Over two months, from April 25 to June 26, 1945, NBC Radio broadcast news documenting the historic summit, including the announcement that Germany had surrendered, and the ceremony at which the U.N. Charter was signed by President Harry Truman and other dignitaries.

In the case of Run-DMC (Darryl McDaniels, Joseph Simmons and Jason Mizell), their take on Walk This Way - in collaboration with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry - stayed true to the forms of both. Energetic guitar riffs, vinyl scratching, a drum machine, and the vocal rhythms of rap made for a song that crossed over to two audiences while also reviving Aerosmith's career. Run-DMC and Aerosmith would share the Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap - Single.

Epic Rhythm Is Gonna Get You, from the album Let It Loose, is one of the most infectious songs from Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine ... which is really saying something, considering that Estefan has had more than 100 hits on the Billboard charts, sold more than 100 million albums, and won multiple Grammys. Written by Estefan and Enrique Kiki Garcia, the song wasn't an immediate hit when it was first released in June 1987, and then featured in a Hollywood action film. Reissued in December 1988, it finally broke through to the charts, peaking at No. 5 in the U.S. Play an excerpt from Rhythm Is Gonna Get You Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nRumours (1977) Warner Bros. Broken hearts have certainly spawned their share of sad songs. But one of the most artistically and commercially successful albums of all time was born out of a band's splintering core - jilted lovers who stuck together professionally through sheer will. In the mid-'70s the English blues band Fleetwood Mac was comprised of Mick Fleetwood and two couples: Brits John McVie and his wife, Christine; and Americans Stevie Nicks and her boyfriend, Lindsey Buckingham. But they were coming apart at the seams: The McVies were headed for divorce, and Nicks and Buckingham were breaking up. Fleetwood's marriage was ending as well. The songs that make up the band's 1977 album, Rumours, are chock full of anger, spite, betrayal and heartache. McVie wrote You Make Loving Fun about her lover, and Nicks wrote Dreams as a message to Buckingham:\n\n\n\nThunder only happens when it's raining\n\nPlayers only love you when they're playing\n\nSay, women, they will come and they will go\n\nWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll know Play an excerpt from Dreams, from Rumours Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nGo Your Own Way was Buckingham's message back at Nicks:\n\n\n\nLoving you isn't the right thing to do ...\n\nIf I could, maybe I'd give you my world\n\nHow can I, when you won't take it from me ...\n\nShacking up is all you want to do Play an excerpt from Go Your Own Way, from Rumours Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nAnd the raw emotions didn't settle down once the record was released; Fleetwood and Nicks began an affair while touring for Rumours, a record that would win the Grammy for Album of the Year and sell more than 45 million copies. Asked in 2017 on CBS This Morning why the band continued to play together, Fleetwood replied, Corny, but because they get a dose of it. They definitely get a megadose of it, which is challenging, you know, to be able to attain that with this gloriously dysfunctional story, which is us bunch.\n\nSitting on Top of the World (1930) Library of Congress Guitarist Lonnie Chatmon and violinist Walter Vinson, of the Mississippi Sheiks, composed what would become a standard not just of their group's style of blues, but also bluegrass, rock and folk - a song to be covered by everyone from Ray Charles, Howlin' Wolf, the Grateful Dead and Cream to Bob Dylan, Jack White and Willie Nelson.

But it was the timeless music of the Tony-winning Broadway show written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, including the song My Favorite Things, that has captivated audiences the world over. In November 1965 the album hit #1 on the Billboard chart, spent 109 weeks in the Top 10, and was so successful that in 2015 Billboard ranked it at No. 2 on its all-time list.

What do I need to know to go into politics? That's what a 27-year-old Justin Trudeau asked his father, former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, before embarking on his own political career.\n\nWhat followed, the younger Trudeau, now prime minister, tells 60 Minutes in the clip above, was a stilted and awkward conversation, very different from their usual interactions. It didn't work because everything that he had to teach me about being a good politician, he'd already given me about being a good person. About being a good teacher. About being a good citizen.\n\nOn 60 Minutes this week, Lara Logan talks to Trudeau about his surprising victory last fall and what it was like to grow up as political royalty - the eldest child of a legendary leader and his glamorous wife. The answer, it seems, is complicated.\n\nWhen his parents' marriage foundered, his mother, Margaret, left Justin and his two brothers alone with their father for long stretches while she traveled to England or New York. We were three small boys who were living with our dad who was, you know, running the country.\n\nThe tabloids depicted Margaret as a wild child who abandoned her sons to party with rock stars at Studio 54. But Trudeau later learned that his mother had been wrestling with mental illness. It just was never talked about. It was never addressed, he says. It was, you know, hushed and put aside.\n\nWhen he learned she was bipolar, he saw the divorce in a new light. And now, he says, he's proud of her for speaking publicly and helping to destigmatize mental illness.\n\nIn grade 12, headed toward university, the prime minister tells Logan, he had troubles of his own. I was on a track that was going to be all about high achieving, and I hadn't really realized that it was very much about following in my father's footsteps, he says. And I had a bit of a breakdown, where I just realized this wasn't my track. This wasn't being true to me.\n\nTrudeau readily admits he took an unusual path to prime minister. I was a snowboard instructor. I was a bouncer in a nightclub. I was a whitewater river guide for many years. I worked as a teacher, he says. I make no apologies for a very varied set of life experiences.\n\nAt a young age, Trudeau encountered Sophie Grégoire, a girl who went to school with his younger brother Michel. Twenty-five years later, Sophie and Justin cohosted a charity event together. It started from there, she says.\n\nAfter some initial miscommunication, they had an epic first date - involving Afghan food, ice cream and karaoke. Later that night, she says, they spoke about his brother Michel, who had died in an avalanche, and Trudeau's face suddenly changed.\n\nI said, 'Is everything OK?' And he said, 'I'm 31 years old, and I've been waiting for you 31 years.' There's nothing more to be said. We've been together ever since.
PARIS -- Kate Millett, the activist, artist and educator whose best-selling work Sexual Politics was a landmark of cultural criticism and a manifesto for the modern feminist movement, has died at 82.\n\nMillett's book was among the most talked-about works of its time and remains a founding text for cultural and gender studies programs. Her impact reached across generations and across borders -- and condolences filled social networks in multiple languages Thursday.\n\nMillett died of a heart attack Wednesday while on a visit to Paris, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the family. The publishing house that carried her books in French also confirmed her death.\n\nSexual Politics was published in 1970 in the midst of feminism's so-called second wave, when Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, Millett and others built upon the achievements of the suffragettes from a half-century earlier. Together they challenged assumptions about women in virtually every aspect of society.\n\nAmong Millett's 21st-century fans was TV star and writer Lena Dunham, who tweeted: So sad to hear about Kate Millett's passing. She pioneered feminist thought, de-stigmatized mental illness, wore massive fashion glasses.\n\nSo sad to hear about Kate Millett's passing. She pioneered feminist thought, de-stigmatized mental illness, wore massive fashion glasses. — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) September 7, 2017\n\nEmailing w/ Millett was a treat (she invited me to her Christmas tree farm) & her intellectual brawn was evident in all the trouble she made — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) September 7, 2017\n\nCan't bear to lose any more second-wavers. Even if you don't agree with all their theory, they made space for us and they have the stories — Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) September 7, 2017\n\nSteinem posted a tribute on Facebook: As Andrea Dworkin said, 'The world was asleep, but Kate Millett woke it up.' Sexual Politics -- and all Kate's work -- will keep us Woke.\n\nSexual Politics chronicled centuries of legal, political and cultural exclusion and diminishment of women, from the penis envy theory of Sigmund Freud to the portrayals of women as disrupters of paradise in the Bible and Greek mythology. She labeled traditional marriage an artifact of patriarchy and concluded with chapters condemning the misogyny of authors Henry Miller, D.H. Lawrence and Norman Mailer, but also expressing faith in the redemptive power of women's liberation.\n\nIt may be that a second wave of the sexual revolution might at last accomplish its aim of freeing half the race from its immemorial subordination - and in the process bring us all a great deal closer to humanity, she wrote.\n\nWhile countless women were radicalized by her book, Millett would grow to have bittersweet feelings about Sexual Politics, which later fell out of print and remained so for years. She was unhappy with its mandarin mid-Atlantic prose and overwhelmed by her sudden transformation from graduate student and artist to a feminist celebrity whose image appeared on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nAmused at first by her fame, Millett said she was worn down by a ruin of interviews, articles, attacks.\n\nSoon it grew tedious, an indignity, she wrote in the memoir Flying, published in 1974.\n\nShe was dubbed by Time to be the Mao Tse-tung of Women's Liberation, and rebutted by Mailer in his book The Prisoner of Sex, in which he mocked her as the Battling Annie of some new prudery.\n\nMeanwhile, she faced taunts from some feminists for saying she was bisexual while she was married but not saying she was gay. During an appearance by Millett at Columbia University, an activist stood up and yelled, Are you a lesbian? Say it. Are you?\n\nFive hundred people looking at me. Are you a Lesbian? Millett wrote. Everything pauses, faces look up in terrible silence. I hear them not breathe. That word in public, the word I waited half a lifetime to hear. Finally I am accused. 'Say it. Say you are a Lesbian!'\n\nYes, I said. Yes. Because I know what she means. The line goes, inflexible as a fascist edict, that bisexuality is a cop-out. Yes, I said, yes I am a lesbian. It was the last strength I had.\n\nMillett's books after Sexual Politics were far more personal and self-consciously literary, whether Flying or Sita, a memoir about her sexuality in which she wrote of a lesbian lover who committed suicide. The Loony Bin Trip chronicled her struggles with manic depression and time spent in psychiatric wards.\n\nThere is no denying the misery and stress of life, she wrote. The swarms of fears, the blocks to confidence, the crises of decision and choice.\n\nThe daughter of Irish Catholics, Millett was born in 1934 in St. Paul, Minnesota, and was long haunted by her father, an alcoholic who beat his children and left his family when Millett was 14. She attended parochial schools as a child and studied English literature at the University of Minnesota and St Hilda's College, Oxford, from which she graduated with honors.\n\nMillett lived briefly in Japan, where she met her future husband and fellow sculptor Fumio Yoshimura. They moved to Manhattan in 1963 and divorced in 1985.\n\nShe joined the National Organization for Women and began attracting a following for her sculptures, which appeared in Life magazine and has been exhibited worldwide. Through her own Women's Liberation Cinema production company, she directed the acclaimed feminist documentary Three Lives. She also founded the Women's Art Colony Farm in Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\nMillett taught at several schools, including the University of North Carolina and New York University. In 1968, she was fired from her job as an English lecturer at Barnard College, a decision that stemmed at least in part from her support of student protests against the Vietnam War. The extra free time allowed her to complete Sexual Politics, which began as her doctoral thesis at Columbia.\n\nEmployees of the French publishing house Editions des Femmes held an impromptu gathering Thursday when they learned of her death, sharing memories of a woman who came regularly to Paris for more than 40 years to share ideas and plan out activism.\n\nShe was a pioneer, a pillar of global feminism ... a true creator, said longtime friend Catherine Guyot at the publishing house. We were not always in agreement. We talked about going beyond feminism ... but she always discussed with pleasure.\n\nMillett was honored several times late in life. In 2012, she was given the Pioneer Award from the Lambda Literary Foundation and the same year was presented a Courage Award for the Arts prize by her longtime friend Yoko Ono. Millett was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 2013 and, in her acceptance speech, reflected on her years as an activist.\n\nThe happiness of those times, the joy of participation, the excitement of being part of my own time, of living on the edge, of being so close to events you can almost intuit them. To raise one's voice in protest, just as the protest is expressed in life, in the streets, in relationships and friendships, she said. Then, in a moment of public recognition, the face of the individual becomes a woman's face.\n\nSteinem said Millett's ashes would be brought home but information about memorial arrangements was not immediately available.
Singer-songwriter Gregg Allman died Saturday at the age of 69. By way of tribute, we take another look at this remarkable portrait Chip Reid painted of Allman for Sunday Morning, first broadcast on January 16, 2011:\n\n\n\nBy now, the songs are like old friends. And Gregg Allman never gets tired of singing them.\n\nReid asked Allman why he loves singing so much.\n\nIt's like going to an analyst and just spilling your guts, he said. You know, something that's been bugging you for a long time and you finally tell this person, 'Look, here's the way it is.'\n\nThere's no question the Allman Brothers -- the bluesy, jam-band pioneers who all but invented Southern rock -- have earned a special place in rock history.\n\nThe band's journey began in Nashville, Tenn. Gregory Lenoir Allman was born on Dec. 8, 1947, a year and 18 days after his brother Duane.\n\nTragedy struck early: Their father was murdered by a hitchhiker when Gregg was just 2. Big brother Duane had to fill the void.\n\nHe knew just that much more than me, Gregg said, and if we'd lived to be 96 and 95, I'd still be 'little brother.'\n\nBut it was Gregg who first discovered music, when as a nine-year-old he saw a neighbor with a guitar.\n\nSo did you fall in love with the guitar the first time you saw it sitting there? Reid asked.\n\nYeah, I did. I did. It was like sparks flying, it was, he said.\n\nGregg taught Duane, who quickly became a virtuoso. They played together until 1969, when Duane assembled what would become the Allman Brothers Band. Gregg was reluctant to sign on -- having already been accepted into college to be a dental surgeon.\n\nMy brother said, 'Man, we gotta go out here and tear up the roads a while,' you know? Gregg laughed. I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll go out there for two years. And I'm going on back to med school.' Well, I got out there, the two years I was so far in debt, man, I had to stay!\n\nIn debt, perhaps, but along the way Gregg found he had a gift for songwriting, such as Melissa, written in 1967 with Steve Alaimo.\n\nCrossroads seem to come and go, yeah.\n\nThe gypsy flies from coast to coast\n\nKnowing many, loving none\n\nBearing sorrow, havin' fun\n\nBut back home he'll always run . . . to sweet Melissa.\n\nWas there a Melissa, Allman was asked.\n\nNo, he told Reid. It was a person that I had dreamed up. I was real lonely. And I had everything in the song written but the title. And I got, 'But back home I'll always run with sweet Barbara ...' 'With sweet Mary Jo... ' I was flabbergasted, you know?\n\nInspiration came to him in, of all places, a grocery store.\n\nI was the only one in the store, except for this one Spanish lady and she had this little toddler with her, Allman said. She was everywhere. And one time, she just took off down this one aisle, and the lady just freaked out. And she went, 'Oh, Melissa, Melissa, come back!'\n\nAnd I went, 'Oh lady, I could kiss 'ya, he laughed. 'Melissa,' that's it!\n\nThe band released 2 albums, gaining little attention until 1971, when they recorded a performance at New York's legendary Fillmore East.\n\nTo watch a 1970 Allman Brothers Band performance at Fillmore East click on the video player below.\n\nThe album At Fillmore East (below), featuring Whipping Post, catapulted them to worldwide fame. To this day it is considered one of the greatest live albums of all time.\n\nCapricorn\n\nTheir wildest dreams had come true. But just 3 months later, it all came crashing down.\n\nOn Oct. 29, 1971, Duane Allman was riding his motorcycle down Hillcrest Avenue in Macon, when a truck turned in front of him.\n\nHe had two speeds, man -- hundred, and parked, Gregg laughed.\n\nDuane Allman was dead at 24. The band carried on, with guitarist Dickey Betts shouldering more of the load.\n\nBut with his long blond hair and gritty, soulful voice, Gregg got most of the attention.\n\nSat down, wrote you a long letter,\n\nLord it seems just like the other day,\n\nSaid sure as the sunrise, baby,\n\nTomorrow I'll be up and on my way.\n\nBut I'll live on and try and be strong\n\n'Cause it just ain't my cross to bear\n\n(It's Not My Cross to Bear)\n\nMore than he bargained for, after his high-profile marriage in 1975 to Cher.\n\nI remember going to the grocery store and just seeing my face everywhere, Gregg recalled. And I'm like, 'What is happening, you know?' She said, 'I told you, I told you this would happen!' Yeah, she warned me.\n\nThey were married for about four years -- one of Allman's multiple marriages. He leaves behind five children.\n\nTo hear Greegg Allman perform Ain't Wastin' Time No More, click on the video player below.\n\nOver the decades, the Allman Brothers disbanded and then regrouped several times, playing a celebrated yearly residency at New York City's Beacon Theatre, until breaking up for good in 2014.\n\nAllman also made a series of solo albums. The last one will be released this coming September.\n\nIt seems the man who first sang The Road Goes On Forever more than four decades ago wasn't too far off.\n\nSo, you're going to do it until you just can't do it anymore? Reid asked.\n\nOh, yeah! Gregg chuckled. 'Til they have to take my ass out there on a stretcher!\n\n\n\nFor more info:

MUNCIE, Ind. -- Police in central Indiana say they arrested a groom after he allegedly sunk his teeth into his bride's arm during a fight hours after their marriage.\n\nThe Star Press in Muncie reports that officers arrested 22-year-old Dillon Jess Lane after entering the couple's apartment just before midnight Saturday on a domestic-disturbance call.\n\nPolice say the intoxicated Lane was biting his wife's arms as they entered. He also was allegedly holding his sister-in-law. Police say both women were trying to get away from Lane.\n\nThe officer said the women's clothes were covered in blood and broken furniture was strewn around the room. The newspaper reports the women suffered abrasions and bruises.\n\nLane was arrested on preliminary charges, including domestic battery. A name of a lawyer for Lane wasn't immediately available.
CIA Director Mike Pompeo has been approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to be secretary of state in a party line vote. One Republican switched his vote late in the day, enabling Pompeo's nomination to advance to a vote by the full Senate.\n\nPompeo, had faced serious opposition before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's vote until Monday. However, though he earlier did not appear to have enough votes to recommend him to the full Senate, he ended up with a slim majority after Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, changed his mind. President Trump said a few days ago that Rand Paul was a very special guy who has never let me down.\n\nI just finished speaking to @realDonaldTrump, after speaking to him several times today. I also met with and spoke to Director Pompeo, Paul tweeted Monday. Having received assurances from President Trump and Director Pompeo that he agrees with the President on these important issues, I have decided to support his nomination to be our next Secretary of State, Paul added.\n\nI just finished speaking to @realDonaldTrump, after speaking to him several times today. I also met with and spoke to Director Pompeo. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) April 23, 2018\n\nHaving received assurances from President Trump and Director Pompeo that he agrees with the President on these important issues, I have decided to support his nomination to be our next Secretary of State. — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) April 23, 2018\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, had also expressed some reservations about Pompeo, but told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe that he had also decided to support Pompeo's nomination. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-North Dakota, last week became the first Democrat to announce her support for Pompeo.\n\nPompeo recently visited with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, ahead of a meeting that's being planned between Kim and President Trump. He was named to the post of the nation's top diplomat after Mr. Trump fired Rex Tillerson last month.\n\nSenators like Chris Coons, D-Delaware, who was among the last Democrats on the foreign relations panel to announce his no vote, have said they're concerned that Pompeo won't speak up when he disagrees with the president, that he will embolden, rather than moderate or restrain Trump's most belligerent and dangerous instincts.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Coons said, On vital decisions facing our country, Director Pompeo seems less concerned with rule of law and partnership with our allies and more inclined to emphasize unilateral action and the use of force.
Watch the CBSN Originals documentary The Right's Fight to Make America a Christian Nation in the video player above.\n\nOutside the Capitol insurrection in January, a group of protesters carried a large wooden cross and a flag flew reading Jesus is My Savior, Trump is My President.\n\nSome in the crowd embraced Christian nationalism, an ideology that combines Christian and American identities and promotes Christianity as the reigning religion. Research has found that adherence to Christian nationalism was a significant predictor of support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nLike other White evangelical Christians — a reliable Republican voting bloc for decades — they saw their support for President Trump rewarded with conservative judicial nominees and policies promoting religious liberty. But hundreds of evangelical leaders have condemned the radicalization emerging among those who identify as Christian nationalists.\n\nThe debate over what role religion should play in public life has never been more contentious, with some promoting a vision of Christian primacy that critics say tramples on the rights of everyone else.\n\nSeveral pastors with very different points of view shared their thoughts in the new CBSN Originals documentary, The Right's Fight to Make America a Christian Nation.\n\nKen Peters – Knoxville, Tennessee\n\nKen Peters founded the Patriot Church in Knoxville, Tennessee. CBS News\n\nA Bible sits on Pastor Ken Peters' desk, its cover graced with an American flag and inscribed with the words FOR GOD AND COUNTRY. His church has an American flag painted across its roof.\n\nI believe we are the greatest country next to Israel. I got to give God Israel as His chosen people in the Old Testament, he told CBSN Originals. But we've proven it, America's the greatest country that's ever existed in the history of the world, and it's because of Judeo-Christian values.\n\nIn September 2020, Peters founded the Patriot Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, one of a network of three Pro-America non-denominational congregations that desire to see a land infiltrated by the Holy Spirit.\n\nHe said his goal for the Patriot Church is to avoid tiptoeing around political issues like he believes other churches do.\n\nAt the pulpit, we preach strong against things like abortion, things like gay marriage, said Peters. We talk about religious freedom and we endorse candidates. We endorse President Trump. We endorse people that we feel are running on a platform of righteousness.\n\nAt a Patriot Church service a month after Mr. Trump's defeat, Peters called out to his congregation, Who won the election? The crowd shouted back in unison, Trump!\n\nKen Peters prays with members of the Patriot Church that he founded in Knoxville, Tennessee. CBS News\n\nFor Peters, the stakes are high: he believes religious liberty is under attack in America and a Biden victory means the further loss of religious freedom.\n\nWe're about to lose this country as we've always known it. It's about to become something completely different. … I don't want it. My parents don't want it. My grandparents don't want it, he said.\n\nIt's not according to our heritage, he continued. That's why I'm fighting so hard to keep it a Christian nation.\n\nPeters said he wants the country to have Christian principles and Christian laws and Christian ways, a stance that Christian nationalists, who believe Christianity should have dominant influence on American life and politics, would agree with.\n\nHowever, Peters rejects the label — though he added that he does consider himself a nationalist as opposed to a globalist.\n\nI think [Christian nationalist] has a connotation of some sort of racist, or I think America is better than every other country. I hate that term, he said. I do believe America is special. I believe she's beautiful. I believe her roots are great. … So I will never say that I'm a Christian nationalist, but I will say I'm a Christian that loves America.\n\nBrian Kaylor – Jefferson City, Missouri\n\nBrian Kaylor served as a pastor at a Southern Baptist church but believes in the separation of church and state. CBS News\n\nI have seen the look of surprise on legislators when I will announce at the beginning of a testimony in a hearing that I'm a Baptist minister, and I am opposing this bill to promote Christianity in public schools precisely because of my faith, Brian Kaylor told CBSN Originals.\n\nKaylor grew up attending a Southern Baptist church and went to school at Southwest Baptist University. He pastored a Baptist church for a couple of years and in that time realized that he was better suited for a different part of the ministry, which grew to include advocacy for the separation of church and state.\n\nKaylor, who lives in Jefferson City, Missouri, has testified against several bills in the Missouri State Legislature, including one in 2019 that pushed Bible literacy classes in public schools and another in 2020 that would require public universities to provide official recognition and benefits to religious student associations.\n\nSeparation of church and state is really important because it's really the only way that we can protect the purity of not just the church, but also of individual faith, said Kaylor. I also think it helps the state to remain focused on the welfare of all people, not just those of a privileged class, be that religion or be that some other special class.\n\nKaylor sees a timely lesson in the history of the 1950s, when the U.S. adopted In God We Trust as the national motto and added under God to the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nIt's not happening in a vacuum. It's happening because we're in the middle of a Cold War against that atheistic Soviet Union. And so we need to conjure up that God is on our side, he said. We saw this in the '50s and we are definitely seeing another wave … I think this time it's this concern that we, the White evangelicals, White Christians, are losing control of our country.\n\nHe opposes policies promoting Christianity in public life and the so-called religious freedom laws that would allow business owners to cite their religious beliefs to turn away members of the LGBTQ community.\n\nThere is just the psychological, personal, spiritual level of being constantly treated as if you're not really accepted in your own community, and I think that can be very damaging, he said.\n\nKaylor said he doesn't believe that the separation of church and state is an attack on religious liberties.\n\nSome people almost seem to act, 'If I can't establish my religion, then you're violating my free exercise of it,' he said. Establishing your faith is not religious liberty for someone else. Because if someone else's liberty is endangered, then all of us, all of our liberty is in danger.\n\nMichael Walrond Jr. – New York City\n\nMichael Walrond Jr. is the senior pastor at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem. CBS News\n\nMichael Walrond Jr., the senior pastor at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem, wants to see America live up to its ideals.\n\nAmerica may be a Christian nation in language, but it's far from it in practice: how we treat people, how we manipulate, how we take advantage of, how we live in a country of so much wealth, and there's so much poverty, he said.  I could go on and on. If we were a quote-unquote 'Christian nation,' there are certain harsh realities that in many ways define this country, that would not exist.\n\nFor Walrond, the rising Christian nationalist movement and the intermixing of Christian and American exceptionalism is really a shroud for bigotry and prejudice — a way to justify the denigration of people of color, immigrants, and people of other faiths.\n\nAll of that has theological undertones that are deeply rooted in a dysfunctional and distorted view of Christianity that really serves as a covering for ideas and notions of supremacy, superiority, and racial supremacy and superiority, he said.\n\nWalrond believes young people are turned off by the intolerance, and nationwide their church attendance is down. According to Gallup, only 19% of 24-year-olds attended church weekly or almost weekly in 2019, down from 33% in 2002.\n\nAt his own church, Walrond has seen the opposite trend: when he started preaching at First Corinthian there were maybe 100 attendees, and now they're reaching thousands. He attributes it to the kind of teachings provided there.\n\nThere are a lot of young people here, in spite of what the statistics say, because they don't find a space that is intolerant and rigid. They find a space that is open, that affirms the dignity of human beings and affirms them, he said.\n\nWalrond speaks openly of political issues that he said other pastors may prefer to avoid.\n\nThere are issues that are political that impact the everyday lives of our people, he said. It would be theological and homiletical malpractice for me to stand in this pulpit, right, and preach a salvation that doesn't take seriously the lived lives of individuals, right?\n\nIn 2014, he even ran for Congress but lost the Democratic primary. In the end, Walrond said his focus is on living the teachings of God.\n\nI hope that in the future, we actually take love seriously and make it be the lens by which we view the world. I hope that in a way, human beings can begin to live the lives we were created to live, that we will love beyond the limits of our prejudices, and understand our responsibility to serve and take care of one another.
A historic referendum in Ireland on Friday could relax that country's strict anti-abortion laws. CBS News' Jonathan Vigliotti spoke to voters there who say the vote is also a referendum on the nation's future.\n\nFor a country so closely entwined with the Catholic Church, months of polarizing protests have signaled a seismic cultural shift. Voters will select yes or no to repeal Ireland's 8th amendment which bans all abortions except when a mother's life is at risk.\n\n\n\nThe law was created in 1983, supported by those who feared Ireland having its own Roe v. Wade moment. Since the 1973 ruling legalized abortion in America, Ireland has been considered a pro-life beacon.\n\n\n\nIt's a torch Sinead McBreen wants to carry for unborn children with disabilities. Her 3-year-old daughter Grace has Down syndrome.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't my right to terminate, to decide when to terminate her life, McBreen said.\n\n\n\nBut pro-choice campaigners like Ivana Bacik say the current law ultimately hurts women.\n\nIt has caused this immense trauma. It has blocked any reform of abortion law and of course it hasn't stopped Irish women having abortions, Bacik said.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, over 3,000 women from Ireland traveled to the U.K. to have abortions. That's almost nine per day. It is estimated that 1,500 illegal abortion pills are ordered online each year.\n\nThe Catholic Church in Ireland has encouraged its followers to vote no to abortion, but critics here say its moral authority has weakened after a series of child abuse scandals.\n\nIn the past few decades Ireland has leaned more liberal, legalizing divorce in 1995 and gay marriage in 2015. If abortion is legalized, women will be allowed to terminate in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The vote is expected to be very close.
Potential Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is gaining attention for his faith. In a speech Sunday, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said Vice President Mike Pence should raise his objections to homosexuality with God.\n\nI can tell you, that if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, he said. And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world could understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\n\nPence, a conservative Christian, has opposed same-sex marriage. Buttigieg is a devout Episcopalian.\n\nEmma Green, who reports for The Atlantic, told CBSN that in the past, Democratic candidates have often been hesitant to discuss their faith. But the way Buttigieg talks about religion is authentic.\n\nHe quotes the Bible and talks about ideas from Jesus with ease and confidence. And this isn't always something that we see from the Democratic side. Even among the current field of Democratic hopefuls, Green said.\n\nOther Democrats, like Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have spoken about religion at recent events. Green said Democrats have a real opportunity to try and connect with religious voters.\n\nThe word hypocrisy comes up a lot in my reporting. People who feel as though the Republicans, President Trump, don't necessarily live out the religious ideals that they want to see. And I think Democrats see an opening, Pete Buttigeg included, Green said.\n\nConservative Christians largely supported President Trump in the 2016 election. But their reasoning varies widely. Some felt that Mr. Trump signaled he would stand up for their religious point of view with his policies and judicial appointments. Some didn't connect with Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor many, Green said abortion will remain a top priority heading into the 2020 race, which could be a challenge for Democrats like Buttigieg.\n\nThose voters would argue that this issue is the most crucial human rights issue. That defending the rights of the unborn is the most important thing that the government can do and so that's why they put this issue so high on their list of things they vote for, Green said.
Megan Fox is playing coy when it comes to identifying her unborn baby's father.\n\nThe 29-year-old actress already shares two sons -- 3-year-old Noah and 2-year-old Bodhi -- with her estranged husband, Brian Austin Green. Though their divorce is not finalized, Fox filed papers to end their marriage in August 2015 citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nWith the state of Fox and Green's current relationship unclear and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles star debuting an adorable baby bump on the red carpet Monday night, speculation has been swirling over the unborn child's paternity. Fox couldn't help but have a little fun with the rumors in a cheeky Instagram post on Tuesday.\n\n#NotTheFather, she captioned a three-way split image, showing current and former co-stars Shia LaBeouf, Will Arnett and Jake Johnson.\n\nNoticeably absent from her not the father collage is, of course, Green.\n\nThe couple, who tied the knot in 2010, have been spotted spending time together in recent months, often on outings in Los Angeles with their two children. Just last month, though she wasn't wearing her wedding ring, Fox did use the pronoun we when discussing her upcoming birthday plans in an interview with ET.\n\nMaybe go to dinner? I don't know, we never go to dinner, she said. Maybe dinner, maybe a movie.
Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit's The Nashville Sound is out Friday. It's the sixth album for singer-songwriter Isbell, who has won two Grammy awards and cracked the top 10 of the U.S. album charts.\n\nHe also has something else to celebrate.\n\nAt 38, Isbell has become one of Nashville's most acclaimed singer-songwriters, with songs about heartache and loss as well as learning and redemption. He has lived all of that, reports CBS News' Mark Strassmann.\n\n\n\nIsbell just launched a six-month international tour that will take him from Cincinnati to Copenhagen, backed by his band the 400 Unit.\n\nOff-stage, crowds will not see who else he brought on tour: a young, devoted fan named Mercy -- his 21-month-old daughter.\n\nIt's a lot of fun to be able to take her on the road, and I'm really dreading the time when that's going to have to stop, ya know? Isbell said. There's a big responsibility, so I have to look at it like, would I want her to be around somebody like me?\n\nBut early in his career, Isbell acted like the child. In his 20s, when he played with the group the Drive-By Truckers, by his own admission Isbell drank a fifth of Jack Daniel's a day and loved cocaine.\n\nIt was so bad that I can't have one drink ever again. That's gotta be pretty bad, Isbell said.\n\nToo much for the Drive-By Truckers. In 2007, they kicked him out of the band. He also lost his marriage.\n\nHe got really upset and told me he had a problem and couldn't quit drinking on his own. He'd tried it, said musician Amanda Shires, the friend who refused to give up on him.\n\nI just thought this person is my friend and this person is asking for help and that's what's going to happen and if it means that our relationship doesn't survive then that's just what is going to happen, Shires said.\n\nIn 2012, he entered treatment. He has been sober and clean ever since.\n\nA year later, the woman who saved Isbell became his wife. Sometimes Shires plays with his band, but mostly she's a solo artist and often on a separate tour.\n\nWhen baby Mercy was born, they agreed: sometimes she would tour with her mother, other times he would become country music's Mr. Mom.\n\nWhatever needed to be done I need to know how to do it just as well as my wife. You know, for us to be able to really balance the parenting, Isbell said. It was very humbling and it was also, um--terrifying. Because you know giving a baby a bath for the first time is one of the scariest things you can do on this whole earth.\n\nAfter I quit drinking I thought I got a handle on this adult living situation and then that baby comes along and every corner becomes a death trap. Everything I see, is like somebody needs to put that away. Somebody could trip and fall and hurt themselves on this.\n\nAsked what kind of dad Isbell is, Shires said, The kind everybody wishes they had. He's a funny dad and he plays the games, changes diapers, makes food, great, a great dad.\n\nParenting on the road has brought Isbell a new focus: Mercy is the real headliner in the Isbell family.\n\nMy wife may be the role model for our daughter in some ways, but I think I represent what she'll put up with. You know, I think one day she'll say, 'OK my dad behaved this way so if whoever I happen to fall in love with behaves this way it's got to be OK because I love my dad,' Isbell said.\n\nIsbell has won two Grammy awards, but he knows the prize that matters most is the reward of raising a happy, healthy child.
The release of special counsel Robert Mueller's long-awaited report last Thursday created new headlines, but did nothing to lessen the country's partisan divide. One fact, however, that at least U.S.intelligence officials agree on is that Russia's cyber espionage efforts constitute one of the greatest threats we face as a nation.\n\nTonight, we're going to tell you about one of the most insidious aspects of that threat, one that goes well beyond what Robert Mueller documented in his investigation: it is the growing and unlikely partnership between Russian government spymasters and Russian cybercriminals.\n\nOne of the first public hints of this unholy alliance came, coincidentally, when President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia's intelligence agencies for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. At the same time, and little noticed, he also sanctioned two big-time Russian criminal hackers. How the FBI came to unmask them is a great detective story and a rare window into this marriage made in Hell.\n\nEvgeniy Bogachev\n\nJohn Carlin: What you're seeing is one of the world's most sophisticated intelligence operations when it comes to cyber espionage using the criminal groups for their intelligence ends and protecting them from law enforcement.\n\nJohn Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security during the Obama administration, echoes what current U.S. Officials have confirmed to us about the Russians.\n\nLesley Stahl: So the intelligence agencies are what, piggybacking on the criminal enterprise?\n\nJohn Carlin: Increasingly, you cannot tell which is which when it comes to the criminal and the intelligence agency. So one day, the same crook may be doing something purely to make a buck. But that same crook may be directed by a trained intelligence operative using the same tools and techniques to steal information from them for the goals of the state.\n\nLesley Stahl: Why would the government rely on crooks? They could do their own intelligence.\n\nJohn Carlin: By relying increasingly on criminals and the tools that they use, they make it really difficult to figure out who did it. They wanna hide their tracks.\n\nFor years, they were able to hide their tracks behind the criminal exploits of this Russian hacker, Evgeniy Bogachev, one of the FBI's most wanted cybercriminals today, with a $3 million bounty on his head.\n\nDave Hickton: He is the most prolific, most dangerous, and most notorious cybercriminal in history.\n\nDave Hickton is the former U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh who oversaw the government's investigation of Bogachev, which began in 2009.\n\nLesley Stahl: In the beginning, did you know anything about his connections to the Russian government?\n\nDave Hickton: We were very much in the dark about who he was, where he was. He was a phantom over the internet effectively.\n\nA phantom with no known address or nationality who went by the online aliases of Slavik and lucky12345. What was known was that he had created a computer program that enabled him to steal victims' online credentials, which he then used to drain their bank accounts. It was called Gameover ZeuS.\n\nDave Hickton: If you were infected, it was game over.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did he just do individuals or did he go in and disrupt companies?\n\nDave Hickton: Oh, both. He was particularly prolific with banks and businesses at the time of payroll.\n\nTo help identify lucky12345, the feds brought together cybersecurity experts from around the world, including Microsoft, which was already looking into this because so many of its clients had been hacked.\n\nLesley Stahl: So this is the Microsoft Cybercrime Center?\n\nTom Burt: it is. It is the home of our Digital Crimes Unit.\n\nCorrespondent Lesley Stahl with Tom Burt\n\nTom Burt is a vice president of cybersecurity at Microsoft, which was enlisted to understand how Gameover ZeuS worked and to identify where the infected computers were located.\n\nTom Burt: This is Omaha, Nebraska. And the FBI reported that the first infections they found were here in Omaha.\n\nLesley Stahl: And then you begin to see what? Show us.\n\nTom Burt: Well, you see where all the infected computers were that were part of this criminal network.\n\nLesley Stahl: Oh my goodness. Whoa.\n\nTom Burt: These are the infected devices connecting to the internet throughout the United States that were part of this Gameover ZeuS criminal enterprise. And now you can see how it was really a global-- a global network.\n\nA global network of a million infected computers under the complete control of this cyberthief.\n\nLesley Stahl: You know what's almost as interesting as where the red dots are, is where they're not.\n\nTom Burt: That is interesting.\n\nLesley Stahl: So look at Russia.\n\nTom Burt: It's not at all unusual for these criminals who operate these kinds of networks to actually design their code so it will not infect computers in the country they live in.\n\nAs Microsoft investigators worked with the FBI to map the spread of Gameover ZeuS, they also reverse-engineered its computer code. And what they saw stunned them: a thicket of interconnected infected computers around the world that made it nearly impossible to trace back to its creator, lucky12345.\n\nTom Burt: We looked at it and said, Whoa, how do we stop this?\n\nLesley Stahl: And he was just hiding behind all of this. The Wizard of Oz behind everything.\n\nTom Burt: The very rich Wizard of Oz.\n\nWhat Microsoft figured out was a way to pull back the wizard's curtain.\n\nTom Burt: We created computers that we called honey pots that we actually got onto the criminal network. We got them infected so that we could then see all the traffic, all the communication that was passing through the network.\n\nLesley Stahl: And once you were able to do that, what-- was it just a matter of time before you broke them down?\n\nTom Burt: Once we had that information and we understood how the network worked we gave that to the FBI. They then had a lotta work to do before they were able to identify who the real bad guy was.\n\nThe FBI turned to other security experts for help. One of them was Brett Stone-Gross of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.\n\nBrett Stone-Gross\n\nLesley Stahl: When you started to analyze Gameover ZeuS, how advanced, how sophisticated, Brett, was it?\n\n\n\nBrett Stone-Gross: From every angle it was innovative and brilliant. And what they did was they had designed the system that was very difficult for both researchers and law enforcement to take action against.\n\nLesley Stahl: How long did you track him?\n\nBrett Stone-Gross: Yeah, we had tracked him close to 10 years.\n\nLesley Stahl: You chased this guy for ten years?\n\nBrett Stone-Gross: Yup.\n\nAs the FBI dug deeper, they realized his criminal operation was every bit as innovative and brilliant as his computer code. Lucky12345 had assembled something law enforcement had never seen before: a syndicate of super cyber-criminals looting banks and businesses with impunity.\n\nDave Hickton: We were chasing a group of individuals, which was known as the Business Club, which was a collection of some of the most skilled and dangerous cybercriminals in the world who had formed what was basically a 21st century mafia don club for the internet.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you ever determine how much money they actually stole?\n\nDave Hickton: We stopped counting at $100 million in the United States. And I really think the answer is he stole as much as you can count.\n\nAfter years of investigation, they were no closer to identifying the mastermind, until finally they got a tip from a source.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you really didn't catch him with whatever tools we have. You had to have a human being walk in like in the old days.\n\nDave Hickton: Right. This confidential human source came forward and said, I think this email address, which traces back to Russia, is gonna be the ticket to find him, and that proved true.\n\nI think increasingly today, the Russian government is a criminal syndicate.\n\nBecause the email address was how lucky12345 communicated with his criminal syndicate. And by connecting many dots, the FBI was eventually able to identify the mastermind as Evgeniy Bogachev, a raccoon-eyed, 30-year-old whose last known address was here in Anapa, a Russian resort city on the Black Sea. Online photos show him on his boat, with his wife and with his spotted bengal cat in his matching pajamas. The feds finally had their man.\n\nMeanwhile, they had analyzed his computer server where, says former Justice Department official John Carlin, they saw that Bogachev had begun searching around for targets outside his criminal activities.\n\nJohn Carlin: We saw them doing things like right before Russia was going to invade Ukraine, we saw that same network being used to collect information on Ukraine. And we saw terms like Top Secret or Department of Defense being used as search terms or queries.\n\nLesley Stahl: U.S. Department of Defense?\n\nJohn Carlin: Yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: What other agencies was he looking into?\n\nJohn Carlin: There were queries targeting the FBI. And—\n\nLesley Stahl: Why the FBI?\n\nJohn Carlin: It seems like they were looking for information that they could use to then compromise or try to turn FBI agents.\n\nAll of which led U.S. national security officials to conclude that Bogachev had become an asset of Russian intelligence, though U.S. investigators had no concrete proof of Moscow directing him. They would get proof in another case, involving this Russian cyber thief, Alexsey Belan, who was indicted in 2017 along with two Russian intelligence officers charged with directing him.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Belan didn't start working with Russian intelligence until after the U.S. asked Russia for help in arresting him for identity theft and other cyber crimes.\n\nJohn Carlin: This was a period, we were looking for cooperation from the Russians. Not only did they not help, they signed him up as an intelligence asset after we asked for help.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you identify him for them as a brilliant hacker, and then they sign him up to work for them the way they did with Bogachev?\n\nJohn Carlin: Yeah, not what you were looking for with cooperation, right?\n\nLesley Stahl: And then were you able to see that he was working for intelligence, trying to gather information for the state?\n\nJohn Carlin: And that's the incredible detail in this indictment. This is the first case where we're able to show he's getting direct requests from Russian intelligence officers and they are providing him secret information that he can use to evade detection and arrest.\n\nBelan then proceeded to commit one of the most far-reaching hacks ever, from 2014 to 2016, into Yahoo, one of the world's busiest internet sites.\n\nLesley Stahl: That was gigantic, that Yahoo hack.\n\nJohn Carlin: People estimate 500 million to a billion email addresses.\n\nLesley Stahl: So the Russians have their eyes on half a billion-plus people's computers. And this guy is siphoning off money.\n\nJohn Carlin: They still let him be the-- the crook that he wants to be.\n\nLesley Stahl: Uh-huh.\n\nJohn Carlin: But then they'll also use that same trove of information to target people they might be interested in for intelligence purposes.\n\nPeople, he says, like business leaders and foreign government officials, in order to steal classified information or to search for something compromising to blackmail them. As documented in both the Belan and Bogachev cases.\n\nLesley Stahl: Are they the only two cases that we know about?\n\nJohn Carlin: If you look at the most wanted cyber criminals, it's a who's who of Russians.\n\nLesley Stahl: Now you mentioned Putin. Is he aware of all of this? Has he personally sanctioned this kind of activity?\n\nJohn Carlin: There is no doubt that he is both aware of it and has personally sanctioned some of the activity.\n\nLesley Stahl: Wow.\n\nJohn Carlin: This is a kleptocracy. This is a government by theft. And the thing that matters the most is that you do what the don wants, what the head of the crime family wants. And here, the head of the crime family is Putin.\n\nLesley Stahl: The Russian government is running a criminal syndicate. I mean is that going too far?\n\nJohn Carlin: No. I think increasingly today, the Russian government is a criminal syndicate. It's a rogue state when it comes to cyber activity and it's causing harm to countries, companies, and people throughout the world.\n\nProduced by Richard Bonin and Ayesha Siddiqi
The last time $100 billion was spent buying Time Warner was back in 2000, when the media giant joined forces with the dotcom-era darling AOL in a stock-based merger that proved so disastrous it's widely seen as the worst corporate marriage in history.\n\nIt turned out that after the dotcom crash, an overly inflated AOL was forced to take a monstrous goodwill write-off of nearly $99 billion on Time Warner in 2002. AOL's market value slumped from $226 billion to around $20 billion. A few years later Time Warner spun off its Time Warner Cable division and then AOL as independent companies. The vastly shrunken AOL was acquired by Verizon in 2015 for just $4.4 billion.\n\nLooking back, the AOL-Time Warner deal was marred by cultural incompatibilities and AOL's inability to respond to the rise of broadband vs. dial-up internet access. AOL lost its competitive position and couldn't extract the expected financial synergies from the deal.\n\nFast forward to Tuesday, when a federal judge approved AT&T's blockbuster buyout of Time Warner, valued at $85 billion without debt and $108 billion including net debt. Will AT&T (T) fare better than AOL did? The odds are against the phone company: According to McKinsey & Co., nearly 70 percent of mergers fail to generate the revenue boost management expects.\n\nSo why is another company shelling out big bucks for Time Warner (TWX) yet again? With Comcast (CMCSA) nabbing NBC Universal in its entirety in 2013 and Verizon (VZ) buying Yahoo, telecoms have been moving toward vertical integration. Rather than just be a pipe that's delivering content, they want to be in the content business as well.\n\nThat's all in an effort to head off the competition from over-the-top internet-based media providers like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), and to fight off the problem of lost subscribers and cable cord-cutting by adding a new source of revenue: digital advertising. Now, wireless and satellite-TV giant AT&T (which owns DirecTV) is set to add CNN and HBO to its stable.\n\nFirst proposed in October 2016, the deal, when finalized, will mark the 33rd takeover in AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson's 11-year tenure. But to make this one work, he and the rest of AT&T will need to convince millions of people to break with recent media trends and get excited again about pay TV -- even though Time Warner has lost more than a million TV subscribers since the end of 2016.\n\nAT&T's initial plan is to roll out a new offering called Watch, a $15-a-month sports-free online TV package. The hope is access to popular shows like HBO's Game of Thrones will encourage cross-selling and service bundling as well.\n\nAnother AOL-level culture shock is possible: AT&T is a former utility company based in Dallas, while Time Warner is a media company with operations in New York City and Los Angeles. Red state vs. blue states. Media creatives vs. suited-up telecom types. What could go wrong?
Daddy, can you spare a dime? Apparently, many do -- and much more than a skinny coin. One out of six American adults receive financial support from their parents or other family members, who chip in for everything from rent to basics like groceries.\n\nMillennials are delaying major milestones like homebuying and marriage, and financial independence is included among those, according to research from Country Financial. One in three adults surveyed by the financial services company said they don't believe they should have financial independence until they're at least 25.\n\nThat may be in stark contrast to how earlier generations viewed independence, adulthood and money. Today, six in 10 millennials are unmarried, or three times the rate of the silent generation (people now in their 70s and 80s), when the average marriage age was 21 for women and 23 for men.\n\nBut the U.S. economy has also changed since their parents and grandparents entered the workforce. The financial crisis and Great Recession hit millennials just as they were entering the job market -- and many of them are also juggling hefty student loan repayments.\n\nThey may have been unemployed or underemployed, and if you lose those early couple of years in your career, it takes a long time to recover, noted Doyle Williams, executive vice president of Country Financial. When I went to college, you could work a part-time job and pay your way through with a small student loan.\n\nHe added, What I found surprising was the response to the survey. People are saying they're lazy or they don't care or some other reason that's negative, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nAdult Americans who receive help from their families are making rational economic choices, he said. Balancing debt, underemployment and stagnant income, they may be hoping to forestall costs so they can build their careers and enjoy the payoffs later.\n\nSome parents keep their kids on their cellphone plans or Netflix family subscription because it's cheaper to carry these group plans than to ask each person to subscribe individually. (And it's not only adult children who do this: Williams noted that he's on his 25-year-old son's Netflix account.)\n\nSharing entertainment subscriptions is a theme in Refinery29's Money Diary series, a column in which millennials disclose their income and spending habits. In one recent column, an engineer earning a salary of $78,000 per year noted that her parents paid for her car and she spends nothing for Netflix -- because she uses her parents' password.\n\nIt's not only millennials who are still relying on mom and dad for financial support, according to Northwestern Mutual, which ran its own survey about American financial habits earlier this year. The financial services firm found that 15 percent of the adults who receive help from family members are 35 to 49 years old, or Generation X.\n\nWhat was striking to me was the idea of the 35- to 49-year-old group, they had the impact of the 2008 crisis, said Emily Holbrook, director of personal markets at Northwestern Mutual. Gen X adults are looking at divorce and child care payments. Even if your earnings have gone up, disposable income is getting squeezed.\n\nAcross the board, 16 percent of Americans -- or one in six -- receive financial support from parents or other family members, Northwestern Mutual found. The top categories of expenses that adults get help with are bill payments, such as credit cards, mobile phones and cable bills, basic necessities such as food and clothing, and housing costs.\n\nIn Holbrook's view, part of the problem is a systemic change in financial risk from corporations and governments onto individuals. Previous generations could rely on pensions from employers, while college costs were much lower, she noted. Now, Americans are accountable for managing and saving in their own retirement plans, and the skyrocketing cost of college leaves many adults saddled with debt.\n\nParents and other family members naturally want to help struggling adult children, yet Holbrook said the first place to start is a discussion about budgeting, emergency funds and creating a financial plan.\n\nAnd helping adult children will ultimately backfire if the parents haven't saved for their own retirement. That's not all that uncommon. Northwestern Mutual found that one in five Americans have no retirement savings.\n\nPeople need to have a level of financial discipline, Holbrook said. Ultimately, all parents want their children to be set up for success for life.
Vice President Mike Pence told the nation's governors on Monday that President Trump's comments at his Saturday rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, about slowing down testing for the coronavirus were just a passing observation, according to audio of the call obtained by CBS News Correspondent Ed O'Keefe. On Monday, Pence clarified the president's comments about testing under questioning by Nevada Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak, who sought assurance that state and federal leaders would stay on the same page about the importance of testing for COVID-19. Sisolak called the president's comments not helpful — but neither he nor Pence referred to them as a joke, according to audio of the call.\n\nThe president's comments on Saturday night as it related to his order to slow down the testing were certainly not helpful, Sisolak told Pence. We're doing everything we can in Nevada to increase our testing, to increase the availability of the testing and our cases have gone up. It's not solely a result of more testing, it's also a result of people not wearing masks and not following the social protocols. So, if we could all get on the same page and get a commitment that there's not a federal mandate to slow down testing I think it would be extremely helpful.\n\nCBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports that Pence told Sisolak the administration is going to continue to partner with you on testing, I think the president's observation was a passing observation in his remarks. The vice president said the increased capacity in daily testing is leading to a higher number of positive results. In a statement after the call on Monday, Sisolak said testing is a critical component to Nevada's Roadmap to Recovery reopening plan, adding that an increase in testing helps determine the spread of the virus in the community and gives state and local public health operations critical information to pursue aggressive measures to help monitor and respond to outbreaks.\n\nPence also told the governors the Trump administration remains focused on rising cases in nine states, with the situation stable in the other 41, and he told the governors that medical officials are seeing a growing trend of more people under age 45 testing positive for coronavirus. We are seeing steady progress in the vast majority of states, Pence told the governors, according to one person listening in on the call. During the call, Pence also called on Republican governors from Florida, Texas and Arizona to explain how they're handling a sharp rise in infection in their states. Pence and other officials on the call especially praised Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis for his management of a record number of infections in the Sunshine State. DeSantis reiterated what he has said publicly — that increased testing among younger, asymptomatic people is driving the rate of infection.\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nJoe Biden is planning to participate in three previously-scheduled debates with Mr. Trump and not one more, his campaign confirmed to CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe on Monday. The Biden campaign is also calling on the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates to explain how it plans to hold the in-person debates scheduled for September and October despite the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThere is no reason why Vice President Biden and President Trump cannot meet for debates with appropriate safety and social distancing measures (set by public health authorities) on the three dates the CPD has identified. Nothing should prevent the conduct of debates between Joe Biden and Donald Trump on these dates; again, we do not want to provide President Trump with any excuses for not debating, the Biden campaign wrote in a letter to the commission on Monday.\n\nThe commission has organized the televised debates dating back to 1988. This year, debates are also set to occur on September 29 at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana; October 15 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan and October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 7 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nTwo more staff members working on the president's Tulsa rally tested positive for the coronavirus, the Trump campaign confirmed to CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe. These staff members attended the rally but were wearing masks during the entire event. Upon the positive tests, the campaign immediately activated established quarantine and contact tracing protocols, Trump communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. On Saturday, the Trump campaign confirmed six members of the advance team had tested positive for coronavirus only hours before the president's first rally in over three months kicked off. NBC was the first to report the positive cases.\n\nJust under 6,200 attendees filed into the BOK Center to watch Mr. Trump during his first rally, according to the Tulsa Fire Marshall's office. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports aides to the president's re-election bid, including campaign manager Brad Parscale, touted that there were 1 million RSVPs online. But with far fewer than expected showing up at arena doors, an outdoor stage assembled for overflow crowds who would not fit into the 19,000 seat arena was swiftly dismantled. White House senior adviser and Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Parscale both admitted over the weekend to Mr. Trump that they are not strategists, amid concerns the campaign lacks an overall strategy, CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett and White House coordinating producer Arden Farhi report. According to multiple conversations with campaign advisers and Trump allies, Mr. Trump grew frustrated by the yawning gap between the advertised crowd size and what materialized.\n\nMr. Trump's Tulsa rally has been viewed as a breakdown in data management, among GOP circles. Republican officials tell CBS News that while it is not a calamity that only 6,000 people showed up, a sharper analysis of rally RSVPs would have revealed thousands punked the Trump campaign with fake sign-ups, leveling expectations for the rally turnout amid new coronavirus case spikes in Oklahoma. Saturday's rally has strained the historically tight and reinforcing relationship between Parscale and the Trump family, including Kushner. The mounting pressure comes amid a campaign shakeup. Top 2016 Trump campaign official Jason Miller rejoined the president's re-election team this month, tasked with redefining the campaign's driving message. Bill Stepien, senior advisor to the campaign, was promoted to deputy campaign manager in late May.\n\nISSUES THAT MATTER\n\nVOTING RIGHTS\n\nThe Democratic Association of Secretaries of States (DASS) is trying to flip the seats of chief elections officers in five states and kickstarted the effort Monday with the release of a digital ad highlighting the office charged with protecting voter rights, reports CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. The occurrence of the coronavirus pandemic in an election year has thrown a spotlight on the voting process because of changes states have been making to limit voters' exposure. The ad, which will be featured on social media sites, ties black voter suppression to white supremacy in the U.S. White supremacy does not endure on its own. It is propped up by suppressing black voices and votes, a narrator says in the nearly two-minute long video.\n\nIN THE SENATE\n\nKENTUCKY\n\nA race worth watching on Tuesday that was not receiving national attention until recent weeks is the Democratic Senate primary in Kentucky, reports CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson. Former Marine Amy McGrath had been the favorite after receiving support from national Democrats and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, but state Representative Charles Booker has surged in recent weeks, collecting high-profile endorsements from Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren while participating in protests across the state. Internal polling shared with CBS News by the McGrath campaign shows McGrath has about a 10-point lead on Booker, but a spokesperson for Booker said it's hard to rely on polling when the race is changing everyday as Booker becomes more well known. An official on the Booker campaign told CBS News their internal polling shows similar margins to McGrath's campaign's polling with Booker only 10 points down, but a few weeks before that, he was 50 points down. The official said the trajectory suggests Booker could win but wouldn't be surprised if he didn't. McGrath has been hit in ads from the left and the right — by Booker for not being a real Democrat and from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling her Extreme Amy for being too far left. Booker and McGrath are competing to take on McConnell in November. McConnell has seven primary challengers on the ballot, but he is the favorite.\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nNew York, Kentucky and Virginia will be holding congressional primaries on Tuesday, and with a Republican runoff in North Carolina's 11th District as well, a total of 41 House seats will be on the ballot. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro has a rundown of the most notable races to watch this week:\n\nNEW YORK\n\nProgressives will be closely watching the results in New York's 16th District, as their backed challenger Jamaal Bowman is looking to unseat 31-year incumbent Eliot Engel. Bowman has been backed by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who unseated a longtime incumbent herself in 2018. Engel has received endorsements from Hillary Clinton, Governor Andrew Cuomo and Senator Chuck Schumer. The Democratic Majority for Israel PAC has waded into this race late to boost Engel, trying to hit Bowman with an ad about unpaid taxes (Bowman responded on Twitter to the ad). As of June 19, the group has spent at least $1.55 million on this race.\n\nNearby in the South Bronx, more than 10 candidates are running to fill the open seat in the state's 15th District. Democrats are looking to beat city councilman Ruben Diaz Sr., a Puerto-Rican born pastor that has a history of being against same-sex marriage and abortion, as well as being friendly toward Mr. Trump. Council member Ritchie Torres is looking to prevent Diaz Sr. from holding the seat, and told CBS News political reporter Grace Segers the election of Díaz Sr. would be one of the greatest tragedies of 2020. Segers has more on that race here.\n\nIn the 17th District, seven candidates are looking to represent Congresswoman Nita Lowey's old seat. The latest available poll shows lawyer Mondaire Jones with an 11-point lead over former Obama defense official Evelyn Farkas and Adam Schleifer, who served as a federal prosecutor in California and is the son of a pharmaceutical CEO. Schleifer has funneled more than $4 million of his own wealth into the campaign.\n\nCongresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is facing her own primary this Tuesday, with former journalist Michelle Caruso-Cabrera looking to unseat the high-profile freshman Democrat. Caruso-Cabrera, backed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and endorsed by the New York Post, has framed Ocasio-Cortez as more concerned with national politics than the district. Ocasio-Cortez has a large fundraising advantage, with more than $10 million raised, and aired an attack ad saying Caruso-Cabrera isn't one of us and has ties to Wall Street.\n\nVIRGINIA & KENTUCKY\n\nWhile some districts in Virginia opted for Republican conventions rather than primaries, seven districts still have primaries on Tuesday. In districts of targeted House Democrats such as Elaine Luria in Virginia's 2nd, Republicans are looking to settle on their challenger. Former Congressman Scott Taylor is angling for a rematch, but first has to get past veteran Jarome Bell and former candidate Ben Loyola. In the state's 10th District, Republicans chose Marine veteran Aliscia Andrews during a Saturday convention to challenge Democrat incumbent Jennifer Wexton.\n\nAnother House race to watch is in Kentucky's 4th District, where Republican Thomas Massie is facing a challenge from attorney Todd McMurtry. Massie is known recently for his attempt to delay a $2 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, prompting some ire from Mr. Trump, but an internal poll showed him with a large 77 to 11 lead.
Singapore — New Islamic criminal laws took effect in Brunei on Wednesday that make gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning offenders to death. The laws have triggered an outcry from countries, rights groups and celebrities far beyond the tiny Southeast Asian nation's shores.\n\nThe penalties were provided for under new sections of Brunei's Shariah Penal Code. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah instituted the code in 2014 to bolster the influence of Islam in the oil-rich monarchy of around 430,000 people, two-thirds of whom are Muslim.\n\nEven before 2014, homosexuality was already punishable in Brunei by a jail term of up to 10 years. But under the new laws - which apply to children and foreigners, even if they are not Muslim - those found guilty of gay sex can be stoned to death or whipped. Adulterers risk death by stoning too, while thieves face amputation of a right hand on their first offense and a left foot on their second.\n\nBrunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah (C) attends an event in Bandar Seri Begawan on April 3, 2019. Getty\n\nOppressed at home\n\nLiving in Brunei, we already knew that our sexual identity is taboo and should not be expressed. We already felt belittled before the law came to place, said a 23-year-old member of the LGBTQ community who wanted to be identified only as Kun out of fear of reprisal from the authorities.\n\nNow with it, we feel even smaller and the ones who could potentially oppress us have more opportunity to harass us to say and do what they want, he said.\n\nThere has been no vocal opposition to the new penalties in Brunei, where the sultan rules as head of state with full executive authority. Public criticism of his policies is extremely rare in the country.\n\nBacklash from the West\n\nOn Tuesday, the United States joined the United Kingdom, Germany and France in urging Brunei to halt its plans.\n\nThe United States strongly opposes violence, criminalization and discrimination targeting vulnerable groups, including women at risk of violence, religious and ethnic minorities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino said in a statement.\n\nCelebrities including George Clooney, Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres have voiced opposition to the new laws, and have rallied a boycott of nine hotels in the U.S. and Europe with ties to Hassanal, who is still sultan.\n\nAre we really going to help fund the murder of innocent citizens? Clooney wrote Thursday on Deadline Hollywood. Clooney said that while you can't shame murderous regimes, you can shame the banks, the financiers and the institutions that do business with them.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, urged Brunei's government to stop the entry into force of this Draconian new penal code.\n\nPhil Robertson, the deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, called on the sultan to immediately suspend amputations, stoning, and all other rights-abusing provisions and punishments.\n\nBrunei's Southeast Asian neighbors, some of whom also have laws banning sex between men, have remained silent, however.\n\nAnti-LGBTQ laws around the world\n\nAccording to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association's 2019 roundup, consensual same-sex sex acts are still officially or unofficially criminalized in 70 U.N. member nations. The same report said the death penalty could be implemented for consensual same-sex sexual acts in at least 10 nations. That did not include Brunei, as the law has not yet come into effect.\n\nIn neighboring Indonesia, Shariah law is officially implemented in the predominantly Muslim Aceh province, but not nationally. People have been caned for homosexual acts, and even attempted acts, in Aceh.\n\nUnder increasing pressure from Amnesty International and other rights groups, Aceh decided last year to move the canings out of the public eye and conduct them behind closed doors. For years large crowds had gathered in public to witness the spectacle.\n\nLGBTQ citizens of other nearby Muslim-majority countries were concerned about the broad new penalties in Brunei.\n\nI am very worried that Indonesia or Malaysia may follow the lead, said a 24-year-old man from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, who wanted to be identified only by his first name, Ludwig. I think people nowadays, especially the younger generation, are quite OK with LGBT, but those who are not make the loudest noise and they are the reason why it seems like everyone is against it.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Malaysia's 32 million people are Muslim. They are governed by Islamic courts in family, marriage and personal issues. Last year, two Malaysian Muslim women were convicted under Islamic laws and caned for attempting to have sex with each other.
The New Year could give you new ways to improve your regular visits to the doctor, but how can you make your exam time most worthwhile? Be empowered and come armed with information, advises CBS News medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula.\n\nSo first, you want to bring your medications, bring the bottles, bring pictures of the bottles so the doctor knows the dosage and frequency, Narula said. Talk to your family before your visit, ask did your aunt Fran have a thyroid problem? Does your mother have high blood pressure? That's very important.\n\nAlso, she recommended keeping a diary of symptoms and getting copies of medical records, which she said is your right.\n\nI can't tell you how many people have no idea what their chest X-ray showed that they had a year ago, or their stress test. That information is very useful. Keep those copies. Bring all that information to your visit, Narula said.\n\nDr. Tara Narula CBS News\n\nLast but not least, Narula said you should bring a friend or family member who can help take notes or listen during the appointment because lots of times when you're in the office, the information goes in one ear and out the other.\n\nYou're very overwhelmed. Having someone there who can kind of corroborate symptoms, add information and keep notes is useful, she said.\n\nGetting lab tests done before a checkup can sometimes be helpful if you've been seeing the same doctor for a while and you know that they order specific tests each year, Narula said.\n\nThen you can then sit face-to-face with the doctor and go over the results when you see them, she said. However, if you're a new patient, the doctor may want to order specific tests particular to whatever condition they're looking at you for, and then you would get stuck twice, essentially, so it may make sense to wait in that case.\n\nNarula said ask the doctor questions about screenings, vaccinations, cardiovascular risk and how the office functions (will they follow up?). But ultimately, establishing personal connection with your physician is the most important.\n\nThis is like a marriage. It's a very important personal relationship. You're emotionally vulnerable, you're physically vulnerable. You want to know, is this someone who's going to listen to me, who communicates in a way that I understand, and who responds to my concerns in a way that's appropriate? Narula said.\n\nBut don't have second thoughts about asking for second opinions.\n\nPeople lots of times feel uncomfortable about that. But the bottom line is: this is your health. You need to be in charge and the doctor should not get offended if you ask for a second opinion, Narula said.
Marshall Fogel, an attorney, spent $121,000 for a Mickey Mantle card in 1996. He then started amassing one of the largest personal collections of baseball memorabilia in America.\n\nFor Fogel, it's all about the love of the game.\n\nI don't care if you're the banker or the town ... sheriff ... you know, certain ethnic or race. You all went to the game, he told CBS News' Barry Petersen. You all sat pretty much together and you all rooted for the home team.\n\nIt brought people together, he added.\n\nSome of his pieces are now on exhibit at History Colorado Center in Denver, including the handprint Babe Ruth made for a palm reader and a receipt for roses that Joe DiMaggio sent to Marilyn Monroe long after their tumultuous 274-day marriage.\n\nJason Hanson was the curator who put the exhibit together along with his own memories of going to games with his father.\n\nIt's a chance to share time together which is an increasingly valuable commodity in this world, Hanson said.\n\nBats from Marshall Fogel's collection CBS News\n\n\n\nFogel has baseball's signs of changing times, like when players endorsed cigarettes or after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the all-white major leagues. There were comics so that young black children could believe their dreams would come true as well.\n\nAnd then there's Lou Gehrig, who developed ALS. Fogel has one of the last original pictures of Gehrig relegated to the dugout as disease stole his skills.\n\nIf you look closely at his face you can see and imagine what he must be thinking something's wrong. Because he's sick and maybe I won't be able to play anymore, Fogel said. No matter how great, even in 1936 when he won the MVP award, he always was a gentleman always cared about people ... and you just can't help but want to use him as a role model even today.\n\nIt's still the same game on a summer's day: nine guys against one lonely batter. And as the man who has collected so many memories knows well, it's still what it has always been.\n\nIt's so simple when life is so complex and when you add all that together it comes out that baseball is magic, Fogel said.\n\nTo hear about Marshall Fogel's most cherished piece of memorabilia and the story behind it, watch the video in the above player.
Brené Brown has a Ph.D. in social work and is a professor at the University of Houston. For her research on human behavior and emotion, she has conducted tens of thousands of interviews with study subjects and amassed reams of data. She could easily have spent her career in the academic ivory tower.\n\nBut Brené Brown chose to do something that's rare and dangerous in academia: she made her work popular, translating very rigorous scientific research into very human stories about relationships, parenting, and leadership. She just launched a popular podcast, and every one of her books is a best seller. Her plain-spoken lessons have particular resonance in these days of anxiety and disconnection.\n\nBrené Brown\n\nBill Whitaker: Your books would be in the self help section, I think.\n\nBrené Brown: That bugs the crap outta me.\n\nBill Whitaker: That bugs the crap out of you?\n\nBrené Brown: It totally does.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why?\n\nBrené Brown: I don't think we're supposed to help ourselves. I think we're supposed to help each other. I mean, I don't think we're supposed to do it alone. We all wanna be better. Right?\n\nBill Whitaker: Isn't that what you're helping people do?\n\nBrené Brown: Yes. But my message is clear that you don't have to do it alone. We were never meant to. We are neuro--\n\nBill Whitaker: So it's not self help.\n\nBrené Brown: --no, we are neuro-biologically hardwired to be in connection with other people.\n\nBrené Brown spends a lot of time building connections. To her huge social media following – millions follow her on Facebook and Instagram – and now through a new podcast called Unlocking Us.\n\nBrené Brown: And I'm not sure about you, but this is my first effing global pandemic.\n\nShe launched the podcast just over a week ago, as impacts of the coronavirus swept across America.\n\nBrené Brown: We don't know how to do this. And by this I mean, we don't know how to social distance and stay sane, we don't know how to stay socially connected but far apart. We don't know what to tell our kids. We're anxious, we're uncertain, we are a lot of us afraid. And let me tell you this for sure, and I know this from my life, I know this, from again, from 20 years of research, and 400,000 pieces of data. If you don't name what you're feeling, if you don't own the feelings, and feel them, they will eat you alive.\n\nWithin a day, Unlocking Us became the most listened-to podcast in America. Millions of people are feeling very vulnerable right now, and vulnerability is what Brené Brown has been studying for decades.\n\nBrené Brown: We asked thousands of people that question, like, What is vulnerability to you? The first date after my divorce, trying to get pregnant after my second miscarriage, starting my own business. To be alive is to be vulnerable.\n\nBill Whitaker: A lot of people associate vulnerability with weakness.\n\nBrené Brown: Definitely. Bad mythology. Vulnerability is not weakness. It's the only path to courage. Give me a single example of courage that does not require uncertainty, risk, or emotional exposure. No one, in 50,000 people, not a person has been able to give me an example of courage that did not include those things. There is no courage without vulnerability.\n\nThat message has found a receptive audience in an interesting place: the United States military.\n\nCol. Dede Halfhill: Sometimes I'll say, Have you heard of Brené Brown? And they'll say, No. And I'll say, Let me kinda walk you through this.\n\nAir Force Colonel Dede Halfhill, who's currently the spokeswoman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, first encountered Brené Brown's work when she was a squadron commander in Iraq. She's now been trained and certified to teach Brown's techniques to other military officers.\n\nCol. Dede Halfhill: Society is changing. And what society needs from its leaders is changing. It needs leaders who can have really hard conversations around things like race, sexual assault, suicide. So to say you get to be a leader who doesn't talk about feelings, that's not possible anymore.\n\nBill Whitaker: I can hear people saying, An-- an officer in the air force, someone who's, you know, fighting a war, is not supposed to feel vulnerable. You're not supposed to talk about your feelings.\n\nCol. Dede Halfhill: Vulnerability is the birthplace of courage. And courage is not doing something because you're fearless. Courage is doing something because you may be afraid and you do it anyway.\n\nCol. Dede Halfhill\n\nBrené Brown: The most vulnerable people I know are the toughest people I know.\n\nBill Whitaker: Hmmm.\n\nBrené Brown: They're just not posturing, blustery, tough. They're real tough.\n\nBill Whitaker: So finish this sentence for me. If you are courageous, there's a 100% chance that?\n\nBrené Brown: There's a 100% chance you'll get your ass kicked. You will know failure and setback and disappointment. S--\n\nBill Whitaker: It's guaranteed?\n\nBrené Brown: Guaranteed.\n\nBrown says she has plenty of proof from her own life, particularly early in her academic career.\n\nBrené Brown: I could fill this room with rejection letters. Like, I couldn't get anything published.\n\nShe had to self-publish her first book, titled Women and Shame, in 2004. But longtime friends Karen Walrond and Laura Mayes remember that Brown's confidence and ambition were always ferocious.\n\nLaura Mayes: I said, What do you want to do in five years? What's your end goal? And she was like, What I really want to do is start a global conversation on shame and vulnerability. I was like, Well, I want to be an astronaut ballerina. (LAUGH) That is how crazy it sounded to me. That, anyway. Never before or since have I ever asked the question and someone came back with such a out--\n\nKaren Walrond: Decisive answer.\n\nLaura Mayes: Decisive and outlandish answer.\n\nBRENÉ BROWN ON STAGE AT 2010 TEDx: I want to talk to you and tell some stories.\n\nSomething happened in 2010 to help make Brené Brown's goal less outlandish: she was invited to speak at TEDx in Houston, a small satellite conference of the now-famous TED Talks.\n\nBRENÉ BROWN ON STAGE AT 2010 TEDx: Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability? No.\n\nIn that 20-minute talk, Brown displayed some of the humor and humility that have since become trademarks.\n\nBRENÉ BROWN ON STAGE AT 2010 TEDx: You know how there are people that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important, that they kind of surrender and walk into it? A: That's not me, and B: I don't even hang out with people like that. (LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nKaren Walrond: And I remember afterwards, she came and sat down and she said, How'd I do? And I said, I think you just changed your life.\n\nShe had. In a Netflix special last year Brown remembered that when the TEDx talk was posted online, it immediately caught fire.\n\nBRENÉ BROWN IN NETFLIX SPECIAL: So I watch it, and it's like, three people, four people, five million, six million… [man whoops] And there's this day-- Like, yeah. You're like, Whoo!And I'm like, S***![audience laughs] Um, that's the difference!\n\nThat TED Talk became one of the most-watched ever, now viewed nearly 50 million times. Just after giving it, Brown says she came across a quote from Teddy Roosevelt, which still hangs in her office.\n\nBrené Brown: It's not the critic who counts. It's not the person who points out how the strong person stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done it better. The credit belongs to the person who's in the arena.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why is that so profound, to you?\n\nBrené Brown: Because there are so many cheap seats in the world today. Full of people who will never, never go into the arena.\n\nBill Whitaker: Like, online critics?\n\nBrené Brown: Yeah. Faceless, nameless, who will never start their own business or try to do something.\n\nCol. Dede Halfhill: When I met Brené, I showed her a card I'd been carrying in my wallet for, at that time, 22 years. And it's the Theodore Roosevelt quote. And I received that card from a wing commander when I was a second lieutenant. And that card represented for me everything I wanted to be as a military officer. I wanted to do the hard things. I wanted to step into the arena. But I wasn't. And getting into her work and understanding that work allowed me a language to know why.\n\nBill Whitaker: So what is the biggest lesson, not just military leaders, but-- say, corporate leaders should learn from Brené Brown?\n\nCol. Dede Halfhill: That this is teachable. That courage is a teachable skill. And we need it.\n\nShe may not like the description, but this fifth-generation Texan has become a brand. All the best selling books and the podcast. Legions of devoted fans, a new center at the University of Texas, her alma mater, to teach her leadership lessons, and endless speaking engagements.\n\nWhen it's a talk to NASA employees, she does it for free. For a big company, she charges up to $200,000 a speech.\n\nBill Whitaker: Why you? What-- what has clicked? Why are people listening to your message?\n\nBrené Brown: I think it's just being truthful.\n\nBill Whitaker: Your lessons, your message, is based on data. It's not just you sitting up there saying, Oh, I think this, I think that. This is all data-driven.\n\nBrené Brown: It is. It's frustrating, 'cause I don't, the data don't say what I wanna say. (LAUGH) I want vulnerability to be an intellectual pursuit. I don't want it to be about feeling and emotions and vulnerability.\n\nBill Whitaker: And the data says?\n\nBrené Brown: It's about feelings and emotions and vulnerability and self-love and how you talk to yourself and self-kindness and self-compassion, and stuff that I'm not great at, naturally.\n\nBrown and her husband Steve, a pediatrician, have been married for 26 years. Also a native Texan, he wasn't interested in an interview, but was happy to show us around Lake Travis, where they have a vacation home. On that boat ride, Brown told us about a momentous decision she made not long after they were married.\n\nBrené Brown: I was in my last semester of graduate school and I had to do a geneogram, which is like-- it's like a map you draw of your family where the lines mean different things. And-- and so I call my mom and I was like, Hey, can you help me with this geneogram over the phone? And she's like, Dead, cirrhosis of the liver. Dead, alcohol-- you know, it was like, oh, my God, shake my family tree and the drunks fall out. Like, what's happening here? So I just said that's it. I just, you know, I quit smoking and quit drinking and--\n\nBill Whitaker: On the same day.\n\nBrené Brown: Same day.\n\nBrené Brown speaks and writes very openly about her sobriety, her marriage to Steve, and how they have parented their daughter and son, who are now 20 and 14. But especially as her fame grows, there are limits, too. Brown calls them boundaries. Comedian Amy Poehler gave that idea a funny twist when she invited Brown to do a cameo in the movie she directed, Wine Country.\n\nAMY POEHLER: You're not gonna believe who's in this restaurant.\n\nRACHEL DRATCH: You'll never guess.\n\nPAULA PELL: Cher?\n\nRACHEL DRATCH: No, no, no. Ready?\n\nAMY POEHLER AND RACHEL DRATCH: Brené Brown!\n\nANA GASTEYER AND MAYA RUDOLPH: Brené Brown!?!?!\n\nOf course they can't resist interrupting her dinner.\n\nEMILY SPIVEY: How can I be generous in my assumptions of others when I hate most people?\n\nMAYA RUDOLPH: Mmm – Good one.\n\nBRENÉ BROWN: Here's the thing. We can't be generous toward other people without boundaries.\n\nMAYA RUDOLPH: Yes, Brené, yes.\n\nPAULA PELL: Boom. Boom on the boundaries.\n\n\n\nBRENÉ BROWN: So, (DRAWS CIRCLE WITH HER HAND) Boundaries.\n\nVOICES: Boundaries. Yes, oh my god, message received.\n\nIt's easy to miss, but the two women sitting to Brown's right in that scene are her real-life friends Laura Mayes and Karen Walrond.\n\nBill Whitaker: Do people actually come up to her, like she's their best friend?\n\nBOTH: Yeah. Yeah. (LAUGH)\n\nBill Whitaker: She gets that a lot?\n\nKaren Walrond: She gets a lot of-- I was afraid to come up to speak to you, but Brené Brown would tell me to be (LAUGH) courageous, so I'm-- this is me being courageous to come up and speak to you.\n\nLaura Mayes: Yeah.\n\nKaren Walrond: Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: And--does she go, Boundaries?\n\nLaura Mayes: Yes. (LAUGH)\n\nBrené Brown: You know, I've been thinking a lot about why the work resonates. And I think what people want the most is they-- they-- they don't want the lessons. They wanna see me struggling with the lessons. Because--\n\nBill Whitaker: Are you still struggling?\n\nBrené Brown: Oh, God, yes. Yeah.\n\nBill Whitaker: The teacher is learning still?\n\nBrené Brown: Oh, g-- yes. I am the worst poster person for vulnerability in the world. Like, yes I'm still struggling. I try to be honest about how hard it is. You know, and-- and that I think it's worth it.\n\nProduced by Rome Hartman. Associate producer, Sara Kuzmarov. Broadcast associate, Emilio Almonte.

A group of priests who have distanced themselves from the Catholic Church are criticizing the Vatican's recent decree that the Catholic Church cannot bless same-sex marriages. The Austrian Priests' Initiative, a group of priests leading a campaign of disobedience against the Vatican, said this week they will continue to bless same-sex couples.\n\nThe initiative (also as Pfarrer-Initiative) said in a statement that its members are deeply appalled by the new Roman decree that wants to prohibit the blessing of same-sex loving couples.\n\nThis is a relapse into times that we had hoped to be overcome with Pope Francis, the group's statement continues. In solidarity with so many, we will not reject any loving couple in the future who wants to celebrate God's blessing, which they experience every day, in a church-service.\n\nReality has long since shown that same-sex couples connected in love can very well celebrate God's blessing in church. A state-of-the-art theology establishes this responsible practice, the statement reads.\n\nThe Austrian Priests' Initiative was founded in 2006 by nine priests and now has around 350 members from the ranks of the Roman Catholic church. The majority of its members are from Austria, but the initiative has expanded to other countries. More than 3,000 people support the reform movement, led by Father Helmut Schüller.\n\nThe group's call to disobedience aims to reform the Catholic church. In part, they would like to create a new image of a priest, so that a man or woman, married or unmarried, can serve as a priest.\n\nThe Austrian Priest's Initiative is an Austria-wide movement of Roman Catholic priests and deacons who follow their conscience and campaign for new paths in the church, the group said in its statement. Its goals are: lively congregations, contemporary synodal church structures and, above all, a credible and open-minded world church that focuses on sincere service to people.\n\nThe group also said it vehemently protests against the assumption that same-sex couples are not part of God's divine plan. We deeply regret that this decree, which seeks to revive the spirit of bygone times, widens the gap between Roman bureaucracy and the local Church, the group said. This decree offends many Christians and obscures and discredits the liberating message of Jesus.\n\nThe Vatican's decree states the Church cannot bless same-sex unions since God cannot bless sin, the Associated Press reports.\n\nThe Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which is the Vatican's orthodoxy office, issued a two-page explanation published in seven languages and approved by Pope Francis.\n\nThe Vatican upholds that gay people must be treated with respect and dignity, however, gay sex is considered intrinsically disordered. In Catholicism, marriage is a lifelong union between a man and woman, is intended for the sake of creating new life, and is part of God's plan, the AP reports.
The Chinese city of Yiwu is set to launch a database that will allow residents to check whether their romantic partners have histories of domestic abuse before marriage, according to local media. The database — expected to roll out on July 1 — will let people in the city of 1.2 million see past detentions or restraining orders taken out against citizens across China since 2017, as well as information on any domestic abuse convictions.\n\nThere has been a stark rise in reports of domestic abuse during coronavirus lockdowns in China — and around the world — as victims and survivors have found themselves trapped behind closed doors alongside perpetrators.\n\nMany times, marriage parties only know whether the other party has committed domestic violence after marriage. By establishing a query system, the marriage partner can know whether the other party has domestic violence records before marriage, and consider whether to enter a marriage, Zhou Danying, vice chairman of the Yiwu Women's Federation, told regional news outlet The Paper.\n\nThe purpose is to prevent domestic violence, she said.\n\nDomestic abuse wasn't explicitly outlawed in China until 2016, when partner assault was criminalized, though earlier, in 2001, domestic abuse was permitted as grounds for divorce. Chinese courts, however, often refuse to grant divorces on those grounds, instead encouraging reconciliation between husbands and wives, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nA recent change in the civil law also requires a 30 day cooling off period before a couple can go ahead with a divorce, which can make it harder for victims trying to flee abuse at home.\n\nI hope the system can be adapted in more regions and encourage authorities to be more active in accepting domestic violence cases, gender expert Zheng Shiyin told Sixth Tone, a local news website. She added, however, that there were limitations.\n\nThe current system only recognizes domestic violence records issued by the official channels. However, in reality, such records are often hard to issue. For example, to apply for a personal safety protection order from the court, one needs to provide quite a lot of evidence, which is often hard for victims to collect, she said.\n\nIt would be forbidden to copy or disseminate information from Yiwu's new domestic abuse database, and each person looking up a potential partner would have to commit to privacy restrictions, provide information about themselves and their fiance, and only be allowed to make two searches a year.\n\nCBS News' Grace Qi in Beijing contributed research for this report.
Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh drew bipartisan criticism Thursday for saying the country won't elect Pete Buttigieg president because he's been kissing his husband on stage after debates.\n\nLimbaugh's comments came eight days after President Trump bestowed the nation's top civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, during the State of the Union address. Mr. Trump said Limbaugh inspires millions of people daily and thanked him for decades of tireless devotion to our country.\n\nLimbaugh, a Trump ally who recently announced he has advanced lung cancer, made the remarks on his nationally syndicated radio show. Buttigieg has finished in the top two in Democrats' first two presidential contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThey're saying, 'OK, how's this going to look?' Limbaugh said Wednesday, imagining Democrats' thinking. Thirty-seven-year-old gay guy kissing his husband on stage, next to Mr. Man, Donald Trump.'\n\nButtigieg didn't directly address Limbaugh's remarks. But at a town hall in Las Vegas Thursday night, he said, I'm proud of my marriage I'm proud of my husband.\n\nLimbaugh's remarks were the latest tendentious turn in a career in which he's won an adoring audience among millions of conservative listeners, but condemnation from others for comments considered racist, sexist and offensive.\n\nButtigieg, 38, is the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and has been married to his husband, Chasten, since 2018. Buttigieg was a U.S. Navy intelligence officer in Afghanistan, is a Harvard graduate and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University in England.\n\nLimbaugh said he envisioned Democrats concluding that despite all the great wokeness and despite all the great ground that's been covered, that America's still not ready to elect a gay guy kissing his husband on the debate stage president.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, who is challenging Buttigieg for the Democratic presidential nomination, assailed Limbaugh on ABC's The View.\n\nI mean, my God, said Biden, who called it part of the depravity of this administration. He added, Pete and I are competitors, but this guy has honor, he has courage, he is smart as hell.\n\nMr. Trump, asked if Americans would vote for a gay man to be president, responded, I think so.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump, who was speaking with Geraldo Rivera on Cleveland's Newsradio WTAM, added: I think there would be some that wouldn't. I wouldn't be among that group, to be honest with you.\n\nSome Capitol Hill Republicans said they disagreed with Limbaugh's remark, while others demurred.\n\nI'm just going to leave all that alone, said conservative Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, who said she'd not heard the comment. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, who is facing reelection this fall, also declined to comment.\n\nIt's a miscalculation as to where the country is at, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a strong Trump supporter, told The Associated Press, in response to Limbaugh's remarks. I think the country is not going to disqualify somebody because of their sexual orientation.\n\nAsked if Limbaugh should retain the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which Trump bestowed last week during his State of the Union address, Graham said, Well, my God. Free speech still exists.\n\nOhio Senator Rob Portman said of Limbaugh, He may disagree, as I do, with their policy positions, but the question is what their qualifications are, not other issues. Portman announced his support for gay marriage in 2013 as he revealed that his son Will is gay.\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee, a moderate who is retiring in January, initially said he wasn't familiar with Limbaugh's remarks and declined to comment. His spokesman later emailed an Alexander statement that said: There may be reasons not to vote for Mayor Buttigieg, but that's not one of them. This is a tolerant country.\n\nA Buttigieg campaign spokesman declined to comment.\n\nBut the candidate has addressed criticism over his sexuality before. During a Des Moines, Iowa, rally in 2019, an audience member asked what he should tell his friends who say America isn't ready for a gay president. Buttigieg replied, Tell your friends I said 'hi.'\n\nThe former mayor has also framed his sexuality in religious terms.\n\nIf me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, Buttigieg said. If you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\n\nAccording to government websites, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is for an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\n\nPast award recipients have included Mother Teresa, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and Frank Sinatra. Under Mr. Trump, the award has been bestowed on golfer Tiger Woods, supply side economist Arthur Laffer and Edwin Meese III, who was a top aide to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe 69-year-old Limbaugh also said some Democrats may believe they should get a gay guy kissing his husband on stage, ram it down Trump's throat and beat him in the general election. Really? Having fun envisioning that.
Produced by Chuck Stevenson and Gayane Keshishyan Mendez\n\nA murder that stunned an upscale California neighborhood more than six years ago is now the focus of an international manhunt — and authorities are asking the public for help.\n\nWe had no idea this was going to become the logistical monster that it has, U.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey tells 48 Hours.\n\nPeter Chadwick and his wife, Q.C. Chadwick, seemed to have the perfect life. College sweethearts, they were married for 21 years and had three sons. They lived in a gated community in Newport Beach, California. That dream life collapsed one day in 2012 when neither of the Chadwicks turned up to pick up their sons from the bus stop. Investigators had little idea that day the case would lead to an international manhunt.\n\nThe next morning, authorities got a 911 call in San Diego, the next county over. It was Peter Chadwick, claiming a house painter named Juan murdered Q.C. and forced him to put her body in his SUV and drive down to the Mexican border. Once there, Chadwick said Juan met another man and took off with Q.C.'s body. Chadwick told the 911 operator they were planning to cut her up and dump the body south of the border. Authorities didn't buy Chadwick's story, and charged him with his wife's murder. He was soon released on a $1 million bond. Two years later he vanished.\n\nWhat led to the alleged murder? How has Chadwick been able to elude capture?\n\nBefore they mysteriously disappeared, Peter and Q.C. Chadwick had been raising their family in posh Newport Beach, California.\n\nTheir oldest son was away at boarding school on Oct. 10, 2012. That's the day his two brothers found their world turned upside down.\n\nTracy Smith: So, these boys got out of school and what happened?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters | Newport Beach Police Dept.: They get out of school and a bus drops 'em off at a bus stop near their house.\n\nSergeant Ryan Peters remembers that day.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And a neighbor saw 'em sittin' at the bus stop past the time that they typically get picked up by either Peter or Q.C.. ... So, she stopped and asked, Have you reached your mom and dad? And they said, No, they haven't been able to reach 'em. They were calling them, and nobody was answering.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore | Newport Beach Police Dept.: It was very unusual for the Chadwicks not to be punctual.\n\nLieutenant Bryan Moore was called in later.\n\nTracy Smith: Dad should be here to pick them up?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Dad is always here.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Normal protocol during a missing persons case is we're … checking with friends, we're checking with relatives.\n\nTracy Smith: And checking the hospitals, checking with family, neighbors — anybody have any idea where they are?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: All attempts to locate them were — were a dead end.\n\nThat same night, with their parents still missing, the boys slept at a friend's house. Investigators combed the Chadwick home for clues.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And then when they go upstairs and they walk into the master bath … then that's when patrol realizes there's more to the story.\n\nBroken glass found in the tub of the Chadwick's upstairs master bathroom Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: In the master bathroom, they initially saw the broken glass. ...Decorative glass that was around the bathroom tub, the edging.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: We had blood at the bottom of the bathtub.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: As you continue through the downstairs ... the safe is clearly ajar.\n\nTracy Smith: So, it's starting to look like more than just a welfare check situation.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Yeah. Obviously, whoever left, left in haste. ... It looked quite suspicious.\n\nHeidi | Neighbor: We were all in shock. Like Where is she? What's going on? Why is she missing?\n\nWord that the Chadwicks were gone spread quickly through the neighborhood. Heidi lived just across the street.\n\nQ.C. Chadwick, a devoted mom to three sons, was described as having a bubbly personality. She was very funny, said friend Karen Thorp. And so smart and talented, she could do anything. Of Peter Chadwick, Thorp said, I felt like I never really knew him very well.\n\nTracy Smith: What were they like?\n\nHeidi: Well, Q.C. was the one with all the personality. ... She was always looking forward to my annual Christmas party, because she came over and she got to dress up. And she looked like a million dollars. And she had fun!\n\nKaren Thorp | Q.C.'s friend: My first impression of her was that she was a completely devoted mother.\n\nKaren Thorp had known Q.C. for years. Their children went to school together.\n\nKaren Thorp: She was... very determined to make sure they were getting good grades and they were completing their assignments, and they were taking music and were doing a sport. She wanted them to be the best at everything.\n\nTracy Smith: And, how were they?\n\nKaren Thorp: They were the best at everything.\n\nTheir father, Peter, came from a wealthy family. He was born in Britain and had dual citizenship. Q.C.'s family was also affluent. They met at Arizona State University.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you get the sense that she was very in love with him?\n\nKaren Thorp: Yes. That she was in love with him and that she depended on him also…\n\nTracy Smith: What do you mean depended on him?\n\nKaren Thorp: Q.C. found our country to be a bit new and strange, different from where she had come from and she was learning about how to do things here.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you get the sense that Peter liked her depending on him?\n\nKaren Thorp: Yes. Yeah, we definitely all felt that he was completely comfortable with that. … She was definitely less independent than many of her friends.\n\nQ.C. and Peter married in 1991. When he grew more successful, the couple moved to that home in Newport Beach. They eventually had three sons.\n\nArt Scott taught the two older boys piano.\n\nArt Scott: They were great students … They did everything I asked.\n\nArt Scott: I would teach him [plays a tune on the piano]. Then after a few months, after he got a bit more advanced, I would teach him … [plays an extended tune]. And it would expand beyond that as he got more committed and did more work. … They were very bright kids.\n\nArt Scott: I really enjoyed being in their home. She always had a beverage for me, and something to eat every single time. And that doesn't happen, you know, every day of — for all the clients that I see. … And so, she was very congenial, very much — making me feel warm in her house.\n\nTracy Smith: And what was Peter like?\n\nKaren Thorp: He almost seemed painfully shy when we first met him. … I felt like I never really knew him very well.\n\nTracy Smith: What did Peter do?\n\nKaren Thorp: At first, we didn't really know. We thought he ran his own business and we then learned he managed some apartment buildings.\n\nTracy Smith: Was Peter kind of a mystery?\n\nKaren Thorp: Yes. Peter was a mystery.\n\nBut, Thorp says, she did sense that the couple's dynamic had been evolving over the past few years.\n\nKaren Thorp: Q.C. was really beginning to come into her own and be her own person.\n\nKaren Thorp: I'd say she was less insecure about what to wear and what to do and she was able to follow more of her way of doing things.\n\nTracy Smith: So, you could see the self-confidence?\n\nKaren Thorp: I could see the self-confidence, yes.\n\nKaren Thorp: I felt at the time like I really knew the family, but I have to say, with so many things in life, you never really know about peoples' inside lives and what's really going on.\n\nNow, police were left with two missing parents and those disturbing clues in the master bathroom.\n\nTracy Smith: And what were the boys saying?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: The boys had no idea where mom and dad were.\n\nTracy Smith: Anybody have any clue?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: No. At that point, nobody had any clue at all.\n\nBut that wouldn't last long. The first big break came near the Mexican border in San Diego. It was just before dawn the day after when someone there — 100 miles from Newport Beach — called 911 with an emergency. It was Peter Chadwick:\n\n911 OPERATOR: 911 Emergency. This is Crystal… PETER CHADWICK: They took her… they took her 911 OPERATOR: Who took her? PETER CHADWICK: The guy who broke into my house. He — he drove me here. He had a friend ... I think they're going — they might be going to Mexico or somewhere.\n\nA BIZARRE 911 CALL\n\nIn surveillance pictures taken at a gas station near the Mexican border, Peter Chadwick can be seen — he's about to make that 911 call:\n\nPeter Chadwick is seen in surveillance pictures taken at a gas station near the Mexican border. Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nPETER CHADWICK [TO STORE CLERK]: Can you call 911? Somebody killed my wife.\n\nMoments later, Chadwick tells the operator Q.C. had been murdered:\n\nPETER CHADWICK: My wife's dead ... They've gone in a pickup truck. 911 OPERATOR: So, your wife was kidnapped? PETER CHADWICK: She's dead ... 911 OPERATOR: Uh, hold on. Let me get my supervisor on the phone.\n\nTracy Smith: This is the gas station where Chadwick called 911?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Yeah. This is where he chose to kick off our investigation.\n\nTracy Smith: And this was a huge break\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: This was huge.\n\nTracy Smith: Just to get a sense of where we are, how close are we to the border — is that?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters [pointing to city lights in the distance]: It's right there.\n\nTracy Smith: What are we looking at?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: We're looking at Tijuana.\n\nTracy Smith: What did Chadwick tell 911?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Chadwick calls 911 and says he was kidnapped. And he was kidnapped by a guy named Juan who had killed his wife in Newport Beach.\n\n911 OPERATOR: How do you know Juan? PETER CHADWICK: I picked him up to look at some painting work at the house. I brought him to the house.\n\n\n\nTracy Smith: So, Peter and Juan go back to his home … and then what did Peter say happened?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: At some point Peter and Juan separated, Juan continued upstairs, and Peter went down to his office ... Peter said within seconds, he heard his wife Q.C. screaming.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He hears Q.C. scream Peter, Peter... and as he runs upstairs he sees Juan strangling Q.C., who's in the bath, in their master bedroom and he's drowning her.\n\n911 OPERATOR: How do you know she's dead? PETER CHADWICK: She drowned, she drowned. ... Her body was stiff, even!\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: As he goes up and sees this, witnesses this, he's being held at bay by Juan with a 2-inch pocket knife.\n\nChadwick told police he was helpless to save Q.C.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Instead of being able to rescue his wife he's held at bay by Juan and Juan proceeds to finish killing his wife.\n\nThen, Chadwick said Juan ordered him to help get Q.C.'s body out of the tub and wrap it in a blanket.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And Peter says he walks over and grabs a green blanket and wraps her up in it. And that's the blanket they used to take her downstairs.\n\nWith Juan at his side, Chadwick said he was forced to drive all through the night with his wife's body in the back of his SUV.\n\nPETER CHADWICK [TO 911]: I've been driving with them. PETER CHADWICK [TO 911]: I think they might be going to Mexico or somewhere. … I want you to get 'em …\n\nChadwick says that's how they ended up at a border town gas station, where they met up with another man named Chee.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And they took the body out of Chadwick's car, put it in a truck and took it to Mexico.\n\nChadwick says Juan and Chee drove away, leaving him alone with his vehicle in a dreary parking lot. That's when Chadwick made his 911 call:\n\n911 OPERATOR: OK, and where is she now? PETER CHADWICK: They have her body. They said they're gonna cut her up. 911 OPERATOR: What color car did Juan leave in? PETER CHADWICK: Wha — What? 911 OPERATOR: What color car did Juan leave in? PETER CHADWICK: Dark green. Dark green uh, umm, like a — like a pickup van but covered. Um what do you call, uh, umm. And — and a — a Chevy.\n\n\n\nWithin a few minutes, police arrived and took him to the station. Lieutenant Bryan Moore says his detectives found holes in Chadwick's story.\n\nTracy Smith: Any signs of Juan at all?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: No.\n\nPeter Chadwick told 911 that his wife was killed at about 11 a.m. the previous morning, but surveillance footage shows Chadwick's SUV leaving his gated community in Newport Beach at 1:32 p.m. — about 2.5 hours later. Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nChadwick told 911 that Q.C. was killed at about 11 a.m. the previous morning, but surveillance footage shows Chadwick's SUV leaving his gated community in Newport Beach about two-and-a-half hours after that. Police say there's no Juan in the vehicle. And later, Chadwick's at a toll. Again, no sign of Juan.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Everyone we talked to and described this Juan individual, no one had any idea who that was, or could give us any information related to this person.\n\nTracy Smith: What about Chee?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: No. Some of the video surveillance we picked up, in the area where Peter said he met this Chee person, there was no other vehicles involved that we could see.\n\nWhat's more, Chadwick's own body had some incriminating injuries.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He had scratches on his neck and his arms. You know, bite mark on his forearm.\n\nPeter Chadwick's own body had some incriminating injuries. Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nTracy Smith: Did he try to explain that as these came from Juan?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: He explained some sort of a struggle between him and Juan, but there was never any specifics on how he obtained those injuries\n\nAnd then there was this: a packed suitcase in Chadwick's car.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: We had a suitcase with … all male clothing inside that was just kind of thrown in there, as if somebody had kind of packed hastily.\n\nTracy Smith: I'm sorry — there was a bag in the car of men's clothes?\n\nTracy Smith: What kind of kidnapper says, Hey, go ahead and pack yourself an overnight bag?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Which is part of the problem. That's not normally a thing that happens, no.\n\nQ.C.'s friend, Karen Thorp, says nothing Peter said made any sense.\n\nTracy Smith: When you first heard that story, did you buy it?\n\nKaren Thorp: Absolutely, not! I don't even think the 911 operator bought it! If you've heard the tape her reaction is, Um-hmm, really? Um-hmm?\n\n911 OPERATOR: OK, wh — what?— are you on any kind of medication, sir? PETER CHADWICK: …Not — not — not, uh, that heavy one ... 911 OPERATOR: OK, but this happened yesterday at 11. You're now calling us at 5:30 in the morning.\n\nDetectives weren't buying any of it either.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: During the initial contact … Peter was — was kind of all over the map. His story was very disjointed. He'd go through the range of emotions, crying — however, the officer never saw a tear — to moments of anxiety and just complete quiet.\n\nTracy Smith: So, he went from great displays of being distraught to nothing?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: And the most interesting thing was during the entire contact with law enforcement and with our detectives, he never once asked about his kids.\n\nTracy Smith: He never asked about the boys?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: No.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: And we're talking, he hasn't seen them since the morning prior when he dropped them off for school. ... So, it's almost 24 hours.\n\nTracy Smith: What did that say to you?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: To me, it means that he is more concerned with his story, creating an alibi —\n\nTracy Smith: — than he is about his own sons.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: It appeared so, yes.\n\nKaren Thorp: People's first feeling was that there had been a takeover robbery and they had both been kidnapped I don't know if there was speculation in the media about that. … [emotional] But I never for a moment thought that it had happened. I somehow knew he had killed her.\n\nA BIG BREAK\n\nKaren Thorp: I remember calling and I said, He's killed her, hasn't he? And I can't tell you why I knew. My friend said, Are you OK? Are you at work? And I said, I am, but I'm going home now.\n\nOn Oct. 11, 2012 — just six hours after that 911 call — Peter Chadwick was arrested for murder.\n\nPeter Chadwick was arrested for Q.C.'s murder Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He wasn't defensive, angry, sad, emotional in any way as if somebody that was being placed under arrest that was innocent would have acted.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Almost like he wasn't surprised that we were putting the handcuffs on him.\n\nChadwick quickly lawyered up and stopped talking to detectives. The community was shocked.\n\nKaren Thorp: Just, just unthinkable that, that he would do that and that someone would do that, and that she would be gone.\n\nKaren Thorp could only guess what led to her friend's murder.\n\nKaren Thorp: I think, over time, knowing Q.C., it seemed that she wanted to become more independent and she would start doing more things for herself … and I wondered then if maybe some of her reservations and insecurity were because of Peter.\n\nTracy Smith: Why do you think she didn't confide in you?\n\nKaren Thorp: I think she was very proud ... and I think everyone was shocked.\n\nBryan Moore believes Q.C. had uncovered a dark side of her husband.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Probably the most telling things that we discovered was a handwritten piece of paper that had Peter's computer search history on it. Looked like it was written out by Q.C..\n\nTracy Smith: And what did that say?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: How to torture, Chinese sex massage, abortion costs in Orange County.\n\nTracy Smith: These were all in his search history?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Yes.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: So, as we dug into it further. We started to get the real account that there was some turmoil in their marriage. There was some talk of divorce.\n\nTracy Smith: He visited prostitutes?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Based on his search history … we have to assume so.\n\nTracy Smith: This isn't that happy Newport Beach family that it appeared to be from the outside?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Absolutely, not.\n\nIn court, Peter Chadwick pleaded not guilty. His two sons, who had lived at home, were now with their mother's brother more than 50 miles away in the Los Angeles area. Their mother was missing and presumably dead.\n\nTracy Smith: Did the boys have any idea about what happened to their mother? What their dad was doing?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: None whatsoever.\n\nThen, seven days after Peter Chadwick called 911, detectives got another big break. This time, a tip they say they can't discuss, that led them to a location in the mountains, more than 100 miles from Newport Beach.\n\nTracy Smith: This is remote.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: It's extremely remote. … Kind of south San Diego County, in the middle of nowhere.\n\nTracy Smith: Where are we headed?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: So, we're going to crime scene number two.\n\nDetectives found themselves on a barren mountainside in rural San Diego County: Wildcat Canyon. They believe Peter Chadwick came here that night.\n\nTracy Smith: What do you think he's thinking of as he's driving up this road?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: If you kind of put yourself in his position, he's been driving around for hours, over 10 hours with Q.C.'s body in the car. … He needs to find a place to drop the body. He needs to find a place to drop the body where he's not gonna be seen. Where it's dark and it's not gonna be seen anytime soon after he drops it.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: The first place he comes to is this little road.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: We were not sure we were ever gonna find her. …The chances were slim to none.\n\nThat's where they came upon a dumpster.\n\nOn a barren mountainside in rural San Diego County, investigators came upon this dumpster. Among the items they found inside of it: bags of Q.C.'s belongings, $10,000 in cash and her body wrapped in a green blanket Newport Beach Police Dept.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: When we lifted it up it was full.\n\nTracy Smith: So, what did you see?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: We started finding Q.C.'s items. … We found nice bags. … We found a really nice purse. … So, we set those aside. … When we opened up the bag, that's when we found Q.C.'s ID; her permanent residency card; $10,000 cash. … And all of this stuff is the stuff that he described Juan taking with Q.C.'s body into Mexico.\n\nAnd wrapped in a green blanket: Q.C.'s body.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: It was huge break for us. … The dumpster was scheduled to be picked up the Thursday morning, which was the next morning after we believe Peter disposed of Q.C.'s body. … The issue with that was there was some kind of billing dispute.\n\nTracy Smith: So, they were supposed to pick up the dumpster … but they didn't.\n\nOnce detectives finally found Q.C., the medical examiner was able to determine how she died.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: There was a pretty violent struggle which resulted in strangulation and possible drowning.\n\nAs the state built its case against Peter Chadwick, he sat in jail for two months, until December, when bail was set at $1 million. No sweat for the multimillionaire businessman.\n\nKaren Thorp: I heard he got out on bail … and I remember being absolutely infuriated and disgusted. He should not be out on bail.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy says the court really had no choice. Chadwick was entitled to bail.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy | Orange County Senior Deputy D.A.: We had a guy that had — he had no criminal background. He had roots in the community.\n\nChadwick also had that multimillion-dollar home and three sons. And he surrendered his U.S. and U.K. passports.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy: We can keep him on a short leash. We can keep him, you know, engaged in the process. We can keep, you know, we can keep eyes on him.\n\nHeidi: Peter came back and got her van, which was really creepy. … He returned to get her van, because his car was impounded. So he drove off with her van. … And I was just happened to be out on the street, and he gave me a nod and I'm just like, turned my head in disgust.\n\nEven before Chadwick could face trial, Karen Thorp's mind was made up.\n\nKaren Thorp: He was – shameless … Talk about chutzpah. He sent out an email inviting people to a 100-day vigil, candlelight vigil, at the home where he murdered her. … How can you kill your wife … throw her in a dumpster … and hold a candle light vigil at the home where you killed her?\n\nTwo years passed. Chadwick moved into his father's home in Santa Barbara, a swanky town up the coast. All three sons ended up in boarding school.\n\nTracy Smith: How solid did you think your case was as you headed for trial?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Extremely solid. … I mean with all the circumstantial evidence, the body … the injuries … and the lack of plausibility on behalf of Peter's story. … So overall, we thought we had this thing wrapped up.\n\nTracy Smith: So as you're looking down the road, you're thinking Peter Chadwick is gonna end up where?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: In prison.\n\nBut Peter Chadwick had other plans.\n\nDISAPPEARING ACT\n\nPeter Chadwick was awaiting trial and making his court appearances for hearings, doing what he was supposed to do.\n\nTracy Smith: … until he wasn't anymore.\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Yeah … we got word from his attorney … that said … I don't know where he is.\n\nAfter two years out on bail, Peter Chadwick disappeared.\n\nLOCAL NEWS REPORT: Breaking news to tell you about an accused murder on the run from California … This is one of the most wanted suspects in the entire United States.\n\nHeidi: What do you mean he's gone? You know, didn't somebody keep an eye on this guy?\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy: Nobody thought that he would flee from his sons.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy was left holding the bag.\n\nTracy Smith: Why didn't he have an ankle bracelet?\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy: That's actually a great question. Only under certain circumstances is there a monitoring system set up. … Believe it or not, we don't typically do that on bail situations.\n\nKaren Thorp: A million dollars bail really wasn't enough to keep someone as cold hearted and narcissistic as him to stay around.\n\nAt first, investigators heard that Peter Chadwick might be dead.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: Initially, Michael Chadwick started relaying information that he was suicidal.\n\nTracy Smith: So, Michael Chadwick, Peter's dad, said he was gonna kill himself? That Peter was gonna kill himself?\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He alluded to the fact that he was suicidal.\n\nKaren Thorp: I don't know if it was his attorney or his father had said he had been despondent and suicidal. [shakes her head] No.\n\nBy the time investigators realized that he'd flown the coop, Chadwick was long gone. He had a three-week lead on them and he'd been studying up.\n\nThey discovered books in Chadwick's home on how to disappear and how to change identities and leave false trails.\n\nInvestigators learned from a taxi company that someone – who police now believe was Peter Chadwick – took a cab from his dad's house to an airport in Santa Barbara. The cab driver says that the person he picked up that day was a woman. Was Peter Chadwick in disguise?\n\nPeter Chadwick is seen on surveillance video at the Santa Barbara Airport U.S. Marshals\n\nWhen he got to the Santa Barbara Airport, he went inside with his suitcase and then he must have changed clothes, because surveillance cameras have pictures of Chadwick dressed as himself hanging out at the airport.\n\nHours ticked by, but he never got on a plane. Instead, Chadwick went back outside, got into another cab, and drove away. And that's the last anyone here saw of Peter Chadwick.\n\nThe search for Chadwick has now become an international manhunt with the U.S. Marshals leading the way.\n\nPeter Chadwick's on their most wanted list and there's a $100,000 reward.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey leads the team.\n\nMarshal Craig McCluskey: We're gonna catch him. …He's gonna make a mistake. We're gonna choke him off … and grab him.\n\nDisappearing is a tough thing to do, but Evan Ratliff is one of the few who did it successfully and is willing to talk about it.\n\nEvan Ratliff | Author: I disappeared by leaving everything in my life behind, selling my car, ceasing any contact with my family, and adopting a new identity and trying to start a new life.\n\nTracy Smith: How many phones did you go through?\n\nEvan Ratliff: I probably went through seven or eight.\n\nRatliff isn't some kind of sketchy criminal; he's an author. His book, The Mastermind, is about an accused drug and arms dealer who relied on disappearing techniques to cover his tracks.\n\nA few years ago, as a kind of test, Ratliff staged his own disappearance while researching an article for Wired magazine.\n\nEvan Ratliff: I was trying to sort of get inside that experience and understand what it felt like.\n\nEvan Ratliff: The only way to really know was to try and experiment, a short-term experiment … leaving my life behind, adopting a new identity and trying to live within that identity as a new person.\n\nTracy Smith: And then you said to the world come find me.\n\nEvan Ratliff: That was the second part of it.\n\nThe Find Evan Ratliff challenge became a bit of an online phenomenon — especially when the magazine put up a $5,000 reward.\n\nTracy Smith: How many people were looking for you?\n\nEvan Ratliff: Thousands and thousands of people, uh, all over the country. …They were online, you know, on Twitter, in groups, private groups and public groups. They were on Facebook. It was in the media different places.\n\nTracy Smith: Did you feel hunted?\n\nEvan Ratliff: I did.\n\nWithin days, tech wizards and regular folks were able to find out a shocking amount about Ratliff's life.\n\nEvan Ratliff: Every address I'd ever lived at, all my family members publicly exposed, my social security number, my signature, and that's when it really hit me – Oh, these people are, they're taking it very seriously.\n\nRatliff had studied up on tactics and he had a plan.\n\nEvan Ratliff [holding device]: I had a thing like this — basically a GPS device — it actually gives your GPS location.\n\nTracy Smith: So, there are ways like this to throw people off?\n\nEvan Ratliff: Sure … I would leak this and then leave it somewhere. … Or put it in someone's bag so it would keep going without me.\n\nEvan Ratliff: Buying airplane tickets all over the place that I knew people would find. They would discover that I had made those purchases and that would lead them away from where I was actually going, you know, on a bus or on a train.\n\nTracy Smith: And at one point you even hopped on with a rock band on a tour bus?\n\nEvan Ratliff: I did, I did. … They were kind of just out of college. They were touring the southwest and through Texas … I was also paying for gas, so they had no complaints.\n\nTracy Smith: You were connected through email, you were logging into social media. How do you do that and not leave a digital footprint that investigators can see?\n\nEvan Ratliff: There are ways to do it. … Even if someone got through my initial layer of security they would end up in Las Vegas … in fact it was just an empty room with a couple computers in it.\n\nTracy Smith: Then the disguises.\n\nEvan Ratliff: Then the physical disguises. You know, shaved head, beard, goatee work.\n\nJust a few of Evan Ratliff's many disguises Evan Ratliff\n\nEvan Ratliff: Grow a beard, and then dye my hair, dye the beard, shave the beard into various, you know, mustache, goatee. … I shaved the top of my head sort of in the manner of male pattern baldness.\n\nEvan Ratliff: What you're trying to prevent is someone who's seen some image of you very briefly, recognizing you.\n\nTracy Smith: What do you think ultimately was your undoing?\n\nEvan Ratliff: I think it was probably, it always felt like laziness more than anything else.\n\nIt took a group of techies nearly a month to find Ratliff and collect that $5,000 reward. He had carelessly used his new identity to visit a Facebook page about the hunt, accidentally revealing just a little too much information.\n\nEvan Ratliff: It was a matter of taking the identity and tracing it to my actual location … as soon as they saw me, I was sunk.\n\nTracy Smith: So, with all that in mind, how could Peter Chadwick be gone for so long?\n\nEvan Ratliff: Well, it is kind of extraordinary, I have to say, for that period of time.\n\nPeter Chadwick has been missing for more than four years.\n\nEvan Ratliff: I think it gets more and more exhausting over time. I think it's harder and harder to keep up the level of paranoia that's necessary to really maintain all of your, you know, security systems that you've set up for yourself. That's just a very difficult thing to do.\n\nRatliff says it's money that makes the biggest difference and Chadwick had plenty. After he disappeared, the U.S. Marshals discovered surveillance shots of Chadwick taking money from his bank accounts. Little by little, he withdrew $1 million in cash.\n\nTracy Smith: I try to do the math on this. If Peter Chadwick has been gone since 2015, he took about a million dollars with him. … What do you think? Could he burn through close to a million dollars?\n\nEvan Ratliff: I guess it depends on what's his taste for — for living conditions and — and where he is in the world? … He could make it go a long way. I mean you can find very cheap places to live all over the world.\n\nTracy Smith: If he's willing to rough it.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: He just doesn't strike me as the kind of guy that would be roughing it … Peter likes his red wine…he likes nice hotels… he likes room service...\n\nMcCluskey thinks somebody, maybe a tourist, is bound to run into Chadwick.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: I think the-the public is gonna be key in the capture for Peter Chadwick. … I think somebody's gonna encounter him in a restaurant or on a busy street and it's gonna be that tip that comes that's really gonna put us right on his trail.\n\nNOT YOUR AVERAGE FUGITIVE\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: This is definitely one of the toughest cases.\n\nCraig McCluskey is still leading the hunt for Peter Chadwick.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: We didn't expect it to become the monster fugitive manhunt that it has become today.\n\nChadwick has one big advantage over the average fugitive.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: What makes him so difficult to find is the fact that he fled with a decent amount of money.\n\nTracy Smith: So, it was about a million dollars that he had in cash when he left?\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: Approximately a million dollars, yes.\n\nYet, the Marshals have been getting lots of leads.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: Once you find a string, you gotta start pulling on it. And, uh, we found a couple strings.\n\nThey've come from everywhere.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: The countries that we've had active leads in that we've pursued include Japan … they include Canada … Mexico … Belize … Panama … the Ukraine.\n\nTracy Smith: So, you're basically chasing this guy all over the world.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: Yes.\n\nThere have also been misfires. Like one lead from the Canadian Rockies. A man claimed to have spotted Chadwick on a train just last year.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: He fell back in his chair when he saw the photo and said, I just spent four days with this guy on a train.\n\nBut that man – according to authorities – was a known scammer looking to cash in on that $100,000 reward.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: This case isn't a rapid hunt. It — it's more like fishing. You know, you set your bait and you row out to your spot … and you wait and you hope that somebody bites on it.\n\nFor the last four years, Chadwick hasn't taken the bait. Even though he gave up his passports when he was arrested, he's gone international and made himself invisible.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: For the first two to three years, I believed that he went north and in fact we learned that he did. … He intentionally threw us off his trail. He wanted us to believe that he was going north to Canada when, in fact, he doubled back and went down south. We learned that in 2017, he was in a bus accident in Mexico … So, we know, at least as recently as 2017, he was down in the country of Mexico.\n\nAnd the Marshals have been zeroing in on Mexico. They say it's easier for a fugitive to get a phony passport there.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: The last two top 15s on the US Marshals' list were both caught having Mexican passports, so it seems like that's a first stop on the fugitive train.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you think, could Peter Chadwick be a fugitive forever?\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: I don't think so. … Nobody can survive on their own for this long without some type of contact. And I believe that's coming from inside the family somewhere.\n\nInside the family — McCluskey doesn't think it's the Chadwick kids. He doesn't believe Chadwick has even contacted the boys since he vanished.\n\nTracy Smith: What does it say to you about him as a person?\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: That he doesn't care. I mean, he's perfectly comfortable leaving everything behind and he's more about self-preservation than he is about taking care of his kids.\n\nPeter Chadwick's father, Michael, now lives in Pennsylvania. The U.S. Marshals captured surveillance video of a shadowy figure entering his home in 2017. That person remains unidentified.\n\n48 Hours asked Michael Chadwick to talk with us. He declined to comment.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: I didn't think this case was gonna turn into what it did. But I think one reason that it did is not because Peter's smart. It's not because he was savvy. It's not because he outsmarted us, it's because he's getting help. I think once we cut him off from his source of help that he's gonna make a mistake and we're gonna catch him.\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: I think he has to be getting help from somebody.\n\nTracy Smith: The question is who?\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: And that's a big question, because if we identify that, we find Peter.\n\nTracy Smith: Could you narrow it down to one hand?\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: I could.\n\nTracy Smith: Will you?\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: I can't disclose that at this time.\n\nAuthorities say Peter Chadwick has gotten away with murder for more than six years now.\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy: He abandoned his family … he made his attorney look terrible, and … he thumbed his nose at the court and the justice system.\n\nTracy Smith: Is part of this just that rich guys can get away with an awful lot?\n\nProsecutor Matt Murphy: [ Takes a deep breath] You know, it's — it's just — it's frustrating. ... You shouldn't be able to take advantage of the system because you have money. And you know, that's what happened here. Most people can't afford this bail. You shouldn't be able to do this because you got money. … He took full advantage and he used his financial resources to do it.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you feel like he slipped through your fingers?\n\nLt. Bryan Moore: Yeah. I honestly wished, uh, you know, we could have wrapped this case up a lot sooner.\n\nSgt. Ryan Peters: He got the better of us, at this point.\n\nKaren Thorp hopes whoever is helping Peter Chadwick will have a change of heart.\n\nKaren Thorp: Someone needs to come forward. Someone with a conscience. Someone who cares about those kids and who cares about what has happened to this lovely woman. This lovely, devoted mother who has no justice.\n\nKaren Thorp: So selfish, so cold, so— I'm sorry— sociopathic.\n\nTracy Smith: And those poor boys.\n\nKaren Thorp: It makes me incredibly angry to see that he could abandon his children and that he could, well, that he did what he did to her. … Instead of staying around for his children he left to save himself.\n\nTracy Smith: Do you have a sense of how the boys are doing?\n\nKaren Thorp: They're really, really strong, really, really supported by Q.C.'s family. There's so much love around them and so much love for them. They've really - they've continued to flourish in spite of this tragedy.\n\nQ.C. Chadwick\n\nAnd that is a fitting tribute to a dedicated mom whose life was cut so short.\n\nArt Scott | Music teacher: We lost in Q.C. a mother who cared for her children deeply, and who loved life and loved vibrancy, and loved to give her children all that she possibly could.\n\nThe man accused of taking her life is still out there … somewhere.\n\nTracy Smith: If he's watching, what do you want to say to him?\n\nU.S. Marshal Craig McCluskey: Peter, it's a matter of time. We're gonna get you … You know, become a man. Step up, own a little responsibility in your life. And, if you don't, we're gonna get you anyway.\n\nHAVE YOU SEEN PETER CHADWICK?\n\nHave you seen Peter Chadwick?

BILOXI, Miss.- Canadian rocker Bryan Adams is canceling a performance this week in Mississippi, citing the state's new law that allows religious groups and some private businesses to refuse service to gay couples.\n\nAdams said in a statement Sunday night that he was canceling a show Thursday at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum in Biloxi.\n\nThe singer says he can't in good conscience perform in a state where certain people are being denied their civil rights due to their sexual orientation.\n\nThe move comes after Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band canceled a Sunday show in Greensboro, North Carolina, because of that state's new law blocking anti-discrimination rules for the LGBT community.\n\nThe Mississippi law will take effect July 1.\n\nThe Religious Liberty Accommodations Act prohibits the government from taking any discriminatory action against religious organizations that decline to host marriages, employ people or facilitate adoption or foster care based on a religious belief that marriage should be between one man and one woman; sex outside marriage is wrong; or that sexual identity is determined by a person's anatomy at birth.\n\nSimilar protections will cover counselors and at least 13 other categories of wedding-related services, including photographers, disc-jockeys, florists, cake-makers, jewelers and limousine drivers. The bill will allow judges and marriage-license clerks to recuse themselves from same-sex marriages.\n\nIt also will prohibit government penalties against those who set sex-specific standards for dress codes and the use of restrooms.\n\nSupporters say it offers protection for Christians who adhere to traditional views of marriage and gender roles. Critics say it would allow government-sanctioned discrimination against gay people.\n\nSeveral states -- including Minnesota, New York, Washington and Vermont -- have banned non-essential travel for state employees to Mississippi in the wake of the new law's passage.\n\nMike Cashion, director of the Mississippi Hospitality and Restaurant Association, said Thursday that the group will promote the message Everyone's Welcome Here, in response to the law, which he says has created a level of controversy that affects Mississippi's image.
DETROIT -- It's a new home for a very different kind of dog.\n\nCody, a hermaphrodite pit bull-mix that was picked up by the Detroit Dog Rescue last month, has been adopted, reported CBS Detroit.\n\nCody was found to have the organs of both a male and a female dog. Executive director Kristina Rinaldi said they were looking for a very special person to adopt the dog, who was sick with malnutrition and heart-worm when found.\n\nWe wanted him to go to someone who understood him, Rinaldi said.\n\nOn Monday, Cody found that home with gay rights attorney Dana Nessel, her wife Alanna and their two twin sons.\n\nNessel represented April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse who challenged Michigan's same-sex marriage prohibition and won a Supreme Court appeal which resulted in marriage equality throughout the nation.\n\nWe weren't interested in his sex organs or whether he was a male or female, Nessel said. We just wanted a dog that needed a home and the boys just loved this dog.\n\nNessel says she's pushing to rename Cody after the David Bowie gender-bending alter ego, Ziggy Stardust.
Carol Channing, the iconic actress, singer and comedian who starred in the Broadway hit Hello, Dolly, has died. Her publicist, B. Harlan Boll, confirmed to CBS News that Channing died at 12:31 a.m. in Rancho Mirage, California, of natural causes. Channing was 97.\n\nChanning had suffered strokes over the past year, Boll said. No events have been scheduled, as was her wish.\n\nBesides Hello, Dolly, Channing starred in other Broadway shows, but none with equal magnetism. She often appeared on television and in nightclubs, for a time partnering with George Burns in Las Vegas and a national tour.\n\nHer outsized personality seemed too much for the screen, and she made only a few movies, notably The First Traveling Saleslady with Ginger Rogers and Thoroughly Modern Millie with Julie Andrews.\n\nOver the years, Channing continued as Dolly in national tours, the last in 1996, when she was in her 70s. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called her the ninth wonder of the world.\n\nChanning was not the immediate choice to play Dolly, a matchmaker who receives her toughest challenge yet when a rich grump seeks a suitable wife. The show, which features a rousing score by Jerry Herman that's bursting with joy and tunes like Put On Your Sunday Clothes, ''Before the Parade Passes By and It Only Takes a Moment, is a musical version of Thornton Wilder's play The Matchmaker.\n\nTheater producer David Merrick told her: I don't want that silly grin with all those teeth that go back to your ears. Even though director Gower Champion had worked on her first Broadway hit, Lend an Ear, he had doubts about Channing's casting.\n\nShe wowed them in an audition and was hired on the spot. At opening night on Jan. 16, 1964, when Channing appeared at the top of the stairs in a red gown with feathers in her hair and walked down the red carpet to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant, the casehardened New York audience went crazy. The critics followed suit. Hello, Dolly collected 10 Tony Awards, including one for Channing as best actress in a musical.\n\nThe show opened on Broadway almost exactly 55 years ago to this day, on Jan. 16, 1964.\n\nShe was born Jan. 31, 1921, in Seattle, where her father, George Channing, was a newspaper editor. When his only child was 3 months old, he moved to San Francisco and worked as a writer for the Christian Science Monitor and as a lecturer. He later became editor-in-chief of Christian Science publications.\n\nSinger and actress Carol Channing smiles as she is introduced to the Governor and Council meeting in Concord, N.H., on Wed., June 27, 2007. Channing sang a song for Gov. John Lynch. AP\n\nAt the age of 7, Channing decided she wanted to become an entertainer. She credited her father with encouraging her: He told me you can dedicate your life at 7 or 97. And the people who do that are happier people.\n\nWhile majoring in drama and dance at Bennington College in Vermont, she was sent off to get experience in her chosen field. She found a job in a New York revue. The show lasted only two weeks, but a New Yorker magazine critic commented, You will hear more about a satiric chanteuse named Carol Channing. She said later: That was it. I said goodbye to trigonometry, zoology and English literature.\n\nFor several years she worked as an understudy, bit player and nightclub impressionist, taking jobs as a model, receptionist and sales clerk during lean times. Landing in Los Angeles, she auditioned for Marge Champion, wife and dance partner of Gower Champion who was putting together a revue, Lend an Ear. Marge Champion recalled: She certainly was awkward and odd-looking, but her warmth and wholesomeness came through.\n\nChanning was the hit of Lend an Ear in a small Hollywood theater, and she captivated audiences and critics when the show moved to New York. As the innocent gold digger in the musical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, her stardom was assured. One reviewer reported she hurls across the footlights in broad strokes of pantomime and bold, certain, exquisitely comical gestures. The show's hit song, Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend, became her signature number.\n\nOver and over again she returned to the surefire Hello, Dolly, which earned her $5 million on one tour. She considered Dolly Levi a role as deep as Lady Macbeth, but added that the essence of her character was her unquenchable thirst for life. That description fit Carol Channing, who attributed her sunny optimism to her lifelong faith in Christian Science.\n\nOthers who have played the role include Pearl Bailey, Phillis Diller, Betty Grable, Ethel Merman, Martha Raye, Ginger Rogers and Barbra Streisand, who played Dolly in a 1969 film version directed by Gene Kelly. Bette Midler won a Tony Award in the role in 2017.\n\nChanning had two early marriages that ended in divorce — to novelist Theodore Naidish and pro footballer Alexander Carson, father of her only child, Channing. Her son became a successful political cartoonist.\n\nIn 1956 she married a television producer, Charles Lowe, who seemed like the perfect mate for a major star. He adopted Channing's son and supervised every aspect of her business affairs and appearances. He reportedly viewed every one of her performances from out front, leading the applause.\n\nAfter 41 years of marriage, she sued for divorce in 1998, alleging that he misappropriated her funds and humiliated her in public. She remarked that they only had sex twice in four decades.\n\nThe only thing about control freak victims is that they don't know who they are, she told The Washington Post. It's taken me 77 years to figure that out. I was miserable. I was unhappy. And I didn't realize it wasn't my fault. But I'm going to survive. I'm going to live. I'm free.\n\nLowe died after a stroke in 1999. Channing moved to Rancho Mirage near Palm Springs, California, in 2000 to write her memoirs. She called the book Just Lucky, I Guess.\n\nIn this Oct. 18, 2005, file photo, Broadway legend Carol Channing introduces her husband, businessman Harry Kullijian, during a performance of her one-woman show in New York. AP\n\nChanning remarried in 2003 to Harry Kullijian, her childhood sweetheart from 70 years before. He died in 2011.\n\nIn her book, Channing recounted an early story from her childhood that showed a budding audience-pleasing performer. She wrote that she came home from kindergarten and noted that all the little girls hit the little boys.\n\nHer parents asked: Do you?\n\nShe responded: Oh no, I pet them.
The last several months have been a whirlwind for Justin Verlander. Last summer, the 35-year-old star pitcher was traded to the Houston Astros after 13 seasons with the Detroit Tigers. The Astros went on to win the World Series and just three days later, Verlander and his fiancée, supermodel Kate Upton, got married in Italy.\n\nI like to joke that my friends tell me 'the best week of your life already happened. It's just down hill from here,' which is probably true. I don't know if it gets much better than that, Verlander told CBS News.\n\n❤️ A post shared by Kate Upton (@kateupton) on Mar 18, 2018 at 10:36am PDT\n\nBut he will try for a repeat of last season's glory on the baseball field. It starts March 29 on Opening Day when Verlander will start for the Astros against the Texas Rangers.\n\nOutside of baseball, he has also partnered with Flonase on a campaign where he discusses his long-time battle with seasonal allergies, his relationship with his father and the impact it's had on his career through a series of short videos.\n\nVerlander recently talked with CBS News about the health campaign, as well as balancing his hectic baseball schedule with his new marriage, and what he thinks the Astros' prospects are for this season.\n\nQ: You've had quite a year. What have the past few months been like for you? How has your life changed?\n\nA: It's been pretty crazy, honestly. I guess I wouldn't say it's changed dramatically, and I think that's a good thing, especially once Kate and I got married. I married my best friend so honestly it's just been fun. Winning the World Series, you get a sense of fulfillment, but it was such a whirlwind for me after the season. That first month, to get married, then the honeymoon, and by the time I got back and settled, I was already focusing on my workouts and getting back into the swing of things for the next season. It's such a crazy experience. So, I wouldn't say my life is any different except when I'm reminded that we won the World Series and got married. Then it's like, oh yeah, that really did happen! That wasn't a dream.\n\nQ: Your World Series win came right after Hurricane Harvey. What was that like and what do you think it meant for the people of Houston?\n\nA: Honestly it was incredible. I think there are not many opportunities where the city can bond with a sports team through a tragedy like that and it gives the city hope. It gives the city something fun to root for when otherwise they probably don't have much else going on that's happy. I saw videos on social media of families whose homes were devastated but they had a makeshift TV box and they were watching the World Series and cheering and having fun. That gives you goose bumps. The Houston Strong sentiment carried us all the way through. You never want to have a disaster like that, but that became a motivation for us in the clubhouse. We wanted to give a World Series win to a city that so desperately needed something to cheer for.\n\nQ: And what was it like jetting from that World Series win straight to Italy for your wedding?\n\nA: It was a crazy whirlwind. Definitely a hangover was involved. It was an interesting experience. We partied that night all night and then first thing in the morning had to hop on a plane and go straight to our wedding when all of our guests had already been there for a day and a half. It was two amazing once-in-a-lifetime experiences kind of tied into one in the same couple of days. That just doesn't happen.\n\n💃🏼🕺🏻 A post shared by Kate Upton (@kateupton) on Mar 20, 2018 at 11:03am PDT\n\nQ: Is travel during baseball season hard on your relationship? How do you and Kate make that work?\n\nA: We try to be together as much as possible. We both have extremely busy schedules but we've come up with a way that we can see each other and maximize our down time. During baseball season whenever she has downtime she'll come to whatever city I'm in, and during the off season I'm wherever she's at, so I'm in L.A. or New York a lot in the off season and she's in Houston or on the road during the season. We try not to go ever more than two weeks without seeing each other.\n\nQ: Tell me a little about your relationship with your father and what it was like filming these short documentaries with him for Flonase?\n\nA: The opportunity to do a documentary with someone who's had a huge impact on my life and career like my dad was a pretty great experience. It was really awesome to be able to sit down and just talk about my family and upbringing through baseball. Old stories that we haven't really talked about in a long time really brought a smile to my face, to hear them again and relive them through his eyes and remember where we started in these little back fields playing baseball with me, my dad, and my mom. Where it started to where it is now was a pretty amazing journey and I've shared that with my family this whole way and to be able to relive some of those moments was really special.\n\nQ: How did you get involved with this campaign and how long have you been suffering from allergies?\n\nA: I've had allergies for as long as I can remember. The first time I had them severely was when I went to college and I had such bad drainage I lost my voice completely for a week. From then till now I always searched for the best allergy remedy and a few years ago when I got Flonase and started getting on a regular routine with it, it really helped resolve most of my issues. It was by far the best allergy remedy that I had tried so when the opportunity to partner with them came along I thought it was perfect.\n\nQ: How does having allergies impact your game?\n\nA: The spring is great. It's the start of baseball season. It's the start of warm weather, but if you suffer from allergies it can be a miserable time. I know that first hand. I've been on the pitcher's mound before and I've had congestion or watery eyes and I think you can understand how that would severely impact my ability to perform.\n\nQ: Do you get a sense of how many fellow ballplayers suffer from allergies on the field, especially during spring?\n\nA: I would say allergies among baseball players are very common. A lot of people suffer from allergies, whether it's mild or major, and I definitely see a lot of guys around the locker room who struggle with it. We're 25 guys in there and somebody's always like 'man, my allergies are killing me.'\n\nJustin Verlander Ben Rosenzweig\n\nQ: Do you have any other tips for allergy sufferers?\n\nA: I think what a lot of people can relate to is travel and how your allergies can really flare up when you're traveling. You get on an airplane with congestion or a runny nose, and it always seems to get worse. So, I feel people's pain and I've dealt with it and being prepared with my medication and being able to treat those symptoms has helped me tremendously.\n\nQ: What are you most looking forward to for this upcoming season and what's the team's mindset right now?\n\nA: I'm most looking forward to getting my bearings in Houston since I wasn't there very long last year. Being in another city, I love to eat. My wife and I are both foodies. We like experiencing new foods and I've heard there are a lot of great places to eat in Houston so I'm excited to find some of them.\n\nAs for the team, if I had stepped into this locker room for the first time this spring training, I would have never known that they won a World Series. Everybody seems hungry and excited about the start of a new season. Nobody seems complacent. The whole team is ready to go and I think that's a special atmosphere.\n\nQ: What do you think the Astros' prospects are this year for another World Series win?\n\nA: I think they're pretty good. We have the best team in baseball in my opinion and I know enough to know that anything can happen in 162 games. We need to stay focused. That's why I like this team so much because there's no complacency. Everybody's focused on being better and once you get to the playoffs then all bets are off and may the best team win.
Not tonight seems to be an increasingly familiar refrain in America's bedrooms, according to a new study that found people are having less sex than they previously did.\n\nResearchers surveyed more than 26,000 Americans, and found that adults had sex about nine fewer times a year in 2010-2014 than in 1995-1999.\n\nFor married couples, the survey had even more potentially discouraging news — people who were married or lived together had sex 16 fewer times a year in 2010-2014 than in 2000-2004.\n\nThese data show a major reversal from previous decades in terms of marriage and sex, said study author Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University.\n\nIn the 1990s, married people had sex more times per year than never-married people, but by the mid-2000s that reversed, with the never-married having more sex, she said in a university news release.\n\nAnd here's another twist: younger Americans are having less sex than their parents or grandparents did when they were younger.\n\nDespite their reputation for hooking up, millennials and the generation after them [known as iGen or Generation Z] are actually having sex less often than their parents and grandparents did when they were young, Twenge said. That's partially because fewer iGen'ers and millennials have steady partners.\n\nThe researchers also found that age is a major factor. People in their 20s have sex more than 80 times a year. By age 45, that falls to 60 times a year. And, at 65, that number is just 20 times a year. Each year after the peak of sexual frequency at 25, sexual activity decreases about 3 percent.\n\nOlder and married people are having sex less often — especially after 2000, Twenge said. In a previous paper, we found that the happiness of adults over age 30 declined between 2000 and 2014. With less sex and less happiness, it's no wonder that American adults seem deeply dissatisfied these days.\n\nPeople might be quick to blame increased working hours. Surprisingly, the study found that people who worked more hours actually had sex more often.\n\nThe findings were published March 7 in the Archives of Sexual Behavior.
Jessica Simpson is a pop star and fashion designer who knows a thing or two about popular taste. Tracy Smith reports. (An earlier version of this story was originally broadcast on May 21, 2017.):\n\nIf all you know about Jessica Simpson is that she's a singer, you might be surprised we're talking with her about design. That's OK; she's used to it.\n\nAnd she's used to people being pleasantly surprised by her fashions: People are shocked that they like my brand. Maybe 'cause it's not that expensive? Or maybe because I was a cheesy pop star back in the day? I have no idea. But you're gonna like my shoes, damn it!\n\nJessica Simpson. CBS News\n\nAnd people may be even more shocked to hear this: the Jessica Simpson Collection, which includes products ranging from clothes to accessories to home, is a billion-dollar-a-year business.\n\nHow's that for a cheesy pop star?\n\nWhen asked how much of her goes into her collection, Simpson said, My name's on it; I would never let my name be on anything that I wouldn't approve of somebody wearing.\n\nThirty-seven-year-old Simpson and her mom, Tina, are involved in every step of the design process. I would never trust anybody but my mother to help with this collection, said Jessica.\n\nTina said that she and her daughter would be in a meeting and would say the exact same thing. We'll look at a piece and we'll feel the same way about it. Then there'll be times sometimes when she feels one way, obviously, and I feel another. But I always defer to her because she's the boss.\n\nOh, yeah. Right! Jessica laughed.\n\nMost of the time, Tina added.\n\nSome designs come straight from Jessica's own closet. A romper is based on an outfit she wore to the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. It's timeless to me. Everybody needs a romper, she said. And to make it black-and-white and sexy is the best way to go.\n\nAnd you can look like Jessica Simpson at the VMAs, said Smith.\n\nI mean, I wish I could look like Jessica Simpson in 2005!\n\nThis was Jessica Simpson in 2005 -- strutting around in Daisy Duke shorts and cowboy boots, and not much else:\n\nShe was more famous than she'd ever dreamed -- and a long way from where she started.\n\nA preacher's daughter from Texas who began singing in church, Simpson's progress up the pop charts was slow but steady, until 2003, when her dad had an idea for a reality show.\n\nNewlyweds: Nick and Jessica chronicled the daily lives of Simpson and her then-husband, fellow singer Nick Lachey … warts and all. I think letting me be myself is probably the wisest decision, even though I cringe at it sometimes, she laughed.\n\nOne classic moment: mistaking Chicken of the Sea tuna for actual chicken.\n\nThat was true! she laughed. I just was really confused 'cause I didn't like fish, but I liked this, you know? I liked the Chicken of the Sea. By the Sea? I should know it by now!\n\nJessica realized early on that fans tuned in to see what she would say -- and what she was wearing. So she started a fashion line, just shoes first. And while the TV show -- and her marriage to Nick -- didn't last, the Jessica Simpson Collection has endured for more than a decade.\n\nThe reason, Simpson says, is relatability. I'm just like everybody else. I have gone through almost just as much, if not more, very publicly.\n\nThe tabloids have been merciless, like when her parents split up, or when she was pregnant with her first child and put on a few pounds. It's like, 'I'm pregnant! How could I be fat-shamed?' she laughed. OK, that makes sense. It's not fair. I deserve a f****** donut!\n\nOf her own fashions, she says it's very important to her that they fit all sizes. It's very important for me to let every woman feel included, she said. If I make a shirt, I'm going to make sure that every size is available. Because I have been every size, trust me!\n\nSimpson's been busy with her brand, and raising two kids with husband Eric Johnson, so it's been a decade since she had a new song. But she says the success of the collection has allowed her to start making music again.\n\nI have no record deals; I am my own record deal, which is so empowering to say, she said. Nobody has to tell me what to look like, nobody has to tell me what music sounds good.\n\nLater this year, she'll release both the album, and a new, slightly pricier clothing line. If they earn her more money, or more respect, that's fine. But Jessica Simpson's goal is much simpler.\n\nSmith asked, When people hear the name Jessica Simpson today, what do you want them to think?\n\nJust that I'm your friend, she replied.\n\nSo not 'Jessica Simpson, pop star'? Not 'Jessica Simpson, business mogul'?\n\nI don't even like 'Jessica Simpson, pop star,' she laughed. So weird. 'Jessica Simpson, friend' works for me! I like that.\n\n\n\nFor more info:
If you are wondering why Facebook (FB) seems to be taking baby steps to address the biggest scandal in its history, take a look at its business model. Stronger rules about user data might hurt Facebook's core business of using what it knows about you to sell ads that target your interests.\n\nFacebook is proposing only narrow countermeasures that address the specifics of the furor over Cambridge Analytica. That's the data mining firm that worked for Donald Trump's campaign, and now stands accused of lifting data from some 50 million Facebook users for the purpose of influencing voters.\n\nThose measures, announced Wednesday by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, mostly involve new limits on what Facebook apps can do with the user data they collect. One such errant app was central to the Cambridge Analytica debacle.\n\nBut those steps don't get at what many outsiders see as bigger problems at Facebook: its rampant data collection from users, its embrace of political ads that target individuals and small demographic groups with precision, and its apparent inability to end malicious use of its service by governments, shady corporations and criminal elements.\n\nAdvertisers and third-party apps have flocked to Facebook because of its vast user data, providing the social network with a profit of almost $16 billion last year.\n\nThey're being very deft and creating the illusion of trust, said Scott Galloway, a New York University professor of marketing. But by focusing on the mechanics of how apps work on its service, he said, Facebook is failing to take meaningful action to ensure it's not weaponized by scammers, manipulators and other nefarious types.\n\nFacebook isn't alone in tracking consumer activity and selling that data to advertisers. Search giant Google tracks consumers across its brands, including everything from search activity to emails its users send and receive. However, Facebook's reach is considered much broader because its users provide data on their likes as well as their networks of friends.\n\nUltimately, Facebook is a data-collection company and without user data, it would wither and die. But how much data it sucks in, and what it does with it, is a question of major public importance — one that touches on the health of democracy itself, privacy advocates say.\n\nIt's just not a question that Facebook seems to want to address.\n\nFacebook made $40 billion in advertising revenue last year, and that's expected to rise 22 percent this year to $49 billion, according to research firm eMarketer. Wall Street analysts who follow Facebook don't seem worried yet, despite the sharp drop in the company's stock this week. That's because analysts don't expect the company to have to change the way it does business.\n\nFacebook can, for instance, single out users who live in Kansas and have listed Bernie Sanders and same-sex marriage as their interests — which is exactly what some Russian-linked ads did as part of a propaganda campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.\n\nApps — everything from dumb personality quizzes to games (remember FarmVille?) — have been able to harvest user information since 2007, when Facebook opened its service to outside developers. Facebook has since restricted what types of data apps could access, notably in 2014, but as the Cambridge Analytica debacle shows, loopholes remained.\n\nIn the wake of the Cambridge Analytica outcry, Facebook is once again cracking down — but solely on apps. Its new restrictions limit what data apps can access and will cut them off from your information if you don't use them for three months. Facebook will also conduct its own audits of apps that appear to suck in large quantities of data, although it has said nothing about allowing independent audits, leaving users no alternative but to trust that Facebook itself has their interests at heart.\n\nIt's also unclear how much control Facebook has over user data once a company like Cambridge Analytica acquires it.\n\nOne better solution, says Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center: Make apps alert users whenever data transfers are taking place. That would let people decide whether or not to keep them.\n\nZuckerberg apologized for the debacle during a CNN interview Wednesday, but stopped short of endorsing broad privacy legislation and instead said only that he would support the right kind of rules. For instance, he said, it might be OK to require online political ads to disclose who paid for them — but then talked up Facebook's own voluntary efforts instead of endorsing an existing bill that would do just that.\n\nJeffrey Chester, executive director for the consumer-privacy group Center for Digital Democracy, said Facebook is blaming app developers and outside firms like Cambridge Analytica instead of saying, 'we need to really look at cleaning house.'\n\nMany users have had an uneasy relationship with the company, largely due to its series of privacy scandals over the years that seem to be growing more serious. Back in 2007, for example, Facebook launched a service called Beacon, which tracked what users did on other websites and published it on people's news feeds, often without the users' knowledge. Facebook was sued over Beacon and shut it down in 2009.\n\nThe current scandal has fueled a nascent #deletefacebook movement. While there's no sign of a Facebook exodus so far, the possibility presents yet another threat to the company.\n\nUntil this debacle, I had no idea, said Pat Hager of Bismarck, North Dakota, who is considering deactivating Facebook. I wouldn't have a problem with them putting ads on the side or in the posts like they do, but the data sharing that was going on behind our backs feels sneaky and devious.
Jason Sudeikis finally answered the question that has been on everyone's mind, but his reply was definitely not one we ever saw coming.\n\nThe former Saturday Night Live star was recently a guest on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, and things took a hilarious turn when a fan called into the show and asked him when he plans to marry his fiancée, Olivia Wilde.\n\nI know this isn't my mom because my mom's in the audience, Sudeikis, 40, joked.\n\nCohen chimed in and noted that everyone is very concerned about this, seeing as the two have been engaged since January 2013. Sudeikis started dating the 32-year-old Vinyl actress in December 2011, and the couple welcomed their first child together, a son named Otis, in April 2014.\n\nThey shouldn't be. I feel like we are [good] in many, many ways, he revealed. I mean, I believe we won't get married until weed is legal in every state, gosh darn it!\n\nBack in February, Wilde also weighed in on why she's in no rush to say I do.\n\nWe are seriously connected, she told NET-A-PORTER.com's The EDIT. Before you have a child, marriage is the ultimate commitment and promise to one another, and then once you have a child, it's like, 'Oh, we're committed and promised already.'

Reba McEntire got real in an interview when she talked about her divorce from ex-husband Narvel Blackstock.\n\nThe 60-year-old country superstar told CMT's Cody Allen she didn't want to break up with her ex after 26 years with him. The two finalized their divorce in October.\n\nThe divorce was not my idea. I didn't want it in any shape, form or fashion, McEntire admitted. So, it was really hard to make the adjustment when someone's not happy. I just want everybody to be happy in their lives, because our lives are too short to be miserable.\n\nThe singer said she turned to God when things went south.\n\nI prayed every day to help me have the strength to move one foot in front of the other, and continue on with what I'm supposed to be doing ... and then with my team ... and my friends, my family, my girlfriends, said McEntire.\n\nYou know, you just got to have a great team of people around you that you love, and they love you, and I'm very blessed to have those people, she added. I thank God for it all.\n\nApparently, McEntire's daughter-in-law, Kelly Clarkson, who is married to Brandon Blackstock, tried to help McEntire save the marriage last August and urged them to stay together though the two had been living apart for two years, reports ET.
BANDA ACEH, Indonesia -- Indonesia's deeply conservative Aceh province on Friday caned several unmarried couples for showing affection in public and two women for prostitution before an enthusiastic audience of hundreds. The canings were possibly the last to be done before large crowds in Aceh after the province's governor announced earlier this month that the punishments would be moved indoors.\n\nThe caning last year of two men for gay sex before a baying mob drew international attention to Aceh's increasingly harsh implementation of Shariah law and a wave of condemnation.\n\nThe women accused of prostitution were caned 11 times each. One of the women held up her hand after the fifth lash, signaling the pain was too intense. She was given a drink and the strokes resumed despite her discomfort.\n\nThe crowd, which included tourists from Malaysia, cheered at each blow and many people held smartphones aloft to record the punishment.\n\nThe six young people accused of flirtatious behavior received between 11 and 22 strokes. Shariah police wanted to convict them of zina, unlawful sexual intercourse that includes sex outside marriage and adultery. That would have resulted in a greater number of lashes, but police lacked enough witnesses.\n\nSome residents of Aceh, the only province in Muslim-majority Indonesia to impose Shariah law, are opposed to having the canings performed inside prisons. About a thousand people protested outside the Banda Aceh mayor's office on Thursday. They say hiding the canings will reduce the deterrent effect.\n\nAn Indonesian woman is publicly caned for prostitution in Banda Aceh, Aceh province, Indonesia, April 20, 2018. REUTERS\n\nHistorically, Aceh, located at the tip of the island of Sumatra, was the first region in the Indonesian archipelago to adopt Islam after contacts with Arab traders from as early as the 8th century. Its implementation of Shariah law was a concession made by the central government in 2001 as part of efforts to end a decades-long war for independence.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has dismissed the change to indoor whipping as cosmetic and called for Aceh to abolish caning and the laws that allow it. It says caning remains a form of torture whether it is done in public or not.
Olivia Munn is denying rumors that she's dating Chris Pratt -- to Pratt's ex-wife Anna Faris, and to everyone else. Munn shut down what she called the tabloid stories on Twitter and included a screenshot of a text conversation she had with Faris.\n\nMunn posted screenshots of a list she wrote on Instagram stories, in which she said: 1. Not every woman is scorned and upset after a breakup.\n\n2. Not every woman is 'furious' at another woman for dating her ex.\n\n3. Even if I was dating @prattprattpratt, some tabloids got me and @annakfaris all wrong.\n\n4. Women respect and love each other a lot more than some people like to think.\n\n5. Chris and I would have a horrible celebrity name: Crolivia, Prunn, Chrisivia, Olipratt.\n\nShe showed a text she sent to Faris that said, I would never respond to random tabloid stories, but since we know each other I wanted to reach out to you personally to tell you the story about me and Chris dating has 0% truth.\n\nThe X-Men star continued, I'm sure you already know it's not true, or maybe didn't care either way, but I just wanted to reach out personally to tell you it's not true.\n\nThis town is so f***ing crazy, Faris texted back, saying, you are so sweet to text.\n\nBut Faris also added, Having said that if you were my new sister in law I would be thrilled! Pratt and Faris announced their separation in August after eight years of marriage. The two filed for joint custody of their son.
LOS ANGELES -- As a Miami Dolphins cheerleader, Kristan Ware was a fan favorite. But she claims the league and the team discriminated against her because she was a Christian.\n\nI got told things like, 'You can't mention God,' Ware said. I felt like I was walking on eggshells. But yet a football player can publicly announce whatever he believes in whether it's kneeling for political indifference or kneeling because he does have a relation with God and he wants to pray before a game, he has a right to do that.\n\nKristan Ware CBS News\n\nAccording to a complaint filed with the Florida Commission on Human Relations, Ware says she was blatantly discriminated against based on her religion and gender and there was pervasive and severe abuse and harassment by the team director.\n\nMy virginity got brought up and I said, 'You know I am waiting for marriage,' and they said, 'Well, as far as we're concerned, you've taken something that was once upon a time pure and beautiful and you've made it dirty,' Ware said.\n\nShe is one of many NFL cheerleaders who are publicly complaining about double standards tied to their weight, their wardrobe and their conduct.\n\nIf you are in a restaurant you have to leave if a football player comes in, Ware said. If you were going to Walmart you had to be presentable just in case someone recognized you and wanted a selfie.\n\nBailey Davis, a former New Orleans Saints cheerleader filed a complaint after she was fired for a social media post. Ware says her complaints to higher ups weren't taken seriously.\n\nI had to make the choice, you know, do I lay down the uniform even though it is something that I love to stand up for my faith or do I stay on the team and be silenced? Ware said.\n\nWare quit before finishing her third year with the team. The Dolphins say after human resources was made aware of one of the incidents in the complaint, a supervisor was reprimanded and apologized to the cheerleading team. The NFL says everyone including cheerleaders, has the right to work in a positive and respectful environment free from harassment. The state now has six months to investigate the complaint.
When Brad Pitt accepted an award at the National Board of Review gala earlier this week, he revealed a personal side of himself few get to see. The actor hugged Bradley Cooper, who presented him with the award, then danced — literally — over the podium and told the audience Cooper helped him get sober.\n\nBradley just put his daughter to bed and then rushed over to do this, he's a sweetheart, Pitt said as he accepted the Best Supporting Actor award for his role in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nI got sober because of this guy and every day has been happier since, he continued, the audience erupting in applause.\n\nBrad Pitt accepts the Best Supporting Actor Award for ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD from Bradley Cooper at #NationalBoardOfReview #NBR pic.twitter.com/HS6mUVOWSD — Matt Neglia (@NextBestPicture) January 9, 2020\n\nThe 56-year-old actor's acceptance speech then took a lighthearted turn. It's nice to leave this [gala] carrying something other than George Clooney, he joked.\n\nI know very little about the National Board of Review, he quipped. The organization, founded in 1909, reviews films during what's known as awards season and then choses the top films of the year, handing out prizes during their annual gala.\n\nI started to Google you and look you up and I thought 'f*** it, I like films, too. That's good enough for me,' Pitt continued to joke. He then delved into his love of films since he was a child, giving the public a glimpse into the real man often at the center of tabloid headlines.\n\nBrad Pitt doesn't often divulge details about his personal life – but he did recently reveal that his friend, Bradley Cooper, helped him get sober. Here, they embrace on stage at the National Board of Review annual awards gala. Getty Images\n\nPitt found himself the subject of incessant Hollywood gossip after his marriage and divorce with Jennifer Aniston — and then marriage and divorce with Angelina Jolie. The Jolie-Pitts often kept a low profile during their marriage, and the actor continued to do so after Jolie filed for divorce, making his first public appearance months later.\n\nIn May 2017, Pitt shared with GQ magazine that he had quit drinking alcohol. Now, he's revealing a bit more about his path toward sobriety — and the pal who helped him get there.\n\nCooper, who has been alcohol free since 2004, told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012 that it was incidents of self-harm that made him want to stop drinking. I was at a party, and deliberately bashed my head on the concrete floor, he said in the interview, according to Entertainment Tonight. And then I did it again. I spent the night at St. Vincent's Hospital with a sock of ice, waiting for them to stitch me up.\n\nI don't drink or do drugs anymore, he said. I realized I wasn't going to live up to my potential, and that scared the hell out of me. I thought, 'Wow, I'm actually gonna ruin my life. I'm really gonna ruin it.'
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church, the biggest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States, announced Thursday it is pulling as many as 185,000 older youths from the organization as part of an effort to start its own scouting-like program.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said the move wasn't triggered by the Boy Scouts' decision in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders, since Mormon-sponsored troops have remained free to exclude such adults on religious grounds.\n\nBut at least one leading Mormon scholar said that the Boy Scouts and the church have been diverging on values in recent years and that the policy on gays was probably a contributing factor in the split.\n\nCBS affiliate KUTV in Salt Lake City, Utah, reports the LDS Church said it doesn't believe young men between 14 and 18 years old are not being served well by the Varsity or Venturing programs.\n\nThe church said the decision will affect 185,000 teens; the Boy Scouts put the number at 130,000.\n\nThe loss is only a fraction of the 2.3 million youths in the Boy Scouts of America, but the organization has been grappling with declining membership for years and has enjoyed an unusually close bond with the Mormon church for more than a century because of their shared values. Joining the Boy Scouts is practically automatic among Mormon boys.\n\nBoy Scouts of America spokeswoman Effie Delimarkos said the organization is saddened by the decision but understands the church's desire to customize a program.\n\nAbout 280,000 Mormon boys ages 8 to 13 will remain in the Scouts while the church develops its program, the Mormons said. The Boy Scouts estimated their number at 330,000.\n\nKUTV reports the church will continue through 2018 to make the same payment to the Boy Scouts of America for registration of its young men.\n\nLike other conservative faiths, the Mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. The church initially said it was deeply troubled by the Boy Scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nIn Thursday's announcement, the church said that it learned recently that the Boy Scouts are considering admitting girls, but that its decision was made independently of that.\n\nMatthew Bowman, a Mormon scholar and history professor at Henderson State University, said the schism reflects the two organizations' diverging values, with gays and girls among the issues on which they are moving apart.\n\nThe church is wedded very much to traditional gender roles and they see the Boy Scouts of America increasingly move away from that, Bowman said. That means that they have come to see it as less of a hospitable place.\n\nThursday's announcement represents a first step toward something that has been in the works for years: a Mormon-run scouting-type program that could be used in congregations around the world. The church has 15.8 million members, nearly 6 in 10 of them outside the U.S. and Canada. Scouting is available only in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe long game here is the church looking forward to a time when Americans are even more of a minority in the church than they are now, Bowman said.\n\nMormon teenagers who want to continue working toward the Eagle Scout rank will be able to do that on their own while also participating in the new program, said church spokesman Eric Hawkins.\n\nThe Boy Scout movement has been entrenched in Mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nIn 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the faith's alliance with the Boy Scouts.\n\nA Boy Scout training complex in West Virginia is named after Mormon church President Thomas S. Monson, a longtime member of the Boy Scouts' executive board and a major supporter. Charles Dahlquist II, a Mormon, holds the top volunteer position with the Boy Scouts.\n\nBecoming an Eagle Scout is an especially proud badge of honor within Mormon culture. Many Utah lawmakers list it on their resumes. Social media was buzzing with jokes Thursday about Mormon women adjusting their hopes of finding a husband who was an Eagle Scout.
London — Prince Harry on Monday accepted an apology and damages from the publisher of British tabloid The Mail on Sunday and its online version, MailOnline, in a libel lawsuit relating to articles about his relationship with the British armed forces. Harry sued Associated Newspapers for libel over two articles published in October which claimed he had snubbed the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.\n\n\n\nThe articles claimed that Harry had not been in touch with the force since his last appearance as an honorary Marine in March, and that military leaders were considering replacing him as Captain General of the Royal Marines.\n\n\n\nHarry and his wife, Meghan, stepped down as working royals and moved to the U.S. in early 2019. His honorary military titles were put on hold, and they were due to be reviewed in March as part of the monarchy's review of the couple's departure arrangements.\n\nHarry had served for a decade in the British army, and his lawyers said the articles caused considerable damage to his reputation and credibility with veterans.\n\n\n\nLawyer Jenny Afia, representing Harry, said the publisher has accepted that allegations that he had turned his back on the force were false.\n\n\n\nThe articles constituted not only a personal attack upon the Duke's character but also wrongly brought into question his service to this country, Afia said.\n\n\n\nShe said Harry was proud to have served in the British armed forces for 10 years in Her Majesty's name and has maintained active links with those forces ever since and will continue to do so in the future.\n\n\n\nHarry will donate the damages to the Invictus Games Foundation, a charity for wounded or sick servicemen and women that he founded, she added. The amount of the damages was not disclosed.\n\nSeparately, Meghan is also suing Associated Newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over articles that published portions of a letter she wrote to her father, Thomas Markle, after her marriage to Harry in 2018.
In 1850, a Catholic orphanage called St. Aemilian was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to take in children whose parents had died in a cholera epidemic. 168 Years later, that same organization -- now known as SaintA -- is still finding shelter for thousands of children who need it, often kids who have deep trauma in their young lives, and helps those kids with a revolutionary approach that's spreading across the country.\n\nNo longer a residential orphanage, SaintA primarily places orphaned, abandoned, neglected and abused children in foster homes, and then coordinates their care. On any given day, it's looking after some 2,000 children, almost all of whom are part of a 21st century epidemic of childhood trauma.\n\nAlisha Fox: I got diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder when I was 15.\n\nMilwaukee resident Alisha Fox was given that PTSD diagnosis seven years ago, months after she somehow found the courage to tell her grandmother – and then the police – of the terrible trauma she had been enduring.\n\nAlisha Fox CBS News\n\nAlisha Fox: For ten years, when I was four to 14. I'd been sexually abused and raped by my father.\n\nAlisha's father and mother split up even before she was born. Her dad eventually got custody because her mom had a drug problem, and he then hid his crimes from everyone for a decade.\n\nAlisha Fox: So during that whole time, I wasn't a person. You know? I wasn't anything. I wasn't even my own property. I didn't own myself. Somebody else did.\n\nOprah Winfrey: I can tell by the way you can speak about it, when you can say, This thing happened to me from four to 14, that now there's been a clearing for you.\n\nAlisha Fox: Right. Most people think that, you know, Oh, she's damaged, or like, Oh, she's not gonna be okay, but at the end of the day I think that I'm a survivor.\n\nOprah Winfrey: And every time you tell it, it makes you a little stronger.\n\nAlisha Fox: Absolutely.\n\nAlisha's survival was not a sure thing. Her father went to prison for his crimes against his daughter; she went to live with her maternal grandmother and aunt, Bonnie and Michelle Hahn.\n\nOprah Winfrey: What did you think the first time you heard her described as suffering from PTSD?\n\nBonnie Hahn: I didn't understand it because PTSD was for the veterans coming home from the war. That was what I thought it was. I had no idea.\n\nTim Grove: At the time, she was acutely suicidal.\n\nTim Grove is clinical director at SaintA, and he took responsibility for Alisha's care.\n\nTim Grove: We might not be able to ever prevent the stuff that happens to kids. But we are fully in charge of how we respond when we see it.\n\nThat very same sensitivity that makes you able to learn language just like that as a little infant makes you highly vulnerable to chaos, threat, inconsistency, unpredictability, violence\n\nFor Alisha, like every child who comes to SaintA now -- they responded with an approach called trauma-informed care, which focuses on a person's experiences before trying to correct their behavior, whether it be juvenile delinquency, poor performance in school, or out-of-control anger.\n\nOprah Winfrey: It comes down to the question of not, What's wrong with you? What's wrong with that kid? Why is he behaving like that, to, What happened to you, which is a very different question.\n\nTim Grove: It's so subtle and yet so profound in terms of how kids experience an adult that approaches them from that angle. They--feel safe.\n\nSaintA in Milwaukee CBS News\n\nAlisha Fox: I felt that somebody understood. That they knew where I was coming from. That it wasn't just another person just tryin' to talk to me to calm me down for that moment. That they had done their homework and that they really wanted to help.\n\nOprah Winfrey: You felt seen?\n\nAlisha Fox: I felt seen. Felt heard.\n\nA crucial element of trauma-informed care is something called the ACE test. ACE stands for adverse childhood experiences.\n\nTim Grove: Ten questions primarily taking a lens and looking at sort of the family home and saying to adults looking back at their childhood, Were you physically abused? Were you neglected? Did someone go to prison? Ten questions categorizing adversity that kids face.\n\nAlisha Fox: I did a ACE test for them, and I scored a nine out of ten.\n\nFor anyone, a high score on the ACE test is a powerful predictor of physical and mental problems down the road. According to the Centers for Disease Control, it makes you five times as likely to be depressed and can cut your overall life expectancy by as much as twenty years.\n\nThe CDC says this isn't theory, it's scientific fact, backed up by hundreds of published studies. And, the CDC says, one out of every eight children suffers enough trauma to cause lasting damage.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: If you have developmental trauma, the truth is you're going to be at risk for almost any kind of physical health, mental health, social health problem that you can think of.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry may be the world's leading expert on childhood trauma. He has treated thousands of children, and been called on for decades to treat kids traumatized in high-profile events including the Columbine and Sandy Hook school shootings. He's a psychiatrist, and also has a Ph.D. in neuroscience.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: That very same sensitivity that makes you able to learn language just like that as a little infant makes you highly vulnerable to chaos, threat, inconsistency, unpredictability--\n\nOprah Winfrey: Violence.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: --violence. And so children are much more sensitive to developmental trauma than adults.\n\nOprah Winfrey: So if you're a child who's raised in a nurturing and well-cared-for environment, you're more likely to have a well-wired brain?\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: Correct.\n\nOprah Winfrey: And if you're a child who's raised in an environment of chaos, of uncertainty, of violence, of neglect, you are being wired?\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: Differently.\n\nOprah Winfrey: Differently.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: And-- and typically in a way that makes you more vulnerable.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry CBS News\n\nKids that grow up like that have much higher rates of risk for mental health problems, much higher rates of risk for doing poorly in school.\n\nOprah Winfrey: For just functioning in the world.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: Exactly.\n\nBruce Perry travels the world teaching the techniques of trauma-informed care to therapists, educators, social workers and foster care agencies. It's crucial, he tells them, to understand what has happened to traumatized children before trying to fix their behavior.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: You need other tools in your toolkit.\n\nTim Grove heard Perry speak at a conference 10 years ago, and almost immediately began incorporating the Perry approach at SaintA.\n\nReally it boils down to something pretty simple. And it's relationships.\n\nTim Grove: We started to train our staff. And what our staff came back to us and said was they said, We're starting to get this and we're seein' some remarkable things happen, but you gotta work on that teacher. You gotta work on that cop who just came and screwed everything up. And we said, Okay.And 10 years later, 50,000 people have gone through our curriculum and been--\n\nOprah Winfrey: Wow.\n\nTim Grove: --trained by us.\n\nAmong those trainees, all the teachers at a trauma-sensitive charter school operated by SaintA.\n\nSaintA now works with the Milwaukee Police Department's trauma response unit, and with judges in the city's childrens court.\n\nWhat the judge now knows is to ask a child what happened to you? Before asking what's wrong with you? SaintA repeats that mantra to any Milwaukee organization that will listen.\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: I got involved with SaintA's and the director over there, Tim Grove, and he says, Belinda, you've been doing this all along. There just never was a name attached to it.\n\nFor the last 23 years, Belinda Pittman-McGee has been running the Nia Imani Family Center.\n\nOprah Winfrey: I notice the chores board. So there's order and responsibility.\n\nProviding transitional housing for homeless women and their children. The chaos of homelessness is itself a traumatic experience.\n\n60 Minutes contributor Oprah Winfrey and Belinda Pittman-McGee CBS News\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: I couldn't help anyone if I didn't go back and learn about what happened to them. What they didn't know was to understand, Why am I the way that I am?\n\nOprah Winfrey: Why can't I control my impulses? Why am I so aggressive?\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: That's right.\n\nOprah Winfrey: Why does the first thing that happens, somebody irritates me and I blow up--\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: That's right. I blow up, I wanna fight.\n\nOprah Winfrey: I wanna fight. Yeah, Yeah. So you help them put the pieces together--\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: Put it together.\n\nOprah Winfrey: --for their stories?\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: That's right.\n\nOprah Winfrey: To understand why I am this way.\n\nBelinda understands trauma because she has lived through trauma. More than 30 years ago, she fled an abusive marriage with her three children.\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: I got the children and we left.\n\nShe and her children walked to a shelter for abused women.\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: The first week I was there, we were all outside, kinda go-- gonna go about our day and I heard a mother says, Okay, I'll see you back at home tonight. I thought, Home? She callin' the shelter home. That blew me away.\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: I used to sit around a table just like this, just like this. So, I know life can be better if that's what we truly want.\n\nNia Imani's residents gather in the building's basement almost every evening for group learning and discussion facilitated by staff members who've been through training with SaintA.\n\nTheir children are looked after in an adjacent room, and Belinda shuttles between nurturing the children and nurturing their moms.\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: And this is our baby in the family, right? This is our baby in the family. And she's-- we're gonna help her. We're gonna-- she's gonna learn from all of our experiences\n\nThere is a lot of pain in this room. Most of the women are on public assistance, and Belinda says that 90 percent of the men who fathered their children are incarcerated.\n\nBeinda Pittman-McGee: How long he been incarcerated?\n\nWoman at Discussion: Well, he get out next year. And he like, Y'all there, come back. Like, I don't wanna go back. Like, it's the first time in my life, like, I feel like I'm doin' somethin' and I'm doin' it because I wanna do it. And I'm happy with that.\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: You are. You are. And you know what? You're gonna work that out, too. You're gonna work it out.\n\nThey'll work it out, she says, by first understanding their own trauma and then, in her words, re-scripting their lives…and the lives of their children.\n\nOprah Winfrey: You know, people talk about this cycle of poverty, the cycle of joblessness, homelessness, incarceration. Can those problems be solved without addressing trauma?\n\nBelinda Pittman-McGee: No.\n\nWe first learned of the trauma-informed care happening in Milwaukee from a series in the local newspaper, the Journal Sentinel. It was titled A Time to Heal, and there's a lot that needs to be healed in Milwaukee; it's one of the poorest cities in the nation. And something else drew us to Milwaukee: it's the city where I grew up.\n\nOprah Winfrey: It's not lost on me the irony of being back in the same city, Milwaukee, where I grew up on welfare, poor. A lot of negative experiences. Sexual abuse and all of that. What's the difference between a really bad childhood and being able to overcome that and a traumatic childhood and someone not being able to overcome that?\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: Really it boils down to something pretty simple. And it's relationships.\n\nOprah Winfrey: And a lot of people can say, Oh, I went through that. I went through that. I was, you know, physically abused, sexually abused. And I made it. I pulled myself up by the bootstraps. What you're saying is at some point in your life there was a relationship, or a helping hand, or some kind of healing process that helped you to get where you are.\n\nDr. Bruce Perry: Absolutely. Somebody helped you pull up those boots.\n\nFor the women at Nia Imani, that somebody is Belinda Pittman-McGee. For Alisha Fox, who's now in college, it's SaintA, her aunt, and her grandmother.\n\nAlisha Fox: I think the way that I got through it is knowing that my family, my grandma's side of the family, was always gonna be there for me, no matter what. Through my darkest times they were there. So I thought, If they could be there through my darkest times, then they're definitely gonna be there for the great times.\n\nProduced by Rome Hartman.

U.S. stocks plunged on Monday, briefly halting trading as frightened investors fled the markets amid growing economic uncertainty over the spreading coronavirus. Oil markets also collapsed after Saudi Arabia said it plans to slash prices, escalating a battle with Russia just as the coronavirus's impact is reducing demand for oil.\n\nTrading was stopped shortly after the markets opened at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time, triggered by a 7% drop in the S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 has three circuit breakers that kick in when stocks decline by 7%, 13% or 20% in a single trading session.\n\nThe Dow tumbled 2,014 points, or 7.8%, to 23,851 — a 52-week low. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both slumped more than 7%.\n\nStocks are now in a correction, when the market declines 10% from its most recent high, and are approaching so-called bear territory, or when stocks lose more than 20% of their value. The stock market hasn't seen a bear market since the financial crisis, when the S&P 500 shed about 56% of its value over a 17-month period.\n\nMonday's sharp decline marks the third straight week of turbulence for U.S. investors, who are weighing the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The new COVID-19 disease was blamed for at least 24 deaths in the U.S. as of Monday, with the number of coronavirus disease cases in the United States topping 500 on Sunday.\n\nBusinesses such as Twitter are asking employees to work at home, while universities including Stanford and Columbia are suspending in-person classes. Economists say the risk of recession is increasing due to business disruptions.\n\nIf you ever wondered what would happen if someone lobbed a hand grenade into a bloodbath, now you know, Tom Holland of investor advisory firm Gavekal, said in a report. It's not pretty. Investors logging onto their screens on Monday have been greeted by a sea of red, the like of which has not been seen for 10 years.\n\nHe added, One of the few things investors can conclude with any confidence is that market conditions are now likely to get a good deal worse before they get better.\n\nOil shock\n\nOil prices plunged to their lowest since the 1990s Gulf War as Saudi Arabia slashed prices and boosted output. The benchmark U.S. crude price fell as much as 30%, deepening a rout that began when Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major producers failed to agree on how much to cut output to prop up prices.\n\nThe economic effects of an oil shock maybe longer lasting that those from COVID-19, Fitch Ratings said in a report.\n\nWhile investors typically welcome lower energy costs for businesses and consumers, the abrupt plunge rattled markets already on edge about over the coronavirus. The decline in oil prices could also hurt U.S. shale producers, adding to economic anxieties, Gavekal's Holland noted.\n\nDespite a marriage of convenience on oil between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman Al Saud, this relationship has always been fragile, Societe Generale analysts said in a note. Russian oil companies see the cuts as a self-destructive mechanism to give volumes to the U.S. shale industry.\n\nAt the same time, global oil demand will decline due to the coronavirus this year, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nWhile the situation remains fluid, we expect global oil demand to fall in 2020 – the first full-year decline in more than a decade – because of the deep contraction in China, which accounted for more than 80% of global oil demand growth in 2019, and major disruptions to travel and trade, it said in its March report.\n\nIt added, The immediate outlook for the oil market will ultimately depend on how quickly governments move to contain the coronavirus outbreak, how successful their efforts are, and what lingering impact the global health crisis has on economic activity.
LOS ANGELES -- Who's ready for Speidi Jr.?\n\nAfter eight years of marriage, former reality TV stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are expecting their first child.\n\nThe couple tells US Weekly that Montag is 12 weeks along and the baby is due on Oct. 19.\n\nMontag says she's glad she and Pratt took their time before trying to conceive. The 30-year-old says she thought she was ready in her twenties, but each of their work obligations at the time meant it wouldn't have been a good situation.\n\nMontag and Pratt were regulars on MTV's The Hills and have appeared in other reality shows. In 2009, Montag famously had 10 plastic surgery procedures in one day. The couple temporarily split in 2010.\n\nThe couple doesn't know the sex of the baby yet, but Montag says she's hoping for a boy.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church appointed a 93-year-old former heart surgeon Tuesday as its new president, following a longstanding succession plan that aims to keep the faith on course with a minimum of upheaval.\n\nThe selection of Russell M. Nelson was announced during an address broadcast from Salt Lake City to Mormons around the world. Nelson called on Mormons to stay true to their faith and keep the covenant path.\n\nIf you have stepped off the path, may I advise you with all the hope in my heart to please come back, Nelson said. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there's a place for you in this, the Lord's church.\n\nThe announcement came after Nelson was chosen as the religion's 17th president during a private meeting of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles leadership body in a temple, per church tradition that makes the longest-tenured member of the Quorum the new president. Nelson is now considered a prophet, seer and revelator by Mormons. Nelson succeeds Thomas S. Monson, who died Jan. 2 at age 90.\n\nNelson announced that his two counselors will be Dallin H. Oaks, 85, and Henry B. Eyring, 84, both members of the Quorum. Eyring was also a counselor for Monson, while this marks the first time Oaks will serve as a counselor to a church president. Oaks is the next-longest tenured member of the Quorum, making him next-in-line to become the next president.\n\nMembers of the media watch as Russell M. Nelson speaks via television from the historic Mormon Salt Lake Temple after being announced as the 17th president of the Mormon Church on Jan. 16, 2017, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Getty\n\nNelson is the second-oldest man to assume leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is based in Utah and counts nearly 16 million members worldwide. He will oversee the religious and business interests of the faith in collaboration with two top counselors and members of the Quorum, one of the faith's top governing bodies.\n\nNelson's record during his three decades in church leadership suggests he will make few changes as he upholds church teaching and seeks to draw new members.\n\nAmong the challenges he faces is adapting to the increasingly global nature of the church, which was founded in 1830 in the United States and now has nearly six in 10 members living in other countries.\n\nStill, the rate of growth overall in membership has slowed in the past few decades, despite efforts to spread the faith including the lowering of the minimum age for those serving as missionaries.\n\nNelson takes the top position amid increased scrutiny of church teaching in the internet age, which has made more information on doctrine available. Under Monson, leaders released a series of essays explaining some controversial areas of Mormon history, including early polygamous practices and a past ban on black men in the lay clergy.\n\nThe church also faces some pressure to allow greater leadership roles for women, including those who want to be admitted to the priesthood.\n\nNelson also will have to navigate the issues raised by the LGBT rights movement. The church, at times, has expressed empathy and told members to be welcoming to LGBT people while also strictly defending opposition to same-sex marriage and all homosexual relationships.\n\nLast year, Mormon leaders partially cut ties with the Boy Scouts of America, which in 2015 ended its blanket ban on participation by openly gay adults. The LDS church, which has been the biggest sponsor of troops, said the move wasn't about that decision.\n\nNelson fits the common profile of his generation of church leaders as someone who was successful in the private sector before leaving behind his career to help guide the faith.\n\nBorn in Salt Lake City in 1924, Nelson converted to Mormonism at the age of 16. He was a doctor by 22. He served a two-year Army medical tour of duty during the Korean War before resuming a medical career that included being director of thoracic surgery residency at the University of Utah.\n\nNelson learned Mandarin after church president Spencer W. Kimball challenged church leaders in 1979 to learn the language. The next year, Nelson spent a month in Jinan, China, working with doctors there as a visiting professor of surgery.\n\nIn the spring of 1984, he joined the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nThe final surgery Nelson performed was the next year in China, when he operated on Chinese opera star Fang Rongxiang at the request of a doctor who knew and trusted Nelson, according to a church biography.\n\nNelson was scheduled to answer questions from reporters later Tuesday morning.\n\nHis past speeches offer some clue to how he will lead.\n\nIn October 2015, during a period of intense discussion about the role of women, Nelson spoke of women's unique contributions.\n\nMy dear sisters, whatever your calling, whatever your circumstances, we need your impressions, your insights, and your inspiration, Nelson said. Married or single, you sisters possess distinctive capabilities and special intuition you have received as gifts from God. We brethren cannot duplicate your unique influence.\n\nThat year, when the U.S. legalized same-sex marriage, Mormon leaders declared people in same-sex relationships apostates, meaning they could be excommunicated, and banned baptism for children living with gay parents until the children reached age 18. The policy caused an uproar among gay rights activists within and outside the church. Nelson told a group of young adults in 2016 that the rules came from a revelation received by Monson and other leaders that gave spiritual confirmation for their stance.\n\nLast October, in an address to the church general conference, Nelson implored members to closely read and understand the faith's keystone scripture, the Book of Mormon.\n\nWhen I think of the Book of Mormon, I think of the word power, Nelson said. The truths of the Book of Mormon have the power to heal, comfort, restore, succor, strengthen, console, and cheer our souls.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, posted a video to Twitter Thursday apologizing for her previous remarks about LGBTQ issues, as those comments have plagued her newly launched presidential candidacy.\n\nAs a 21-year-old running for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father, an anti-gay activist, in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions.\n\nTo try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\nGabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. Since entering Congress, she has supported a number of bills promoting LGBTQ equality. She has said that her initial views reflected her socially conservative upbringing.\n\nIn my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones, Gabbard said in the video posted to Twitter Thursday. She said that she was sincerely repeating her apology from 2012. My record in Congress over the past six years reflects what is in my heart, Gabbard added.\n\nMy father was very outspoken. He was an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in Hawaii – and at that time, I forcefully defended him, Gabbard said. But over the years, as I grew up, I formed my own opinions, based on my life experiences.\n\nGabbard also said that she hoped her change of heart could inspire other people who may hold anti-gay views.\n\nI look forward to being able to share more of my story and experiences growing up – not as an excuse, but in the hopes that it may inspire others to truly live aloha, to love and care for others, Gabbard said.
Like everyone else, Nicole Kidman is excited for the second season of Big Little Lies, and apparently, even A-listers can be star-struck. At the 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards show, Kidman, who accompanied her husband Keith Urban to the show, talked to CBS News' Vladimir Duthiers about working with Meryl Streep.\n\nKidman, who stars on the show as Celeste Wright, plays Streep's daughter-in-law. Streep plays Mary Louise Wright, mother of Celeste's late husband, Perry. The show also stars Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern.\n\nWe've already been shooting, explained Kidman.\n\nAmazing, Kidman said of Streep. She's a master. It's like watching the most exquisite acting. Every single day we're all like [gasp]. And we all had so much fun. She's joined the gang.\n\nThe actress also praised Streep for being down-to-earth with the rest of the cast.\n\nShe's such a pro, said Kidman. She shows up. She's completely on time. She's so prepared. It's a joy and it's a joy to work with someone can have so many diva antics and she so doesn't. She's just there to do the work.\n\nOn the same night, Kidman also told ET of Streep, She's got a fantastic character. It's also grounded and it's based in something very, very real, and we hope we bring you the [best] second season and it delivers. We're working hard.\n\nIn January, HBO said season two will focus on the the malignancy of lies, the durability of friendships, the fragility of marriage ... and, of course, the vicious ferocity of sound parenting. No premiere date has been set.
First on CBS News, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock spoke with political correspondent Ed O'Keefe Tuesday in his first one-on-one interview since announcing his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Watch the full interview in the video player above.\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock just became the 23rd Democratic candidate to enter the presidential race Tuesday, seeking to distinguish himself from the crowded field by highlighting his record as a Democratic governor in a state that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in 2016.\n\nWe need to defeat Donald Trump in 2020 and defeat the corrupt system that let's campaign money drown out the people's voice, so we can finally make good on the promise of a fair shot for everyone, Bullock said in a video announcement.\n\nIn his first interview after announcing his run, Bullock told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe that he didn't see Mr. Trump as a good role model.\n\nI have plenty of policy disagreements with this president but also that the way that he conducts in the office and divides people, how he belittles people. That's not the example that you want out of a president. When we're expecting more from our preschoolers at times than a president, that's not the role model that I think most families want for their kids, said Bullock.\n\nAsked about the ongoing trade dispute with China, Bullock said he considers the country a tremendous economic threat but criticized Mr. Trump's approach to trade.\n\nFirst of all, you don't just do it alone. America first shouldn't America alone, but you work with your allies and say that, 'Look, there's an expectation. If you're going to have access to my market, we'll have access on the same terms,' Bullock said.\n\nThe Montana Democrat now joins the largest and most diverse Democratic primary field in modern history. Relatively unknown at the national level, Bullock must now compete with candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; and Kamala Harris of California.\n\nBullock has managed to win several statewide elections in predominantly rural Montana by running as a moderate who also embraces some liberal proposals. During the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump won Republican-leaning Montana by nearly 21 percentage points, Bullock was reelected by a 4-point margin.\n\nOn Tuesday the Montana governor launched his presidential campaign at his alma mater, Helena High School, before leaving for a three-day, eight-county swing through Iowa. It'll be his seventh trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state. He has also visited early-voting states like New Hampshire and Nevada over the past several months.\n\nSince assuming control of the governor's mansion in 2013, he has supported same-sex marriage, net neutrality and held pro-choice views on abortion. He also worked with the Republican-controlled legislature to push through some of the most sweeping campaign finance reforms in the country.

Produced by Alec Sirken\n\nNCIS agents go inside the mysterious case of Cory Allen Voss, a young Navy communications officer murdered after using an ATM in Virginia. The investigation -- a collaboration with the Newport News Police Department -- would lead the agents on a trail of twisted relationships, lies and secret, double lives.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt | NCIS: In 2007, Cory Voss … was a Naval officer. …Cory was an outstanding sailor, had multiple accolades throughout his career … and had been assigned to the USS Elrod.\n\nMaureen Evans | NCIS Special Agent Supervisor: Cory was a shining star and he was a rising star in the Navy. And he would've done great things.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee | Newport News Police Dept., Retired: not one person had anything negative say about him.\n\nBarbara Wilson: And he took to the Navy just like a duck to water.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: He had returned from a deployment and he was at home with his wife Caterina Voss, also known as Cat. And they had had a romantic dinner.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow | NCIS: Once they finish their dinner, Cat tells Cory that she needs some money for the children's lunches the next day at school. So, she asks him to go to the ATM which is just about two or three miles from their house … This is about 11:30 at night, just a routine errand up to the ATM.\n\nMaureen Evans: Cory was at the ATM machine trying to withdraw some money … an individual dressed in all black entered the passenger side of his vehicle … and pointed a weapon at Cory.\n\nMaureen Evans: Cat wasn't able to locate Cory at all.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: So, Cat had called the ship looking for him to see if anyone had seen him. And she also called the local hospitals to determine if anyone had come in matching his description.\n\nMaureen Evans: So, the following morning … she called the police department once again to report that he had still not returned home.\n\n911 OPERATOR: Newport News police and fire, Anista. CAT VOSS: Hi I'm calling to see if my husband had gotten into an accident or something in Newport News. 911 OPERATOR: We haven't had one. CAT VOSS: No, OK.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: And what we now know -- he went to an adjacent parking lot.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: Newport News police arrive at the parking lot and find Cory Voss deceased in his vehicle with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: From there, my sergeant and I responded to talk with Mrs. Cat Voss and … she just became hysterical, screaming … almost out of control.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: This appeared to be a robbery gone bad.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: But then we started looking more. … Usually, a robber wants to come in, commit the robbery -- not shoot at all if he doesn't have to, but if he does, it's one maybe two shots and he's gone. And this just seemed like it was overkill.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: Throughout the investigation, leads … led us to multiple individuals involved with the murder of Cory Voss.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We developed one suspect … then a second suspect … and ultimately a third suspect … we just had to figure out how to tie all of them together\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: It took a lot of twists and turns as the investigation progressed.\n\nGregory Ford, Executive Assistant Director, NCIS Criminal Investigations: I can't fathom what the mindset is of someone that commits heinous acts such as this.\n\nBarbara Wilson | Cory Voss' mother: it still doesn't make sense to me.\n\nMaureen Evans: I've never come across a triangle of three individuals … with no connection initially … that ended up in a cold-blooded murder of somebody who was totally innocent.\n\nCory and Cat\n\nU.S. Navy Ensign Cory Voss was on a fast track to a promising naval career until his murder at the hands of a mysterious stranger in April 2007. The only clues investigators had were grainy surveillance photos at the ATM.\n\nGrainy surveillance video shows Cory Voss at the Langley Federal Credit ATM Newport News Police\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: This is the Langley Federal Credit Union where Cory drove up to that night. And That's the ATM.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We just couldn't tell clearly who had gotten in that truck. … it was blocked by a part of a visor. So, we couldn't make a definitive identification of that individual. And there was even speculation as to the race of the individual.\n\nBarbara Wilson: it just breaks your heart.\n\nCory's mother Barbara Wilson was devastated.\n\nBarbara Wilson: It's hard, not having all of your children.\n\nShe recalls her son's wife Cat being overwhelmed with grief at his funeral.\n\nBarbara Wilson: She was just a complete mess. I was more concerned with her than I was for myself.\n\nNCIS agents and Newport News Police in Virginia felt enormous pressure to quickly solve this case, so they pooled resources.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: We work a great deal with local law enforcement … We worked seamlessly together.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: As investigators, we began a victimology soon after the crime takes place.\n\nMaureen Evans: Because we need to learn about the victim in a case so that we can learn more about … how that person could have potentially died.\n\nBarbara Wilson: He was a great kid. … He was a handful.\n\nBarbara Wilson says Cory's teenage years were rocky.\n\nBarbara Wilson: But it was mostly just from hanging around kids who were getting in trouble. … I used to say, when he turns 18, he's going to be just fine if he should live that long [laughs] because he just -- you know one thing after another.\n\nEnsign Cory Voss Newport News Police\n\nWhat turned his life around was when Cory joined the Navy.\n\nBarbara Wilson: He just kind of grew up. … military will do that to you.\n\nBarbara Wilson: He looks so good in that uniform\n\nMaureen Evans: He was a great ship handler. He was a great supervisor. Everyone loved him\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: After interviewing all the people about Cory -- friends, family, Cat's friends. Not one person had anything negative to say about him. I mean, he was, like, the perfect guy.\n\nMaureen Evans: I spoke to Cory's executive officer on the USS Elrod. He told me that in the 14 years that he had been supervising young officers in the Navy that Cory was one of the top three\n\nHe was a navigation specialist on a five-year training program to run his own ship. Professionally he was on the rise, and his personal life blossomed in 1999 when he met Cat in a bar in Newport News.\n\nBarbara Wilson: He brought her to meet the family and she was very nice.\n\nShe seemed exotic. Cat always spoke to Cory's mother in a Russian accent.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: Cat Voss told Cory 's mother that she was born and raised in the Ukraine by a Ukrainian father and an American mother.\n\nBarbara Wilson: She said she came over from the Ukraine when she was in seventh- or eighth-grade, so she went to high school in the States.\n\nBarbara Wilson: She had -- a wild side. And, so, I kind of gathered that she was now wanting to settle down.\n\nThe couple had only been dating three months when they learned they'd be having a baby.\n\nBarbara Wilson: it wasn't like, you know, Well, she's pregnant so we have to get married. … He was in love with her. They were going to be a family.\n\nWhat Cory didn't know is that Cat was keeping a secret: she was already married to Steve Larson, a high school classmate in Newport News. They eloped after she got pregnant at 17. Their daughter lived with Cat's mother.\n\nSteve Larson | Cat's ex-husband: The marriage was always a struggle. … Money was always the argument. You know, we never had enough.\n\nLarson was a military man and was often away from home. After one long deployment, he came back to a little surprise.\n\nSteve Larson: She told me she was pregnant with somebody else's kid. … Six months pregnant\n\nThe father was Cory, but Larson still wanted to save their marriage.\n\nSteve Larson: But she didn't want to do it. … she was definitely done with me. … she knew what she wanted … and she drove for it every time and worked towards getting what she wanted every time.\n\nInevitably, they divorced.\n\nCat and Cory Voss Barbara Wilson\n\nCory and Cat married in 2000 after the birth of their daughter Casey; Cory Jr. followed a year later.\n\nBarbara Wilson: Cat and I talked all the time on the phone. So, she would call and she'd say, you know, we're fixing up the apartment … She would ask advice and how you do this and how you would do that … I mean, I really thought she was just the best daughter-in-law … good mother.\n\nWhile Wilson believed Cat was a good wife and mother, Cat was not so impressed with her husband as a good provider.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: She wanted to maintain a certain lifestyle, drove a BMW … she wanted to buy the clothes and buy the jewelry. And so, she would spend all this money and had an exorbitant amount of debt. … there were so many bills that were not being paid because of this lifestyle that she wanted to have.\n\nCarol Wiggins | Cat Voss' aunt: Cathleen was fairly manic about money.\n\nCarol Wiggins is Cat's aunt. She knew all about her niece's spendthrift ways but was very fond of her.\n\nCarol Wiggins: She was fun, charming, witty, charismatic.\n\nWiggins remembers when Cat was 16, a great aunt left her $25,000 of inheritance. And Wiggins and Cat went shopping.\n\nCarol Wiggins: And Cathleen would go through that store. And get a look on her eye -- it reminded me of a rat in a cheese factory.\n\nCarol Wiggins: She spent a lot of money. And graciously spent it on my children and bought me a couple of things. And in three weeks she was broke\n\nAs investigators kept probing Cat and Cory's relationship for clues to his murder, an anonymous caller to a police hotline focused their investigation on Cat, the grieving widow.\n\nAshley Doyle | Friend of Cat Voss: A voice just told me, you know, she did it. … You have to stand up and say something.\n\nSecrets and lies\n\nBarbara Wilson: The Ukrainian accent did not throw me at all. You know, I was happy that my son had found somebody that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.\n\nJust days into the investigation, NCIS agents and police learned Cat wasn't who she appeared to be. That accent she used with Cory's mom? That was all an act.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: Yes, Cory's mom believed it up until the day we told her, during this investigation, that it wasn't true.\n\nCat had, in fact, grown up in Newport News.\n\nBarbara Wilson: Pure fantasy. … I don't know why she would go and make up this story.\n\nMaureen Evans: it's like she wants to be the center of attention. She wants to be exciting … instead of just being the, boring person that really doesn't have anything exciting in their background.\n\nAshley Doyle: She always would do a Russian accent, but it was only when we were out drinking, and we all thought it was a way for her to be funny- for her to entertain us.\n\nCat's friend, Ashley Doyle, would become a key part of the investigation.\n\nAshley Doyle: I met Cory not long after meeting Caterina, he was just a very good husband … to Caterina and a very good dad to the kids. Just always, taking care of them. Caterina wanted to go somewhere, do something, Cory would be there for the kids.\n\nAshley Doyle: Often, with Caterina, we were out, you know, drinking, partying … She was a lot of fun to be at a bar with because you felt like you were the center of attention, too, because she was.\n\nCory spent months at sea. And when he was away, Cat was at play … often with other men.\n\nAshley Doyle: So sometimes Caterina would give the children, Kacey and Cory, Benadryl to get them to sleep so that she could basically do what she wanted in the evenings and she could bring home whoever she wanted, and they would be sleeping.\n\nNCIS agents would learn Cat had found a new boyfriend, Michael Draven, whom she'd met on the website MySpace.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: We needed to focus our efforts on Cat for the murder of Cory, specifically that Cat had a relationship with an individual named Michael Draven.\n\nAshley Doyle: She said he was a photographer … and he was very -- he came off as being very artistic and kind of had that Goth look … appearance to him … But she was just completely enamored with him from the get-go and was telling me all about him.\n\nMichael Draven and Cat Voss Newport News Police\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: Well, we learn about Michael Draven that he claims to be a successful filmmaker and photographer, and that he had opened his own business that he was making hundreds of thousand dollars per year, doing really well.\n\nBut, in reality …\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: What we found out is he's living in a mobile home with his mother and delivering newspapers, part-time, when she can wake him up in the middle of the night.\n\nAshley Doyle: I was immediately like, Caterina, you're not going to continue talking to this guy? He lied to you. …She's like, well, He was, you know, he was just embarrassed about his situation -- and just immediately she was making excuses for him. … And then, once he took hold of her, she was a different person.\n\nLike Cat, Draven created his own reality; Michael Draven wasn't even his real name.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We learned that he had actually, in Baltimore, Maryland, submitted a document to the court system, changing his name from Anthony Neff to Michael Anthony Eric Draven. … Eric Draven was the name of an actor in a movie called The Crow … he said that it was a more intriguing name.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: Michael Draven was a fanatic, in that everything that he did seemed to be a little bit bizarre.\n\nDraven also had a bizarre side job to make extra money.\n\nMaureen Evans: Draven would go to this hospital in Baltimore and be a human test subject.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: … where he'd go up and, based on the study that he would do … he would be paid for taking pills or a procedure may be done or what have you. He was a lab rat. He was a human lab rat.\n\nHe and Cat were so brazen in their relationship that Draven had photos of her children on his MySpace page.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: And he had captioned my daughter Casey. And you know we just thought that that was bizarre that he had made basically claims of them being his children before Cory was ever murdered.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: I think what Michael Draven wanted was to be Cory.\n\nAshley Doyle: She was talking to me about divorcing Cory and I explained to her, Caterina, what are you going to do? She's never worked. She was a stay at home mom, I knew it was going to be a big change for her … as far as financially – and … that she would actually have to support herself as well … And I think that she started realizing that she needed to do something else to maintain her lifestyle.\n\nA month after that conversation …\n\nAshley Doyle: I woke up one morning, getting ready for work, turned on the news … and I happen to hear something that caught my attention. And I turned and looked at the TV screen and I saw Cory's truck … and they were saying that he was found dead in his truck. Immediately my mind started spinning and I thought, Oh, my God … she's done it.\n\nAshley Doyle: And at the end of the news report, they had said, if you have any information, you can call the crime line.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: She didn't initially want to provide her name or meet with us. But after talking with her for a few minutes, she did agree to do that.\n\nBut was Cat really involved in Cory's death? Detectives needed something incriminating so they asked Ashley to wear a wire and record Cat with a small camera inside her purse.\n\nAshley Doyle: It was just hard for me to do.\n\nAshley Doyle: And I was just terrified. I thought she was going to know for sure that I was wearing a wire or that I had a camera.\n\nAshley Doyle: And then we walked into the kitchen and we were talking more about things … and she put down a Pepsi bottle right in front of my purse that I had laid in front of her to try and get her talking to me. And I thought, Oh, God, she knows. She knows about the camera.\n\nAshley Doyle CBS News\n\nIt was a false alarm -- Cat had no clue about the camera.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: Well, obviously [we] didn't get a bombshell of a confession or anything like that.\n\nDoyle says Cat had two distinctly different reactions to Cory's death. On one hand, she was dismissive.\n\nAshley Doyle: Cory's mom called and she let the answering machine pick up the call. And she said, Oh, God, it's Cory's mom again. And she acted just totally uncaring about the whole situation.\n\nBut in contrast, at his funeral, Doyle says Cat's behavior was over-the-top.\n\nAshley Doyle: I went with a friend of mine and we just could not believe the show that Caterina put on … just very dramatic, crying … laying over the casket. It was really bad acting. It was ridiculous. It was a joke.\n\nFor investigators, there were more red flags.\n\nMaureen Evans: When a military member in the Navy is killed, there's an immediate $100,000 death benefit that is provided to the spouse or to the family -- the next of kin. And in this case, that $100,000 went to Cat.\n\nMaureen Evans: We had people researching how Cat spent money.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: She's spending … almost $10,000 in the Outer Banks on a vacation with her boyfriend, his brother and girlfriend, and the kids. And we're only less than three weeks removed from Cory 's murder.\n\nShe splurged on jewelry, hotels, restaurants -- and even paid the rent of her boyfriend Draven's new apartment.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: And within three months, she had spent all but approximately $900 of it.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: That's telling us that she has no remorse for her husband being murdered.\n\nMonths passed, but investigators only had a circumstantial case -- they needed a lot more.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: At that point in time, we didn't have anything more than mere suspicion and some connections to Michael Draven -- but certainly, nothing to link her directly to participating in the murder.\n\nSo, they resorted to another investigative technique -- wiretaps:\n\nSURVEILLANCE AUDIO: MICHAEL DRAVEN: Yeah, yeah, they want to talk to him. CAT VOSS: What about? MICHAEL DRAVEN: I don't freaking know.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: The phones were Cat's and Draven's … homes and cell phones.\n\nAnd those weeks of overheard conversations led investigators down another long twisty trail to pay dirt.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: It was a game-changer.\n\nTickling the wires\n\nBarbara Wilson | Cory Voss' mother: If he were overseas, then, you know, that's when I would worry about him. … the idea that he would come home and then be killed. … You know, it just didn't seem to make sense. It didn't seem real.\n\nAs the months had passed, Cory Voss's murder was still unsolved. NCIS and police were taking a hard look at Cat and her lover Michael Draven, now their prime suspects.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: No, we didn't at that point know … who had gotten in the truck. But we certainly didn't discount the fact that we thought it could have been Draven.\n\nInvestigators hoped the phone taps might lead to conversations revealing who actually killed Cory:\n\nSURVEILLANCE AUDIO: MICHAEL DRAVEN: You need to get the hell here now. CAT VOSS: Why? What happened? MICHAEL DRAVEN: Just get here.\n\nThey needed to get Cat and Draven talking about the murder.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We went first to interview Cat's mother. … And we knew that she would call Cat and tell her that we just interviewed her and what we asked. … immediately, we flew that afternoon to Michigan, and we interviewed Cory 's sister … And we even asked them to call and see how she was doing. So that created conversation.\n\nThose conversations were part of the carefully orchestrated wiretap plan.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: Tickling the wires. It's a law enforcement phrase that -- it's used to elicit or initiate conversation between other parties.\n\nRetired Newport News Detective Larry Rilee CBS News\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We didn't get a confession, but what we did get was an enormous amount of evidence of them creating alibis and what they needed and what they wanted the friends to tell the police if they were to come to them.\n\nCat herself was eager to see the investigation wrapped up.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: She was telling all of her friends that we weren't investigating. The police department isn't doing what they need to do. They haven't found anybody. She needed to be cleared.\n\nCleared, so she could get all of Cory's military benefits.\n\nMaureen Evans | NCIS special agent supervisor: She also … found out that there was a $400,000 life insurance policy that she was also gonna to get. … Additionally … money for Social Security for the kids, which was about $300 a month for each kid. And she also got a widow's benefit as well, which was … probably $500 to $700-a-month for the rest of her life.\n\nMaureen Evans: But in order to get that money, she had to be excluded as being involved in any way, shape or form with Cory's death.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: As a matter of fact, Caterina Voss had made several complaints that we weren't doing enough, and that was because I'd put a hold on her insurance money.\n\nMaureen Evans: And she actually claimed in one of the last emails that she sent to the life insurance policy folks that she was psychologically and emotionally damaged because she couldn't pay any bills.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: She even made formal complaints to a local U.S. congresswoman … She failed to tell the congresswoman, however, that she had already gotten $100,000 and blown through it in six weeks.\n\nInvestigators were thoroughly convinced of Cat's motive: money. But they still needed to figure out if she was the mastermind behind Cory's murder.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: During the course of the investigation there was a big break in the case.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We learned that Michael Draven had been arrested in March of 2007.\n\nThat was a month before the murder.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: … and it was an arrest for an outstanding warrant in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nMaureen Evans: He apparently got into some sort of altercation with his ex-girlfriend\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: And Michael Draven had been in jail for some six days and had made hundreds of phone calls, 99% of them to Cat Voss.\n\nAnd all phone calls in jail are recorded.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: So, we chose to just take a chance and recover the phone records.\n\nCAT VOSS | JAIL CALL AUDIO: Well, there's one little factor that'll be taken care of very soon, just to let you know. Don't say it on here because it's recorded.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: There was a question by Draven to Cat, Did you talk to David?\n\nJAIL CALL AUDIO: MICHAEL DRAVEN: You said that you and David was talking? CAT VOSS: Uh-huh.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: And she said in a vague response, Yeah. Yeah, like last week, like two hours.\n\nJAIL CALL AUDIO: MICHAEL DRAVEN: You told him what's going on? CAT VOSS: Yes, I did. MICHAEL DRAVEN: OK. CAT VOSS: He said, oh, my f-----g god. … I'm just letting you know, I will take care of it from here on. MICHAEL DRAVEN: OK, just don't get yourself in trouble, OK? CAT VOSS: I won't. Trust me.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: There was a conversation about money and how much David wanted. And he wanted $500 up front.\n\nJAIL CALL AUDIO: CAT VOSS: He wants more money. MICHAEL DRAVEN: More money? CAT VOSS: Um, up front, and he wanted – he wanted -- I don't have $500 now.\n\nThose recordings were a game changer. Agents reviewed Cat's phone records to find the mysterious David.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: That phone was registered to a guy named David Runyon. And it went back to a Morgantown, West Virginia, address. And that was where we truly believed that we had identified the third party that was involved in this this murder.\n\nAnd now it was time for NCIS agents to track him down\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: It's not often that you get the smoking gun, and in this case, a smoking map.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: I thought, how dumb could this guy be?\n\nFollowing the trail\n\nMaureen Evans: We're not going to let a crime go unpunished.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: Of course, there's a personal connection to each one of our cases and a desire to solve that case.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: Who is David Runyon?\n\nFrom left, NCIS Special Agent Sandra Barrow, Special Agent supervisor Maureen Evans and Special Agent Dana Shutt CBS News\n\nTo make their case, investigators needed to connect Cat and Draven, and now, David Runyon, to the murder of Cory Voss.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: Michael Draven was getting paid to have medical experiments conducted on him.\n\nMaureen Evans: We find out that David Runyon is also one of those individuals that goes to the to the hospital in Baltimore and volunteers to have drugs ingested in him to actually be a human test subject as well. So that is where they met and had developed some sort of relationship.\n\nThe focus of the investigation shifted to Morgantown, West Virginia, where Runyon lived.\n\nMaureen Evans: Our job was to come up here and surveil him.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: We placed a GPS tracking device on his Chevy blazer. And we conducted weeks of electronic surveillance as well as constant visual surveillance.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: And we watched his daily activities. We were trying to establish a pattern of life … his associates, residence, prior residences, anything that may be of evidentiary value to the investigation.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We did find out that he had been in the military, that he was a sharpshooter.\n\nThey followed him 24 hours a day.\n\nMaureen Evans: from the time that, you know, he woke up to the time that he went to bed.\n\nMaureen Evans: We were trying to find evidence to tie David Runyon further to Draven and Cat. And so, during their surveillance, we did see him going in the back of his vehicle numerous times. We thought there were gun boxes in there, but we were never close enough to actually see what was in there.\n\nBut they had enough evidence from the wiretaps to get a search warrant for his mobile home.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: And during that search, we located a box of 357 ammunition. And five … were missing. … That was significant because Cory Voss had been shot five times.\n\nThen, another crucial clue.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: In his backpack, we found what we referred to as a shopping list. And it was a handwritten note with a shopping list that included items such as a knife, a tarp, a black hooded sweatshirt, boots.\n\nNow, five months after Cory's murder, it was time to move in on Runyon.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: And so we made a telephone call to Morgantown Police Department and requested their assistance.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: Morgantown police initiate the traffic stop. … And I remember David Runyon had no reaction whatsoever.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: When we were searching his truck, obviously we were hopeful that we would find something.\n\nAnd what they found would make their case.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: And it was hidden down in the compartment underneath the compartment, in the center console.\n\nThe smoking map found in Runyon's vehicle included a detailed description of Cory Voss' truck, as well as Cory's name handwritten on it. Newport News Police\n\nIt's what Rilee refers to as the smoking map.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: And on that map was handwritten, Langley Federal Credit Union … a very detailed description of Cory Voss' truck, as well as Cory's name written on there. Also, in the center console was a picture of Cat and Michael Draven.\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: We all just sat there and looked at each other and thought, My goodness. I can't even believe that this is in this vehicle.\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: I thought, how dumb could this guy be to still have in his possession something of such significance that unequivocally links him to Cory Voss, Cat, and Michael Draven, still riding around with it in his vehicle after seven months?\n\nSpecial Agent Dana Shutt: How can someone still keep that? … Why would they not get rid of that evidence?\n\nSpecial Agent Sandra Barrow: I think he just forgot about it.\n\nThey arrest Runyon and Detective Rilee sits him down for an interrogation:\n\nDET. LARRY RILEE: They're gonna make you out to be a monster man, you're gonna be a hired killer.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We ultimately showed him that map.\n\nDET. LARRY RILEE: Let me show you a map that we found in your truck, David.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: We asked them was that his map, and he also acknowledged that it was. And he acknowledged that it was his handwriting on that map. And he also acknowledged that that was a photograph of Cat Voss and Michael Draven that we had recovered from his vehicle.\n\nDET. LARRY RILEE: You have a picture of Michael Draven and Cat Voss …\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: And it was very shortly after that that he decided to invoke his right to an attorney, and he didn't want to speak to us anymore.\n\nDAVID RUNYON: It sounds like maybe I need to get a lawyer.\n\nThey headed back to Newport News to arrest Michael Draven. Investigators were still monitoring his calls on those wiretaps.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: So, it was well-known amongst the family and the friends of Cat and Michael that this arrest had taken place in Morgantown, and they felt that they were next. So, they became extremely worried … Michael Draven was heard walking around the city very depressed, talking with his mother and with Cat and saying, at some point, that he was just going to go to the James River Bridge and jump off into the river.\n\nThey made an all-out effort to find him before he could harm himself.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: It was raining outside. It was cold outside. … He was soaking wet. … He appeared so exhausted, mentally and physically. … I don't know that it wasn't a relief for him.\n\nTwo down, one to go. They needed to find Cat Voss – which led to, says Rilee, absolute shock.\n\nMAPPING THE MURDER\n\n\n\nAfter picking up a soaking wet, suicidal Michael Draven, investigators sat him down.\n\nDET. J.T. WILLIAMS [TO DRAVEN]: All we're asking Michael is the truth … you will feel a 110% better, believe me.\n\nAfter hours of interrogation by Detective Rilee and his partner, Draven finally comes clean -- naming Cat as the mastermind behind her husband's murder.\n\nDET. J.T. WILLIAMS: What did she ask you to do? MICHAEL DRAVEN: She asked me to take him out. DET. J.T. WILLIAMS: And what did that mean to you? MICHAEL DRAVEN: Shoot him or strangle him or kill him. DET. J.T. WILLIAMS: And you could not do that? MICHAEL DRAVEN: No. God I can't kill a person …\n\nJuanita Harper | Michael Draven's mother: I know my son, he couldn't even kill a bug.\n\nDraven's mother Juanita Harper recalls a bizarre conversation she and her husband had with Cat.\n\nJuanita Harper: She wasn't specific on naming Cory's name. But she was like – there's something I want to get rid of without having it traced back to me.\n\nHarper says they didn't take it seriously, and her son's only crime was not standing up to Cat.\n\nJuanita Harper: He said he didn't speak up for fear that she was gonna to have something done to my husband and to me and my grandchildren.\n\nDetectives lay out their case to Draven -- how they know for certain he connected Cat with Runyon.\n\nDET. LARRY RILEE: We know through the cell phone records that you put her into contact with David Runyon.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: He had relayed to David Runyon that Cat Voss was in a bad relationship with her husband … he had been told by Cat that Cory had abused the children -- not sexually, but physically.\n\nThat was not true, but agents say Cat made it up to convince Draven and Runyon to go along with her murder plan.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: Ultimately Michael Draven said that … David Runyon agreed to commit that murder for $20,000 … But that he never got paid for it.\n\nMICHAEL DRAVEN: She never gave him anything. I never gave him anything.\n\nDET. J.T. WILLIAMS: It's hard for me to believe that a professional hit man or any hit man is gonna drive six hours, come down here and kill a man and drive back and not even get gas money.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: And the only amount of money that we were ever able to document being sent was a $275 Western Union money transfer to David Runyon.\n\nDuring his interrogation, police ask Draven to call Cat as they record it:\n\nPHONE CALL AUDIO: MICHAEL DRAVEN: I want to know what we're going to do. MICHAEL DRAVEN: Cat, I've done nothing but love you. MICHAEL DRAVEN: Cops are all over the place. … I'm f-----g freaking out, OK. CAT VOSS: I'm coming to get you right now.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: Knowing that she was coming, of course, we had detectives and officers staged outside to take her into custody.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee [outside police station]: We staged detectives and officers in the area here in front of the station.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: I mean, she had no idea that anybody was out there waiting to arrest her.\n\nCat Voss was arrested and questioned.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: And then so she wanted to blame Michael.\n\nCat Voss tries to pass the blame when questioned Newport News Police\n\nCAT VOSS [crying]: I felt like he was pushing and pushing. Now I'm mad because I feel like I was used. DET. LARRY RILEE: Y'all came up with an idea. CAT VOSS [crying]: No. He came up with this idea.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: She wants to throw Michael under the bus.\n\nDET. LARRY RILEE: What was the idea? CAT VOSS [crying]: For him to find someone to take Cory out.\n\nThen she blames Runyon:\n\nCAT VOSS [crying]: He took my husband's life and it was my fault [cries] he did it and I hated him. …he wanted all his money and he kept going up and up and up with the money.\n\nLarry Rilee: She acknowledged that she was involved. However, she said she didn't really want it to happen.\n\nDET. LARRY RILEE: You know what? You're a very manipulative person.\n\nCAT VOSS: No, I am not!\n\nDET. LARRY RILEE: You manipulated everyone.\n\nDet. Larry Rilee: The only remorse she showed was that she had been caught. I believe that to this day.\n\nNewport News Police\n\nAll three were charged with conspiracy to commit murder for hire.\n\nDraven and Runyon went to trial. Draven got a life sentence.\n\nMaureen Evans: And Runyon was found guilty as well. And he's actually on death row.\n\nAs for Cat …\n\nMaureen Evans: the evidence was so overwhelming that she pled guilty in this case.\n\nCat also got life.\n\nBarbara Wilson: She took my son away from me. That's unforgivable … She was evil.\n\nIn the end for all the investigators involved in this case, there is some satisfaction in bringing justice, but there is also anger at the killers.\n\nMaureen Evans: What kind of individual does that? That's probably what baffles me the most about that … It's just cold blooded.\n\nGregory Ford | Executive Assistant Director, NCIS Criminal Investigations: Getting to the truth is what we owe to the Department of Navy, to the victims and to the public.\n\nBarbara Wilson: I think about him all the time. …there's a void. … There's a piece missing.
Many celebrities have been posting quarantine content from their mansions in Los Angeles, but one famous actor is no where near the Hollywood scene. Matt Damon and his family are self-isolating in the small seaside town of Dalkey in Ireland.\n\nSince Dalkey is not used to hosting A-list celebrities, the actor has become the talk of the town. Damon agreed to an interview on an Irish radio show, Fully Charged, where the hosts asked him to surprise a fan who just happens to be a nurse on the front lines of the coronavirus battle.\n\nTo kick off the interview, Damon explained that he was in Europe filming a movie when production moved to Ireland but then shut down due to coronavirus.\n\nRather than fly home, he and his family chose to stay put in Dalkey, and they've been there for about two months now.\n\nI don't know if you're fully aware that the Dalkey people are protecting you like a glorious gem, radio host Nathan O'Reilly told Damon during the interview.\n\nLocals have even created a Facebook group to track Damon — and he's aware of it. That's when I realized how great this place was and how protective everybody is here, Damon said. I had no idea this was happening behind the scenes. O'Reilly admitted joining the group to try and find Damon for the interview.\n\nThe reason Damon agreed to do the interview was because a famous friend convinced him to. U2 singer Bono lives nearby, and while the pals can't see each other face to face due to social distancing rules, they have been FaceTiming. On one call, the Irish singer told Damon: You know, there's a local radio station that's looking for you.\n\nThat was the final impetus for me, Damon said. I was like, 'I really got to check those guys out and call into the show.' The hosts were absolutely delighted that Bono helped facilitate the interview, which they conducted with Damon via video conference.\n\nDamon called Dalkey incredible and one of the most beautiful places his family has ever been. Obviously what's going on in the world is horrible, but for my family, it timed out right, Damon said. I'm with my whole family and I have my kids and we have teachers with us because we were planning on missing school for about eight weeks. So we have what nobody has, which is live human beings teaching our kids.\n\nDamon knows this is a luxury for parents in a time of remote learning. He's also grateful that in a time when travel is limited, he's stuck in a picturesque place.\n\nDamon said while most of his family is together in Ireland, his eldest daughter, Alexia, from his wife Luciana Bozán Barroso's previous marriage, is in college in New York City. She and her roommates had COVID-19 early on, Damon said, adding she got through it fine, and she will reunite with the rest of the family at the end of the month.\n\nOf course, the hosts couldn't end the interview without asking Damon about Contagion, the prescient 2011 film about an uncontrollable pandemic. You're oddly prepared for this because you were in 'Contagion.' Life is literally imitating art now, host Graham O'Toole said.\n\nDamon said has spoken to screenwriter Scott Burns and some of the people who consulted on the movie about the current pandemic. Anybody who says you couldn't predict this, just look at 'Contagion.' I mean, 10 years ago we made a movie just by talking to experts and asking them how this would look and how it would kind of go down, Damon said.\n\nThe whole thing is just tragic and sad. I hope some good can come out of it. Luckily, this isn't as lethal as it might've been, so maybe this is a dry run for the big one that might come along, because these things do come along every few decades, he continued. Best to be ready for it.\n\nTo end the interview, the hosts had Damon surprise a nurse who asked if there was any way she could see him. The nurse, Anais, who is from France but lives in Dublin, was shocked to see Damon join the video conference. I just can't breathe at all, she said.\n\nDamon thanked Anais for all she and other frontline workers are doing. I feel like that is the one thing to come out of this — we will never ever ever look at you guys the same. And that's a good thing, he told the nurse.
Colin Jost and Scarlett Johansson attend the world premiere of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Avengers: Endgame at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019m in Los Angeles, Calif. Getty\n\nWedding bells are in the future for actress Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost of Saturday Night Live. Johansson's publicist Marcel Pariseau tells The Associated Press on Sunday that the private couple is officially engaged after two years of dating. Pariseau says no date has been set for the nuptials.\n\nJohansson, 34, was previously married to actor Ryan Reynolds and journalist Romain Dauriac, with whom she has a daughter named Rose who was born in 2014.\n\nThis is the first marriage for the 36-year-old Jost, who is the co-anchor of SNL's Weekend Update.\n\nThe couple recently walked the red carpet together at the premiere of Avengers: Endgame, in which Johansson plays the character of Black Widow.
Beijing — A Chinese man has been ordered to pay his ex-wife almost $8,000 for years of unpaid housework, in a landmark divorce case that has sparked furious debate in China. Under the country's new civil code, which came into effect this year, divorcing spouses have the right for the first time to request compensation if they bore more responsibilities at home.\n\nEx-wife Wang told the Beijing court that during five years of marriage she looked after the child and managed household chores, while (her husband) Chen did not care about or participate in any other household affairs besides going to work.\n\nShe filed a claim for extra compensation for housework and childcare duties, according to a February 4 court statement.\n\nThe court ruled that Wang had indeed taken on more household responsibilities and should receive 50,000 yuan ($7,700) plus sole child custody and an additional 2,000 yuan in alimony per month.\n\nBut after local media reported this week that Wang had appealed — having originally requested 160,000 yuan compensation — the ruling sparked widespread online debate over the value of women's unpaid domestic labor.\n\nThe trending hashtag stay-at-home wife receives 50,000 yuan housework compensation had gained over 570 million views on the Twitter-like platform Weibo by Wednesday.\n\nWomen should never be stay-at-home wives... when you divorce, you are left with nothing whatsoever. 50,000 yuan in housework compensation is bullshit, read one comment.\n\nA full-time nanny could cost more than this for half a year, are women's youth and feelings this cheap? read another.\n\nThe amount reflected the length of time the couple were married plus the effort Wang put into housework, Chen's income and the local cost of living, according to one of the judges, quoted Monday in local media.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has estimated that Chinese women spend nearly four hours doing unpaid labor daily — 2.5 times that of men and higher than the average.\n\nMarriage breakups have surged over the last two decades in China as divorce laws were liberalized and women became more financially independent — to the concern of Beijing, which is trying to boost birth rates in an ageing population.
Global gains in LGBT rights, including marriage equality, have been met with backlash in many parts of the world. This year alone, Brunei adopted the death penalty as punishment for gay sex, then – in the face of mounting international pressure – announced it would not enforce the punishment. Brunei is one of 70 countries worldwide where same-sex relations are a crime, in seven of those countries punishable by death. Jon Wertheim reports on an organization called Rainbow Railroad dedicated to helping LGBT individuals escape persecution, violence and sometimes death in their home countries on the next edition of 60 Minutes, Sunday, May 19, 7:00 p.m., ET/PT on CBS.\n\nFounded in 2006 and based in Toronto, Rainbow Railroad has helped 600 LGBT individuals leave 22 hostile countries. Kimahli Powell is its executive director. The majority of people that we help have told harrowing stories of being hunted down, of being excommunicated by their churches, their families, their communities, and so they've come to us really desperate, he tells Wertheim.\n\nIn 2017, reports surfaced of authorities in the Russian republic of Chechnya rounding up, torturing and in some cases killing men they suspected of being gay. The Chechen leader has publicly denied the existence of gay citizens. Wertheim speaks to a gay Chechen man who was able to find safety with the help of Rainbow Railroad. Usman, whose identity 60 Minutes conceals at his request because he fears for the safety of his family back home, was swept up in the Chechen purge and subjected to torture by electric shock. They tied my hands behind my back. And they beat me. They kept asking me for names and phone numbers, he says. He goes on to explain that his captors wanted him to give up the names of gay men he knew.\n\n\n\nUsman was one of 42 Chechens Rainbow Railroad helped bring to Canada after the 2017 crackdown in the Russian republic. The Chechen migrants have since been granted permission to stay in Canada.\n\nWertheim also interviews a group of LGBT migrants from Egypt. Rainbow Railroad helped bring them to Canada after they were caught up in a crackdown in Cairo. In 2017, Ahmed Alaa and Abanoub Elias raised the rainbow flag, a symbol of gay pride, at a concert in Cairo given by a band whose lead singer is openly gay. Egyptian media denounced the flag-raising and authorities began arresting LGBT citizens. Alaa spent months in jail. Elias went into hiding. The friends were reunited in Toronto last year with the help of Rainbow Railroad. They have since been granted asylum in Canada.\n\nIn a full-circle moment for Alaa and Elias, Mashrou Leila, the band whose concert sparked the LGBT crackdown in Cairo, was in Toronto to play a show and wanted to meet the Egyptian exiles. Alaa and Elias attended the concert along with other Egyptians who escaped their home country with the help of Rainbow Railroad. When I was in the jail, I know that I will be able to hear this music again, said Alaa. I raise the flag again with Abanoub. It was an amazing moment for me. I can do what I want now. I'm safe.

Roughly 1 in 5 Americans in a live-in relationship keeps a checking, savings or credit card account hidden from their spouse or partner. That adds up to 29 million people whose financial secrets could plague their love lives, according to a CreditCards.com report.\n\nSecret accounts are most common among millennials, 28 percent of whom are currently hiding bank or credit cards from their live-in partners, the study shows.\n\nMore than half of the people surveyed likened keeping financial secrets to physical infidelity, qualifying it as at least equal in severity to physical cheating.\n\nI think it's very damaging from a trust standpoint and also from a dollars and cents standpoint, said CreditCard.com industry analyst Ted Rossman. If a secret account includes credit card debt, that's a meaningful chunk out of the household budget.\n\nBe upfront about separate spending, freedom funds\n\nRossman added there's nothing wrong with couples keeping their finances separate, but it's important to be upfront about it. Communication about money is so important in a relationship, he explained. It's hard enough to reach big financial goals when you're on the same page. It's really almost impossible when you're not on the same page.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, someone might keep a pool of money secret in order to surprise their spouse with a vacation, or anniversary present. On the other end of the spectrum, a husband or wife could be using the secret account to finance an affair. Someone would have a credit card they use to go to hotels, travel, and buy them gifts, Rosman said.\n\nSo-called freedom funds are common, too, among people who aren't sure their relationships will last. They will say, This is mine if this relationship doesn't work out, that's what I will take to try to start over,'  Rossman said.\n\nDigital banking tools vs. the dangers of household mail\n\nSan Francisco financial planner Sarah Behr says financial deception is symptomatic of deeper fissures in a relationship.\n\nYou don't feel like your goals are aligned and either one or both people don't necessarily feel like they can be candid, she said. Being secretive about debt or other issues gets at the core of trust in the same way infidelity can when you find out that someone has been spending a lot without telling you, or created some mess you are both on the hook for.\n\nShe said her first marriage crumbled after her then-husband repeatedly misspent funds — on mountain bikes and fly fishing equipment -- that the couple agreed they would not put towards recreation and leisure. I lost trust in his ability to spend wisely, she said.\n\nDigital banking tools have made it increasingly easy to hide this kind of spending. One thing to watch out for, though, is a partner who intercepts household mail.\n\nSome things are required by law to go snail mail so you would have to get to the mailbox and make sure you cut it off and then suppress everything to paperless billing, Behr said.\n\nCredit checks before wedding bells ring\n\nOther financial advisers suggest credit and background checks of your romantic partner before tying the knot.\n\nIf you are married you would be liable for anything the other person has, including tax debt, credit card debt and student loans, said New York City financial planner Brian Walls. They could rack up credit card debt without the other one knowing. They could do some damage.\n\nThere's no right or wrong way for a couple to manage their finances, but secrecy is corrosive and damaging when it comes to money.\n\nIf someone finds out about their partner's account when they are trusting they are on the same page, it would create a really big rift in that trust going forward if someone is doing stuff behind their back, said Dallas certified financial planner Katie Brewer.\n\nThe best way for a couple to manage their finance is whatever way allows them to stay married, she added.
Plaintiffs and defendants TELL IT TO THE JUDGE at their own risk when they're in Judge Judy's TV courtroom. She sees right through the lies and evasions . . . and she won't hesitate a second in giving them what-for. Rita Braver has a Sunday Profile:\n\nShe's the tough-as-nails terror of daytime TV:\n\nGet a job and pay for your bail!\n\nAre you an idiot or are you just not paying attention?\n\nLet me explain something to you Mr. Grunt: I don't like you.\n\nDo your math . . . use your fingers and toes!\n\nAnd if Judge Judy Sheindlin is talking, you better pay attention:\n\nBraver likened the judge to a drill sergeant: It's 'Look into my eyes. Don't talk when talking, just shape up.'\n\nI think I'm a good fact finder, said Sheindlin. And if you should've brought that piece of evidence and you didn't, that is not my fault. And if you're 22 years old and if I say to you, 'On what day were you arrested?' and you say to me, 'Which time?' that is not a good thing.\n\nJudith Sheindlin does not just play a tough judge on TV. She was a tough judge for 14 years on New York's City's family court.\n\nNo one in her courtroom got away with anything, as 60 Minutes showed in 1993:\n\nIf that's too hard for you, sir, then I'm gonna put you somewhere where you're gonna be in bed at 9 o'clock - that's where your friends are!\n\nYou were no-nonsense, not afraid to speak out, not afraid to challenge the system - the way things had always been done, said Braver.\n\nI knew where people were sleeping in the hallways, you know, instead of doing their job, said Sheindlin. I knew what systems weren't working.\n\nShe was a Brooklyn girl who went to law school, but stopped practicing to stay home with the kids, for a while.\n\nI was going a little crazy. It wasn't satisfying enough, Sheindlin said. Kids would go away to school for several hours, I was watching soap operas. I said, 'This is not what you studied for seven years. Something has to happen in my life before the children go to college.'\n\nA friend said, I have just the right job for you: Come and work for me in family court as a prosecutor.\n\nHer job, Sheindlin says, was one thing that led to the breakup of her first marriage. A few years later, she went to meet some friends for a drink and spotted Jerry Sheindlin:\n\nAnd I looked at him, and I thought he was adorable, she recalled. I still think he is adorable!\n\nWhen asked what he thought when she walked in, Jerry Sheindlin said, 'Now, that is one pretty lady,' and she kept on getting closer and closer.\n\nThey were married, and raised her two and his three children together. They now have 11 grandchildren.\n\nEventually, both Sheindlins became judges - she in family court, he in criminal court.\n\nWhat was it like both being judges? asked Braver. Frankly, that sounds like a TV program.\n\nIt was terrific. I just wished that my objections were sustained more often! Jerry laughed.\n\nVery good dear, very good, said Judy. That was a good one.\n\nWas that a good one?\n\nYeah, one in a row.\n\nTo look at them now, you'd never know that they divorced in 1990. They remarried a year later.
Pope Francis has married a couple of flight attendants on board a flight from Santiago, Chile, to the northern city of Iquique.\n\nCarlos Ciuffardi and Paola Podest had planned to wed on February 27, 2010, but a massive earthquake struck and their church collapsed on their intended wedding day. They eventually had a civil service, but had yet to be formally married in the eyes of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe two LATAM Airlines flight attendants were on the trip from Santiago to Iquique and, as all crew members are given the opportunity to do, went up to the front of the aircraft for a photo with Pope Francis.\n\nWhen the pope asked them if they were married, the couple revealed the story of how the deadly quake had forced them to cancel their wedding. The pontiff asked if they would like him to conduct the ceremony right there on the plane, and they agreed.\n\nA photo released by the Vatican shows Pope Francis marrying LATAM Airlines flight attendants Paula Podest and Carols Ciuffardi during a flight between Santiago and Iquique, Chile, Jan. 18, 2018. Vatican Media\n\nThe pope asked them repeatedly if they were sure, but they didn't waver. Pope Francis blessed the wedding rings the couple have worn since their civil ceremony. The couple, who met when Podest was working as Cuiffardi's boss, now live in Santiago with their two children.\n\nCarlos and Paola Ciuffordi kiss after being married by Pope Francis on board a LATAM Airlines flight between Santiago and Iquique, Chile, Jan. 18, 2018. POOL\n\nWe can't believe the Pope married us, Carlos told members of the media on the flight. A pope has never married anyone on a plane.\n\nWe hope it will promote marriage, the groom added. We have a Vatican document, it's all valid.\n\nThe chairman of LATAM was roped in as an official witness to the wedding, and an accompanying Chilean cardinal drafted the legal document for the marriage by hand.\n\nA handwritten wedding certificate records the marriage of LATAM Airlines flight attendants Carlos and Paula Ciuffordi, conducted by Pope Francis during a flight on Jan. 18, 2018 between Santiago and Iquique, Chile. POOL\n\nPope Francis gave the bride a white rosary and the groom a black one. He asked Ciuffardi if his wife was still the boss, to which Ciuffardi laughed and said yes.\n\nThe Catholic Church leader told the couple. this is what's missing in the world, the sacrament of marriage. I hope this motivates couples to marry.\n\nThe couple said they planned to celebrate in Iquique Thursday night with colleagues, and have a tiny honeymoon, as they were scheduled to fly back to Santiago the following day.
Two weeks after unveiling plans to open a global operations center in Charlotte, North Carolina, that would employ more than 400 people, PayPal says it will instead look elsewhere due to a new state law that blocks anti-discrimination rules for gay and transgender people.\n\nThe legislation enacted by the state invalidates protections of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender citizens and denies these members of our community equal rights under the law, PayPal said in a statement on Tuesday. Becoming an employer in North Carolina, where members of our teams will not have equal rights under the law, is simply untenable.\n\nThe law, approved by the state's Republican-controlled legislature and Gov. Pat McCrory, came in response to a Charlotte City Council ordinance approved in February that would have extended protections to gays and lesbians, as well as bisexual and transgender people, at hotels, restaurants and stores. Charlotte also would have allowed transgender people to use restrooms aligned with their gender identity.\n\nThe law blocked Charlotte's rules and prevented other local governments from approving similar ordinances.\n\nThe online payments company is joining a growing list of companies that oppose the law, with Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), American Airlines (AAL) and Bank of America (BAC), as well as the state's professional basketball team, among those calling for a repeal.\n\nAtlanta's mayor has reportedly banned taxpayer-funded travel to North Carolina over the law, following similar actions by officials in states including New York, Connecticut, Minnesota and Washington.\n\nThere's no doubt there is a well-coordinated, national campaign to smear our state's reputation after we passed a commonsense law to ensure no government can take away our basic expectations of privacy in bathrooms, locker rooms and showers, Josh Ellis, McCrory's communications director said Thursday in a statement.\n\nGovernor McCrory appreciated the opportunity to sit down and deal with these complex issues through conversation and dialogue, as opposed to political threats and economic retaliation, Ellis added of the governor's meeting with LGBT leaders.\n\nThe effort to get North Carolina to rescind the law, signed by McCrory on March 23, came as Mississippi's governor signed a law that lets public and private businesses refuse service to gay couples based on the employers' religious beliefs.\n\nI have signed House Bill 1523. Full statement: pic.twitter.com/00DbgQADFt — Phil Bryant (@PhilBryantMS) April 5, 2016\n\nNathan Deal, Georgia's two-term governor, recently vetoed a bill offering barriers to same-sex marriage after dozens of corporate heavy-hitters urged him to do so.
Art Garfunkel's voice helped shape some of the most famous songs in American music. As half of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, his pipes dominated the pop charts with hits like Bridge Over Troubled Water, Cecilia and Homeward Bound and multiple No. 1 records.\n\nLater he moved onto a successful solo career. The acclaimed singer told CBS This Morning on Tuesday that he never planned to write a book, but after years of jotting down insights in a small notebook he keeps tucked in his back pocket, he decided to put together a memoir.\n\nWhat Is It All but Luminous: Notes from an Underground Man, chronicles his life, career-defining moments and tumultuous relationship with Paul Simon.\n\nI've walked the United States and I've walked across Europe. As I walk, little insights occur to me, some of them are big and I get a notion of a first line and I go, that line has rhythm and it means something to me. It touches the theme I've thought about all my life, Garfunkel said.\n\nGarfunkel's voice helped Simon & Garfunkel earn induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Early on, Garfunkel knew he had a gift and often sang at his temple as a young boy – a place that influenced his style.\n\nIt gave me a spirituality connected to singing right from the earliest age. So you share it with others, Garfunkel said. The temple had a big high ceiling with lovely wood walls so the reverb was wonderful and that became a big thing for me. The echo which puts tails on your notes and extends them, I was entranced with that sound.\n\nAfter Simon & Garfunkel split in 1970, it was his voice that gave him confidence.\n\nI didn't know if the world would accept me, but I knew I could sing without Paul, he said.\n\nHe described the duo's relationship as intense and like a marriage.\n\nIt has summers and winters. It waxes and wanes, it is best not talked about. You leave it alone. Sometimes you get a call from Paul or I from him, and out of nowhere something funny goes on and you laugh and you go, I miss him, and then you hang out, you have a dinner, Garfunkel said. It's standard to be asked, 'Do you think you'll work together?' And I've always said, 'Who knows, life is a surprise.' We don't know what comes next. Nowadays, I say, 'No, we won't.'\n\nAsked what the luminous referenced in his memoir's title means, he said, It's as if you're walking and you are so entranced by the beauty of everything you tear up and in the blurry vision of tearing up, what is it all but luminous? It's a poet's notion.\n\nIn the book, a travelogue of sorts, he described the songs that changed his life, including songs from The Beatles and one of his own.\n\n'Scarborough Fair' felt to me like the best, most flowing, most organic thing we ever recorded.
A pair connected to the historic cases paving the way for the legalization of same-sex marriage five years ago endorsed Joe Biden on Friday. We won that fight for the freedom to marry because of an ally in the White House, Joe Biden, Jim Obergefell and Judith Kasen-Windsor said in a joint statement given to CBS News, calling Biden the LGBTQ community's greatest ally.\n\nObergefell was the plaintiff in the historic 2015 case that made gay marriage legal and Kasen-Windsor is the widow to the plaintiff whose case in 2013 rendered the Defense Against Marriage Act illegal.\n\nBiden was vice president when the Obama White House lit up in rainbow colors to celebrate the 2015 decision. It was Biden's early backing of legalizing gay marriage in 2012 that pushed then-President Obama to eventually come out in support of marriage equality.\n\nHe is the leader our country needs so desperately right now, someone who can bridge the divides that Donald Trump has worked so hard to dredge, Obergefell and Kasen-Windsor wrote.\n\nThe White House is illuminated in rainbow colors after today's historic Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage in Washington June 26, 2015. Gary Cameron/Reuters\n\nObergefell in 2015 was seeking the right to be listed on the death certificate of his late husband, Arthur, as their marriage in Maryland was not recognized in their state of Ohio. His story was one of the marquee elements in the joint case heard before the Supreme Court that year.\n\nKasen-Windsor is the widow of the late Edie Windsor, whose tax case over widower benefits led to the overturning of the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage on the federal level as as between one man and one woman and was overturned by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013. That decision is seen as paving the way for the 2015 Obergefell case.\n\nNow, both their names — and love — are intrinsically connected to the historic push for LGBTQ equality in America.\n\nJoe Biden is a man of empathy, compassion and grace. In governing from these values, he will restore the dignity of the office and our country's standing in the world, the two wrote marking the end of Pride Month, He is a man who realizes that we are not a static society. Our culture is ever changing and we must change with it.\n\nDuring the primary campaign, Biden was commonly thanked for his early support of same-sex marriage. Before the Supreme Court ruling earlier this month that barred workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, Biden was outspoken about the inequities facing LGBTQ employees in the workforce.\n\nIn a new get-out-the-vote initiative for LGBTQ Americans, Biden's campaign hopes they can turn out the estimated 11 million LGBTQ adults to support Biden in key battleground states.
WINDSOR, England -- British designer Clare Waight Keller is the master designer behind the silk boat-necked gown and long veil worn by Meghan Markle as she walked down the flower-bedecked nave of St. George's Chapel for her wedding to Prince Harry. Markle's choice was being closely watched Saturday given how big an impact royal weddings have on what brides everywhere want to wear.\n\nWaight Keller, the first female artistic director of French fashion house Givenchy, met Markle earlier this year, Kensington Palace said. The statement said Markle wanted a dress with an elegant aesthetic, impeccable tailoring, and relaxed demeanor.\n\nMeghan Markle arrives for her wedding to Prince Harry WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nMarkle's choice was a far cry from what she wore for her first wedding to film producer Trevor Engelson: For that beach wedding, in 2011, she sported a simple, strapless white gown adorned with a jeweled belt. Markle and Engelson divorced in 2013.\n\nHarry and Meghan gazed into each other's eyes Saturday at the altar in St. George's Chapel as a soprano sang a work by Handel to celebrate their trans-Atlantic union in front of hundreds of celebrity guests and millions of viewers around the world.\n\nHarry and best man Prince William wore dark formal military dress, with white gloves and the frock coat uniforms of the Blues and Royals. Harry kept his full red beard intact.\n\nAs they stood at the altar, Harry said to Meghan: You look amazing.\n\nArchbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby presided over the ceremony, asking Prince Harry and then Markle to take their marriage vows. They both responded, I will.\n\nCollectively all of those gathered in St. George's Chapel vowed to support the new royal couple, before Welby gave a prayer.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018.

Kim Kardashian West has filed for divorce from her husband, Kanye West, her publicist confirmed to CBS News on Friday. The reality star and the Grammy-winning hip-hop artist had long been rumored to be ending their six-year marriage.\n\nThe two married in a 2014 ceremony in Italy after the birth of their first daughter, North, 7, and went on to have three more children: Saint, 5, Chicago, 3, and Psalm, 1. It was the third marriage for Kardashian, whose first marriage was to producer Damon Thomas and second to basketball player Kris Humphreys, and the first for West.\n\nThe news comes after a tumultuous year for the couple. West, who is 43, announced in July via Twitter what turned out to be a disorganized campaign for the presidency, a move he had been toying with for years. He quickly drew criticism for accepting millions in federal stimulus funding for his clothing and sneaker business, Yeezy.\n\nAfter he made controversial statements at a South Carolina campaign rally and tweeted a series of late-night comments aimed at his wife, Kardashian came forward to discuss his ongoing struggles with bipolar disorder.\n\nKanye West and Kim Kardashian in 2016. Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty\n\nAnyone who has [bipolar disorder] or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how complicated and painful it is to understand, Kardashian wrote on Instagram at the time. I've never spoken publicly about how this has affected us at home because I am very protective of our children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health.\n\nIn September, the 40-year-old Kardashian and her family announced the end of their long-running reality show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the last season of which is set to premiere next month.\n\nKardashian turned to advocacy during the last presidential administration. She lobbied the Trump White House on criminal justice reform and helped win the release of Alice Johnson in 2018, visiting the White House last March to continue her efforts. She has said she is studying to become a lawyer. Her father, Robert Kardashian, was a criminal defense attorney who once represented O.J. Simpson and died in 2003.\n\nThe two have not commented publicly on the split.\n\nLisa Bacon contributed reporting.
PASADENA, Calif. -- Ken Burns and Trent Reznor would seem two unlikely collaborators, but both describe their recent work on the upcoming PBS documentary on the Vietnam War as among the most satisfying of their careers.\n\nReznor, the Nine Inch Nails singer and Academy Award-winning film score composer with partner Atticus Ross, made the score for the 10-part series that debuts this fall.\n\nThey came into the project after Burns' production partner Lynn Novick saw the movie, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Captivated by the film's music, she stayed through the final credits to learn Reznor and Ross were responsible for it, and contacted the composers to see if they'd be interested in working on the Vietnam documentary.\n\nA meeting was set up, and Reznor watched film footage they had gathered to tell about the war that divided Americans in the 1960s.\n\nFor most of the clip, I'm trying not to start crying and wondering what my voice was going to sound like when the lights came up, Reznor recalled on Sunday.\n\nReznor said he initially found the idea of working with Burns' team intimidating; Novick, meanwhile, thought they'd never be able to rope in a pair of in-demand, Oscar-winning composers. But the marriage was made, and 18 months later a dropbox of music arrived in Burns' and Novick's email queues. She downloaded it, took a long drive and popped in the music, and had to pull over to call Burns.\n\nOur minds were collectively blown, she said.\n\nBurns said the music evoked the harshness and divisiveness of the times, yet with a strong underlying melodic sense. Rather than place the music atop already existing scenes -- the way scores generally work -- the documentarian said he was able to build scenes around the music itself.\n\nThe score will work along with a full soundtrack of music from the era, Burns said. The documentary from the team behind The Civil War will unfold over 18 hours.\n\nReznor and Ross won an Oscar for their score of The Social Network. Within the past year, they've been working simultaneously on music for the movie Patriot's Day, the documentary Before the Flood and for a new Nine Inch Nails disc, Reznor said.
Editor's Note: This week on 60 Minutes, Lesley Stahl sits down with Nancy Pelosi. But this isn't the first time they met. In 2006, right before the midterm elections and months before Pelosi made history as the first woman to be elected Speaker of the House of Representatives, she appeared on the broadcast. Below is a transcript of that story, entitled Two Heartbeats Away.\n\nIf the Democrats win a majority of seats in the House of Representatives on November 7th, the next speaker of the House will almost certainly be Nancy Pelosi. She would be the first-ever woman speaker, second in the line of succession, just two heartbeats away from the presidency. The 66-year-old congresswoman from San Francisco has represented one of the most liberal districts in the country for nearly 20 years. Since she was elected Democratic leader of the House four years ago, she's been happy to push other members of Congress to the microphones to speak for the party. But now, she says, her time has come. More front-and-center lately, she has been the point person, for instance, in the party's attacks about the page scandal. She keeps promising that if she becomes speaker, she'd bring civility back to Washington. Just not now.\n\nLesley Stahl: You have called your Republican colleagues...\n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi: Right.\n\nLesley Stahl: These are quotes,immoral, corrupt. You say they're running a criminal enterprise. I mean, you're one of the reasons we have to restore civility in the first place.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well, actually, when I called them those names, I was being gentle. There are much worse things I could have said about them.\n\nOh, really? It's hard to imagine.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: No evidence of honest leadership.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: A failed Republican do-nothing Congress...\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: The arrogance of power of the White House...\n\nHere she is on the president's handling of Katrina.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: The president said he's going to lead the investigation into what went wrong. He need look only in the mirror, for starters.\n\nLesley Stahl: If you're speaker... I'm wondering how you'll work with him. I mean, you--here are some of the things--only some of the things you have called him: an incompetent leader.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Right.\n\nLesley Stahl: You said, In fact, he's not a leader; he's a person with no judgement. Ooh.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: That's right.\n\nLesley Stahl: It even stings to hear it now. I mean, obviously, the two of you are bound to get along just great.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: You know, it--we're professionals. We're professionals. You could go through a long list of things his surrogates have said about me. I know they have to do what they have to do, and they know I have to do what I have to do. And what I have to do is make a distinction in the public that's between the Democrats and the Republicans in order to win. This isn't personal, this is about...\n\nLesley Stahl: It sounds personal.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: This isn't personal.\n\nLesley Stahl: He's incompetent, he's...\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well, I think he is.\n\nLesley Stahl: That's personal.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well...\n\nLesley Stahl: And he has no...\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I'm sorry. That's his problem.\n\nLesley Stahl: How does this raise the level of civility?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well, this is a--well, we're in a political debate here. We didn't come here to have a tea party together and toss a coin to see who would win on an issue. I have very thick skin. I don't care what they say about me.\n\nAnd she needs that thick skin.\n\n(Excerpt of political television ad)\n\nShe's being used for target practice.\n\n(Excerpt of political television ad)\n\nRepublicans, including the president, go after her, saying if she's speaker, it'll mean a weaker military, pampering of terrorists, and higher taxes.\n\nPresident George W. Bush: When we lowered the taxes for families with children, she voted against it. When we put the death tax on the road to extinction, she voted against it. Time and time again, she had an opportunity to show her love for tax cuts, and she voted no.\n\nPelosi doubts the attacks will work, since most Americans have no idea who she is. Besides, at the urging of her colleagues, she has downplayed her pro-abortion rights, anti-gun position since becoming leader, instead promoting more centrist issues, like raising the minimum wage and energy independence.\n\nLesley Stahl: Well, you don't talk about the big liberal issues you used to fight for up here.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I've never walked away from any of my positions. I take pride in them.\n\nLesley Stahl: Gay marriage?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well, that's an issue that is not an issue that we're fighting about here.\n\nOne issue she is fighting about here is Iraq.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Are we safer in America because of this war?\n\nShe opposed the war from the start. And now, like her, most Democrats support a phased withdrawal of troops beginning later this year.\n\nLesley Stahl: Does that not open you up then to that charge of cutting and running? This is just what they're saying.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: The issue is them. The issue is the war that they got us into. If the president wants to say the war in Iraq is part of the war on terror, he's not right.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you not think that the war in Iraq now, today, is the war on terror?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: No. The war on terror is the war in Afghanistan. That is what...\n\nLesley Stahl: But you don't think that the terrorists have moved into Iraq now?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: They have.\n\nLesley Stahl: Well...\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: The jihadists in Iraq. But that doesn't mean we stay there. That means--they'll stay there as long as we're there. They're there because we're there.\n\nLesley Stahl: What do you say to a Republican--I've heard this--that you, meaning the Democrats, but Nancy Pelosi as well, do not understand the serious nature of this threat, of the jihadists?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I, as a mother and a grandmother, 14 years on the intelligence committee, don't tell me I have any underestimation of what the threat is to our country. So if you want to justify your failed policy by saying we don't understand the threat, clearly you didn't understand the situation you got us into.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: You don't just go into a war as a--on a whim.\n\nThe Democrats think Iraqi is a winning issue for them, and so Pelosi fires away as she campaigns for different candidates almost every day. Here she is in Armani in Connecticut.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Win this election. Take the country in a new direction.\n\nHere she is in cowboy boots in Minnesota farm country.\n\nMan: So have you been to Minnesota before?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Oh, many times.\n\nMan: Go ahead and eat.\n\nWhere she had not one pork chop on a stick...\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: This is delicious.\n\nBut two!\n\nLesley Stahl: So this is Tip O'Neill's office?\n\nPelosi's Capitol Hill office is the one once used by Tip O'Neill when he was speaker 20 years ago.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Here's a picture when I was a little girl, when I swore my father in when he became mayor of Baltimore.\n\nNothing prepared her for power more than growing up in Baltimore, the daughter of Tommy D'Alesandro, an old school Democrat. She learned the secrets of political organizing when she used to help keep track of favors owed her father during his 12 years as mayor.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I was pampered in the fact that I had five older brothers, which I highly recommend to anyone.\n\nNancy was the youngest of six children, and the only girl in a strict Catholic family.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I wanted to be independent. And they were always, you know, Oh, you can't do this. You can't do that, telling me all the things I couldn't do.\n\nLesley Stahl: You never rebelled?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: No. I was--I was not.\n\nLesley Stahl: Never?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: It wasn't even an option. This is the '50s.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you ever sneak out?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: Ahh. Nancy Pelosi...\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Don't tell.\n\nLesley Stahl: OK. No telling.\n\nPaul Pelosi: She loves to dance, which she does well. She loves to sing, which she doesn't do well.\n\nAt college, she met her husband, Paul Pelosi, now a wealthy San Francisco investment banker. In fact, she's the eighth richest member of the House. He says he doesn't give his wife advice, except for one thing.\n\nLesley Stahl: You buy her clothes?\n\nPaul Pelosi: Oh. Well, she hates to shop.\n\nLesley Stahl: You pick out her clothes? Wow.\n\nPaul Pelosi: Well...\n\nLesley Stahl: Sort of. Actually.\n\nPaul Pelosi: I have--yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: Yes.\n\nPaul Pelosi says that, for years, a career in politics was the farthest thing from her mind.\n\nPaul Pelosi: It wasn't even on the table. It wasn't even part of the discussion.\n\nLesley Stahl: It was never going to happen?\n\nPaul Pelosi: There was nothing in her personality. It was never going to happen.\n\nLesley Stahl: So what happened?\n\nPaul Pelosi: Well, we end up in San Francisco, we raise our five children, and, when the children were in school all day, then she started doing volunteer stuff.\n\nChristine Pelosi: Five kids born, six years and one week, so between...\n\nLesley Stahl: She was pregnant the whole time.\n\nChristine Pelosi: For most of the '60s, yes.\n\nChristine, the second oldest of four daughters and one son, says her mother was the disciplinarian and drill sergeant in the family then, as she is in Congress now.\n\nChristine Pelosi: So we were always expected to make sure that our homework was done and that we were prepared for what we did. She would always say, Proper preparation prevents poor performance.\n\nLesley Stahl: You had these little slogans that you...\n\nChristine Pelosi: We had these little slogans.\n\nAs the kids got older, Pelosi threw herself into state politics, eventually becoming chairman of the California Democratic Party. She didn't run for Congress till she was 46. And now at 66, as she's poised to go down in the history books, what Nancy Pelosi wants you to know is that, when it comes to her real goal in life, she's just like any other woman her age.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: It's great. It's fabulous. It was my goal in life, and now I've achieved it. I'm a grandmother.\n\nAsk Nancy Pelosi to describe herself, and the first thing out of her mouth is that she's a mother of five...\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: The category is The Flintstones.\n\n...and a grandmother of five.\n\nLesley Stahl: When I asked your daughter Christine how you rule, she said you were motherly.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I guess it depends on your definition of motherly. If motherly means we're going to have order in the house, yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: That's motherly.\n\nWell, she's certainly brought order to the Democrats. She has insisted on no more bickering in public and just saying no to nearly everything that comes out of the Bush White House. In other words, party discipline, kind of like the Republicans do it. As a result, Democrats now vote together more often than they have since Eisenhower was president. How has someone so clearly not one of the boys managed to keep them in line? Well, one way is money.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well, here we are again...\n\nRepresentative Charles Rangel: Take my names off the checks. Just give it to her.\n\nShe has personally raised more than $100 million, second only to Bill and Hillary Clinton, which she dispenses generously to her colleagues. Another way she rules is through good, old-fashioned hardball.\n\nLesley Stahl: People say Nancy Pelosi is tough as nails.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I'm very strong. I don't know tough, but...\n\nLesley Stahl: Every time I ask you about it, you retreat into, Oh, no, I'm a mother, I'm a grandmother.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: No.\n\nLesley Stahl: You are tough. You have to--I mean, it goes without saying.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I'm tough.\n\nLesley Stahl: You got there. You did it.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well, I heard somebody say the other day, when they said, You should see how tough she was on a certain subject. And one of my other colleagues said, You have no idea.\n\nOne thing she does is threaten to deny plum assignments to members who vote with the Republicans. But by keeping her troops in lockstep, her critics say she has worsened the gridlock and partisan bitterness in Congress.\n\nLesley Stahl: What's this meeting about?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Now, this meeting is our Democratic caucus. This is our last huddle.\n\nPelosi took us to the last election strategy session House Democrats held before they went off to campaign.\n\nMan: Our leader, Nancy Pelosi.\n\nThe mood was buoyant, with credit going to Pelosi for bringing them so close to retaking the House with her strategy of not letting one Republican attack go unanswered.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: So let's hear it for the Democrats! Are we ready to win?\n\nWith just 16 days to the election...\n\nWoman: Ladies and gentlemen, the next speaker and first madam speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.\n\n...Nancy Pelosi, who already made history once when she became minority leader, thinks she's about to do it again.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well, you have to understand, breaking the--here we call it the marble ceiling. This makes glass look like nothing. This is a marble ceiling.\n\nLesley Stahl: Right.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Democrats are going to...\n\nAnd breaking it, she says, would help all women.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Onward!\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: I believe if I become speaker of the House and, in that highly visible role, show the American people that women know how to use power, that I think it helps all women in the political process or whatever field they're in, but I think it will be a plus.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: This is it.\n\nShe has pledged that as speaker she would give the Republicans rights they've denied the Democrats, like allowing them to introduce amendments to bills. But she may have trouble reining in the Democrats' appetite for revenge. There's already been talk of multiple investigations and impeachment of the president.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: No, impeachment is off the table.\n\nLesley Stahl: Off the table. And that's a pledge?\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Well, it's a pledge in the--yes, I mean, it's a pledge. Of course it is. It is not--it is a waste of time.\n\nLesley Stahl: So that's completely off the table.\n\nRep. Nancy Pelosi: Wouldn't they just love it if we came in and our record as Democrats coming forth in 12 years is to talk about George Bush and Dick Cheney? This election is about them. This is a referendum on them. Making them lame ducks is good enough for me.
In this episode of Intelligence Matters, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and senior Obama administration official Samantha Power speaks with host Michael Morell about a wide range of topics, including how the promotion of human rights bolsters global stability. Power and Morell discuss the value of public service and the importance of the rule of law. They also review some of the key foreign policy decisions made by the Obama administration. Power shares anecdotes from her latest book, The Education of an Idealist: A Memoir.\n\nDownload, rate and subscribe here: iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher.\n\nINTERVIEW WITH SAMANTHA POWER\n\nCORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL\n\nPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSamantha, welcome to Intelligence Matters. I'm very glad you could join us.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nThank you, Mike.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhen we served together in the Obama administration, Samantha, I found you to be a remarkable person, authentic, principled, passionate, honest, reflective. And I could actually go on and on. And now that I've read your book, I know why.\n\nYour book, The Education of an Idealist, is not only all of those adjectives that I just mentioned, but it's also extraordinarily well written. It's lyrical. The words grab you and they don't let you go. It's tough to put down. So all of that to say\n\ncongratulations. And I really hope my listeners go to the book store or go online and buy it and read it. Because it really is a remarkable book.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nThank you so much, Michael. That means the world to me. Thank you.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSamantha, maybe the place to start is to ask you to define what you mean by an idealist in the context of the book, in the context of yourself.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nI think my definition is pretty broad. First let me say what it doesn't mean. I think it doesn't mean looking at the world through rose-colored glasses. It doesn't mean utopianism or believing there is some absolute perfection available to us given that we are mere mortals and humans.\n\nBut what it does mean is that the world is in need of repair and reform and\n\nimprovement. And that in order for any of that improvement to occur, human beings who are part of the world need to show agency and take risks and make themselves vulnerable to failure for starters in order to try to bring about the improvements that we know are needed: less cruelty, more decency and kindness. And so it's really a combination of just not being that happy with the world as it is, and then taking that second step of believing that there's something we can do about it.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd would you say, and I assume the answer is yes, that that's always the condition, that the world can always be made a better place? And you never get to some end point where you can stop?\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nI think that it's hard to imagine a world of equal education for all and end of hate and intolerance, or an end of injustice. I think\n\nit's our lodestar. Our compass should take us in that direction so we should never lose sight of what equality and full respect for people's rights and peace on Earth, what that would look like.\n\nBut I guess I start as somebody who started my life in Ireland where The Troubles were roiling the country and there was a great sectarian division. I then later in life was a war correspondent. So I saw carnage and the perpetration of atrocities up close.\n\nSo I start with a set of dark assumptions I think about the inability to perfect the human condition. But definitely alongside seeing some pretty unappealing things, I've seen so much good done, so many people standing up for what they believe in and making a difference that I think the space I inhabit is more as Obama I think began to say toward the end of presidency, Better is good. And better is often a hell of lot harder than worse. And so I guess I'm\n\ndedicated to not making the best the enemy of the good.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo as an idealist, Samantha, do you feel lonely today? And maybe another way of putting that is, How do you assess the state of idealism today?\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nBecause the term is so fungible and means a lot of things to a lot of people, I want to just stipulate that I think many, many people who go into public service who aren't human rights lawyers like me or aren't motivated principally by humanitarian issues, might be motivated by more traditional conceptions of U.S. national security, preventing nuclear proliferation.\n\nI believe individuals like that, soldiers who serve our country abroad, our diplomats who represent us and with our soldiers are trying to keep our country safe, our intelligence officers, I think they're all\n\nidealists. They're all trying to enhance U.S. security, look out for the welfare of the American people.\n\nAnd so there are a lot of idealists still serving in our institutions, whether our domestic agencies or those institutions that are dedicated to promoting our security. And then there are a growing community of people outside government who are activating like never before in response to what they see as very serious slippage in terms of our values and our ideals.\n\nAnd so whether it's people fighting within to maintain an integrity to our national security process or as we've seen in the whole Ukraine military assistance scandal, individuals who believe that standing up to Russian aggression remains in our interest, believe that following the law and the legislation that Congress passed is what is required by being a public servant.\n\nWhether it's those individuals or crack journalists on the outside, people who have now just in recent days decided they're going to run for office for the first time because they don't like what they see, whether in Washington or in their local communities. I think that there's been a really healthy counter-reaction to the perception that the elected leaders are not delivering the kind of integrity or sense of purpose and principle that a lot of Americans I think pine for.\n\nSo I guess the shorter answer to your question, Michael, is I feel conflicted. I feel crushed on a daily basis by some of the policies that are being pursued, wasting four years on an issue as dangerous as climate change, blowing the Iran nuclear deal without any conception of how you're going to replace it.\n\nBelieving in a lot of places in punishment for punishment's sake rather than any kind\n\nof theory of the case as to how you're going to actually advance our security. Betraying people who fought alongside our service men and women in northern Syria in order to end ISIS caliphate. Walking away from those partnerships and both the cruelty of that and the coldness of that, but also the lasting legacy of that for our foreign policy and our ability to make such partnerships in the future.\n\nAll of that is terribly dispiriting. But then you just see so many people standing up and just saying, This is not the way it should be. And sometimes it takes a crisis to draw people into the enterprise of governance and of politics and of service. And maybe that's the moment we're in.\n\nI think the verdict is out as to which of these forces are going to prevail. But I must say that the pride that I felt and also the gratification I felt seeing intelligence officials, civil servants, foreign service\n\nofficers testifying under oath, telling the truth, speaking up for a set of values and principles that I had thought until recently were enduring.\n\nAnd I do believe will be seen to be enduring over time. But also imagining all those faceless individuals who weren't testifying, but how they felt to see themselves in their community and the integrity of the enterprise embodied in those individuals who now have become more known in ways they never wanted to be known.\n\nSo I think that also offers the American public a glimpse into the world that you know so well, that I had a taste of for just eight years but became so impressed by. And the more exposures we give, again, I keep using the word integrity, but without sounding corny, the kind of purity of conceptions of service I think that motivate people every day.\n\nI think the more we lift the veil on that. That's why I wrote the book in the way that I did. I think that's why you wrote your book is to open up that world and make it attractive. Make it not just the sum of the sound bites.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDraw others to it.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nYeah, and draw people into that cause.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Samantha, maybe we can get to the education piece of the idealist in question here, which is you. I need to ask you two questions about that. And the first is your mom and her story and how that impacted you.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nMy mother grew up in County Cork in Ireland, one of five sisters. She grew up wanting to do two things, number one, one day become a medical doctor. She always just knew that that's what she wanted in her heart of\n\nhearts. And the other thing she wanted to do pretty much every day of her life to this day, she's now 76, is hit a ball, some kind of ball.\n\nWhether it was a tennis ball, a golf ball, a squash ball, a racquet ball, a field hockey ball. She was an amazing athlete. And she grew up in this family and was deterred. She was the first female member of her family. She had a brother as well. She was the first to go to college.\n\nAnd when she went to college, again, she wanted to be a doctor. But her own sister said, That's so self-indulgent. It'll cost so much money, this, that. So she was deterred. And it was probably the only time in her life that I know of any way where someone was able to talk her out of something she wanted.\n\nSo she went and got a basic science degree, went on to get a Ph.D. in biochemistry in\n\nLondon. She had to leave Ireland really to be able to do that. Because girls, young women, weren't really encouraged in the sciences in those days. And she still just wanted to be a doctor.\n\nAnd so in what was then a later stage of life, in her mid-20s, it sounds like a kid to me but, she went back to medical school and ended up becoming an MD. To this day is a kidney doctor at Mount Sinai in New York. She married my father, gave birth to me, and somehow managed the juggle of finishing her Ph.D., the dissertation part of her Ph.D., and attending classes for medical school, and being the top squash player in Ireland, and continuing to play field hockey.\n\nShe's an amazing juggler. But her marriage to my dad frayed. He was a big drinker. And he began I think almost to live vicariously through her achievements. And he began to spend and more and more time in the pub. Tensions intensified. And eventually she\n\ndecided she wanted to split with him and be with another Irishman, a doctor, also a kidney doctor.\n\nAnd in Ireland in those days, Michael, there was no divorce. It's a relatively recent addition to the law books. And she didn't really have an option for being with the man she wanted to be with, leaving my dad, separating in a kind of clean way. So she decided to emigrate to America and fought within the Irish court system at a time where the Catholic church was supreme, super influential.\n\nAmazingly, partly because of my dad's drinking, she won custody of my brother and me to bring us to America. Under the terms by which I would continue to be raised as a good Irish Catholic. I would be home schooled in Irish, which she would have to do, not her favorite. And thirdly, of course, that I would go and see my dad during all of the holidays.\n\nBut to imagine her setting off on that airplane in 1979. I was nine, my younger brother was five. The responsibility she must have felt, the rupture in, again, a Catholic family to be making a break like that. The guilt which Catholics do very well, but also a sense of adventure I suppose in starting this new life with this new person who has been in my life ever since, Eddie Burke, my stepfather.\n\nShe's an amazing woman, a real trailblazer, and always left in me the sense that if you can dream it, you should at least try to do it. It doesn't mean it'll work. But put yourself out there. And if you put yourself out there enough times, good things will happen.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Samantha, you're an immigrant. And so what's going on in our country with regard to how we view immigrants must have special meaning for you.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nIt does. As an Irish immigrant, I have been extremely fortunate. I experienced as a kid nothing other than a warm welcome in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, initially. And then I went to high school in Atlanta, Georgia. The climate that immigrants and refugees are being greeted with today, depending I think on their religion or where they come from, is totally different than what I experienced.\n\nBut I think one of the things that I often think about is, wow, in 1979 when my mother was trying to bring my younger brother and me here to this country, if the mere fact that someone had carried out a terrorist act in my homeland meant that my whole religion was branded or meant that my country was somehow put on a visa ban or a travel ban list, I wouldn't have come here.\n\nIf we practiced collective guilt or guilt by association in that way where we lump\n\nindividuals together on the basis of some immutable characteristic that they can't control, that would have abetted all kinds of injustice. And it would have deprived this country of many individuals who've made tremendous contributions to the sciences, to our communities. Even our athletic fields have been sprinkled with people who've come from--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRecently.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\n--all over the world. Yeah, people used to say the San Antonio Spurs were like the United Nations of NBA teams for example. But whatever field you consider, and of course as you know, Michael, the national security community, and as we saw even as these officials in these recent days were testifying on the Ukraine matter.\n\nFiona Hill from Scotland, Masha Yovanovitch, an immigrant, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, an\n\nimmigrant. These people who at the first occasion they have to pay back their country, they choose to go into public service. We just see that throughout the infrastructure of our country, whether at the local, state, or federal level.\n\nAnd so it's heartbreaking. And it's completely counter-productive from the standpoint of again our communities, our economies. Not far from where I grew up in Georgia, there's a town, Clarkston, which when I lived in Atlanta, I never would have dreamed would become known as the Ellis Island of the South. It's a little town that has been completely rejuvenated by immigration and very specifically by the inflow of refugees. I think 40 languages are now spoken in little--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWow.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\n--Clarkston, Georgia. And that community is\n\nat the forefront, as is Buffalo, New York, and other places that had not been doing well really in recent years economically, but now have come to rely on this influx of energy and innovation. Think about particularly refugees, what it means to be a refugee, what it took for any refugee to make their way to the United States.\n\nThe resilience, the determination, the drive, this is why the CEO of Chobani who's himself a Turkish immigrant, he very early on as part of his business model realized that if he could find immigrants and refugees in the community, then this wasn't charity from his standpoint.\n\nHe just saw how they worked on the assembly lines and in the board room. Just again, the energy often motivated not only by the desire to feed their young families and to provide for their immediate families here in the United States who might have come then, but often tending to the needs of dozens of\n\nmembers of their extended family back home in refugee camps or who are struggling elsewhere to make ends meet. And so this redefinition of what America is I think will do all of us a great disservice if it persists.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSamantha, the second piece of the education that I'd love for you talk about, and you mentioned it once already, is your time as a journalist reporting from places like Bosnia, East Timor, Kosovo, Rwanda, Sudan, all of the vacation spots, right. How did those assignments impact you?\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nI think they left me with a bias toward getting close, getting out there to talk to individuals who've been affected by conflict or who've been affected by foreign policy choices that are made in dark, window-less rooms 3,000 miles away or 5,000 miles away.\n\nJust to really think in terms of the human\n\neffects of decision-making. I think also by virtue of being a journalist, early on I began to ask myself the question, Am I doing a good enough job bridging the gaps, bridging the distances between the people I'm interviewing, let's say somebody who survived a rape camp or somebody who is living under occupation?\n\nAs I hear their experiences, am I doing a good enough job remembering that if they're lucky, my readers will not have had experiences like this. So what is it that the individuals that I'm interviewing and whose travails I'm myself reacting very strongly to and feel are very powerful to hear?\n\nAm I conveying their experiences in a manner to which other people with very, very different life backgrounds and experiences are going to be able to relate? And if I'm not, I'd better go back to the drawing board because it's the universals that are going\n\nto pull us together, that are going to trigger empathy and maybe even action.\n\nAnd so that task, when I look back at our years in the Obama administration, I ask myself could I have done more of that bridging. Some of what we were doing that I think was doing significant good in the world is not to this day really all that well understood.\n\nAnd I think the question of how you bridge different worlds. Again as a war correspondent it was a world of war with a more peaceful world. But in general as we seek to create an enduring, or to grow an enduring constituency for U.S. leadership in the world or for international engagement, we really need to find a way to translate what you and I may know to be in our interests or in the common good, but which may not look that way to somebody who's focused on their next paycheck or whether their health insurance premium is going to\n\ngo up.\n\nAnd so I think at least an intentionality and attention to those large, large gaps in life experiences that can make translation challenging. I think that's something I'm left with as well.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Samantha, you become a member of President Obama's national security team, a senior director on the National Security Council staff. Tell me what was it like for an idealist to walk into what is typically a very pragmatic environment.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nI think the biggest challenge is to break down a sense that there's that dichotomy. And I don't know that I succeeded. On a good day, maybe every now and then I'd have a good day and would succeed. But I think there's no question, as you and I've both experienced, that there are at times trade-offs between, for example, the need to\n\nconfront a terrorist threat that is brewing and the recognition that the more that a government that we are partnering with is abusing human rights, the more likely they are fueling long-term threats and even long-term extremism.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSure.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nBut yet, that doesn't necessarily help you on the Monday that you have to make the decision about whether to partner with that military. And so I don't want to pretend that those trade-offs weren't real or that they didn't confront me. I certainly knew that they were coming.\n\nBut I think the point that I would just come back to again and again was the linkage. And I do think that this is something that President Obama agreed with and that the people he chose around him by and large embraced, even if it was often in a crisis\n\nsituation sometimes hard to bring to the fore.\n\nBut you don't just respond to an Ebola epidemic in West Africa because you don't want to see three countries in West Africa suffering unimaginable pain and the loss of hundreds of thousands of people. You definitely don't want that. But you also lead a coalition and get dozens and dozens of countries at the UN to be part of that coalition to tend to that crisis because you don't want Ebola getting on an airplane and coming into American cities or European cities.\n\nAnd you don't just push the Iraqi government to be more inclusive. And in the wake of again the previous regime change and the end of Saddam Hussein's regime, there was a major effort to de-Ba'ath-ify, to get rid of individuals who'd been part of that regime.\n\nAnd it ended up sweeping up many, many\n\nmillions really of Sunni citizens where they too felt disenfranchised and discriminated against in part again after years and years of resentment by Shia feeling as if they never had a chance and had suffered unimaginable repression.\n\nBut you don't engage the Iraqi government about the need to be more inclusive because just in the universal declaration of human rights or because it's a nice way to be. You do it because you recognize that exclusionary governance is inherently destabilizing. And certainly now, Michael I think you'd agree, we look back and see the rise of ISIS as very linked to--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\n--Iraqi governance--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\n--and the human rights abuses carried out. And certainly we knew at the time the Syrian atrocities and our inability to figure out how to mitigate them. And so what I'm saying is kind of conventional wisdom at an abstract level. But it's hard in those meetings.\n\nAnd I found it hard to get that long-term recognition of the integration to break through that more ingrained sense that human rights are not a luxury. The promotion of human rights, even if it's incremental, over time is going to be indispensable to the more stable world that we seek and that we need.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSamantha, I want to ask you a question that I bet you have not been asked on your book tour.\n\nCIA is not particularly popular with the human rights crowd for some good historical reasons I think. And I'm kind of interested\n\nin what your view of the CIA was going in to government and what's your view of it coming out.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nIt's hard to flash back to my pre-government self. I guess I was a student of cold war coups, covert operations. I was somebody who, while I was in college, went back and read some of the really important reports from the 1970s, the Church Committee report and the kind of after-action of operations that went too far. Assassination operations and--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nFrom their moment of conception went too far.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nFrom the moment of conception, exactly. Although my not being in any way a scholar of the intelligence community, my emphasis would have been on some of what happened in Latin America and so forth. And so I would h\n\nave known that history. I think also then remember when we, the Obama political appointees, came in in early 2009.\n\nIt was in the wake of black sites and rendition and so all of that I suppose very much would have colored my understanding of what the CIA was doing. Then you come into government. I think one of the most amazing perks of being in the positions that I was in, first as the president's human rights and multi-lateral affairs advisor, and then as UN ambassador, was my briefer.\n\nIt was just having a briefer, whether it was a daily briefer or a weekly briefer. And just for your listeners who may never have this incredible experience, it's just somebody who tries to curate all of what we know about is happening pretty much everywhere in the world gleaned from our intelligence sources, gleaned from open sources, gleaned from all of our intelligence agencies in the various ways in\n\nwhich they collect.\n\nAnd then you have an individual who I assume is him or herself representing a team of individuals who are just there to staff you and to try to help you basically develop the latest understanding of conditions in countries that in many cases aren't making the newspaper.\n\nEspecially as foreign bureaus close, the importance of our intelligence community is even greater. You don't even have news sources in so many parts of the world now, at least that you feel you can trust. And so that was my first experience, Who are these people? Why are they being so nice to me? Don't they have jobs to do? Why are they spending so much thinking about me and what I'm interested in?\n\nAnd then you realize this sense of team and this sense of higher purpose that I talked about earlier and that your career of course\n\nembodied. And what they are trying to do is to ensure that people who are in a position to make policy decisions have at their disposal the best possible situational awareness in order to inform those decisions.\n\nAnd I must say after all of the sort of after-actions about the run up to the invasion of Iraq, the intelligence community that I got to know was one that was hyper sensitive about avoiding policy judgments putting a thumb on the scale in any way that would be seen to be political.\n\nAnd I don't know what it was like before. Because I wasn't in those rooms before. But just bending over backwards to just make sure that what they were conveying was independent judgments unmediated by a sense of what the boss wants to hear, but really rooted in a belief that their job was to provide what the boss needed to hear, which are two very different things sometimes.\n\nAnd so of course, President Obama moved to redress many of the issues, not only in the CIA but also in the military and elsewhere that I had found very problematic on the outside. And so I became very, very dependent on this community of professionals. And I'm left with a great respect for what goes on behind the curtain while also I think people like you and John Brennan and Jim Clapper and others that I worked with in the intelligence community probably have the same view.\n\nBut we have learned painfully through our history how easy it is to slip and how important it is to have checks and balances on all of our institutions. And how really the rule of law and not a politicized conception of the rule of law or a fluctuating conception of the rule of law. But some pretty hard and fast principles, that those principles need to be the ballast or the foundation for the work that goes on\n\non behalf of national security.\n\nBecause when it's national security, especially the temptation, because the immediacy of threats is so real and because the dedication to keeping our citizens safe is so consuming, I think it's precisely in those circumstances that those checks and balances and those constraints become all the more important.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Samantha, maybe to finish up here, let me ask you about two issues that occurred on President Obama's watch. One where I think we did put human rights, human dignity high on the agenda and one where quite frankly I don't think we did. And I'd love you to talk about these two from that perspective. The first one is Libya, and the second one is Syria. How do you think about those two in the context of what we're talking about here?\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nI actually am not sure that I would embrace the premise in the sense that, and maybe I'll just go in a round-about way to answering your question and come back to Libya. But on Syria, I don't think that one can say that it was an insufficient attention to human consequences that led us where we went or where we didn't go.\n\nMy feeling, and I write about this in the book, is that Obama, if I had to guess, and this isn't something that he's confided in me. But if I had to guess, he probably had more sleepless nights about the torture going on in Syrian prisons that the Caesar Photos revealed.\n\nThe chemical attacks, not just the high profile chemical attack in August 2013, but other attacks. The use of bunker-busting bombs, incendiary weapons. I think nothing made him feel less empowered in a funny way than Syria and very specifically the devastation being wrought on the ground.\n\nI think that's one reason, you witnessed this I'm sure, that he was often very testy with me on Syria when I would raise something that was happening. At one point, We all read your book Samantha. You don't have to remind me that this is a human catastrophe.\n\nAnd I really do think that that's something he carried with him and carries with him. I'm not using that as an alibi for policy. But I don't think it was that human rights didn't matter enough. I think a combination of the invasion of Iraq and all that followed. And the loss of faith that even when you're maximizing your deployments, putting hundreds of thousands of American lives at risk in pursuit of a policy goal in such a messy and sectarian neighborhood, you barely make a dent.\n\nAnd remember, it wasn't just how badly the Iraq war went on a lot of different\n\ndimensions. But it's also the Syria crisis is happening and indeed helps fuel the grow of ISIS. So just the time we are managing Syria or Obama is seeking to manage Syria, U.S. forces are being pulled back into Iraq having finally been withdrawn.\n\nAnd so there's just a sense of, Ugh. We finally did in the end leave Iraq in a stable enough place where we felt like we could draw our troops down. And that you could make the case that there was a stability and there were elections and that people had the chance to build their own destiny.\n\nAnd I think from the standpoint of the president, almost no sooner do you leave than another threat of cataclysmic proportions takes hold and U.S. forces are drawn back in. And just sort of a sense that we had, whether the most robust version of the tool as you'd seen in Iraq or some of the less robust tools.\n\nBut that still would have required using military force in a very aggressive way, namely the kinds of things that I would have been recommending like a no-fly zone or civilian protected areas. None of those were without very substantial risk. And so I think there is a difference between actually coming together and saying, Hundreds of thousands people are dying.\n\nTeam, present me with options for how I can fix this or how I can mitigate this. Seeing that you've done all the diplomatic, economic, and other things that you normally would do in such a circumstance, and unfortunately largely because of Russia's veto on the security council, and thus the fact that none of those sanctions or diplomatic actions are enforced comprehensively.\n\nThere are coalitions of the willing, economic sanctions. And so thus they don't\n\nhave the kind of biting effect where they could have actually over time changed the Assad regime's calculus. He feels he used every tool in the toolbox short of bombing the Assad regime.\n\nAnd he comes to that precipice and says, I see the loss of life. I am not convinced that if I do this, I'm going to mitigate the suffering. I do think that I will incur other risks, especially at a time when the American public and the Congress and others want no part of this.\n\nSo the calculus there I think was more along those lines. I would argue, as you might remember, that we need to do a better job, not of comparing the current circumstance in Syria with the risk of a no-fly zone or whatever. But rather we need to extrapolate what are the long-term costs of Syria. What is that going to mean against that risk?\n\nAnd then if we had internalized those\n\nlonger-term consequences, maybe the cost benefit calculus would have cut for him in another direction. But again, when I went at the UN on his behest to build an international coalition to use limited military force in response to the chemical weapons attack of August 2013, you remember how many countries volunteered to be by our side.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nTwo, initially, the U.K. and France. And we were left with one after the U.K. bailed. And you remember what happened with Congress when we went to Congress to see if they supported.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThey bailed too.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nExactly. And so that's that. On Libya, that's a particularly challenging one to lo\n\nok back on retrospectively. But you're absolutely right. You hear a lot of conspiracy theories about, Oh, Obama went into Libya because of the oil. And it was only that that caused. No, you remember those meetings. I don't think anybody--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight. I don't think oil--\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\n--mentioned the oil.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n--ever came up.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nI don't it, at least in any meeting I was in, ever came up. And what you had was the world, at least by 21st century standards, united. You had a security council prepare to authorize a civilian protection mission. Russia knew full well what it was walking into. There's a lot of revisionism there as well where Putin is acting like he wasn't part of that choice.\n\nYou think Medvedev is going to anything without Vladimir Putin's hall pass? Not in this lifetime. And Russia was a part of it. The Arab League asked for it. Libya's own ambassador to the UN defected, turned to the member states of the UN and begged for the lives of his countrymen to be elevated and for the security council to take the action that it took.\n\nSo the challenge there is that the very Libyans who wanted help preventing Gaddafi from carrying out a large massacre in Benghazi and from reclaiming some of the other cities that were under opposition control, those same Libyans after the Gaddafi regime was dislodged didn't want any international security presence in Libya.\n\nThey wanted to manage their affairs themselves. It was the first time many of them had any occasion to be part of governing the country. And so there's a lot of talk of, Did we plan properly? You\n\nremember the planning processes. We had plan after plan.\n\nSomebody will FOIA, use the Freedom of Information Act, to get ahold of all of our Libya plans. There were so many plans. But in the end the Libyan authorities and even the Libyan factions, really one of the few things they all could agree on was no--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThey didn't want --\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\n--international security help. And so that's not an alibi again for us. The consequences of Libya's implosion are being felt by Libyans, by others in the region. It's immensely destabilizing today. But I personally don't look back and see a scenario once the revolution has started and the denial of human rights.\n\nThis is another example. We should learn from the Arab Spring that we have an interest in evolution and not revolution.\n\nThat incremental change and reform and respect for human rights and again political governance that is inclusive, those are in America's interest. We can all agree that upheavals of the kind that knock out institutions are very, very disruptive and dangerous. But when you deny people's rights for so long, revolution is often what follows.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe author is Samantha Power. The book is The Education of An Idealist. Sam, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nSAMANTHA POWER:\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *
Imagine your teenage daughter was kidnapped while studying for her exams at school. And not just your daughter, but hundreds of girls in your town taken in the night. The families of Chibok, Nigeria lived through that nightmare almost five years ago when the Islamic terrorist group Boko Haram - whose name roughly translates to western education is forbidden - attacked a local school and ran off with 276 girls. Some escaped, but it took the Nigerian government three years to negotiate the release of fewer than half of them.\n\nSince their release, the Chibok girls, as they're known, have been largely hidden from the public. But we were able to meet with them at a kind of prep school to hear their remarkable story of survival.\n\nThe girls in captivity\n\nThis is a hostage video released by Boko Haram from their hide-out in the Sambisa Forest, one month after the kidnapping.\n\nThe Chibok girls are all covered, chanting verses from the Quran.\n\nThey were facing a life of misery with beatings and starvation.\n\nBut now at the New Foundation School on the campus of the American University of Nigeria, the girls are singing again.\n\nThis time it's the Christian songs they grew up with.\n\nRebecca: We are the Chibok girls that have been in captivities and now we are alive.\n\nGetting out alive and singing hymns, things Rebecca feared might never happen.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did they let you sing when you were in captivity?\n\nRebecca: No. We are singing in private—\n\nLesley Stahl: Private.\n\nRebecca: They won't allow us to sing like that.\n\nLesley Stahl: So you had to whisper sing?\n\nRebecca: Yes.\n\nFor Rebecca and her friends, just singing out loud today is a gift, after their three years of living in fear and pressure to become Muslims.\n\nLesley Stahl: So if you didn't convert to Islam, were you punished for not converting?\n\nRebecca\n\nRebecca: Yes, they say if you didn't convert to Islam you wouldn't get home alive. That's what they say.\n\nHere are some of the girls two years ago right after they were released, alive but looking like concentration camp survivors, haunted and numb. This is Rebecca, skin and bones.\n\nLesley Stahl: I heard you were eating grass.\n\nRebecca: Yeah. Some of us eat that. And we are just be patient and live like that. No food. No anything.\n\nLook at them today, in their 20s. They're healthy and full of spirit at a school created just for them, paid for by the Nigerian government and some donors, where they are making up for lost time.\n\nThey're from Northern Nigeria, where life can be hard and opportunities for women are limited. Now, in their Wi-Fi-equipped dorms, they have smart phones, and lap tops and their own beds.\n\nThey go back to Chibok to see their parents twice a year; over Christmas and during the summer.\n\nOtherwise, they work hard here, going to class six days a week, studying subjects like biology and math. Working toward getting into the university, which would for them be free of charge.\n\nMost of the girls we spoke to were shy. And reticent as they told us that their tight bond, going back to Chibok, helped them survive. When Grace's leg was injured the night of the kidnapping, her sisters, as she calls them, Ayesha and Maryam and others pulled her through.\n\nGrace: They are taking care of me. They are fetching water. They are washing me, my clothes, and everything.\n\nAyeisha: We are worried about her leg. We don't have anybody there that will take care of her. Only us.\n\nLesley Stahl: You helped each other, sick, or unhappy, or scared, you were a unit.\n\nAyeisha: Yes.\n\nSomiari Demm: They just had an unbelievable bond, and an attachment to each other.\n\nSomiari Demm is the girls' therapist, on call 24/7. Born in Nigeria, raised and educated in the states, she has been with this group since they arrived over a year ago.\n\nLesley Stahl: Can you tell us what their experiences were like generally?\n\nSomiari Demm: Just a lot of the stuff, the starvation…\n\nLesley Stahl: They ate grass.\n\nSomiari Demm: Eating grass, exactly, the beatings,-- being forced to get married. At some point in time, you know, the bomb, the air strikes. So these are some of things that were reoccurring events.\n\nLesley Stahl: For three years.\n\nSomiari Demm: For three years. Yeah.\n\nSomiari Demm puts her arm around a student\n\nLesley Stahl: You were actually hit.\n\nThe air strikes started as the Nigerian government pursued and attacked Boko Haram.\n\nLesley Stahl: A bomb dropped where you were being held.\n\nRebecca: They mistakenly throw the bomb.\n\nLesley Stahl: And you were injured?\n\nRebecca: With some particles.\n\nLesley Stahl: Shrapnel?\n\nRebecca: Yeah and it's still inside my body. It has not been removed.\n\nBecause the shrapnel is in her liver, she's in pain. But she perserveres at school.\n\nLesley Stahl: You were kidnapped because you went to school. Now you're back in school. Do you feel like you're doing something courageous?\n\nRebecca: Even what happened with me will not stop me doing what I already desire in my mind.\n\nReginald Braggs, an American, has also been at the New Foundation School since its start.\n\nA former naval officer turned college administrator, Braggs runs the school and designed the educational program.\n\nReginald Braggs\n\nLesley Stahl: What is the biggest challenge for you in this program?\n\nReginald Braggs: You know, it really is trying to help the students to meet their goal of getting into the university. And part of that challenge is their English language proficiency. So I had this idea, I said let's do an old-fashioned, American spelling bee with these guys.\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Orange\n\nGIRL: O-R-A-N-G-E\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Correct! (cheers)\n\nSometimes one of them struggles, over even an easy word like poor...\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Poor\n\nGIRL: P-U-T\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Wrong! (whistle)\n\n...and is embarrassed. But when someone like rebecca gets a hard word right…\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Assembly\n\nRebecca: A-S-S-E-M-B-L-Y\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Correct! (cheers)\n\n...a roar goes up.\n\nReginald Braggs: It's amazing how their confidence grows after this.\n\nLesley Stahl: You've seen a progression.\n\nReginald Braggs: Oh absolutely, absolutely.\n\nLesley Stahl: But do you think there's a lot of pressure on them in the spelling bee?\n\nReginald Braggs: Yes, of course.\n\nLesley Stahl: That's okay?\n\nReginald Braggs: Of course. This is about education for them, and knowing that they can do something. And it's always better when you have someone who is confident and they're doing something and the other students are observing them. If they can do it, you can do it.\n\nIt's not as easy as having a can-do attitude for these girls, says Demm. She thinks they're being pushed too hard and that the curriculum is too rigourous.\n\nSomiari Demm: I think at times, we need to kinda scale it back. Trauma really changes the brain whether memory, cognition, recall, retrieval. We have to meet them where they are. If not, all we're doing is making the situation worse.\n\nWe were told they still get flashbacks and night terrors. And it doesn't help that over 100 of their friends are still missing.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you think about the ones who are still in captivity?\n\nGrace: When I think about them, I'm crying. And, I know that place. I know the condition. I don't want my sisters to stay there. I want them to come out.\n\nDemm is using an array of theraputic treatments to help them heal.\n\nShe leads them in yoga and relaxation exercises. And provides individual and group therapy where most of the girls have had difficulty talking about the suffering they endured.\n\nLesley Stahl: Can you tell us just a little bit about what life was like in captivity.\n\nRebecca: (Sigh.)\n\nLesley Stahl: Is it too hard to talk about?\n\nRebecca: Yeah, because I don't want to remember some things. When I tried, maybe I will feel like crying like that.\n\nBut her sisters share her memories.\n\nThe idea here is that the trauma happened in a group, so it's good to do the healing in a group.\n\nDemm says she never pushes the girls to open up. So, for instance, she doesn't know how many were raped. But she says there's a fine line between rape and forced marriage.\n\nLesley Stahl: You got married?\n\nMaryam: Yes.\n\nMaryam wasn't forced to convert, she was already Muslim so she was quickly married off to a Boko Haram commander and got pregnant.\n\nLesley Stahl: You gave birth there in the forest?\n\nMaryam: Yes.\n\nShe said the birth was difficult, but her son, Ali, was healthy. After two years, her Boko Haram husband actually helped her and Ali escape.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you feel still that you're married\n\nMaryam: No.\n\nAnd Ali, now two and a half. Where is he? He's in Chibok with his grandparents. The New Foundation School decided babies wouldn't be allowed on campus.\n\nLesley Stahl: Would you like it if they let you have the baby here?\n\nMaryam: Yes, I like it. But, you know, it can't be possible to carry Ali here.\n\nLesley Stahl: What does he call you?\n\nMaryam: Maryam. (LAUGH)\n\nShe's been separated from her son for so long he doesn't recognize her as his mother. As a child of Boko Haram, Ali is likely to face difficult odds, but Maryam feels that with a good education she can ease the way for him.\n\nThe Nigerian government is paying for most of their schooling. But thousands of other women and girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram are languishing with other victims in government-run camps like this one we found just 30 minutes from the school.\n\nThe contrast with the Chibok girls at the New Foundation School is glaring. But their free education comes with the burden of great expectations. The school's walls are plastered with sayings like: there's no limit to what I can achieve; their dorms are named after successful women like Michelle Obama and Malala.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you feel that because you're getting this wonderful education free, that you need to give something back to your country?\n\nGrace: If I work hard and if I become something, it's not only this Nigeria, I will help many countries.\n\nLesley Stahl: You'll be like Malala.\n\nGrace: Yes! Maybe I will do more than her. (LAUGH)\n\nDawn Dekle, president of the American University of Nigeria, says the New Foundation School is grooming these young women to give back by becoming leaders.\n\nDawn Dekle: The best revenge is massive success. And I really think these young women are gonna be some senators, some governors. Some of these young women wanna join the military. They told me, they wanna be a general in the military and go get Boko Haram so they can't do this to any other young girls.\n\nIt is ironic that their worst experience – has led to opportunities beyond their wildest dreams. They're not completely healed. But every day they get stronger physically, mentally, emotionally, and...\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Soldier.\n\n...they spell better.\n\nGirl: S-O-L-D-I-E-R\n\nBEE MODERATOR: Correct! (APPLAUSE)\n\nSomiari Demm: Despite everything that they've been through, they push forward. They come back even with greater force, with greater determination. And they blow me away.\n\nProduced by E. Alexandra Poolos and Kate Morris.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Kentucky clerk Kim Davis has obeyed orders to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in the months since she spent five nights in jail for refusing to do so, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.\n\nUnited States District Judge David Bunning denied the American Civil Liberties Union's request to order Davis to reissue licenses she had altered to remove her name and title or face the possibility of further punishment. He found that Davis has allowed her deputies to issue licenses to anyone eligible since September and that the altered licenses are likely valid under Kentucky law.\n\nAfter a ruling by the United States Supreme Court that effectively legalized gay marriage last summer, Davis, a born-again Christian, at first refused to allow her office to issue any marriage licenses, igniting a national firestorm over religious freedom and civil rights. She was sent briefly to jail for contempt of court. Davis relented during the turbulent court battle, but altered the licenses to remove her name and title.\n\nThe ACLU, which sued Davis on behalf of four rejected couples, asked the judge to make her reissue the marriage licenses and order that she not interfere with her deputies willing to sign them.\n\nMatt Bevin, the state's new Republican governor, signed an executive order in December that removes clerks' names from marriage licenses in response to Davis' case.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bunning found that Davis has been complying with his order and that there is every reason to believe that any altered licenses ... would be recognized under Kentucky law, rendering the ACLU's request moot.\n\nACLU Staff Attorney Ria Tabacco Mar issued a statement after the ruling saying she was heartened that Judge Bunning believes the altered licenses will likely be honored. But she said the question will have to be settled conclusively by Kentucky state courts.\n\nDavis' lawyer, Mat Staver, wrote that the judge's ruling rebuffed what he described as a personal vendetta against Davis.\n\nFrom the beginning, we have said the ACLU is not interested in marriage licenses. They want Kim Davis' scalp, Staver wrote. They want to force her to violate her conscience. I am glad the court rejected this bully tactic.\n\nDavis made headlines again last month when she was given tickets to the president's final State of the Union, an invite-only event for members of Congress.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan told CBS News at the time, Kim Davis used our ticket. Our staff heard from the Family Research Council that Ms. Davis and her family hoped to attend the State of the Union address and so we offered a ticket.\n\nEvery lawmaker gets one guest ticket to President Barack Obama's annual speech, though congressional leaders get extras.
For some couples, finding a job that offers benefits to cover infertility could be the difference between having kids and not. One in eight couples in the United States has trouble getting pregnant and the cost of fertility treatments is not cheap.\n\nYou might expect a tech company or big bank to offer coverage for treatments like in vitro fertilization, but Starbucks also offers the perk – even for part-time baristas.\n\nNow, some women are taking jobs there, in hopes that becoming a barista will get them a baby, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.\n\nShannon Iagulli CBS News\n\nIt was the darkest time of my life. Our marriage really took a hit, said Shannon Iagulli.\n\n\n\nIagulli and her husband Nic desperately wanted children. But four years into their marriage, it seemed Shannon couldn't get pregnant.\n\n\n\nYou go through your life hearing you grow up, you fall in love, you get married, you have kids so it doesn't happen, you don't understand. Why is my body not doing it, Shannon said. And that's where Starbucks came in.\n\n\n\nIagulli learned the company offered an unusual benefit: coverage for in vitro fertilization. On average, IVF costs $20,000 per cycle, with most couples going through two to three rounds before getting pregnant.\n\nStarbucks executive Lucy Helm CBS News\n\nI mean, you think barista, you think 18-year-old working to go through school, not a 27-year-old woman trying to have a baby, Iagulli said.\n\nStarbucks covers $20,000 for IVF and related medication for all eligible employees. That includes part-time baristas who make, on average, about $10,000 per year.\n\n\n\nIt's just been part of who we are, that if you work here and you put in the time, you're going to get the benefits that make you a full partner, said Starbucks executive Lucy Helm. It is really important to everyone and I think it's something that we're all very, very proud of. People fall in love with working for our company once they become a partner here.\n\n\n\nBut business professor Craig Garthwaite, with Northwestern University's Kellogg school of Management, says it's not just about making employees happy.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Starbucks is a for-profit, publicly traded company. They're not doing this out of the goodness of their heart, this is part of a cohesive strategy they have for how to attract and retain talent and also to advertise to their customers that they are quote unquote 'a good company', one that you want to spend a certain amount of money buying coffee at when you could get that coffee potentially cheaper somewhere else, Garthwaite said.\n\nAsked if there was a business case for wanting to keep the same people other than just being a nice place to work, Helm said, Absolutely, no question that in today's retail world in which fewer people are out and about shopping, places have to be a destination. So yeah, of course it's a business case for bringing in more customers because they increasingly have that connection with who we are and who serves them.\n\n\n\nNot everyone is happy with the company's wages and benefits: thousands have signed a petition online started by a barista complaining about understaffing and low morale.\n\nCBS News\n\nBut count Shannon Iagulli among the happiest of Starbucks baristas. IVF gave the Iagullis not one baby, but two, who at six weeks old, made their first visit to a Starbucks, their mom's workplace.\n\n\n\nWhat she's going to tell her kids about Starbucks when they're older?\n\n\n\nThey will know that that's how they came about that if it wasn't for mommy going to make coffee that they wouldn't be here, Iagulli said.\n\n\n\nNow, she supports other hopeful barista-moms around the country. They've even got a Facebook group called -- what else -- Starbucks IVF Mommas.\n\nStarbucks says it doesn't know how many women are doing this.\n\n\n\nFor the Iagullis, after insurance, they only ended up paying about $2,300 out of pocket.\n\n\n\nAfter getting pregnant last year, Iagulli left Starbucks for another job. Now she says, come this fall, when the twins are a little older, she'd like to go back. They need the health benefits for the family, plus she and her husband want to have more kids.
A full moon will take place on Friday night and with it, the Strawberry Moon will bring a penumbral lunar eclipse. The June full moon also happens to be the last full moon of spring, an occurrence that was named Strawberry Moon by the Algonquin tribes, according to NASA.\n\nThe name comes from the relatively short season for harvesting strawberries in the northeastern United States.\n\nThe Strawberry Moon will be close enough to opposite the sun that it will pass through part of the partial shadow of the Earth, causing an eclipse. During the eclipse, the moon will not be in the sky for most of the Americas, NASA says. The Moon will appear full for about three days, from early Thursday morning into early Sunday morning.\n\nA group of girls watches a full Strawberry Moon rise above the Tagus river in Lisbon, Tuesday, June 2, 2015. AP Photo/Armando Franca\n\nThe eclipse will be entirely visible in eastern Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia and Australia, according to Space.com. It will begin at 1:45 p.m. ET and lasts until 5:04 p.m. ET – about three hours and 18 minutes.\n\nThe Strawberry Moon has also been called Mead Moon or the Honey Moon. The end of June was when honey was ripe and ready to be harvested, which made this the sweetest moon, according to some writings, NASA says.\n\nThe tradition of calling the first month of marriage the honeymoon may be tied to this full moon – either because the Honey Moon is the sweetest moon of the year, or because getting married in June is a custom.\n\nSome consider this full Moon the Rose Moon, but other sources from Europeans and Native Americans also refer to it as the Flower Moon, Hot Moon, Hoe Moon, and Planting Moon, NASA says.\n\nHindus also have traditions surrounding this lunar occurrence. During the three-day full moon, married women will show their love for their husbands by tying a ceremonial thread around a banyan tree, according to NASA.\n\nBuddhists call this full moon the Poson Poya. In Sri Lanka, the Poson holiday celebrates the introduction of Buddhism in 236 BCE.
An American citizen who had been held captive by Yemeni rebels has been freed after a year and a half in captivity, President Trump announced Monday. Danny Burch was recovered and reunited with his wife and children, the president tweeted.\n\nBurch was living in Yemen and working for an oil company in September 2017 when he was abducted by armed gunmen in broad daylight from his car in the streets of the capital of Sana, his family members said at the time. The capital is controlled by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who are locked in a fierce conflict with the Yemeni government and a coalition of Sunni countries led by Saudi Arabia.\n\nMr. Trump thanked the United Arab Emirates for helping secure Burch's release, saying in a statement that his recovery reflects the best of what the United States and its partners can accomplish. The president, who is en route to Vietnam for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said Burch is the 20th American released from captivity abroad under his administration.\n\nWe will not rest as we continue our work to bring the remaining American hostages back home, Mr. Trump said. Today, we join Danny and his family in celebrating his return.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked the State Department's Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs and the U.S. Mission to the UAE for their work securing Burch's release.\n\nBurch was born in Louisiana and moved to Yemen full time in 2005, his son from an earlier marriage told The New York Times shortly after his abduction. He married a Yemeni citizen and fathered three children in the country. He was 63 at the time of his abduction, according to family members.\n\nIn January 2018, Reuters, citing sources in Sana, reported Burch had been freed and brought to the capital of Oman by a senior Houthi official for peace talks that eventually broke down. Asked for clarification about the Reuters report on Monday, a State Department spokesman declined to comment on the record, citing the Burch family's request for privacy.\n\nSara Cook and Christina Ruffini contributed reporting.
Editor's Note: Since the publication of this story, the age and military service record of Luther Younger have been called into question. Younger had claimed he was 99 years old and served in the Marines during the Korean War. CBS News has been unable to confirm his age, and has put in a request with the National Archives to confirm his military service record. A reporter for the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, citing a spokesperson for the Marine Corps, reported that there was no record of Luther Younger serving in Korea. References to Luther Younger's age and military record have been removed from this story.\n\nA man from Rochester, New York, may restore your faith that true, lasting love does exist. His name is Luther Younger, and he is deeply devoted to his wife, Waverlee, whom he calls the sweetest cup of tea he ever had.\n\nLuther walks six miles round-trip every day — in the heat, rain and snow — to visit Waverlee in the hospital. He has become a local celebrity in Rochester and many people recognize him from his daily pilgrimage. Spectrum News Rochester first reported the loyal husband's story earlier this month and it gained widespread media attention.\n\nAfter hearing about Luther, I decided to go up to Rochester so I could take the three-mile walk with him to Strong Memorial Hospital. It was a hot August day — over 90 degrees — but that didn't faze him. When I arrived at his home on Tuesday, he proved he was in tip-top shape and ready for the trek. He dropped to the floor and started doing perfect pushups. Then he popped up, slung a backpack over his shoulder and said, Let's go. He told me his daughter thinks he's too hyper, and acknowledged that he probably is.\n\nHe warned me I would have to keep up with him. I wasn't prepared for him to start running, but he did — several times. I started running behind him, trying to keep up as he led the way through the suburban streets.\n\nHe prefaced our walk with one thing: I don't want to talk about nothing except my wife.\n\nWaverlee Younger was diagnosed with a brain tumor nearly nine years ago and doctors thought she'd have just five years to live, the couple's daughter, Lutheta, told me. Lutheta says both of her parents have remained extremely strong. Over the past nine years, Waverlee has been in and out of the hospital, sometimes for months at a time. Luther stayed by her side, walking to the hospital to visit every day and often sleeping there, sometimes on the floor.\n\nLuther Younger of Rochester, New York, walks six miles round-trip, no matter the weather, to visit his wife Waverlee in the hospital. CBS News\n\nWith Waverlee in the hospital with pneumonia for the past three weeks, Luther has again made it a part of his daily routine to walk to her. He told me he could wait for Lutheta to give him a ride, or take the bus, but he doesn't want to.\n\nI got a wife. I don't want to wait on the bus. I want to go up there to see my wife, he said during our walk.\n\nSeveral people recognized Luther during our journey and stopped to chat. He said people often offer him rides, but he declines.\n\nDuring the trek he reiterated his answer to this question several times. He likes to walk because it clears his mind and he says he's always done hard labor for work. He told me he grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, so he's used to the heat.\n\nBut his daily walk isn't about proving how strong he is. It's about proving his love for Waverlee. She is a beautiful lady and she treats me as a person is supposed to be ... she made a man out of me, he said. That's why I love her, because she's tough. She's not weak ... That's the kind of woman I want.\n\nOn the walk he reminisced about his marriage. He said they met in a laundromat and got married at their home, adding that Waverlee looked beautiful on their wedding day. Lutheta is the couple's only child together, but Luther praised Waverlee for helping raise his kids from a previous relationship.\n\nShe wasn't easy. She was the type of person, if you didn't work, you got to go. And I had to work, he told me. That's why I'm sticking with her, because if it hadn't been for my wife, I wouldn't have made it.\n\nLuther and Waverlee Younger. Lutheta Younger\n\nWe walked through the University of Rochester campus, and Luther started running again when he spotted the hospital building. I told him to be careful, that it was hot out, but he just said, Come on, we have to get there. He refused water, and it seemed that the only thing on his mind was Waverlee.\n\nAs he made his way through the hospital hallways, Luther said hello to the staff members as he passed by, but didn't stop walking.\n\nWhen he walked in the door of her hospital room, he said to me, Watch this ... baby, give me a kiss. He kissed Waverlee, and her eyes fluttered. He is proud his kiss can still make his wife happy after all these years.\n\nThat's my cup of tea, and she's sweet too, Luther said, sitting next to Waverlee's bed.\n\nHe's always called her that, Lutheta told me. He's always cared about her the way he does [now]. He loves my mom, He'll do anything for her.\n\nLutheta says she tries to find a ride home for her dad as often as possible, especially when it's hot out. She doesn't like that he walks six miles alone every day, but her dad is adamant and she lets him do it.\n\nMy dad says it keeps him alive, it keeps him going, his daughter said. Lutheta also started a GoFundMe campaign for her parents, to help raise money for Waverlee's hospital expenses.\n\nAt the end of the day, Luther leaves the hospital to let Waverlee rest. He gave me a big hug goodbye and told me I was like a granddaughter to him. We just spent the afternoon together, but in Luther's big heart, that practically made me part of his family.\n\nHis six-mile round-trip journey would be too much for most people. But when you've walked through life with someone, what's another six miles? Luther is sad to leave his love, but he knows that tomorrow, rain or shine, he will be walking to see his sweet cup of tea again.
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: July 16th, 1999, 18 years ago today … the day John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law died in the crash of the small plane he was piloting.\n\nPresident Kennedy and his son, John-John, at the White House c. 1963. AP\n\nThe only son of our assassinated 35th President, John F. Kennedy Jr. grew up before the eyes of the world -- the Crown Prince of Camelot.\n\nIn 1995 he launched George, a political magazine named for our first President ... and there was endless speculation that he might someday run for office himself.\n\nDubbed The Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine in 1988, young Kennedy was a tabloid darling ... and his 1996 marriage to Carolyn Bessette was the social event of the season.\n\nAn amateur pilot, JFK took off in a Piper Saratoga on the night of July 16 with his wife Carolyn and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette bound for Martha's Vineyard.\n\nAs Bob Orr reported for CBS News, the plane was last picked up on radar at 9:39 that Friday evening, some 17 miles from its destination, consistent with an imminent final approach to the Vineyard Haven Airport. But the plane then disappeared from radar. No emergency declaration was ever made.\n\nFive days later, searchers found the wreckage of the plane, and the remains of its three passengers, on the ocean bottom about eight miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.\n\nThe bodies were cremated, their ashes scattered at sea.\n\nA private mass was held for Kennedy and his wife in New York City, with President and Mrs. Clinton among the invited guests.\n\nAn NTSB investigation blamed the crash on the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night, which was the result of spatial disorientation. Factors in the accident were haze and the dark night.\n\nHad he lived, the dashing young JFK, Jr. so many remember of us would now be 56 years old.

So, if Angie Dickinson were a critic doing a review of her life so far, what would you say? Oh my God, that's one lucky bitch! Dickinson laughed.\n\nWell, it's not exactly luck that's had Dickinson turning heads during a film and TV career that's doubled as a half-century-long master class in the art of seduction.\n\nShe admitted to correspondent Mo Rocca that she enjoyed being a sex symbol very much but I wouldn't want to be known only as a sex symbol. I wanted to be known as an actress, equally or, even more so. Like Marilyn Monroe. She was known as the greatest – rightly rightly so – sex symbol of all time, Boy, try to do Shakespeare after that!\n\nDickinson was always more down to Earth, rough-and-tumble than Marilyn, willing to go mano-a-mano with a tough guy like Lee Marvin in Point Blank.\n\nA portrait of actress Angie Dickinson in 1963. AP Photo\n\nRocca asked, Do you consider yourself more of a broad, a dame, or a gal?\n\nOh, all of the above!\n\nShe was born Angie Brown in September 1931 – yes, she's 87 – in Kulm, North Dakota. Population: around 740. I grew up going to movies, she said. My daddy was the projectionist, so we got in for free. And I loved movies. [The theater] burned down, and we cried for a week. I decided to give up movies for Lent since the movie theater burned down!\n\nThat was your penance?\n\nOh, you're bringing back so many memories that I don't think about normally.\n\nAfter the family moved to California, Angie found work as a secretary, and competed in beauty pageants, which led to a spot on The Colgate Comedy Hour.\n\nJimmy Durante was singing with Frank Sinatra. That was it, she said. I said: 'This is for me!'\n\nShe appeared in a bunch of TV westerns, then in 1959 starred in Rio Bravo opposite her childhood hero, John Wayne. My parents were Democrats, and I was a Democrat. And John Wayne was a Republican, she said.\n\nDid you have some trepidation before you met him then?

Political Players is a weekly conversation with the leaders, consultants, and activists who shape American politics. This week, as Barack Obama and John McCain duked it out on the economy, CBS News' Brian Goldsmith talked with former GOP presidential candidate and current McCain adviser Steve Forbes about taxes, energy, and President Bush.\n\nCBSNews.com: The Politico reported this week that a number of the 300 economists that Senator McCain claims support his economic plans say they have significant reservations about it, that many were unfamiliar with or downright opposed to key parts of his plan. What's your response to that?\n\nSteve Forbes: Well, I've not seen that piece.\n\nCBSNews.com: Senator McCain told Katie Couric this week that he pledged to balance the budget by the end of his first term in 2013. Do you think that's possible?\n\nSteve Forbes: I think his plan is the most realistic plan to achieve a balance--or a far better balance--that is out there, by recognizing the importance of reducing the burden of taxation, among other things. That is the key to getting the economy back on track again. His energy programs, I think, would substantially reduce the price of oil, which would remove a huge burden on the American economy and the American consumer.\n\nSo the way you get a balanced budget is one, greater revenue growth. And he's got the best plan for it. And two, restraint of spending. Just slowing the growth of spending. And on that, he has a record, going back a number of years in the Senate, of being a hawk on reducing spending.\n\nCBSNews.com: But why should voters trust Republican leadership on this issue when the current Republican president inherited a surplus and is leaving his successor with perhaps the worst deficit in American history?\n\nSteve Forbes: We're talking about John McCain, not the Republican Party or the current incumbent in the White House. And we're looking to the future, not what George Bush has done in the past. Bush is not running for reelection. John McCain is running for election. And John McCain has vigorously opposed many of the spending measures of the Bush administration. His tax proposals are far more comprehensive than what the Bush administration has proposed.\n\nAnd on the energy front, he has got a far more vigorous approach than either Senator Obama, the Congressional Democrats, or the current incumbent in the White House. So in terms of what voters are voting for--the programs advocated by Senator McCain, and the programs advocated by Senator Obama--I think Senator McCain's are hugely more beneficial for the economy and for our security.\n\nCBSNews.com: What do you say to economists who argue that it's actually the Bush tax cuts that have contributed more to the shortfall than increased spending?\n\nSteve Forbes: The tax cuts enabled the American economy to go from stagnation, which started under Bill Clinton in 2000, the high tech bubble burst in 2000. And the losses from high tech still vastly exceed what we've lost on the subprime crisis.\n\nAnd the tax cuts of 2003 took the U.S. economy from a subpar one percent growth rate to three to four percent real growth, and between 2003 and 2007, the expansion of the American economy, just the growth alone, exceeded the entire size of the Chinese economy. We grew China in four years. Now, obviously, their growth rates are higher, but they're coming off of a much smaller base. So the tax cuts worked. What didn't work was the reckless spending by both the White House and the Congress.\n\nCBSNews.com: You've talked about John McCain's energy proposals. Do you support his plan for a gas tax holiday?\n\nSteve Forbes: The gas tax holiday plan, as part of a comprehensive package, makes sense. Give people some temporary relief. But have on track a massive program to increase the output of energy in the United States. Clearly, there are tens of billions of barrels of oil offshore that should be explored and produced. Every other country is doing it. Brazil, just a few months ago, discovered a field off its shores that has upwards of 33 billion barrels of oil.\n\nThere's lots of gas out there. And Senator McCain's nuclear program of 45 new plants in this country over the next 20 years, would go a long ways to increasing our production of electricity without relying on oil.\n\nThe technology on the nuclear power is there. Japan has done it, France has done it. So it's just a matter of will in this country to do the same thing. And by the way, both the offshore exploration and production, and the nuclear program, would create nearly a million new jobs, high skilled, high paid jobs, in both of those sectors.\n\nCBSNews.com: But even Senator McCain's supporters say that the benefits of new output, from either additional oil drilling or from nuclear plants would be years into the future. Do you think there's more that can be done, besides what Senator McCain described as the psychological benefit of announcing that we're going to do this?\n\nSteve Forbes: Well, I've heard the same arguments three or four years ago. If we'd gone offshore three or four or five years ago, we'd be having production from that.\n\nAnd in terms of the future, if you're OPEC, or you're another oil-producing nation, and you see the United States has serious programs to increase its output of oil and natural gas production, not only offshore, but also all the shale deposits that we have in the western part of the United States, and we have a serious nuclear program, such as the French and the Japanese have done for years, what are you going to do? You're going to ramp up your production, because you're going to want to sell while the selling's good. That brings the price down.\n\nSo the impact would be immediate. And in terms of increased oil and gas production, that could start to come online in three or four years. The longer we wait, the longer it is in the future.\n\nCBSNews.com: Do you disagree with Senator McCain on ANWR?\n\nSteve Forbes: On ANWR, I do. But I agree with him on offshore and nuclear. And that's where most of the new energy resources are. And that doesn't preclude doing other things. For example, Boone Pickens has a very bold program for massive wind farms in Texas and elsewhere. So you do all of the above: wind, offshore, onshore, nuclear, and we can make substantial progress.\n\nCBSNews.com: Democrats are drawing a contrast between the McCain corporate tax cuts and the Obama plan, which is a bigger middle class tax cut. How do you defend that?\n\nSteve Forbes: Senator Obama has not proposed any specifics on his so-called middle class tax cut. And when he's been in the Senate, even though he's only been there three years, he's voted for tax increases of one sort or another 94 times. He also voted for a Senate budget resolution, for example, that would have increased taxes on individual tax filers making as little as $32,000 a year. So his actions belie his rhetoric.\n\nAnd if he allows the 2003 tax cuts to expire, that's gonna take a family making $40,000 or $50,000 a year, and increase their tax burden one or two thousand dollars. So his tax cut would barely make up for what the tax is going to go up in two years.\n\nOn the business side, the United States today has the second highest business tax burden in the developed world. And that makes us less competitive with countries such as Ireland, Britain and France, which have all reduced their corporate tax rates.\n\nCBSNews.com: Senator McCain claims to have opposed the Bush tax cuts simply because of the failure to cut spending. But there are many statements that have been chronicled of McCain criticizing the Bush tax cuts because he thought they disproportionately benefited the wealthy. Hasn't he changed his position on this?\n\nSteve Forbes: Well, because of his criticisms and those of others, the tax cuts that passed--partially in 2001, but mostly in 2003--substantially increased exemptions for children, with that $1,000 refundable credit. Getting rid of the marriage penalty, which greatly increased the benefits to those in the middle income brackets.\n\nSo the criticism had the effect of making that tax bill even better. And in terms of his own tax record, McCain has never supported a tax increase.\n\nBy Brian Goldsmith
America's demographic fabric is changing, and marketers are taking note by increasingly portraying diverse families in their ads.\n\nBut as a new Old Navy advertisement is demonstrating, such campaigns may not be embraced by everyone, although Americans are increasingly lending their support to brands that embrace inclusivity.\n\nOh, happy day! Our #ThankYouEvent is finally here. Take 30% off your entire purchase: https://t.co/nGQ9Pji1pN pic.twitter.com/vq4mIczm6A — Old Navy Official (@OldNavy) April 29, 2016\n\n\n\nThe brouhaha started when the apparel maker on Friday tweeted an image of an interracial family wearing its clothes, unleashing negative comments from some people espousing racist views.\n\nThen Twitter fought back. Supporters of Old Navy's ad campaign, including many interracial families and friends, tweeted messages with the hashtag #LoveWins, a term that went viral last year after the Supreme Court's marriage equality ruling. Fans of Old Navy's message took the hashtag to heart and tweeted messages of support as well as personal photos showing their own diverse families.\n\nAmerican families are increasingly diverse, with Pew Research Center finding that 12 percent of newlyweds in 2013 married someone of a different race, a record high. Add in same-sex couples and the share of diverse families in the U.S. is even larger.\n\nBut the advertising industry has lagged that reality, with relatively few commercials showing families of different races or same-sex relationships.\n\nThe shift in the American family landscape is historic, and interracial families are only one part of the new normal. We're seeing more households with parents who are single, co-habitating, LGBTQ, or which include stay-at-home dads, said Julie Michaelson, head of global sales at parenting website BabyCenter. Some brands are nervous about embracing this new reality, concerned about backlash.\n\nHey @OldNavy, my family and I thank you for the diversity in this ad! #LoveWins, no matter the color ❤️ pic.twitter.com/TjgYUPMGu4 — KHARY PENEBAKER (@kharyp) May 1, 2016\n\nControversy over portraying interracial families in advertising is nothing new. In 2013, Cheerios faced a similar situation when it aired an ad featuring a biracial little girl who asks her white mother about the cereal's heart-healthy benefits. The girl rushes to her napping father and pours a box of Cheerios over his chest.\n\nThe spot produced a backlash against interracial couples and prompted parent company General Mills (GIS) to shut down the comments section for the ad's YouTube video. In that case, fans also clearly won out, with the ad earning far more likes than dislikes.\n\nOld Navy, which is owned by Gap (GPS), didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. It's likely the company was aware that the rewards of promoting racial inclusivity far outweighs the risk of alienating some shoppers, given that a recent study from BabyCenter and YouGov found that 80 percent of parents like seeing diverse families in marketing campaigns.\n\nAbout four in 10 families are diverse when it comes to race, gender or household formation, such as single-parent households or families with stay-at-home dads, the study found.\n\nThe proportion of traditional family types is shrinking, the BabyCenter research report noted. Marketers who want to connect with parents today cannot afford to ignore this shift.\n\nAs BabyCenter's Michaelson noted, the #LoveWins outpouring speaks to the importance of these types of marketing campaigns. When done authentically, standing for inclusivity will spark a groundswell of support.
AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday in a Houston case that top Republicans hope will provide an opening to chip away at the landmark 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nA coalition of religious and social conservatives sued America's fourth-largest city in 2013, challenging its decision to offer same-sex spousal benefits to municipal employees. Last year, Texas' all-Republican court refused to hear the matter on appeal, effectively allowing the marriage benefits in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that the Constitution grants gay couples seeking to merry equal dignity in the eyes of the law.\n\nBut the state Supreme Court reversed itself in January, amid pressure from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as dozens of other conservative elected officials, church leaders and grassroots activists. They filed a parade of briefs saying the case may help Texas limit the scope of the Supreme Court ruling -- especially in how it's applied to states.\n\nTexas' highest civil court reconsidering a previous decision is unusual, but not unprecedented. Justices listened to about 50 minutes of arguments and aren't expected to rule for months. Jonathan Mitchell, an attorney representing the groups suing, said that though the U.S. Supreme court ruling legalized gay marriage, it doesn't require governmental entities to offer taxpayer-funded, same-sex benefits to their employees.\n\nThe meaning and scope of Obergefell remain open to debate, Mitchell said.\n\nHe further argued that the nation's highest court didn't declare spousal benefits a fundamental right of marriage, meaning it should be up to the states to decide the legality of offering them. Lawyer Douglas Alexander, appearing on Houston's behalf, agreed that such benefits weren't a fundamental right but said that the nation's high court's ruling means that all marriages are equal, so anything offered to opposite-sex couples must be offered to same-sex ones as well.\n\nObergefell answers every question in this case, Alexander said.\n\nThe groups suing have further pointed to the case as a chance for the Texas Supreme Court to defend religious liberty and take a stand on social issues, arguing that state justices should challenge not only the U.S. Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage but also its striking down last summer of many of the state's tough abortion restrictions.\n\nHouston counters that the case is a matter of settled law and shouldn't have anything to do with advancing social conservative causes.\n\nThe justices asked frequent questions Wednesday, including interrupting Mitchell barely a minute into his opening arguments. Many wondered about the court's jurisdiction in a matter involving a municipal decision over spousal benefits when the marriage question had already been decided nationally.\n\nMitchell said Texas' governor and others in filings have argued that an opinion of the Supreme Court does not have the same status as constitutional text, because, if it did, the nation's high court would never be able to rule against its own precedents.\n\nJared Woodfill, a conservative activist at the center of the case, said afterward that he hopes this case will reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which could then rule on the invalid expansion of its 2015 decision. The office of Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner released a statement saying the city is confident that the Texas Supreme Court will follow its practice of requiring strict compliance with decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nSuzanne Bryant, left, and Sarah Goodfriend, right, pose with their marriage license following a news conference, Thu., Feb. 19, 2015, in Austin, Texas. Despite Texas' longstanding ban on gay marriage, the same-sex couple married Thursday immediately after being granted a marriage license under a one-time court order issued for medical reasons. Eric Gay/AP\n\nTexas voters had in 2005 approved a state ban on same-sex marriage, and attorney general Paxton initially suggested that county clerks with personal religious objections could defy the U.S. Supreme Court order and refuse to issue marriage licenses for same sex couples. But same-sex marriages have been unimpeded in the state since then.\n\nTexas isn't the first state to go down this legal road. Last March, the Alabama Supreme Court dismissed a challenge seeking to bar same-sex marriage there in defiance the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling.
President Donald Trump faces a lawsuit over the federal government declining to issue $1,200 stimulus checks to U.S. citizens who are married to immigrants without Social Security numbers. The litigation comes after the IRS said that only married couples in which both spouses hold valid Social Security numbers will receive the payments.\n\nThe suit, filed by a U.S. citizen and Illinois resident identified only as John Doe, alleges that the ban violates the Constitution and is a form of discrimination based solely on whom he chose to marry. Two of the attorneys who are representing John Doe told CBS MoneyWatch that more American citizens in the same situation have reached out to them since they filed the complaint.\n\nThe stimulus checks are part of the government's $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package, which provides $1,200 for single taxpayers earning less than $75,000 and $2,400 for married couples earning less than $150,000.\n\nThe plaintiff in the suit would have qualified for a $1,200 stimulus check except that he files taxes with his immigrant spouse, who uses an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, according to the lawsuit, which also names Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as defendants.\n\nThe suit also states that his children are excluded because one parent is an immigrant. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, families with children under the age of 17 are entitled to stimulus funds of $500 per child.\n\nCruel exclusion\n\nIt's our humble opinion that U.S. citizens are U.S. citizens, said Lana B. Nassar, an attorney at Blaise & Nitschke, PC, who is representing John Doe. He and others in his situation aren't asking for preferential treatment — they want to be treated like U.S. citizens.\n\nThe cruel carve-out violates the Constitution because it discriminates on the basis of marriage, Nassar added. Time and time again the court has found there is a fundamental right to marriage, she added. If you are discriminating on the basis of marriage, the government has to show there is a compelling government interest that justifies this exclusion. It's a very high burden to meet.\n\nNassar added that her client has two children who are citizens under 17. That means the rule is excluding him from a $1,200 stimulus check for himself as well as $1,000 for his children, or $2,200 in total.\n\nThat's money he could use to feed his kids and pay his bills, said Vivian Khalaf, an immigration attorney who is also representing John Doe in the case. The person suffering here is the U.S. citizen — not the person who doesn't have the Social Security number.\n\nPolicy experts have raised concerns that the Corona Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act bars immigrants, except those with Green Cards that allow them to live and work in the U.S., from receiving the stimulus checks. Many legal immigrants pay taxes and otherwise contribute to the U.S. economy.\n\nMr. Trump and the other defendants have failed to treat him as equal to his fellow United States citizens based solely on whom he chose to marry, the lawsuit alleges. John Doe has lawfully filed taxes in the United States, yet he is being denied the rights and privileges under the CARES Act.\n\nThe decision to exclude U.S. citizens who are married to immigrants without Social Security numbers affects 1.2 million Americans, according to the Migration Policy Institute. There were 2.3 million foreign nationals on temporary visas in 2016, according to the non-partisan think tank.\n\nPresumptively unconstitutional?\n\nThere are two exceptions to the issue that sparked the lawsuit. First, if either spouse is a member of the Armed Forces at any time during the tax year, only one of them is required to have a valid Social Security number, the IRS says.\n\nSecond, taxpayers who are citizens and file separately from their immigrant spouses who lack a Social Security number will receive half of the payment for married couples, or $1,200, according to the IRS.\n\nThat second exception could give some couples a chance to file their taxes separately, given that the 2019 filing deadline has been pushed back to July 15. However, many taxpayers have already filed their returns for 2019.\n\nEven so, the carve-out that excludes U.S. citizens with immigrant spouses who lack Social Security numbers is harmful and without serving any legitimate governmental interest, the lawsuit claims.\n\nDiscrimination based on the alienage of a U.S. citizen's spouse is presumptively unconstitutional and subject to strict scrutiny, it claims. The lawsuit was filed Friday in a federal court in Chicago.
NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Nashville Mayor Megan Barry revealed Wednesday that she had an extramarital affair with the former head of her security detail, apologizing and indicating she plans to continue serving in office. I know God forgives, but the people of Nashville don't have to -- and I also want to ask for their forgiveness, Barry said Wednesday.\n\nIn a news release, the mayor said she accepts full responsibility for the pain she caused her family and the family of Sgt. Robert Forrest, her former security chief. She apologized to her husband, Bruce, who she said remains committed to their marriage.\n\nAnd she apologized to the people of Nashville, adding that she remains firmly committed to working hard to serve them. The popular mayor, who was elected in 2015, said progress has been made to offer affordable housing, improve to public education and promote better transportation options, but there's more work to be done.\n\nThe first term mayor's admission follows the painful loss of the Barrys' only son, Max, in July after an overdose on a combination of several drugs, including two opioids.\n\nMayor Megan Barry and her son Max Mayor Megan Barry/Facebook\n\nShe planned to address the news media Wednesday night.\n\nI knew my actions could cause damage to my office and the ones I loved, but I did it anyway, Barry said. I must hold myself to the highest standard of which the voters deserve to expect. Please know that I'm disappointed in myself but also understand that I'm a human and that I made a mistake.\n\nForrest said on Jan. 17 he would retire Wednesday after 31-plus years with Metro Nashville Police. He spent 14 years of that tenure supervising the mayor's security detail over three administrations.\n\nThe 54-year-old mayor said the relationship with the 58-year-old sergeant began shortly after her election in September 2015, CBS affiliate WTVF reports. The television station had recently begun an investigation into her use of taxpayer money.\n\nAccording to WTVF, Forrest had provided protection for former mayors Bill Purcell and Karl Dean, but his overtime pay had increased dramatically since Barry took office.\n\nPolice records show that he averaged $34,000 a year for the last three years of Dean's term. When Barry took office in Sept. 2015, his overtime pay increased to nearly $60,000 for the fiscal year. The next year, he avearged $75,000 in overtime pay alone, bringing his total pay $157,187, WTVF reports.\n\nMetro Police spokesperson Don Aaron told WTVF that Barry has kept a daunting schedule since her election.\n\nThe overtime is a reflection of that morning to night AND weekend schedule, Aaron said.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, Forrest said he never violated his oath as a police officer or engaged in actions that would abuse the public trust. The retired officer asked for privacy as he seeks to rebuild the trust of those he loves the most.\n\nI deeply regret that my professional relationship with Mayor Barry turned into a personal one, Forrest said in the release. This has caused great pain for my wife, my family, friends and colleagues.
Beyoncé and Jay-Z sent their fans abuzz when they momentarily listed a tour date for On the Run 2. On Monday, Facebook event pages appeared, promoting a date for a joint tour between the power couple. Minutes later, the events were taken down.\n\nComplex has a screenshot showing the retracted tour date.\n\nMusic's biggest couple last embarked on a joint tour together in 2014, for On the Run, which promoted the albums Beyoncé and Magna Carta Holy Grail. On the Run made more than $100 million in ticket sales. Fans have been hoping for a new tour featuring Lemonade and 4:44, two intertwined albums about Jay-Z's infidelity in their marriage.\n\nIn 2014, Beyoncé called the joint tour the best of her life. She posted a photo of Jay-Z holding their daughter, Blue Ivy, alongside the caption: Thank you San Fran! Your city is beautiful. It was the perfect place to complete the best tour of my life! Thank you to all the fans that supported our show. God bless. The Instagram post came amid rumors that the couple's marriage was getting rocky.
Paula Patton and her ex-husband, singer Robin Thicke, are fighting over custody of their son.\n\nThe 41-year-old actress was in a Los Angeles court on Thursday to request an emergency hearing to ask a judge to restrict Robin's access to their 6-year-old son, Julian. She is requesting that Robin only have monitored daytime visits. However, the judge denied her request for an emergency hearing.\n\nPaula alleges that Robin has been physically abusive toward their son. Over the past year, I have become concerned about [Robin]'s drinking and drug use, as well as the forms of punishment he is using to discipline Julian, Paula wrote in her declaration. My concerns culminated on January 4, 2017, when Julian's school called Department of Child Family Services (DCFS) to report what they believed to be credible allegations of abuse from Julian against [Robin].\n\nPaula goes on to allege that Robin has been spanking Julian excessively. We asked him to show us how hard, and I asked him to hit me on my back, Patton claims, saying she responded with an ow. She adds, Julian said it was worse than that.\n\nIn his declaration, Robin says, It is my belief that Paula holds residual anger toward me because I and my family would not permit her or her family to attend the funeral of my father on December 20, 2016.\n\nAlan Thicke died suddenly on Dec. 13 at the age of 69. Robin says in the docs that Paula did not have a positive relationship with my father.\n\nRobin also notes that he is complying with the DCFS investigation and is meeting with a social worker on Thursday with his son. I understand that the social worker has already met with Julian, Paula and employees from Julian's school, and that DCFS has not sought to remove Julian from my care, placed any restrictions on my custody, nor instructed Paula to withhold Julian from me. I have certainly not heard from anyone in this regard at any time, he says.\n\nUltimately, the court found there is insufficient showing of great or irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis to grant Paula's emergency request today.\n\nPaula and Robin married in 2005 after dating since they were teenagers. They welcomed son Julian in April 2010, but announced their split in February 2014 after almost nine years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in March 2015.\n\nBoth Paula and Robin appear to be heavily involved in their son's life. Robin last posted pics of Julian in late November, playing with friends and adorably blowing out a candle. In October, the Blurred Lines singer posed with Julian as he dressed up as Michael Jackson for Halloween.\n\nMe and my boy! he wrote.\n\nMe and my boy! A photo posted by Robin Thicke (@robinthicke) on Oct 31, 2016 at 12:39pm PDT\n\nMeanwhile, Patton Instagrammed a photo with Julian on Friday, a throwback of their Christmas together.\n\nChristmas Day with my precious angel, she wrote.\n\nChristmas Day with my precious angel #fbf A photo posted by Paula Patton (@paulapattonofficial) on Dec 30, 2016 at 12:04pm PST\n\nSince their split, both Robin and Paula have moved on, with Robin currently dating 21-year-old model April Love Geary. Meanwhile, Paula has expressed no regret over her and the Lost Without U singer's 21-year-relationship. In August, she Instagrammed a sweet throwback of the two in their younger years.\n\nI always try to only remember what was fun and made me smile, she wrote. My friend showed me this and it took my breath away. We were babies and we had a beautiful baby. What an amazing time in my life. No regrets! Celebrating this amazing life we get to live never knowing what's coming next. Love is always the answer.\n\nPaula also wrote a sweet message for Robin's late father. I knew Alan since I was 15 years old and he had a tremendous effect on my life, Paula Instagrammed alongside a picture of the smiling actor. I loved and respected him so much! So many great memories and laughs together. We will miss him so much! His grandson is quite sure he is still here with us in spirit.
A pastor in Fort Collins, Colorado, is vowing to support the LGBTQ community, even if other church leaders disagree. Lead Pastor Dr. Melanie Rosa wrote a long Facebook post after the Methodist Church voted last week to ban gay clergy members and same-sex marriage.\n\nBy now you are most likely aware of the very discouraging news coming out of the General Conference meeting in St. Louis, Rosa wrote, referring to a decision the Methodist Church leadership made last week. After three days of debate, officials and lay members voted to ban gay and lesbian clerics and the officiating of same-sex marriages. The decision sparked debate among Methodist Church members.\n\nIn Rosa's view, the church's decision is largely unconstitutional and very regressive.\n\nDear Sisters and Brothers in Christ: By now you are most likely aware of the very discouraging news coming out of the... Posted by First United Methodist Church Fort Collins (FCFUMC) on Thursday, February 28, 2019\n\nShe pointed out that 2/3 of American United Methodists do not support this plan and did not vote for it, while the majority from overseas did, representing countries that have very intolerant policies as far as LGBTQ rights are concerned. While the Methodist Church is the third-largest faith in the U.S., 30 percent of members globally are in Africa, where many nations outlaw homosexuality itself.\n\nAt the conference, Methodists who support LGBTQ involvement in the church wanted local congregations to be free to set their own rules on the topic. Instead, the newly-adopted rules stiffen punishment for violations: Clergy who officiate at same-sex weddings could be suspended without pay for a year, and defrocked if they do it again.\n\nRosa said many members are horrified and embarrassed by the negative press surrounding the church's decision, but she noted a passion was ignited among church members. As one person said: 'What they gained pales in comparison to what they provoked,' Rosa wrote. People are mobilizing to rise up and resist the injustice and oppression that was on full display during General Conference.\n\nThe pastor vowed, I will never lead a church that discriminates against anyone. I will relinquish my Ordination before I will be a part of an oppressive and unjust organization. I will never sign a pledge of conformity to exclude anyone.\n\nPastor Melanie Rosa is defying the Methodist Church by supporting the LGBTQ community. First United Methodist Church Fort Collins\n\nRosa reassured members that LGBTQ sisters and brothers will continue to be treated as precious children of sacred worth and will continue to offer leadership and service in our church. She also quoted one of her church's highly respected Lay Leaders who is gay: My husband and I feel very loved at First Church and we are not going anywhere.\n\nThe pastor said her congregation will carry on as usual and will boldly and publicly stand on the side of inclusion and justice, particularly for those in our LGBTQ family who have been marginalized and demonized by Christianity for far too long.\n\nRosa pointed out that historically, the Methodist Church has been split on major issues, including slavery in the 1800s, the role of women, and sexual orientation.\n\nOur church will stand on the right side of history, she wrote. Our church will be a light in this darkness. Love will prevail.
Rising in polls and name recognition among Democratic voters, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg officially entered the 2020 race for president Sunday, hopeful he can achieve a feat that has proved elusive to many: pave a successful path from a city hall to the White House.\n\nButtigieg, a 37-year-old progressive small-town mayor in deep-red Indiana with a difficult-to-pronounce last name, unexpectedly raised $7 million in donations in the first quarter, and has surged to third place in recent polls in Iowa and New Hampshire. A veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Buttigieg is also one of the first openly gay candidates to vie for a major party's presidential nomination.\n\nIt's time to walk away from the politics of the past, and toward something totally different. And so, that is why I'm here today, Buttigieg told a raucous group of more than 4,500 supporters at a rally in South Bend. My name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete. I am a proud son of South Bend, Indiana. And I am running for President of the United States.\n\nSouth Bend's Mayor Pete Buttigieg and his husband Chasten Buttigieg attend a rally to announce Pete Buttigieg's 2020 Democratic presidential candidacy in South Bend, Indiana, on Sun., April 14, 2019. Reuters\n\nSpeaking inside a former automobile manufacturing plant turned tech-incubator, the millennial mayor crafted a not-so-thinly-veiled rebuke of President Trump and Republicans. Buttigieg denounced conservative politicians for offering Midwestern communities like his hometown an impossible promise based on resentment and nostalgia to stop the clock and halt the tectonic shifts reshaping the American economy and its workforce.\n\nThe problem is, they're telling us to look for greatness in all the wrong places. Because if there is one thing the city of South Bend has shown, it's that there is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word 'again,' he added, referring to the president's signature slogan, Make America Great Again.\n\nDespite the torrential downpour outside the venue, the enthusiasm among the rally's attendees was palpable. Kyle Witzgiman, a volunteer for the mayor's presidential campaign, told CBS News he drove 13 hours from Arkansas to attend the South Bend rally.\n\nButtigieg's campaign recently announced 64 percent of his total donations came from contributions of $200 or less. His husband Chasten, who has become a breakout Twitter sensation of the 2020 race, tweeted his thanks to donors, writing, Thank you friends, we're just getting started. The small-town mayor acknowledged that while other candidates in the field may have outraised him this quarter, his number is a big deal for the underdog project.\n\nWe are not part of the national political machine. We started with just about 20,000 people on our email list, and not many people even knew who I was. But as more and more people around the country begin to hear our bold vision for the future, more and more people are investing in this effort, Buttigieg said in a statement.\n\nButtigieg has also garnered media attention for his feud with Vice President Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana who pursued anti-LGBT policies while he was in office. Buttigieg has criticized Pence for his opposition to gay marriage and gay rights, which Pence has said is informed by his Christian faith.\n\nI don't have a problem with religion, I'm religious too. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people, Buttigieg said on Ellen last week.\n\nMeanwhile, Pence accused Buttigieg of attacking his faith. I hope that Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith or attacks on the president as he seeks the highest office in the land, Pence said.\n\nNicole Sganga, Emily Tillett and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.
The bluest congressional district in the U.S. is located in the Bronx in New York City, bordering famous liberal Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district. But among the 12 contenders vying for the open congressional seat, one of the top contenders is a conservative Democrat Reverend Rubén Díaz Sr., a polarizing city councilman with a history of endorsing Republicans and making homophobic comments.\n\nDíaz Sr. is known for wearing a cowboy hat and courting controversy. He resisted calls to resign last year after saying the New York City Council was controlled by the homosexual community, although the committee he led was dissolved. Díaz Sr. has proclaimed himself to be the opposite of AOC.\n\nIn 2011, Díaz Sr. held a rally against same-sex marriage while his granddaughter held a dueling event in support of it across the street. He voted against legalizing same-sex marriage in 2009 and in 2011, when the measure was successful. He has compared abortion to the Holocaust and said murderers, assassins and criminals are pro-choice.\n\nDíaz Sr. did not respond to requests for an interview by CBS News.\n\nRubén Díaz Sr., D-Bronx, speaks during a charter school rally at the Legislative Office Building on Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2016, in Albany, N.Y. Mike Groll / AP\n\nThere's a real risk that a Trump Republican masquerading as a Democrat could represent the bluest district in America, said New York City Councilman Ritchie Torres, one of Díaz's main rivals in the race. Hillary Clinton won the congressional district by over 93% in 2016.\n\nA poll by the liberal think tank Data for Progress conducted in May found Díaz Sr. leading the field of Democratic candidates with 22% support, followed closely by Torres. Torres was the youngest person elected to the city council in 2014, and the first openly gay person to be elected to higher office in the Bronx. In an interview with CBS News, Torres painted the primary as a two-person race between himself and Díaz Sr.\n\nWe have a historic opportunity to have a new generation of leadership, and we have a historic opportunity to retire the politics of hate and fear, Torres said, adding that the election of Díaz Sr. would be one of the greatest tragedies of 2020.\n\nTorres has been endorsed by The New York Times, and several national progressive groups like the Human Rights Campaign. The Times endorsement of Torres said Díaz Sr. talks and acts like a pro-Trump Republican.\n\nAlthough he has frequently railed against same-sex marriage and abortion, Díaz Sr. has insisted that his opposition is based in his religious beliefs and not bigotry. The Puerto Rican-born Díaz Sr. is the pastor of a Pentecostal church in the Bronx. Torres argued that Díaz Sr. has an irreducible base of evangelical support.\n\nDíaz Sr. entered politics in 1993, when he was confirmed by the city council to serve on the police civilian complaint review board. He has endorsed Republicans Rudy Giuliani, George Pataki and Rick Lazio, Clinton's opponent in her 2000 run for Senate. He has more recently invited President Trump to attend his church and Senator Ted Cruz to visit his district.\n\nDíaz Sr. served as a state senator before being elected to the council in 2017. The South Bronx is filled with buildings bearing the Rubén Díaz name, such as Rubén Díaz Apartments and Rubén Díaz Plaza. His son, Rubén Díaz Jr., is the popular Bronx borough president.\n\nIn this Jan. 7, 2015 file photo, state Sen. Rubén Díaz, D-Bronx, watches in the Senate Chamber at the state Capitol in Albany, N.Y. Mike Groll / AP\n\nDíaz Jr. has not endorsed his father, and has previously distanced himself from Díaz Sr.'s more controversial comments. However, the two have frequently appeared together in recent days, including handing out food boxes to Bronx residents on June 5. The 15th Congressional District is one of the poorest in the country, with a median income of $30,000 and nearly 34% of people living below the poverty line.\n\nBronx United, a political action committee that opposes Díaz Sr., has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission earlier this month, alleging that Diaz Sr. knowingly accepted illegal corporate contributions by distributing food provided by Fresh Direct to the city borough presidents outside his city council district but within congressional district. Díaz Sr. has denied that he was campaigning.\n\nAs a pro-Trump, anti-choice, anti-LGBT politician who has spent his entire ineffective career boosting Republicans like Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin and Rudy Giuliani, Rubén Díaz Sr. should not bring his traveling circus to Washington. At a time when we need dynamic leadership, Díaz Sr.'s bizarre antics and extreme views would hurt the South Bronx and New York City, a spokesman for Bronx United said in a statement to CBS News.\n\nDíaz Sr. may also benefit from being listed on the ballot as Rubén Díaz, with no junior or senior modifier, meaning that some people may be unsure of which Rubén Díaz they are supporting.\n\nI think the fact that he's on the ballot as 'Rubén Díaz,' he's trying to confuse people, said Assemblyman Michael Blake, another candidate in the race. He absolutely is competitive, you can't ignore that, but like any campaign you have to tell your own story.\n\nBlake, who is also the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, has the support of several influential local unions. Blake has also been endorsed by the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nOcasio-Cortez and the Democratic Socialists of America are supporting community activist Samelys López. Other candidates include former city Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito; Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez; Chivona Newsome, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York; Tomas Ramos, a program director at Bronx River Community Center; and Frangell Basora, a former intern for Serrano.\n\nHaving an open congressional seat in New York City is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for many young politicians, as several members of the New York delegation have been in the House for decades. Torres noted that several of the candidates in the primary, including Blake, ran for New York City public advocate, a position seen as a stepping stone to becoming mayor, in 2019.\n\nThere are opportunistic elected officials who keep running for higher office, Torres said. He also argued that every insurgent thinks they are the reincarnation of AOC.\n\nBlake replied that people are going to vote for whoever they vote for, and said that his theme of 'Believe in the Bronx' is not just a one liner, it's a true mindset.\n\nProgressive candidates in neighboring congressional districts are gaining traction. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez in the 14th District, progressive candidate Jamaal Bowman is mounting a significant challenge to longtime incumbent Eliot Engel in the 16th Congressional District. In a region where winning the Democratic primary is tantamount to winning the election in November, whoever prevails in these contests could set the tone for the future of politics in New York City.\n\nYou have the poorest congressional district, the most diverse district, and the most Democratic district all in one. And New York-15 can demonstrate to the country where we go as a country, especially in urban America, Blake said.
When Eva Longoria spoke with CBS News last week, she kept it a secret that she was getting married on Saturday.\n\nBut the actress, producer and director still told us about her attitude toward marriage, the secret to a strong relationship and how she's doing her part to change the world through her own philanthropy and a partnership with Chivas' The Venture.\n\nTell me more about the Venture.\n\nWe're very excited. It's called Chivas' The Venture. We're giving away $1 million to people who have amazing ideas to possibly change the world. It's an important thing because my philanthropy is my life work, so when I see people creating sustainable change in their advocacy, it's so inspiring to me because the world is not built on charity and philanthropy -- it's actually built on having a sustainable business model that can continue that change. All these finalists have really done some amazing work and have amazing ideas.\n\nDo you already have any early favorites?\n\nNo, although I'm always particular to Latin American countries, and I saw an amazing woman's idea from Argentina. We have six different continents represented in the finalists, so for us, it's so exciting because so many people try to reinvent the wheel and there are so many great ideas that are already inspiring other great ideas. That's what's great -- we get to hear all of those ideas and share that thought process, and that may create another lightbulb for someone else in another country or neighborhood.\n\nDo you have any ideas on changing the world?\n\nActually, right now I've been involved in an amazing housing project with Turner Impact, with Bobby Turner. It's to create workforce housing and do it in a profitable way and a socially conscious way. When those two things line up, there's a home run, so many people think social impact doesn't have a profit, but it must in order to be sustainable. There's so much change we can make using the free market and that's what I think is pretty unique about the particular venture I'm in.\n\nYou got engaged to Jose Pepe Baston in December, and you've said before that over time your attitude toward big traditional weddings has changed.\n\nIt's not so much that it's changed, it's just that I've been there done that. I think weddings are beautiful if you want to have them, but I've been married before. It's not as monumental of a moment as when you're 22 years old and doing it for the first time. With us, it's more substantial in what we both believe. A marriage is not a wedding. We're looking forward to the marriage, not so much the wedding.\n\nDo you have any secrets to a strong relationship?\n\nCommunication and supporting each other in everything we do. I've never had a bigger cheerleader than Pepe.\n\nI'm sorry that your show Telenovela was just canceled -- of course, that was a pioneer in getting more Latinos on TV. What do you think needs to be done to see more diversity on TV?\n\nI think we need to get behind the camera, kind of like what I've been doing. Directing and producing Telenovela was super-fun. We had a great time doing it and I think we do need more networks like NBC to take risks with shows that have diverse content, but we're only going to do this as we get back behind the camera.\n\nWhat else are you working on?\n\nSeason 4 of Devious Maids premieres June 6, and I'll also be in front of the camera for that. I have a movie in development for HBO, which is an amazing biopic about an amazing lawyer in the Hispanic community in the 1950s. We have my clothing line coming out in July and we have Chivas' The Venture coming out on July 14 as well. I'm very busy and excited.
PFLUGERVILLE, Texas - A 23-year-old suspected of planting deadly bombs that struck fear across Austin was described Wednesday by his uncle as a smart and kind computer geek and a friend said he was an assertive person who would end up being kind of dominant and intimidating in conversation.\n\nNeither had any idea what might have motivated Mark Anthony Conditt, who authorities say died after detonating a bomb in his sport utility vehicle as officers moved in for an arrest near Austin. The attacks in the Texas capital and suburban San Antonio killed two people and wounded four others.\n\nI mean this is coming from nowhere. We just don't know what. I don't know how many ways to say it but everyone is caught off guard by this, Conditt's uncle, Mike Courtney of Lakewood, Colorado, told The Associated Press.\n\nAt a news conference Wednesday evening, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said he considers a 25-minute recording on a cellphone found with Conditt a confession, in which Conditt talks in great detail about the differences among the bombs he built.\n\nBut Manley suggested that there might never be a clear motive, noting where the explosives were placed or addressed seems random. CBS affiliate KEYE reports that a package dropped off at FedEx by Conditt on Sunday was labeled as being sent by Kelly Killmore to an address in South Austin that does not exist. The package was found by law enforcement on Tuesday and did not explode.\n\nConditt grew up in Pflugerville, a suburb just northeast of Austin where he was still living just a few miles from his parents' home after moving out. On Wednesday, authorities recovered homemade explosives from inside the residence, which he shared with roommates.\n\nConditt's family said in a statement they had no idea of the darkness that Mark must have been in.\n\nConditt was the oldest of four children who were all home-schooled.\n\nJeff Reeb, a neighbor of Conditt's parents in Pflugerville for about 17 years, said he watched Conditt grow up and that he always seemed smart and polite. Reeb, 75, said Conditt and his grandson played together into middle school and that Conditt regularly visited his parents, whom Reeb described as good neighbors.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Conditt's mother sent a text message to a friend on Wednesday asking her to pray for the family.\n\nConditt attended Austin Community College from 2010 to 2012 and was a business administration major, but he did not graduate, according to college spokeswoman Jessica Vess. She said records indicate that no disciplinary actions were made against Conditt.\n\nAustin bombing suspect Mark Anthony Conditt, pictured in a 2013 photo\n\nAlthough he worked for a time at an area manufacturing company, Gov. Greg Abbott told KXAN-TV in Austin that Conditt apparently was unemployed more recently and had no criminal record.\n\nConditt left little discernable trace on social media. Aside from a few photos of him on his family's Facebook pages, he addressed a range of topics in an online blog he created in 2012. Vess said he had created the blog as part of a U.S. government class project.\n\nIn the blog titled Defining my Stance he gives his opinion on several issues, often in response to commentary by someone else. Conditt wrote that gay marriage should be illegal, argued in favor of the death penalty and gave his thoughts on why we might want to consider eliminating sex offender registries.\n\nOf gay marriage, Conditt wrote: Homosexuality is not natural. Just look at the male and female bodies. They are obviously designed to couple.\n\nIn the about me section of the blog, Conditt wrote that he wasn't that politically inclined, saying he viewed himself as conservative but didn't think he had enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended. He said he hoped the class would help him do that.\n\nA friend of Conditt described him as smart, opinionated and often intimidating. Jeremiah Jensen, 24, told the Austin American-Statesman that he was close to Conditt in 2012 and 2013. Jensen said they were both home-schooled and he would often go to the Conditt home for lunch after church on Sundays and they attended Bible study and other activities together.\n\nI have no idea what caused him to make those bombs, Jensen told the newspaper .\n\nOfficials work at the scene where a suspect in a series of bombing attacks in Austin blew himself up as authorities closed in, Wednesday, March 21, 2018, in Round Rock, Texas. Eric Gay / AP\n\nHe called Conditt a deep thinker.\n\nWhen I met Mark, he was really rough around the edges, Jensen said. He was a very assertive person and would ... end up being kind of dominant and intimidating in conversation. A lot of people didn't understand him and where he was coming from. He really just wanted to tell the truth. What I remember about him he would push back on you if you said something without thinking about it.\n\nHe said the kind of hate that he succumbed to was not what Conditt believed in during high school.\n\nI don't know what happened along the way, Jensen said.\n\nJensen said Conditt had attended regular church services at Austin Stone Community Church but he didn't know if Conditt held onto his faith. A spokesman for the church said no records of past engagement or past involvement by Conditt were found.\n\nCongressman Michael McCaul told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the suspect matched the FBI's initial profile suspicion that the bomber was likely a white male. But McCaul said a psychological profile probably won't be known until investigators go through Conditt's writings and social media postings.
BUCHAREST, Romania -- Constantin Reliu learned in January that he was dead. After more than 20 years of working as a cook in Turkey, the 63-year-old returned home to Romania to discover that his wife had had him officially registered as dead.\n\nHe has since been living a legalistic nightmare of trying to prove to authorities that he is, in fact, alive. He faced a major setback Thursday when a court in the northeastern city of Vaslui refused to overturn his death certificate because his request was filed too late.\n\nThe decision, the court said, is final.\n\nI am a living ghost, Reliu told The Associated Press in a phone interview Friday from his home in Barlad, northeastern Romania.\n\nI am officially dead, although I'm alive, he said. I have no income and because I am listed as dead, I can't do anything.\n\nConstantin Reliu, 63, is pictured at his place in the eastern town of Barlad, Romania, on March 16, 2018. Adrian Arnautu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDuring the interview, Reliu was deeply emotional, starting off by saying I think I am going to cry and going on to voice rage and a desire for revenge against his wife, who now lives in Italy.\n\nI am not sure whether I am divorced or not, he said. I am not sure whether she is married to someone else or not. Nobody will tell me.\n\nReliu explained that he first went to work in Turkey in 1992 and returned in 1995 to the first big shock of his marriage - his wife's infidelity. In 1999, he decided to return to Turkey for good.\n\nThe AP was not able to locate his wife to hear her side of the story.\n\nLast December Turkish authorities detained him over expired papers and in January deported him to Romania.\n\nUpon landing at Bucharest airport, he was informed by border officials that he had been officially declared dead and underwent six hours of questioning and tests.\n\nThey measured the distance between his eyes to see if it corresponded to an old passport photograph; they asked him questions about his hometown, such as where the town hall was; they checked his fingerprints.\n\nThey decided that it was me! he said.\n\nBut authorities in Barlad were less convinced. He spent weeks trying to persuade them to issue him papers so that he officially existed, he said. When that failed, he asked them to overturn the ruling on his death certificate, issued in 2016, which also ended in failure Thursday on procedural grounds.\n\nReliu said he would like to file a fresh lawsuit but has no money and suffers from diabetes, which makes everything more difficult.\n\nHe also said he has been banned for life from returning to Turkey but would like to write to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to appeal the decision.
Produced by Liza Finley, Richard Fetzer and Emily Wichick\n\nShe's become a national obsession -- Lori Vallow Daybell, the Rexburg, Idaho, mother who never reported her 7–year-old son JJ and 17- year-old daughter Tylee missing. No one has seen the children in months. And despite her arrest on child abandonment charges, she's still not talking.\n\nBut according to her family, there is a reason for that.\n\nJJ Vallow, Tylee Ryan disappear in September. Months later, there's no sign of life. There's no sign of death. There are just questions, frustrating questions, said investigative reporter Morgan Loew. Kay Woodcock\n\nNow, as a nationwide hunt for the missing children continues, Lori Vallow Daybell's mother, Janis Cox, and her sister, Summer Shiflet, reveal theories to 48 Hours on what may have happened -- even whether the children could be hidden in a bunker somewhere out of sight – and why she's staying silent.\n\nShe would never harm her children, Cox tells CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti. And I know her.\n\nI don't know all of her reasons for doing what she's doing, says Shiflet. But I know she has … has the reasons.\n\nBut first, back to the Lori Vallow Daybell the rest of the world knows: a woman who has a lot of explaining to do, says investigative reporter and 48 Hours consultant Morgan Loew. Lori Daybell has two missing children. Lori Daybell is connected to suspicious deaths. Lori Daybell appears to be somebody that has a black cloud over her ... unless she's the one that is causing these bad things to happen.\n\nThat's what the FBI and authorities in at least three states are trying to figure out as they sort through a convoluted tale that many believe will lead to murder charges\n\nA DEADLY PREMONITION\n\nThe allegations that still shock friends who knew Lori Vallow Daybell before she became one of the most vilified women in America.\n\nApril Raymond: You never wanna believe that somebody … you cared about or … looked up to … is capable of something heinous. But, unfortunately … that might not be the reality here …\n\nThis Lori is nothing like the friend she used to know, says April Raymond, whom 48 Hours spoke to on Skype. They met in 2015 at the local Mormon church when Lori and her husband, Charles Vallow, moved to Kauai from Arizona.\n\nApril Raymond: Everyone fell in love with her right away … she really did bring a lot of joy to the people that she surrounded herself with.\n\nEverything about Lori seemed to sparkle, says Raymond, including her marriage to Charles, a successful investment advisor.\n\nCharles and Lori Vallow Kay Woodcock\n\nApril Raymond: I had never seen two people married that were … what I perceived, as genuinely happy with one another. And I— I thought that those two were.\n\nCharles was Lori's fourth husband. He'd been married before, too, and both had grown children. But together they were raising a new family: Tylee Ryan, Lori's daughter from a former marriage, and the recently adopted JJ, Charles's sister's grandson.\n\nApril Raymond: Lori was an exceptional mother. She was the mother that, you know, everyone wanted to be.\n\nEcho Itaaehau: My daughter loved Lori just as much as she loved Tylee.\n\nEcho Itaaehau's daughter, Vaisia, was best friends with Tylee, and a constant visitor at the Vallow home in both Arizona and Hawaii.\n\nEcho Itaaehau: When the girls would go to the mall, or to the movies, or to the lake. In Hawaii they would go — paddle boarding, go to the beach, ziplining, all those adventures. Lori was always there and always a part of it.\n\nAnd so was Lori's son JJ, who has autism and special needs.\n\nApril Robertson: I really admired how patient she was with him and how much care she took of him.\n\nThat included a service dog named Bailey. Neal Mestas was Bailey's trainer.\n\nNeal Mestas: The dog helped settle him down, keep him calm.\n\nBut even Bailey could not take the place of his big sister.\n\nEcho Itaaehau: Tylee and JJ have — an incredible bond and just a beautiful relationship. And she took care of him — and takes care of him as a second mom would.\n\nEcho Itaaehau: And she's super sweet. She can be sassy. She's just— a wonderful, awesome girl.\n\nBut in 2017, the family dynamic began to shift. Tylee was missing her friends on the mainland, so they moved back to Arizona. Then something in Lori began to change.\n\nMorgan Loew: From what we have heard she started to pay a little less attention to the kids … and that's when the rift in the marriage started happening.\n\nApril Raymond says Lori had begun reading the books of Chad Daybell, a novelist and podcaster from Rexburg, Idaho, who told stories about doomsday and people preparing for the end of the world. Over time, some say Lori became more and more obsessed with these extreme religious beliefs, venturing way beyond traditional Mormon doctrine.\n\nMorgan Loew: In the beginning of 2019, Lori disappeared. She took off and left Charles with the two kids. … they had no idea where she was, and this was for about, like, two months.\n\nMorgan Loew: We think that she met up with Chad Daybell at that point, and she starts communicating with Charles in some really strange language … she was saying that she believes that she's a chosen one. And that she can speak to dead people.\n\nShe also spoke to April Raymond about it.\n\nApril Raymond: She felt like she had existed on Earth several times. She felt like she had supernatural powers.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: The friend you knew before was basically the world's perfect soccer mom and now she's … saying she is essentially a reincarnated God?\n\nApril Raymond That's correct.\n\nThen, Raymond says, Lori said something that would take on an even more sinister cast in the months ahead.\n\nApril Raymond: She — told me that Charles was already dead and that there was a demon living inside of him.\n\nMorgan Loew: According to Charles, she even said, If you get in my way, I will murder you. I will murder you. … and at that point, Charles Vallow decided he is going to file for divorce.\n\nCharles was so spooked by his wife of almost 13 years, he put his fears in writing.\n\nMorgan Loew: It's right there in the divorce paperwork. Charles was worried about his life, and he was also worried about the lives of JJ and Tylee … He knew that bad things were on the horizon.\n\nSadly, Charles Vallow could not have been more right. Around 7:40 a.m. on the morning of July 11, 2019, Charles went to Lori's rental home in Chandler, Arizona, to take JJ to school. Less than an hour later, Charles was dead. Lori's brother, Alex Cox, had shot him. At 8:36 a.m., Alex Cox placed this 911 call:\n\n911 DISPATCHER: Is he breathing? ALEX COX: I can't tell.\n\nMorgan Loew: He said, I need to report a shooting. I — I shot my brother-in-law in self-defense.\n\n911 DISPATCHER: And is he hurt? Is he alive or —? ALEX COX: Yeah, there's blood. He's not moving.\n\nChad Cox talks with police after shooting Charles Vallow. Chandler Police Department\n\nThe police arrived and shot bodycam video of Alex Cox on the curb outside the home. He tells them that Charles and Lori got into a fight:\n\nCHANDLER POLICE OFFICER. [bodycam video]: So, you get in an argument? What is it over? ALEX COX: Well, it was over my sister. He was getting physical with her.\n\nThen he says Tylee came out of her room with a bat:\n\nALEX COX [bodycam video]: She came out to defend my sister with her bat.\n\nCox says Charles then grabbed the bat from Tylee and came at him, hitting him in the back of the head:\n\nALEX COX [bodycam video]: So, I went to my room and got my gun.\n\nCox then tells the officer he came back and shot Charles twice in the chest.\n\nBoth Tylee, who had run outside, and Lori say they heard the shooting but didn't see it. Lori says she then walked past Charles's body and left the house to get JJ – who'd been waiting in the car. She and Tylee then drove him to school.\n\nMorgan Loew: And at some point, a little later that morning, Lori and Tylee come walking up to the house.\n\nCHANDLER POLICE OFFICER [Bodycam video]: Hi, who are – are you? [Lori speaks] OK, just stand over there for just a second, guys.\n\nIn the bodycam video, police blurred Tylee's face because she was a minor.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER [Bodycam video]: Does your husband live here or no?\n\nLORI VALLOW: No. POLICE OFFICER: OK.\n\nMorgan Loew: What was striking about the footage … was that … they were very nonchalant.\n\nA smiling Lori Vallow Daybell on police bodycam video Chandler Police Department\n\nPOLICE OFFICER [Bodycam video]: How long have you lived here?\n\nLORI VALLOW: Like 3 weeks. POLICE OFFICER: Oh geez, yeah, OK. LORI VALLOW: That's why the neighbors don't know us very well. POLICE OFFICER: Gotcha. LORI VALLOW: Like, Hi neighbors, sorry [laughs]. POLICE OFFICER: Are you working at all?\n\nAll three were questioned at the police headquarters and released. Raymond learned of Charles's death on Google.\n\nApril Raymond: it all started to make a lot more sense.\n\nSuddenly, Raymond remembered that strange thing Lori said in the months before the shooting: that Charles was already dead and had a demon living inside of him.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: What went on in your mind?\n\nApril Raymond: I felt really sick. … And I just knew something was very, very wrong\n\nA CHOSEN ONE\n\nLori Vallow didn't waste any time, says reporter Morgan Loew. Less than two months after her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, was shot dead, she packed up her two kids and moved to Rexburg, Idaho, home of that author and podcaster Chad Daybell — a known voice among doomsday preppers.\n\nMorgan Loew |Reporter and 48 Hours consultant: They believe that the end of the world is coming, and it is coming soon. And that it is incumbent upon them to prepare for it. And that means stockpiling food and supplies, so that they can survive until they are taken to heaven.ad been ordained to lead the chosen ones.\n\nLori Vallow and Chad Daybell Rexburg Police Department\n\nApril Raymond: In her mind there were 144,000 people that were going to survive Armageddon. She had been appointed to gather the remaining members of the chosen.\n\nRaymond says Lori tried to recruit her as one of the chosen, but it would have come at a heavy price: her two boys.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: What did being a chosen one entail?\n\nApril Raymond: Basically, that I would — need to separate myself from my children and join her and … find the other chosen ones so that we could all be together. … I respectfully declined her offer because that was just— was going too far.\n\nIn early September, Lori, Tylee and JJ moved into a townhouse in Rexburg. Her brother, Alex Cox, moved into the same complex.\n\nMorgan Loew: Alex and Lori had a really close relationship. I think it was more than brother who looks after sister. I think it was more of brother who was the enforcer, who punished people who crossed sister.\n\nIn 2007, long before Alex Cox shot and killed Charles Vallow, he attacked Lori's third husband Joe Ryan with a taser gun and was sentenced to 90 days in jail\n\nMorgan Loew Lori sort of viewed Alex as the destroyer of bad things in her eyes … he was there to take care of the problems.\n\nThat's what makes a now-famous picture of Tylee so terrifying to so many. It was taken on September 8, about a week after they arrived in Idaho, says private investigator Rich Robertson.\n\nRich Robertson: There are photographs that show her and JJ and Alex … in Yellowstone Park.\n\nMorgan Loew: And that was the last time she was seen … And the key there is that Alex was there.\n\nTylee Ryan, 17 and Joshua JJ Vallow, 7, at Yellowstone National Park on September 8, 2019 -- the last time Tylee was seen. At right is their mother's brother Alex Cox. There is no evidence Tylee ever left the park FBI\n\nWe know JJ left the park that day. Pictures from a neighbor's doorbell camera show him nine days later. We also know he attended school until September 23. On September 24, Lori told JJ's teachers she was going to homeschool him.\n\nMorgan Loew: That's the last anybody saw … him …\n\nThe following week, Lori bought a $36 ring on Amazon. The next day she reportedly shopped online for a wedding dress. It would soon be clear who the intended groom was: Chad Daybell.\n\nMorgan Loew: Most of the arrows point to them having a relationship … while they were still married to other people.\n\nCharles Vallow was now gone. But when Lori bought that ring, Daybell's wife of 29 years, Tammy Daybell, was still very much alive. All that changed just 17 days later when the 49-year-old died unexpectedly.\n\nMorgan Loew: Tammy's death was odd from the beginning. Family said she died in her sleep. They didn't want an autopsy performed. She was buried in Utah.\n\nApproximately two weeks later, Chad Daybell married Lori Vallow in Hawaii. They did more than just start new lives. They reinvented their old ones, telling Chad's parents that Lori was an empty nester.\n\nBut then the façade came crashing down when JJ's grandparents in Louisiana, Kay and Larry Woodcock, could take it no more.\n\nMorgan Loew: Every time grandma Kay Woodcock would call, there would be a different excuse about where the kids were. … And finally said, Something is weird here. She had heard enough excuses. She finally reached out to the police.\n\nIn late November, over two months after the children were last seen, Rexburg Police knocked on Lori's door to check on the kids.\n\nRich Robertson: Lori said they weren't there. Lori told … 'em that the kids were staying … with a friend of hers down in Arizona.\n\nArizona authorities then went to that friend's house who told them JJ and Tylee were not there.\n\nRich Robertson: So, at that point, somebody was lying. … And it was most likely Lori\n\nBut she wasn't the only one. When questioned by police, detectives noted that Chad acted as if he didn't know Lori very well. Chad Daybell left out one crucial detail: that he and Lori had been married for three weeks.\n\nMorgan Loew: These lies were starting to catch up with Chad and Lori.\n\nRich Robertson: At that point Rexburg Police executed a search warrant\n\nRich Robertson: But… they were gone.\n\nThey had left town. The police quickly issued a statement that the children's lives were in danger.\n\nRich Robertson: At that point … everything changed.\n\nLori was about to become one of the most hated women in America.\n\nSummer Shiflet | Lori's sister: I've heard things said about Lori … that none of them are true. … This mob mentality of … Lori … just … hung in a public square, basically is what it feels like.\n\nWHERE ARE JJ & TYLEE?\n\nWhen news hit that the two smiling siblings disappeared and their mother never reported them missing, people the world over were transfixed by the bizarre story of the cult mom and her missing kids.\n\nArmies of citizen cyber sleuths came together online. Rexburg mom Dee Ann Carter is one of them.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: What is it about this story that brings together so many people from so many different backgrounds from all over the world?\n\nDee Ann Carter: It's these two children … people connect … you wanna help. You wanna do what you can.\n\nTheir Facebook group, Christmas Misery, is 14,000 strong and growing, says Annie Southam.\n\nAnnie Southam: With so many people, with so many different areas of expertise, putting those pieces together, hopefully the whole puzzle can kinda be solved.\n\nOn the home front, JJ's grandparents Larry and Kay Woodcock launched a public crusade.\n\nLarry and Kay Woodcock KPHO\n\nLarry Woodcock: It breaks my heart; it's killing my soul. … I just want those kids back.\n\nAs family, friends and strangers were begging for answers, Lori and Chad were in Hawaii enjoying an extended honeymoon.\n\nAnnie Southam: There's some stuff that … disgusts me, like … their pictures on the beach … where he's playin' the ukulele and she's dancing around in her dress.\n\nMorgan Loew: But, as … this case started building steam, their ability to live a normal life there started to erode. They had trouble just going outside their front door. Because they didn't know if they were gonna run into investigators or journalists.\n\nEast Idaho News reporter Nate Eaton tracked them down at a local resort:\n\nLori Vallow Daybell has no comment about her children's whereabouts when tracked down at a resort in Hawaii. East Idaho News\n\nEAST IDAHO REPORTER: Lori, Nate Eaton with East Idaho News. Can you tell me where your kids are EAST IDAHO REPORTER: Where are your kids? LORI VALLOW DAYBELL: No comment. EAST IDAHO REPORTER: No comment? There's people around the country praying for your children, praying for you guys…why don't you give us answers? LORI VALLOW DAYBELL: That's great. EAST IDAHO REPORTER: That's great. That's great that they're praying for you, praying for your kids, what? LORI VALLOW DAYBELL: [doesn't answer]\n\nOn January 25, 2020, Lori was ordered to produce the children to Idaho authorities in five days. She ignored it.\n\nMorgan Loew: So … she's placed under arrest. She's taken into custody in Kauai.\n\nLori was charged with three misdemeanors and two felony counts of desertion and nonsupport of dependent children. It was a devastating blow to Lori's mother Janis Cox and sister Summer Shiflet.\n\nCox spoke to her daughter after the arrest.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: And when you asked her how are my grandchildren doing, what did she say?\n\nJanis Cox: As far as I can I remember, she said, you know me mom, the kids are fine.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti : Deep down do you believe that?\n\nJanis Cox: I did believe it. Yes.\n\nSummer Shiflet: She said the same thing to me …\n\nJanis Cox: We know there's a whole 'nother side to this story.\n\nCox and Shiflet sat down with48 Hours for their first television interview – to try and tell us that story. A story they say that began almost a year ago back in Arizona.\n\nSummer Shiflet and Janis Cox. She's not a monster. She's not a heartless, cold, calculated-- murderous type of person, said Shiflet. CBS News\n\nSummer Shiflet: After Charles had died, Lori had been continuously threatened. And she wanted to go somewhere safe. … she didn't wanna tell any of us where she was going because she was being followed and threatened.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: Threatened by who?\n\nSummer Shiflet: By people who loved Charles and want revenge for his death.\n\nCharles Vallow's family say there never were any threats— not even close, but Cox and Shiflet say Lori was so scared, she fled to Idaho to protect herself and her children. They believe she could be hiding them now to keep them safe.\n\nSummer Shiflet I don't know all of her reasons for doing what she's doing. … But I know she has … has the reasons.\n\nBut that still doesn't explain why Lori was off in Hawaii dancing on the beach with Chad Daybell while her children were nowhere to be found.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: Something's not adding up here. Where are they? Where is JJ and Tylee?\n\nSummer Shiflet: It's a great question. We would love to know the answer to that. We don't know. But … we are very confident that Lori would never harm her children…\n\nSummer Shiflet: She's the best person I know … She's just the kindest, loving person that there is.\n\nThey say the real Lori is nothing like the doomsday zealot Charles wrote about in his divorce papers.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: Is Lori part of some strange cult?\n\nJanis Cox: No.\n\nSummer Shiflet: No, not that we know of, no—\n\nJanis Cox: No.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: Not — she's not preparing for the end of the world, she doesn't believe that she is leading the 144,000—\n\nJanis Cox: No.\n\nSummer Shiflet: She has never said the end of the world is gonna happen in July. That has never come from her mouth or lips ever.\n\nSummer Shiflet : A lot of the things that have been reported … any small truths that are in there have been twisted. But most of them are flat out not even true.\n\nFor example, the police reported no one saw or heard from JJ after September 23, but Janis Cox says she called Lori on October 1 — a full week later — and could hear JJ playing in the background. She gave 48 Hours her phone records that showed a 97-minute call.\n\nJanis Cox: He was alive and well.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: How do you know that though?\n\nJanis Cox: Because I know JJ … no one's gonna pretend to be JJ.\n\nAt one point, she says JJ actually got on the phone and said, Hi Mimi, his nickname for her.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: You spoke with him though on the phone?\n\nJanis Cox: Yeah. Yes. And I heard him and he was out playing … And— he just takes the phone, you know — and he knows — you know, he knows who we are.\n\nJanis Cox: So he still knew I'm Mimi, you know? He still knew me, Mimi.\n\nThe Rexburg police aren't commenting on the call. But Cox and Shiflet want to set the record straight on something else – or rather someone else: their son and brother Alex Cox, Lori's so-called enforcer — the man who shot and killed Charles Vallow.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: Is Alex the henchman here?\n\nSummer Shiflet: No [laughs].\n\nJanis Cox: No, he's not.\n\nSummer Shiflet: Alex was the most easygoing, relaxed, hilarious h— type of person. … There's nothing about him that was a hit man...\n\nBut we may never know the true story. On December 12, Alex Cox suddenly passed out and later died; an autopsy determined of natural causes\n\nBut we're still awaiting the autopsy results in another death. Tammy Daybell's body was exhumed two months after being buried to perform toxicology tests.\n\nMorgan Loew: And … why do you run a toxicology test? Because you're looking for drugs or you are looking for poison. And why would they be looking for poison? Because they're investigating the possibility that she was murdered.\n\nWhat started as a hunt for two missing children expanded into something much bigger and even darker. And despite what her family believes, it wasn't looking good for the former beauty queen, says Morgan Loew.\n\nMorgan Loew: Looking at these cases separately, you begin to see that there is a common denominator. And that common denominator is Lori Vallow. She has a dead husband … She has two missing children. She has a new husband who has a dead wife. … She is the factor that connects all of these separate cases together.\n\nTHE MYSTERY DEEPENS\n\nOn March 5, 2020 – five months after police say Lori Vallow Daybell's children were last seen – she was extradited from Hawaii to a tiny airport in Rexburg, Idaho, to face child abandonment charges. Morgan Loew was there.\n\nMorgan Loew: She gets out of the plane and she's wearing a bulletproof vest. And surrounded by officers. And they whisk her into this vehicle.\n\nAfter being one of the first reporters in the country on this story, Loew had Lori within earshot.\n\nMorgan Loew: The SUV stopped right in front of me. And I find myself four inches away from Lori.\n\nWhere are your kids? How come you're not telling anybody where your kids are? investigative reporter Morgan Loew asks Lori Vallow Daybell. KPHO\n\nMorgan Loew:And she looked through the window … with this weird sort of blank expression on her face, and then turned her head.\n\nMorgan Loew: The day of Lori's initial appearance in Rexburg, the courtroom was jam-packed. … And Lori walks in. And she's wearing this orange and white stripped jail outfit and this red lipstick\n\nMorgan Loew: It was such an odd sight to see.\n\nJUDGE: Ms. Daybell, do you understand what Count 1 alleges, as well as the maximum penalties? LORI VALLOW DAYBELL: Yes.\n\nOn Lori Vallow Daybell's initial appearance in Rexburg, the courtroom was jam-packed. Pool/NBC\n\nDee Ann Carter: I don't like to — hate on people [laughs] or talk badly. But it — it did make me mad. She … had done herself up, made herself look good, but still nothing about the children.\n\nKay Woodcock is trying to hold onto hope, but her mind keeps going back to something Charles told her Lori said about JJ.\n\nKay Woodcock: She didn't want JJ anymore. JJ was too much for her to handle.\n\nAdding to Kay's concerns, police discovered a bottle of prescription medicine for JJ's autism with 17 pills remaining. The last time it had been filled was months before JJ disappeared.\n\nAnd remember JJ's service dog, Bailey? The one he loved so much? Lori returned him three weeks before JJ disappeared, which still baffles the dog's trainer.\n\nJJ Vallow with his service dog Bailey. Kay Woodcock\n\nNeal Mestas: At first, I said, I don't think I heard you right. … it would take — a very cold and callous person, which I— I think that's who she is.\n\nLori's sister and mother say that's nonsense. They claim Lori stockpiled JJ's medication, so he didn't need that pill bottle found by police. And as for Bailey?\n\nJanis Cox: I don't think Bailey's an issue, as far as JJ is concerned.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: There's a lot going on that just doesn't add up —\n\nJanis Cox: OK. I — I do know about the dog. I was over there a lot. Charles loved Bailey. JJ was not really attached to it—\n\nSummer Shiflet: He was fine without him.\n\nBut in the months after JJ and Tylee went missing, Lori made several trips to a Rexburg, Idaho, storage unit. And inside that unit?\n\nMorgan Loew: Things that belonged to the kids: bicycles, toys, things like that. … It's pretty tough to come to a different conclusion other than … the kids were no longer around and no longer needed this stuff.\n\nEven more damning than what Lori left behind, may be what she took with her to Hawaii: JJ and Tylee's birth certificates, Tylee's bankcard, which had been used since her disappearance, and Tylee's cell phone.\n\nApril Raymond: I don't know any teenage girl … that would be OK with being separated from her phone\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: How about Tylee's cell phone?\n\nJanis Cox: She told me … in — September … that she had confiscated Tylee's cell phone.\n\nJanis and Summer say Lori didn't want Tylee to be tracked through her phone; she was always fearful of those who she said threatened her and the kids.\n\nSummer Shiflet: She put her daughter first all the time. … she loves her daughter and her children. And … she always was, like, putting Tylee's … and JJ's needs ahead of her own.\n\nBut by April 2020 the investigation had moved beyond the children's disappearance. Authorities were looking into Lori and Chad for murder in Tammy Daybell's death, and they were taking a harder look at the death of Charles Vallow.\n\nINVESTIGATOR [at the crime scene]: He shot the f--- outta him, I'll tell you that.\n\nMorgan Loew: Maybe this wasn't self-defense. Maybe this was a setup. And, I can tell you that people who know Charles or knew Charles … believe that he was lured to that house to be murdered.\n\nApril Raymond, for one, has never believed that story about Charles hitting Alex in the head with a baseball bat.\n\nApril Raymond: One, because Charles wasn't a violent person. The second being that Charles had been a baseball player and an athlete in college and if he had hit Alex with the bat in the way that they claimed that he did — Alex would have been a lot more injured.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Got a little laceration, do you want me to call paramedics? ALEX COX: No, I'd really like some water, though.\n\nCharles Vallow was afraid of Lori according to those divorce documents.\n\nRich Robertson: He wrote about what he thought might happen to him. … And he was rightfully afraid of that.\n\nSummer Shiflet: He wasn't scared of Lori. … even the whole time he was filing for divorce and all those things, he was begging for her to come back.\n\nToday it is JJ's grandparents who are doing the begging:\n\nLARRY WOODCOCK [to reporters]: I have a tendency to get very emotional when I talk about the children. I get extremely emotional when I talk about JJ. JJ is my heart.\n\nThe Woodcocks are offering a $20,000 reward for any information leading to the children's return.\n\nWhile they wait and hope, the FBI has turned its attention to Yellowstone – the last place Tylee was seen.\n\nAaron Teasdale: Yellowstone is one of the last truly wild places left in this country … There are many ways to die in Yellowstone Park.\n\nTHE SEARCH CONTINUES\n\nIt's still hard for Echo Itaaehau to believe that life went from forever to gone.\n\nEcho Itaaehau: It's so sad. … Just this whole thing. Just all of it is just heartbreaking.\n\nItaaehau says she and her daughter Vaisia, Tylee's best friend, are praying she and JJ are still alive and hidden somewhere safe to ride out the apocalypse.\n\nEcho Itaaehau: The only place they could be is in a compound, or a bunker, or someplace completely off the grid.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: Janis, do you think they're in a bunker somewhere?\n\nJanis Cox: I think that's possible.\n\nBut with all the headlines, accusations Lori believes in zombies, and Lori's past talk of demons and possession, April Raymond is fearing the worst.\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: Do you think Lori Vallow is capable of killing her two kids?\n\nApril Raymond: The Lori I knew, absolutely not. But … I don't know what the real Lori Vallow is capable of.\n\nLori allegedly asked Chad Daybell to judge her children in terms of dark and light spirits. A recently uncovered email from Chad to Lori in October 2018, gives Tylee a rating of 4.1 D — D meaning dark. Sadly, it's not surprising to April.\n\nApril Raymond: It pains me to say, but — she would say that Tylee had a dark spirit.\n\nThe FBI is reportedly about to launch a dark mission of its own — a search in Yellowstone National Park, the last place Tylee Ryan was seen. Aaron Teasdale is a Yellowstone expert and 48 Hours consultant.\n\nAaron Teasdale: Yellowstone Park is a very mysterious place. … You've got— places that are quite remote. … So, if you wanted to get away with something, or hide something, Yellowstone is an excellent place for that.\n\nA possibility almost too terrible to consider — that theory that Tylee could have been pushed into one of Yellowstone's many boiling pools, the so-called hot pots.\n\nAnnie Southam: There are cases of people that have fallen into those and their bodies just completely dissolve. … that's a really terrible thought.\n\nAaron Teasdale is skeptical of this theory.\n\nAaron Teasdale: There's different acidities. There's different temperatures. … If you don't pick the right pool, it's not necessarily going to work.\n\nBut Yellowstone – with its rugged terrain and wild ways – is good at keeping its secrets, says Teasdale.\n\nAaron Teasdale: If there is a dead thing in Yellowstone, the living community of the park will find it. … Sometimes the bones will even get eaten. … In a situation like this — it's entirely possible that there will be very little to find.\n\nLori Vallow Daybell remains in jail in Rexburg, Idaho. In May 2020, she appeared in court to ask a judge to reduce her million dollar bond, wearing a mask due to the coronavirus pandemic. That request was denied. Lori's lawyer, Mark Means, spoke after the hearing:\n\nMARK MEANS [to reporters]: Regardless of how you feel about religious beliefs, personal beliefs, actions, inactions, she's entitled to a defense. … we maintain her innocence.\n\nChad Daybell has not been charged with any crime and appears to stand by Lori. JJ's grandmother, Kay Woodcock, is now appealing to Chad on Facebook, writing, SHOW US IF TYLEE & JJ ARE OKAY and I am begging you, CHAD end this NOW. In a little over a week it will be JJ's 8th birthday.\n\nIf you have any information about Tylee and JJ, contact Rexburg Police at (208) 359-3000. CBS News\n\nJonathan Vigliotti: Every night, before you go to bed, you know you're waking up to this reality … What do you think before you fall asleep?\n\nKay Woodcock: I pray. … We just pray about it. That's all we can do.\n\nTylee and JJ's other grandmother says she's doing the same thing.\n\nJanis Cox: We love Tylee and JJ with all of our hearts.\n\nAs the search for Tylee and JJ continues. their silent presence hovers over the town of Rexburg … two children who vanished into thin air with no sign of life, no sign of death.\n\nIf you have any information about Tylee and JJ, contact Rexburg Police at (208) 359-3000.

Australia's Israel Folau seen Nov. 24, 2018. Reuters\n\nIsrael Folau and his anti-gay sentiments appear to have gone too far this time. Rugby Australia said Thursday it plans to terminate the fullback's contract with the national team after he made anti-gay comments on social media for the second year in a row.\n\nWhen Folau made similar remarks on April 5, 2018, he escaped with a warning but no sanction, the BBC reported. Now, only five months from the start of the Rugby World Cup in Japan, where Folau was expected to be one of Australia's leading players, Rugby Australia wasn't so lenient.\n\nRA chief executive Raelene Castle said in a statement that she and NSW Rugby Union head Andrew Hore made repeated attempts to contact Folau directly and via his representatives on Thursday, but that he failed to communicate with them.\n\nAs a code we have made it clear to Israel formally and repeatedly that any social media posts or commentary that is in any way disrespectful to people because of their sexuality will result in disciplinary action, Castle said. In the absence of compelling mitigating factors, it is our intention to terminate his contract.\n\nFolau, one of the sport's top players, published a message on his Instagram account late Wednesday saying that hell awaits drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, idolators.\n\nCastle said that while Folau was entitled to his religious beliefs, the way in which he has expressed these beliefs is inconsistent with the values of the sport. We want to make it clear that he does not speak for the game with his recent social media posts.\n\nIsrael has failed to understand ... that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality, Castle said.\n\nAustralian airline Qantas, a national team sponsor, issued a statement earlier Thursday saying Folau's comments clearly don't reflect the spirit of inclusion and diversity that we support.\n\nFolau has also publicly aired his opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe 30-year-old Folau has 316,000 Instagram followers. By late afternoon Thursday, the controversial post had received 14,700 likes and 13,800 comments.\n\nFolau has played 73 test matches for Australia. Last weekend while playing for the New South Wales Waratahs, Folau scored his 60th try, the most of any player in Super Rugby, breaking the record of former New Zealand winger Doug Howlett.\n\nTwo months ago, Folau signed a multimillion-dollar contract extension to remain with the Waratahs and Australian rugby until the end of 2022. Australian media had reported previously that Folau would walk away from any contract if his religious opinions and views on homosexuality were silenced.\n\nOn Thursday, before Rugby Australia's statement, some contemplated that Folau again made the anti-gay comments so he could be released from the new long-term deal.\n\nThere were reports Thursday that he again might take up a rugby league contract, one of three football codes, including Australian Rules football, that he has played.\n\nFormer Wallabies captain Stirling Mortlock said Folau had pushed Rugby Australia into a corner and they have to act.\n\nEveryone knows his point of view, right? He's done this a number of times already, Mortlock told the Australian Associated Press. So it's more (about) what was the motivation ... knowing full well that he was probably going to get sanctioned.\n\nFormer England rugby international Joe Marler, who plays for London club Harlequins, mocked Folau by posting two images of men kissing. Another former England international, James Haskell, wrote to Folau on Twitter and said sport has no place for this ... keep it to hate groups. You are an unreal player, but a ... misinformed bigot.\n\nFormer Wales rugby player Gareth Thomas, who announced he was gay in 2009, wrote on Twitter that people should not be influenced by Folau's words and that Thomas had sympathy for Folau.\n\nBritain-based LGBT charity Stonewall supported Rugby Australia's move.\n\nFolau's comments are just one example of how much work is still left to do to combat discrimination and the use of hateful language against lesbian, gay, bi and trans (gender) people, said Kirsty Clarke, the director of sport at Stonewall.

Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020.\n\nBeto O'Rourke Beto O'Rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 O'Rourke was born and raised in the Texas border city of El Paso. The former congressman tried to topple Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and failed, but in the process shattered fundraising records and became one of the best known Democrats in the country. At age 46, he's one of the younger contenders for the Democratic nomination.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper John Hickenlooper joins crowded 2020 race 04:09 Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper has the most executive experience in the field, having served as governor from 2011 to 2019 and as Denver mayor for two terms before that. He followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his career as a geologist then later going into the brewpub business, a pursuit which made him a millionaire. The 67-year-old is perhaps best known for overseeing the legalization of marijuana in Denver while he was mayor and in Colorado as governor, although he opposed it.\n\nJay Inslee Jay Inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 The governor of Washington served two stints in Congress, a single term in the 1990s and then six Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1973 and a J.D. from Willamette University College of Law in Oregon three years later. After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values. During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free. However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward, Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure\n\nBernie Sanders Bernie Sanders on 2020: We're going to win 04:49 A senator and former congressman from Vermont, Sanders, a democratic socialist, came to prominence nationally when he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Although he ultimately lost to Hillary Clinton, Sanders developed a devoted following among younger Democrats despite being an independent. At 78, Sanders is one of the oldest contenders for the Democratic nomination. A native of Brooklyn, he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont in the 1980s.\n\nAmy Klobuchar Klobuchar announces 2020 presidential bid 25:20 Biography Amy Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis. Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an F rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light. I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.\n\nCory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,' Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration. After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system. Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his Spartacus moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has no chance in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: Because I know him. He has no chance. In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker ran Newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself, Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year.\n\nPete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg explores presidential bid 06:09 Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing. The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different. Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.\n\nKamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 run 05:19 Biography Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat. In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail. Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does. Harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nElizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 202... 02:18 Biography Warren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office. Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice. During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. The problem is Washington works great for those with influence. Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. We make our campaigns work through the people. Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn't work out too well, Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her. Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her. Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate. Issues Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the Don't ask, don't tell policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 Minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate. The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct. She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors, including billionaire George Soros, have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken. She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017, she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public. What Trump says President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! Mr. Trump tweeted. Critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office, Gillibrand wrote on Twitter in response.\n\nJulián Castro Julián Castro launches 2020 campaign 08:32 Biography Julián Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating him and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman. Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues. In his exit memo from the agency, Castro said that HUD had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. Under the Obama administration, he wrote, HUD invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects. Views on LGBT issues and abortion rights He supports LGBT rights and was the first San Antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's Pride Parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the Mayors for the Freedom to Marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012. Castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. He spoke at the annual luncheon for Planned Parenthood South Texas in May. Controversy In 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. Castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the Hatch Act in his department. What Trump says Castro has not yet been a target for President Trump. Unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, Mr. Trump has never personally disparaged Castro on Twitter. Issues In his video announcing his exploratory committee in December, Castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants. No matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, Castro said.\n\nTulsi Gabbard Rep. Tulsi Gabbard launches 2020 campaign 05:28 Tulsi Gabbard was born in American Samoa in 1981, and her family moved to Hawaii when she was 2 years old. Her mother, Carol, is a practicing Hindu, a religion Gabbard adopted. Her father, Mike, is a member of the Hawaii state Senate. After growing up in a politically active family, Gabbard became a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. While serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. She deployed in Iraq and returned in 2006. After returning from her second deployment in 2009, Gabbard ran for Honolulu City Council. She served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first practicing Hindu in Congress. Issues Gabbard is very progressive, and one of the few members of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. She resigned her position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse him. Gabbard is a supporter of a woman's right to an abortion and received a 100 percent rating from NARAL. She has emphasized environmental and economic issues during her tenure, and supports a $15 minimum wage. She also supports Medicare for All. Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians. In November, she said in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What Trump says Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Gabbard. The two met briefly shortly after Mr. Trump was elected.\n\nJohn Delaney Rep.

NEW YORK -- Anne Jackson, a Tony Award-nominated theater actress who often appeared onstage with her husband, Eli Wallach, in comedies and classics, died early Tuesday of natural causes at her home in Manhattan, said her son, Peter Wallach. She was 90.\n\nJackson and Eli Wallach were a formidable acting duo, starring in a series of plays, including George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara in 1956 and a hugely successful run of Luv, directed by Mike Nichols, in the mid-1960s. A bench in New York City's Riverside Park is dedicated to them.\n\nA lot of people say, 'Sorry for your loss,' said Peter Wallach. Actually, the part I don't accept is the loss part because it was a gift. My parents gave this tremendous gift, which they gave to the world and they gave to their children.\n\nJackson and Wallach played a married couple together as recently as 2003 on the NBC medical drama ER. At the 2010 American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Governors Award honoring Wallach, Jackson introduced her husband: Can I be honest about something? she asked. I taught him everything he knows.\n\nJackson, who played a psychiatrist in the classic horror movie The Shining, earned a best featured actress Tony nomination in Paddy Chayefsky's Middle of the Night in 1956. She also returned to Broadway in the mid-1990s in The Flowering Peach and played Grandma Kurnitz in Lost in Yonkers.\n\nShe and the Tony-winning Wallach acted together onstage in such plays as Cafe Crown, ''Harlequinade, ''The Typist and the Tiger, ''Twice Around the Park and Down the Garden Paths in 2000, among others.\n\nThe couple met when Wallach appeared in the 1946 Equity Library Theater's This Property is Condemned by Tennessee Williams. The only other performer in the show happened to be Jackson. They married in 1948. He died in 2014.\n\nPeter Wallach, a film animator, recalled growing up in a happy home in which the children never really knew if their parents were actually arguing or if they were just rehearsing.\n\nEven sometimes when they'd fight, they would kind of step back from the fight and go, 'Wow, that was a really good Tennessee Williams performance I just gave!' he said. They always forgave each other so quickly because they were both actors.\n\nJackson and Wallach loved New York and were friends with everyone from Harry Belafonte to Igor Stravinsky to Groucho Marx. Wallach rode the subway everywhere except for a time in 1997, while performing in Visiting Mr. Green off-Broadway. His wife stepped in and ordered producers to provide a Rolls-Royce to ferry Wallach to and from the show. She was a tough negotiator -- out of love, Peter Wallach said.\n\nThough the couple also acted independently, Jackson told The Associated Press in 1989: We do have a lot of fun working together. We're both quite good character actors. The characterizations that we come up with make it seem like it's a different person we're relating to.\n\nWhen he acted without her, Wallach said he asked her advice. I just finished playing a judge in 'Law and Order.' I said, 'How do I play a judge?' She said, 'Bang the gavel hard and just say, Overruled!'\n\nThe two wrote and performed a show about their lives that opened in 1993 at the off-Broadway Kaufman Theater. It gracefully weaved scenes from plays in which they acted together or separately with glimpses into their marriage and family life.\n\nThey worked in theater, they worked in television, they worked in movies. They could move eloquently back and forth, said Peter Wallach, who noted his mother's comic chops. Her timing was just so magnificent. She was the queen of the one-liners.\n\nJackson wrote a memoir, Early Stages, which traced her childhood and ended with the birth of Peter.\n\nShe also is survived by their two daughters, Roberta and Katherine, both of whom followed their parents into acting.
Jay-Z is getting incredibly candid about his marriage to Beyonce -- and not just on his new album.\n\nIn a mini-documentary that accompanies 4:44, the rapper and Tidal founder opened up about his sometimes-rocky nine-year marriage.\n\nThis is my real life. I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn't totally built on the 100 percent truth, and it starts cracking, he said in the film. Things start happening that the public can see.\n\nThen we had to get to a point of, 'OK, tear this down and let's start from the beginning,' he said. It's the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nThe new album was released more than 14 months after Beyonce put out Lemonade. Jay-Z explained in the documentary that before he let his version of events out into the world, he let his wife hear it first.\n\nWe just got to a place where, in order for this to work, this can't be fake, he said. Not one ounce. I'm not saying it wasn't uncomfortable, because obviously it was.
Paula Patton is back out in the dating world.\n\nNearly a year after officially divorcing Robin Thicke, the 40-year-old actress told ET that she's ready to find love again, but also spoke about a pretty serious relationship she had after ending her 10-year marriage.\n\nIt didn't work out. It was a good time, Patton revealed at the junket for The Perfect Match, which hits theaters Friday. Yes, I was very in love. ...I am hoping to feel that way soon.\n\nConfessing to being a next level romantic, the actress says she believes there is a perfect match for every person. It is a beautiful thing to find your partner in crime. It's a great way to live your life, she said. If you have met your perfect match and it was working, stay with it. Do not give up. Hold onto that because it is special.\n\nDespite her split from Thicke, Patton is keeping the faith. I am a nurturing and very passionate person, she said. I love to love and I believe in love so much. ...No matter what happens, love hurts.\n\nShe added, But it feels amazing, so you got to get back up and give it a go again.\n\nPatton's advice for seeking out a relationship: Be vulnerable and open your heart.\n\nYou are losing out if you don't give yourself over to it, she continued.\n\nThat being said, Patton does have some new deal breakers of her own, and a big one is pouting. It is when people check out, turn off their hearts and become cold, she explained. I guess I wish that everybody was more fearless and just took a jump and took a leap of faith to say 'yes' to love.\n\nThe actress also admits that she's not sure what makes a perfect match aside from initial chemistry. I believe in love at first sight and I believe in that feeling when you go, 'Oh, that's it,' she touted. I just know it when I feel it.\n\nThicke certainly has moved on in his love life. In December, the 38-year-old singer and his 20-something girlfriend, April Love Geary, heated up Saint Barthélemy, France with their public displays of affection. Lucky to be in love with my best friend, the bikini-clad model captioned a photo of the two at the time.
Former Housing Secretary Julián Castro announced he's endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren for president, just days after he dropped his own bid for the Democratic nomination.\n\nTheres one candidate I see who's unafraid to fight like hell to make sure America's promise will be there for everyone, Castro said in a video released Monday. That's why I'm proud to endorse Elizabeth Warren for president.\n\nCastro dropped out of the presidential race last week after failing to break into the top tier of Democratic candidates. The Warren campaign said he will join the Massachusetts senator for a rally in Brooklyn on Tuesday to address supporters.\n\nCastro will be an active surrogate for Warren who is planning to travel the country for her, according to people familiar with the plans. He will keep a handful of staffers from his campaign with him while others from his policy team are likely to join hers.\n\nThe endorsement forms a political marriage of like-minded campaigns and candidates. Castro and Warren are credited by the rest of the field for churning out some of the most detailed and liberal policy proposals, on issues like immigration, criminal justice reform and taxes. Castro often released his plans first and Warren followed with her own similar proposals, which inevitably garnered more attention.\n\nJulián Castro and Elizabeth Warren embrace after the first night of the Democratic presidential debate on June 26, 2019, in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle / Getty Images\n\nIn the video announcing his endorsement, Castro told Warren that voters have confidence in you because you listened.\n\nMore and more, they're recognizing that you're the one who's actually going to get it done, he said.\n\nThe latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll released Sunday showed Warren in fourth place in Iowa and third in New Hampshire, where her support has slipped since November.\n\nThe two showed a clear personal relationship and admiration for each other on the campaign trail. At Iowa's Polk County Steak Fry in September, Castro cut into her selfie line of thousands to say a brief hello. They embraced, posed for photos and spent a few minutes speaking, allowing a press scrum to gather and stoke speculation about whether they would eventually join forces. Neither side ever sought to tamp down that speculation.
NEW YORK -- The Time's Up campaign is taking aim at R. Kelly over allegations he has sexually abused women. The organization devoted to helping women in the aftermath of sexual harassment or abuse issued a call to action Monday asking for further investigation in to Kelly's behavior. The singer has come under closer scrutiny over the last year as women have come forward to accuse him of everything from sexual coercion and leading a sex cult to physical abuse. Kelly has denied such charges.\n\nWe demand appropriate investigations and inquiries into the allegations of R. Kelly's abuse made by women and their families for more than two decades now. And we declare with great vigilance and a united voice to anyone who wants to silence us — their time is up, the Time's Up statement said.\n\nThe statement was issued by the Women of Color committee within Time's Up, which includes Oscar-nominated director Ava DuVernay, TV mogul Shonda Rhimes and actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell.\n\nWe join the call to #MuteRKelly and insist on the safety + dignity of all women. We demand investigations into R. Kelly's abuse allegations made by women of color + their families for two decades. We call on those who profit from his music to cut ties. #MuteRKelly #TIMESUP #WOC pic.twitter.com/TYmDRVIH00 — Ava DuVernay (@ava) April 30, 2018\n\nThe social media campaign #MuteRKelly has sought to stop his music from being played and to cancel his concerts, and Time's Up said it is joining that call.\n\nSpecifically, Time's Up is seeking action from RCA Records, Kelly's label; Spotify and Apple Music, which stream Kelly's catalog; and Ticketmaster, which has sold tickets to his concerts. And it is calling for the cancellation of a May 11 concert in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nRCA, Spotify, Apple Music and Ticketmaster didn't immediately respond to email requests placed late Sunday night.\n\n✊🏽The official #MuteRKelly website is live! Go to https://t.co/77qGA2Muae to sign up on our mailing list, learn what you can do to support the movement, and get all the latest info about our campaign to end the career of serial sexual predator, #RKelly. pic.twitter.com/zxEa8a2KoG — MuteRKelly-Official (@OffMuteRKelly) April 30, 2018\n\nR. Kelly's management team responded to the campaign and implied that he was a scapegoat, saying: R. Kelly supports the pro-women goals of the Time's Up movement. We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way to draw attention to those goals -- and in this case, it is unjust and off-target ... Time's Up has neglected to speak with any of the women who welcome R. Kelly's support, and it has rushed to judgment without the facts. Soon it will become clear Mr. Kelly is the target of a greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him, his family and the women with whom he spends his time.\n\nKelly's team also implied that he was targeted because he is black. In the statement, they said, R. Kelly's music is a part of American and African-American culture that should never — and will never — be silenced. Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it. We will vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.\n\nThe Time's Up letter was addressed to fellow women of color. It started by saying, We see you. We feel you. Because we are you.\n\nIt continued: For too long, our community has ignored our pain. The pain we bear is a burden that too many women of color have had to bear for centuries. The wounds run deep. As Women of Color within Time's Up, we recognize we have a responsibility to help right this wrong. We intend to shine a bright light on our WOC sisters in need.\n\nTime's Up cited Bill Cosby's conviction last week for sexual assault as a step in the right direction but said it was just a start.\n\nIn a further statement to The Associated Press, Smollett-Bell said: We stand linked with our sisters and will no longer tolerate the predatory behavior of R. Kelly to go unchecked. This is a call to action to #MuteRKelly. His music must be turned down and the voices of these brave survivors must be heard.\n\nThe organizers of the #MuteRKelly movement said they were gratified that Time's Up was amplifying their cause.\n\nWe will not stop until R. Kelly is held accountable for his sexual misconduct against Black girls and women, and we urge ALL artists, radio stations, record companies, streaming platforms and concert venues to cut ties with this accused predator, Oronike Odeleye, a co-founder of the movement, said in a statement.\n\nR. Kelly, whose hits include Ignition, I Believe I Can Fly, Step in the Name of Love, Same Girl and Bump N' Grind, is one of pop music's best-selling artists. He has also written hits for artists ranging from Celine Dion to Michael Jackson to Lady Gaga. While he's written classic love songs and even gospel music, his work is defined by sexually explicit songs such as Feelin' on Yo Booty, Your Body's Calling Me, Sex Me and even more explicit fare.\n\nHe has long been accused of behavior that has ranged from questionable to criminal. He wed then-15-year-old Aaliyah in 1994. The late singer had been his protege, the marriage was later annulled and the two refused to confirm that it even happened.\n\nHe was later accused of child pornography after a widely circulated videotape appeared to show him having sex with, and urinating on, a teenage girl. He was acquitted of all charges in 2008 and continued to rack up hits and sell out stadiums around the country.\n\nIn recent years, as more women have come forward to allege misconduct, protests against Kelly have increased.\n\nA woman told Rolling Stone last year that she was in a long-term relationship with the singer that was sexually and physically abusive. Kitti Jones, who dated Kelly from 2011 to 2013, accused the singer of beating her, withholding food from her and forcing her to engage in sexual acts with other women while he recorded them. Jones also alleged that Kelly made her live with two of his other girlfriends while he constantly monitored them with security cameras.\n\nJones told Rolling Stone she had been living with Kelly for less than a month before she confronted him in November 2011 about the video that was at the center of his child pornography trial. She said he kicked her multiple times and slapped her across the face repeatedly.\n\nI was putting my hand over my face and telling him I was sorry, Jones says. He would start kicking me, telling me I was a stupid b***h [and] don't ever get in his business.\n\nJones also said that later she was housed with other girlfriends and they were not permitted to leave their rooms without contacting Kelly or one of his employees first. She claimed that she and the other girlfriends were not permitted to communicate with each other Jones alleged that because she often got her phone taken away as punishments, she was unable to have access to food for as long as two and a half days.\n\nJones implored people to believe the accusations against Kelly and said, I want them to not be so dismissive towards the women that are speaking out. We're not just rolling over out of bed and saying, 'Hmm, let me just make up a story about R. Kelly today. Let me make it sound similar to something that he's already been accused of and put my own remix to it just [because] I want some attention.'\n\nParents claimed their daughter was being held by Kelly as part of a sex cult but their daughter, who was of age, denied their claims. And recently a woman in Dallas filed a lawsuit against the singer claiming he gave her a sexually transmitted disease, and she claimed he was grooming her to be a part of a sex cult.\n\nKelly has denied all allegations against him.\n\nKelly hasn't released an album of new music since a 2016 Christmas album, and his last true album was 2015's The Buffet, which had no major hits.\n\nAn appearance at a concert in his native Chicago scheduled for Friday was canceled after protests. In a Twitter post on Sunday to his fans, Kelly said he was looking forward to his May 11 concert and had no idea why his Chicago appearance was scrapped.\n\nI never heard of a show being canceled because of rumors, but I guess it's a first time for everything and I apologize to you guys, and in the meantime, I'm going to try and get to the bottom line of it, as far as my lawyers are concerned, he said in a video.
Remember walking through a crowded park on a beautiful day? Just three weeks ago, before there was no place but home, actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick showed Sunday Morning anchor Jane Pauley one of their favorite spots.\n\nWe're in the famous, no-other-park-in-New-York-like-it Washington Square Park, the heart of the village, said Parker.\n\nThe park holds 30 years of memories for this longtime couple – and even more for Broderick, who grew up here. All these new-fangled buildings everywhere? he laughed.\n\nSunday Morning host Jane Pauley with actors Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick. CBS News\n\nShared memories they don't often share. We were just dating. I ran into Matthew, and he was on a payphone. And I was carrying a mattress with my friend John, she said.\n\nThat was the beginning of a long relationship, but a pretty short story.\n\nPauley asked, The two of you, how quickly did you know?\n\nIt was complicated, Broderick said.\n\nIt was? Parker laughed.\n\nI don't remember!\n\nWe're not good at talking about this part. This is the part we don't talk about. We're not practiced.\n\nPauley asked, What's your answer to the question?\n\nFrom the first time we were together, we've never been apart since, Parker replied. That's true. Sorry.\n\nLately, they're spending even more time together. The couple, along with other artists, recently joined Rosie O'Donnell for a live-streamed benefit for the Actor's Fund, a non-profit, in which Parker revealed that the couple has been watching Columbo, playing games, and doing a lot of cooking and laundry.\n\nParker and Broderick were set to co-star in a revival of Neil Simon's Plaza Suite. But the very day they were to begin performances, theatres were shut down to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nPlaza Suite is one of the few new shows still expected to open … someday.\n\nJust last month, the stars were playing to sold-out houses in Boston, and getting set to bring the play to Broadway for the first time since its hit run more than 50 years ago.\n\nIt's also the first time Broderick and Parker have acted together since they were married 23 years ago.\n\nParker said, We had basically come to the conclusion, without ever having said it, that we will never really work together!\n\nEvery now and then, somebody would say, 'You guys should do something together,' said Broderick. And we'd say, 'What?' And they'd say, 'I'm … I have an appointment.'\n\nAnd Parker had her own reason for hesitating: Actually, what I felt was, oh God, no, really? Because you know each other in such a different way. But I think it has been incredibly pleasant.\n\nAudiences have been delighted. Broderick said, At the very beginning, as soon as Miss Parker was revealed, they were just very, very happy to be here. And you can't help but feel reassured by that.\n\nIn this comedy about marriage, they appear as three different couples who check into the same Suite 719 at New York's Plaza Hotel.\n\nAct One: Karen and Sam are celebrating an awkward wedding anniversary…\n\nAct Two: Jessie, a Hollywood producer, hopes for sparks with his high school flame, Muriel.\n\nSet in 1968, Plaza Suite affords Broderick the opportunity to wear a costume that he calls the most fun: a burnt orange jacket and turtleneck: I get a really nice outfit, he said.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick in the revival of Neil Simon's Plaza Suite. Joan Marcus/Plaza Suite\n\nFinally, as Norma and Roy, parents of the bride who's got cold feet. They are moments away from handing off their daughter who has locked herself in the bathroom, said Parker.\n\nOf course, it's a challenge to change characters multiple times in one night. But Parker and Broderick are experienced actors each with decades on stage and screen.\n\nMovie fans still know him best from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. He laughed: Yeah. I like it 80% as much as they do!\n\nAnd she's most famous as the iconic Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City.\n\nPauley asked, Would a young Carrie Bradshaw have dated Ferris Bueller?\n\nI don't know if Ferris Bueller would've dated Carrie Bradshaw! Parker replied.\n\nWell, one is DC, and the other is Marvel, Broderick laughed.\n\nBroderick not only knows comic books; he's a devoted baseball fan. And so is she.\n\nParker said, Before we had too many kids, we had a dream we were gonna – not 'too many kids,' I mean, before we had so many children that …\n\nI think 'too many' is fair, Broderick interjected.\n\n … rightfully took up our time, we had a dream before all the baseball stadiums changed, we were gonna hit every single one in the country.\n\nHow many of them are there? Children? Pauley asked.\n\nWe have three, said Parker.\n\nThat we know about, Broderick added.\n\nNo, we're sure. We're sure.\n\nThey have two girls – 10-year-old twins – and a 17-year-old son.\n\nRe any, or all, of them aspiring actors? It sounds like one of the girls, said Parker. Yeah. Which is an absolute surprise. But she did clarify that the other day, and said she wants to get her degree in education 'cause she really wants to be a teacher. And I said, 'That's a fine and good idea. And then you can always go to acting school.'\n\nBroderick said, These are funny conversations with a ten-year-old, you know? 'I think you could pass the bar. Certainly!'\n\nThey both started young. At 13 she was Annie. And at 17 he made his stage debut alongside his dad, the late actor James Broderick.\n\nThe only time Parker and Broderick had worked together before Plaza Suite was in a 1990s revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Happy to keep his dinner warm 'til he comes merrily home from downtown, sang Parker as Rosemary Pillkington to Broderick's J. Pierrepont Finch, a role for which he won his second Tony Award.\n\nMatthew Broderick would be the man you're singing about? asked Pauley.\n\nYes. She was singing about 'Ponty,' J Pierrepont Finch. 'Oh, Ponty!'\n\nGreat chemistry, both on-stage and off-.\n\nParker said, Yeah, I mean, we spent more time together in the last two-and-a-half, three months than we've spent since we were courting, really, sincerely.\n\nWhile they're still seeing a lot of each other, audiences will have to wait to see them live on stage. But homebound fans can still spend quality time with some old friends, played by Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick.\n\nWe both feel so lucky and so privileged, said Parker. Because how many great actors haven't had the sort of success that you think that they're deserving of? If you're not cognizant of that all the time, you're a fool and an ingrate. And I'm enormously grateful.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mary Raffalli. Editor: Steve Tyler.
Manchester, N.H. — Thousands of New Hampshire Democrats began the search this weekend for their next president, or so they hoped. Balancing the thunderous 2018 midterm Democratic wins with the still-painful 2016 presidential election, voters were treated to the busiest weekend of Democratic presidential campaigning in recent memory with seven contenders crossing the state within the last four days, according to New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley.\n\nCBS News spoke with dozens of Democratic voters across 13 campaign events and heard voters overwhelmingly call for seismic change in both candidates and vision.\n\nIn his first trip to the Granite State since announcing his candidacy at the beginning of February, Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, held seven campaign events, the most of any candidate of the weekend. Interested voters packed like friendly sardines into homes and offices where several times the combined body heat of the attendees fogged windows as Booker wiped sweat from his bald head, which he regularly used for self-deprecating jokes.\n\nBooker's usual 20-minute stump speech is centered on inspiring a revival of grace and often references the struggles of the civil rights movement.\n\nBooker believes his message of love and hope will be enough to beat President Trump, who Booker rarely — if ever — mentions.\n\nMost attendees, like Karolina Bodner, 72, who took copious notes as she stood behind Booker, appreciated this upbeat oratorical approach.\n\nHis whole thing is we will serve ourselves and the country better if we stand for—not just what we are against, she said.\n\nCory Booker in New Hampshire Bo Erickson\n\nOthers disagreed.\n\nTo me it sounded a little weak, said State Rep. Wendy Thomas after hearing Booker's message. I'm not saying that we have to hate them. I'm not saying that we have to destroy them, I'm saying we have to get rid of them. We can love them later.\n\nThomas may find other Democratic candidates' messaging more appealing.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, literally took her message to church as around 1,000 people flooded the pews of the South Street church in Portsmouth like it was Christmas Eve mass.\n\nHarris said Democrats must talk about hard truths like gun violence, a lack of concern about educating other people's kids, and the lives of immigrants in this country but also that these ideas need to be prosecuted via a public debate.\n\nAs Harris outlined these hard truths, her Democratic congregation on Presidents Day regularly rose to their feet to cheer. By the end of her event, Harris had converted many Democrats into believers.\n\nYet, some yearned for a more emotional message, especially those who had previously attended Booker's more intimate events.\n\nI really liked Harris' talk, but it felt more performative, said Marcos Del Hierro, 37, comparing the event to Booker's which he attended the day before.\n\nHarris showed her go-with-the-flow attitude as she waded into the snowy outdoors to address the hundreds of people who were not able to get into her event.\n\nIt's amazing! Harris reacted as she stepped back inside.\n\nwow: HUNDREDS of ppl standing outside in the snow in NH and @KamalaHarris goes outside to greet them before her event: pic.twitter.com/Svi0HADZan — Bo Erickson (@BoKnowsNews) February 18, 2019\n\nBeyond stump speeches, candidates differentiated themselves with new policy positions.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, received progressive credit by endorsing a third federal gender identity marker for Americans who identify as non-binary when asked about a similar statewide bill. Booker, meanwhile, took this question, twice, and said he would research.\n\nWATCH: When President Trump demonizes transgender children it breaks my heart, @SenGillibrand is emotional talking at LGBTQ event in NH. Says this is one of the reasons she is running for President. pic.twitter.com/Vc4laVtZQc — Bo Erickson (@BoKnowsNews) February 15, 2019\n\nHarris also endorsed another progressive idea, a name change for Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day. Booker also was asked and said he would find out more.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, was also in the state and took a centrist stance on two now-popular issues at a CNN televised town hall: Medicare for All she said is a possibility in the future and underscored that she wanted a more at-the-ready solution for health.\n\nNo. I am not for free four-year college for all, was another definitive assessment of a progressive Democratic idea.\n\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with CBS News his staff last week was managing his expectations for turnout at his New Hampshire events due in part to the large number of candidates campaigning nearby.\n\nBut turnout exceeded Buttigieg's expectations and showed up in the hundreds to hear his commitment to freedom, which he defined as not just idealist but freedom for women's reproduction rights, freedom from crushing loan debt, and access to affordable healthcare.\n\nVoters also mentioned another freedom on display: Marriage. Buttigieg said he introduced his husband at the start of the remarks because his marriage is the most important thing in my life and he wanted voters to see that.\n\nThe clearest contrast between the candidates came from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, whose platform centers on an anti-war agenda. While the other campaign events were filled with applause, around 150 attendees at her Sunday town hall sat mostly in silence, seemingly entranced by the serious issues of nuclear war she was forecasting.\n\nOne moment of Gabbard-loving applause was significantly different. The first question, came from a man who said, I really admire that you met with [Syrian dictator Bashar al] Assad. Gabbard controversially met with Assad in secret in June 2017.\n\nMore than half of the attendees, many while wearing Hawaii leis, erupted with clapping joy.
Buttigieg challenges Pence on LGBTQ rights: Your quarrel is with my creator Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a potential 2020 candidate, took aim at Vice President Mike Pence in a speech on LGBTQ issues on Sunday. My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man and yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God, said Buttigieg.
The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU, has been a thorn in the side of government for the nearly 100 years since it was created. With its unflinching devotion to the Bill of Rights, it has angered just about everyone by representing violent criminals, communists and famously, in Skokie, Illinois, neo-Nazis. Always insisting that if rights don't apply to everyone, they apply to no one. ACLU lawsuits and friend of the court briefs have won huge expansions of rights in this country. Miranda warnings from police, access to contraception, internet privacy, interracial and same-sex marriage. And yet the ACLU has always been something of a pariah, being called a card-carrying member suggests being to the left of the left. But in the Trump era, that thorn in the side of power has found new power. And you'll be surprised at the direction it's taking.\n\nCrowd outside Brooklyn courthouse chanting A-C-L-U, we are here; we stand with you! A-C-L-U we are here; we stand with you\n\nJanuary 28, 2017. Donald Trump had been president for a week and a day when the ACLU scored its first legal victory against him.\n\nWalking out to crowds cheering; woman's voice: Thank you, ACLU lawyers!\n\nThey won a temporary injunction against the president's order banning travelers from seven majority Muslim countries the night after he signed it. ACLU executive director Anthony Romero looked a bit stunned by the crowd.\n\nAnthony Romero: I've come out of many courthouses. I have never come out of a courthouse where there were 3,000 people who spontaneously amassed.\n\nROMERO AT COURTHOUSE: So we want to thank you very very much. [CHEERING]\n\nLesley Stahl: Am I correct that soon thereafter you started to see bumps in your membership?\n\nAnthony Romero: There were almost 400,000 new members just on that one weekend after the Muslim ban.\n\nPresident Trump at first address to Congress\n\nPresident Donald Trump: We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation.\n\nAt President Trump's first address to Congress, some senators and congressmen wore blue ACLU ribbons that also turned up on Hollywood red carpets.\n\nLesley Stahl: Suddenly, the ACLU was cool. (LAUGH)\n\nAnthony Romero: That was new.\n\nLesley Stahl: That was definitely new.\n\nAnthony Romero: Yeah.\n\nDavid Cole: What we saw after President Trump was elected was the most energized citizenry around civil liberties and civil rights that I have ever seen.\n\nDavid Cole conducts a meeting\n\nDavid Cole is the ACLU's national legal director.\n\nDavid Cole: We had all these people coming to us, newly joining the ACLU and wanting to engage. Not wanting just to write a check or push a button. But wanting to actually take action in defense of liberty.\n\nLesley Stahl: You owe it all to Donald Trump.\n\nDavid Cole: Exactly. He has reminded people of the importance of standing up and defending liberty.\n\nThe ACLU senior staff saw membership nearly quadruple, and online donations came pouring in.\n\nLesley Stahl: How much?\n\nAnthony Romero: Over $120 million in the first year.\n\nLesley Stahl: What? $120 million in the first year after Trump was elected?\n\nAnthony Romero: [NODS]\n\nThat was 25 times the previous year's number.\n\nLesley Stahl: Did you think that was gonna happen?\n\nAnthony Romero: Never.\n\nAnthony Romero\n\nAnd they've put that money to work, hiring more staff and filing lawsuit after lawsuit against the administration -- 115 of them so far.\n\nDavid Cole: So we sued him over the Muslim ban. We've sued him over family separation. We sued him over the adding-- citizenship question to the census.\n\nLesley Stahl: Are you busier than you've ever been against an administration?\n\nDavid Cole: I think without question.\n\nBut the ACLU did more than file lawsuits. It set out to turn all those people wanting to take action. Into a grassroots civil liberties army called People Power, modeled after a group that might seem an unlikely source of inspiration for the ACLU: the NRA, the National Rifle Association.\n\nLesley Stahl: You're looking to the NRA (LAUGH) for guidance?\n\nAnthony Romero: Yeah.\n\nLesley Stahl: Come on. The ACLU and the NRA?\n\nAnthony Romero: We're very different. We believe in the-\n\nLesley Stahl: No kidding.\n\nAnthony Romero: --the regulation of firearms. They focus on one amendment. I've got the rest of them. But there's a lot we can learn from them.\n\nAs ACLU political director, Faiz Shakir has been in charge of implementing some of the NRA's lessons.\n\nLesley Stahl: What is it in their model that you like?\n\nFaiz Shakir: They're building civic society around their issue. You go to gun clubs and gun shows even PTA meetings and church meetings with your fellow activists. And I think that is inspirational in some regards for us, to think about mobilizing your issues as a-- as a lifestyle.\n\nAnd as the deciding factor at the ballot box. Just as the NRA built a bloc of gun rights voters - the ACLU wants a bloc of civil rights and civil liberties voters. Their slogan: Vote like your rights depend on it. But they're not taking everything from the NRA playbook.\n\nAnthony Romero: What is different is that we don't pick a candidate. We don't give money to a candidate. We don't have a PAC.\n\nThat's because the ACLU has a strict and long-standing policy of non-partisanship: never supporting a political party, and never endorsing or opposing any candidate for elective office. The idea is to remain free to challenge anyone in government whose actions violate civil liberties.\n\nSo as the ACLU dove into the fall midterm elections with more funds and fight than ever.\n\nAs usual, it campaigned for ballot initiatives in several states to expand voting rights, a longtime ACLU goal.\n\nBut Shakir's team also got involved in two governor's races, leading to complaints they violated their own policies.\n\nIn Kansas, then-secretary of state Kris Kobach, a President Trump ally who the ACLU had sued several times alleging voter suppression, was in a tight 5-way race for governor.\n\n-- ACLU ad --\n\nAnnouncer: Kris Kobach took an oath to uphold the constitution, and then, as secretary of state, he was held in contempt of court for refusing…\n\nThe ACLU ran tv ads and sent mailers critical of Kobach's record.\n\nACLU ad continues: ...threatening children with disabilities. Regardless of who you vote for on November 6th, we the people must demand that politicians respect the rule of law. The ACLU does not endorse or oppose candidates.\n\nLesley Stahl: Here's what I smile at.\n\nFaiz Shakir: Yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: You have that ad. You tell the voters of Kansas all the things that you strongly disagree with about him. And then at the bottom it says, We don't endorse candidates.\n\nFaiz Shakir: Yes, that's right. We are also advertising to people that we are a nonpartisan organization, that we don't endorse and oppose candidates. So when you watch an issue--\n\nLesley Stahl: It's like a wink thing. Ha, ha, we don't endorse--\n\nFaiz Shakir: I don't think it is a wink thing.\n\n-- ACLU ad --\n\nMom: It was the most horrific day of my life. My son was addicted to drugs...\n\nIn the Georgia governor's race, the ACLU ran an ad touting Democrat Stacey Abrams' record on criminal justice.\n\nACLU ad continues: And Stacey Abrams will end dependence on private prisons, saving millions that could instead be used for treatment.\n\nMom: We were so destroyed as a family.\n\nAnnouncer: ACLU does not endorse or oppose candidates.\n\nCorrespondent Lesley Stahl speaks with Ira Glaser\n\nIra Glasser: They ran an ad which you could show to a thousand people and a thousand people would say, if you asked them, Oh, that's a political ad for Stacey Abrams.\n\nIra Glasser spent 34 years at the ACLU -- 23 of them as executive director. He believes the ACLU's involvement in candidate races has crossed the line into partisanship, and he's concerned enough about it to speak out.\n\nIra Glasser: I think it's strategically weakening its mission. The best strategy of protecting civil liberties is not to be partisan.\n\nLesley Stahl: The current leadership of the ACLU would say what they're really doing is just telling you where Stacey Abrams stands on issues and where her opponent--\n\nIra Glasser: No, but that's not what they're doing. There's nobody could look at that ad and not think it was a campaign ad for Stacey Abrams. It was. Look, we are living in a time now where Trump has made it a cultural habit to say-- to do something and then, while you're doing it, deny that you're doing it. So the fact that they deny it is just dissembling, it's just-- it's just, you know-- dishonest.\n\nLesley Stahl: Ira Glasser says that this is a key principle of the ACLU not to get involved with candidates. He thinks you crossed a line.\n\nDavid Cole: He's welcome to his views and we'll defend his right to have his views. Look, the people who get elected have tremendous power to decide whether the government is going to respect civil liberties or violate civil liberties. And so why would you not ask the citizenry to think about that issue when they are choosing who they want in office?\n\nAnthony Romero: It would be almost malpractice if in this moment we said, Oh, we're not gonna engage the political process because we're afraid of being called partisan. When our issues are at play, like immigrants' rights, and voting rights, and reproductive rights, and LGBT rights, we have an affirmative obligation to step up.\n\nBut Glasser says they're stepping up too much, putting progressive politics ahead of traditional civil liberties concerns -- like the presumption of innocence.\n\nCase in point: the ACLU's decision to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination based on Christine Blasey Ford's allegation of sexual assault and Kavanaugh's response. The ACLU bussed and flew in large numbers of women to Capitol Hill to lobby key senators and ran an ad in four states, insinuating Kavanaugh's guilt by association.\n\n--ACLU Ad--\n\nAnnouncer: We've seen this before, denials from powerful men.\n\nBill Clinton: I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\n\nBill Cosby: I've never seen anything like this.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh: I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.\n\nAnnouncer: America is watching. Oppose the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nLesley Stahl: We've heard criticism that the ACLU would oppose someone on an unproven charge. You're usually defending people when there's an unproven charge.\n\nDavid Cole: Right. And if the question was whether Brett Kavanaugh should go to jail, we would have defended him. But the question was not whether he should go to jail. The question was whether he should be appointed to one of the most powerful positions in government for life.\n\nLesley Stahl: This wasn't a criminal trial, it wasn't even a civil trial. It was a job interview.\n\nIra Glasser: I agree with the fact that it was a job interview and not a criminal trial but we're talking about the ACLU taking out a million dollars' worth of ads arguing that an accusation was the equivalent of a finding of guilt. For the ACLU, of all organizations, to be complicit in-- in the national pastime now of converting accusations into convictions without a trial-- [MAKES FACE]\n\nLesley Stahl: Ira Glasser, who had your job for many years.\n\nAnthony Romero: A great director.\n\nLesley Stahl: He has said that the changes that have come about recently under your leadership are shortsighted and may undermine the credibility of this organization.\n\nAnthony Romero: I think he gets it wrong. We're more relevant now than we've ever been. We're more impactful than we've ever been. I think that's a sign of our success that we are willing to take kind of on new tactics and new strategies, even as we remain true to the core principles.\n\nOn election night in November, all the voting rights measures the ACLU fought for passed. And in Kansas, Kris Kobach was defeated. But victory didn't silence the criticism.\n\nThree ACLU state affiliates have gone on record opposing what one called the abandonment of non-partisanship, and turning the ACLU into an advocacy organization.\n\nLesley Stahl: Do you see yourself now as a critic of the ACLU?\n\nIra Glasser: No, I see myself as a critic of some of what the ACLU is doing. The ACLU probably still does more good work on issues I care about than any organization in America. But I think they are undermining the sacred importance of their primary mission, and there's nobody else to do it.\n\nPolitical director Faiz Shakir recently announced his departure from the ACLU. His new job. Bernie Sanders' campaign manager.\n\nProduced by Shari Finkelstein. Associate producer, Jaime Woods.
Livia Giuggioli made a shocking confession this week.\n\nColin Firth's wife of nearly 21 years revealed that she once had an affair with the man that has allegedly been stalking her. Giuggioli claims that Marco Brancaccia, an Italian journalist, has been harassing her with frightening messages that police are reportedly investigating.\n\nFor obvious reasons, the Firths have never had any desire to make this matter public. A few years ago Colin and Livia privately made the decision to separate, Firth and his wife told ET in a joint statement on Friday. During that time Livia briefly became involved with former friend Mr. Brancaccia. The Firths have since reunited.\n\nSubsequently, Mr. Brancaccia carried out a frightening campaign of harassment over several months, much of which is documented. As a consequence of his stalking, threats and refusal to desist, the legal complaint was lodged with the Italian authorities, the statement continues. The reporting this week on this case is understood to be the consequence of a leaked court document. This is greatly to be regretted. It does not serve the interests of any of the parties involved.\n\nMeanwhile, Brancaccia, 55, denies the accusation to U.K. newspaper The Times, and alleges that the 48-year-old film producer was lying to hide their relationship that is said to have occurred between 2015 and 2016. [Livia] wanted to leave Colin for me, he tells the British newspaper.\n\nMy 'stalking' consisted of two messages via WhatsApp after she ended our relationship in June 2016, and an email, he says. I wrote an email to Colin about my relationship with Livia, which I now regret sending, and she filed a complaint against me for stalking out of fear that I could go public with what she had revealed to me about her marriage and work.\n\nBrancaccia further claims that the couple's marriage has been over for years.\n\nIn a year she sent me hundreds of messages of love, photos and videos, even a diary, he adds.\n\nFirth, 57, and Giuggioli were married in 1997, and have two sons together, 16-year-old Luca and 15-year-old Matteo.\n\nThe two were most recently seen together on Sunday at the Annie Lennox -- An Evening of Music and Conversation event in London, England.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKendall Jenner recounts scary run-in with alleged stalker\n\nErin Andrews tears up as she recalls the hardest part of stalker case\n\nExclusive: Ingrid Goes West star Aubrey Plaza reveals real-life stalker moment
Democratic lawmakers want to build a monument in the Capitol to honor the late civil rights icon and Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nThe Democratic Women's Caucus, led by co-chairs Representative Lois Frankel of Florida, Jackie Speier of California and Brenda Lawrence of Michigan, proposed a bill Tuesday to erect a monument to Ginsburg on the Capitol grounds or inside the complex.\n\nIt is only fitting that we immortalize this feminist icon with a statue in the Capitol that honors her legacy and educates future generations of her profound contributions, Speier said in a statement.\n\nThe liberal jurist spent over a quarter century on the Supreme Court weighing in to support abortion rights, marriage equality, the Affordable Care Act, and equal pay for women. She also achieved an unusual measure of pop culture fame that began when a blogger writing about a decision Ginsburg had written dubbed her Notorious R.B.G.\n\nYears before taking her seat on the high court, Ginsburg worked with the Women's Rights Project in the 1970s, arguing six landmark cases on gender equality before the high court. She won five of the cases, all aimed at eliminating legal barriers that held women back in the workplace and civic life. She advanced cases that would establish precedents for treating men and women equally under the law in such areas as jury duty requirements, Social Security and military spousal benefits, and the legal drinking age.\n\nIf the monument bill passes, Ginsburg would join only a handful of women depicted in the halls of the Capitol. The Capitol currently houses less than a dozen statues of females, among them, Helen Keller, Rosa Parks and Mother Joseph. The House bill does not specify what the monument would look like, how much it would cost or, for that matter, what form it would take — whether it should be a statue, bust or portrait.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has introduced a comparable bill in the Senate, along with 15 Democratic co-sponsors, including Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nA Democratic aide for the Senate Rules Committee opined that the measure should pass with a simple majority when it comes to the floor and predicted that more Republicans would vote in favor of the bill, given the record of accomplishment of Justice Ginsburg.\n\nBut the bill, unveiled during the first week of Women's History Month, currently has no bipartisan support and would need 60 votes — that is, the support of 10 Republicans — to proceed. CBS News has reached out to several Senate Republican offices for comment.\n\nThe measure, if passed, would require the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library in consultation with the Senate Rules Committee and Committee on House Administration to obtain a monument that honors Ginsburg within two years of the enactment, the Democratic staff aide said.\n\nKlobuchar said Justice Ginsburg's dedication to our country's values and ideals is an example for all Americans. She was an icon and a trailblazer who dedicated her life to opening doors for women at a time when many insisted on keeping them shut, the Minnesota senator said in a statement.\n\nThe Capitol is our most recognizable symbol of Democracy, a place where people from across our country have their voices represented and heard. It is only fitting that the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives honor her life and service by establishing a monument in the Capitol, Klobuchar added.\n\nThis move by Democratic lawmakers comes almost six months after Ginsburg died of cancer at the age of 87 in September. A fierce champion of women's rights, Ginsburg was the longest-serving woman on the Supreme Court and a strong liberal voice.
A district court in Japan ruled Wednesday that the government's failure to recognize same-sex marriages is unconstitutional. Legal benefits stemming from marriages should equally benefit both homosexuals and heterosexuals, the Sapporo District Court said, according to The Associated Press.\n\nBut the court didn't go along with the plaintiffs' request for $9,100 in compensation per person for the difficulties they've suffered.\n\nThe case was part of a series of lawsuits filed by same-sex couples arguing that they've suffered because they can't marry, reports the Japan Times. Many of the couples sued on Valentine's Day 2019, with actions being brought in Sapporo, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya. Another group of same-sex couples filed suit in Fukuoka in September 2019.\n\nJapan is the only country in the G7 that doesn't allow same-sex couples to wed. The ruling in Sapporo was seen as a symbolic victory for LGBTQ+ rights activists and sets a potential precedent for other district court rulings.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, Ai Nakajima, told the BBC the ruling is one huge step forward in Japan, adding, We are moving closer to making our dream come true.\n\nThe chief judge said that the discrimination based on the natural difference of sexuality is a violation of Article 14. I could not stop crying, Ryosuke Kunimi, another one of the plaintiffs, told the BBC.\n\nArticle 14 states, in part, that all of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin, according to a translation of Japan's constitution of Japan on the prime minister's website.
Fergie still has a lot of love for Josh Duhamel.\n\nEarlier this month, the couple announced they had separated after eight years of marriage, but the 42-year-old singer told ET's Keltie Knight at The Tuck Room at iPic Theaters in New York City on Wednesday night that they still remain close.\n\nWe're great friends, Josh and I, there's so much love that we have for each other, Fergie explained. We really like each other, we have fun with each other. We're just not a romantic couple anymore.\n\nBut we are still Axl's parents through and through, and our families -- each other's families, the cousins, my nieces and nephews -- it's all the same. So that's the only thing that's changed, she added.\n\nWhat's most important to the former couple is the happiness and wellbeing of their 4-year-old son, Axl.\n\nAbsolutely, the Black Eyed Peas alum assured, adding that there's no need for any negativity about the split.\n\nIt's just been all love in our family, the Big Girls Don't Cry singer expressed. Our families are families together and that cannot change. That is Axl's family, the cousins, I mean, all of mine, the Duhamels and the Kempers and everybody that I've fallen in love with, they're a family.\n\nFor now, Fergie is focusing on the release of her sophomore album, Double Dutchess, on Friday, Sept. 22 and touring, bringing the family and enjoying Axl every year.\n\nShe's also ready to [make] sure that life is balanced, and I'm open. I'm kind of just an open vessel. Just everything has to be done with love.\n\nSo could her future also include a reunion with the Black Eyed Peas?\n\nAbsolutely. There's a saying, 'You can do it all, you just can't do it all at once,' Fergie expressed. And I used to not think that way. I tried to just do it all at once and I realized, something's gotta give. So I'm not cutting off all, you can do it all but it's just, you know, it's gotta be spread out a little bit more. At least for me.\n\nTune into Entertainment Tonight on Thursday for more from Fergie's exclusive interview on her split from Duhamel, new music and what the future holds. Check local listings here.
Gunmen have attacked a school in northwestern Nigeria and kidnapped at least 30 students just weeks after a similar attack in the region, authorities said Friday. The latest abduction took place late Thursday night at the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka, in the Igabi local government area of Kaduna state, police said.\n\nAbout 30 students, a mix of males and females, are yet to be accounted for, the state's commissioner for International Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said in a statement. Several staff of the school were also kidnapped, he added.\n\nA man rests on a pole beside the signage of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization where gunmen abducted students, in Kaduna, Nigeria March 12, 2021. STRINGER / REUTERS\n\nAruwan said the attack was carried out by a large group of armed bandits, adding that the military engaged the attackers and were able to take 180 staff and students to safety.\n\nAn unspecified number of the students were injured and are receiving medical attention at a military facility. Security forces are conducting an operation to track the missing students, Aruwan said.\n\nNigerian authorities also said that bandits were behind the earlier abduction of 279 schoolgirls late last month in the northwest, referring to the groups of armed men who kidnap for money or to press for the release of jailed members of their groups. Those girls were later freed following negotiations with the government, and it is not known whether a ransom was paid.\n\nThe Islamic extremist group Boko Haram is also known to kidnap young women and force them into marriage, most notably the 2014 attack on the Chibok secondary school in Borno state. That mass abduction sparked international outcry and prompted the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. Of the 276 girls taken, more than 100 are still missing nearly seven years later.
With its upbeat theme and fresh-faced stars, The Dick Van Dyke Show might have looked at first like any other early 1960s sitcom. But Mary Tyler Moore's Laura Petrie, a housewife married to Dick Van Dyke's comedy writer Rob, were actually staking out new turf.\n\nMary Tyler Moore, Dick Van Dyke and Larry Mathews are seen here in this 1962 shot from The Dick Van Dyke Show. CBS\n\nRob and Laura were a modern couple. …You know that these people have sex. … It came across as a real marriage, actor Dick Van Dyke told CBS News. We would get into fights about who'd do the most…\n\nWith more than a few of those standoffs ending with Laura's trademark refrain, Oh, Rob!\n\nI think by the first 'Oh, Rob!' I said she's found her character, said Van Dyke.\n\nThis was a great couple, said Bill Persky, who was a writer and a producer on the show.\n\nThey loved one another. They respected each other. And they got into all kinds of trouble, he told CBS News correspondent Jim Axelrod.\n\nOf course I had a crush on her almost instantly, Van Dyke said. I think the greatest compliment we ever had is that most people thought we were married in real life …everyone thought we were actually married. Which is, I think, is the highest compliment I ever had as an actor.\n\nCarl Reiner created the series.\n\nShe was -- first of all, she was grace personified, Reiner said. When she and Dick did a soft-shoe to 'You Wonderful You' across the stage, I melted, as audiences did all over the country. She was the essence of femininity.\n\nBut Laura certainly wore the pants in that show.\n\nShe got in trouble with the Capri pants with the network … and we had to sleep in twin beds and we could not say the word pregnant, Van Dyke said. How times have changed.\n\nWe reflected what was going on at the time but we were very conscious of raising the issues, said Reiner.\n\nThey took a big risk with an episode called That's My Boy??\n\nIn the episode, Laura has just given birth to their child, Richie.\n\nThe hospital keeps confusing the Petries with the Peters, the couple in the next hospital room. And when the Petries come home, Rob is convinced they have the wrong baby.\n\nHe invites the Peters over to make the switch. And when Rob opens the door, an African-American couple walks in.\n\nIt was the longest laugh I've ever experienced in my entire show business life. We just cut the cameras 'cause they laughed and laughed and cheered. It was amazing, Van Dyke recalled.\n\nBut this groundbreaking episode almost didn't happen.\n\nWhen Carl brought the premise to the network, they said, 'You can't do that, Persky explained. Because it was right at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement and there was a lot of unrest. …So they weren't gonna let him do it. And Carl said that he would quit the show if they didn't.\n\nMary Tyler Moore had created the kind of wife women across America could recognize. In a country about to undergo tumultuous change, they were seeing themselves.\n\nMy God, she was a consummate artist. She was an actress. She was a dancer. She was everything, Reiner gushed. …we're gonna miss her. We're gonna miss her.
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Friday signed into law a ban on child marriage, making it the third state to fully outlaw marriage for people under the age of 18. Only Delaware and New Jersey also ban child marriage.\n\nPennsylvania's legislature unanimously voted to approve the ban last, and Wolf signed it into law as part of House Bill 360, which set 18 as the minimum age to obtain a marriage license. Before the ban, an applicant younger than 16 could obtain a marriage license with court approval, and those between the ages of 16 and 18 could obtain one with parental consent, CBS News Pennsylvania affiliate WKBN reports.\n\nAccording to Unchained, an organization that works to end forced and child marriage in the United States, an estimated more than 2,300 children between 15 to 17 living in Pennsylvania were married under those exceptions since 2014.\n\nSetting the minimum age to obtain a marriage license will help prevent child exploitation, said Governor Wolf in a press release Friday. Marriage is a sacred and serious commitment that should be undertaken with love by two adults, not by children being exploited by unscrupulous adults.\n\nHey @somegoodnews: #Pennsylvania just became 3rd US state to end #childmarriage! PA legislators added #COVID19 amendments to the bill to fast-track it during the pandemic + organized remote voting sessions. Now 47 states to go. #SomeGoodNews — Unchained At Last (@UnchainedAtLast) May 8, 2020\n\nAccording to marriage-license data from across the United States analyzed by Unchained, some 248,000 children at least as young as 12 years old were married in the U.S. between 2000 and 2010. An overwhelming majority of them were females.\n\nThese were not 'Romeo and Juliet' situations, Unchained says on its website. Some 77% of the children wed were minor girls married to adult men, often with significant age differences. Some children were wed at an age, or with a spousal age difference, that constitutes statutory rape under their state's laws.\n\nThe minimum marriage age in most U.S. states is 18, according to Unchained, but 47 states allow people under 18 to get married through exceptions like parental consent or judicial approval. Several states do not have any minimum age for which children cannot marry.\n\nObviously, one child's parental consent is another child's parental coercion, but state laws do not call for anyone to ask the children whether they are being pressured into marriage, reads Unchained's information on common exceptions. Even when a girl sobs openly while her parents sign the application and force her into marriage, the clerk has no authority to intervene.\n\nUnchained's founder Fraidy Reiss told Philadelphia radio station KYW that laws to end child marriage are currently pending in nine states.\n\nIt's three states down, only 47 to go in the push to end child marriage in the United States, she said. The fact that Pennsylvania was able to do this despite the fact that there's a global pandemic going on is just tremendous.
Audrina Patridge is looking to her friends and family for emotional support.\n\nThe Hills star has turned to those closest to her amid her contentious divorce from husband Corey Bohan, ET has learned.\n\nShe's leaning on the support of her family. This is not easy for her, a source tells ET exclusively. Audrina is extremely close with her family. She's putting her focus on what's best for her daughter.\n\nET has also learned that Patridge and Bohan are currently not living together.\n\nThe 32-year-old reality star filed for divorce on Wednesday, two days after requesting a temporary restraining order against the Australian BMX rider following an alleged domestic violence incident.\n\nA judge in Orange County, California, granted Patridge's request, ordering Bohan to stay 100 yards away from her. Bohan was granted monitored visitation of their 1-year-old daughter, Kirra.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by ET, Patridge claims that her estranged husband had become increasingly possessive, angry, agitated and jealous of her busy work schedule and travel obligations.\n\nHis aggressive behavior usually escalates whenever I am paying attention to work obligations, rather than to him, she alleged in her restraining order petition. I am fearful of [Bohan's] temper because he cannot control his swearing and personal attacks on me, even when in the presence of our young daughter.\n\nAccording to her divorce petition, Patridge listed the couple's date of separation as Sept. 6, and cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the dissolution of their marriage.\n\nPatridge is asking to terminate the court's ability to award spousal support to either party, and is seeking sole legal and physical custody of their daughter, with visitation to be granted to Bohan. She additionally requests that Bohan obtain written permission to take Kirra to any county outside of Orange County, San Diego County and Imperial County.\n\nThe divorce comes just 10 months after Patridge and Bohan tied the knot at a wedding ceremony in Hawaii, after dating for several years.\n\nAudrina's No. 1 priority is her daughter and she asks for privacy at this time, Patridge's rep told ET in a statement.\n\nA hearing regarding Partridge's request for a restraining order has been set for Oct. 6 at 8:30 a.m.\n\nIn December, the reality star spoke with ET about how she and her new husband hoped to avoid divorce, and admitted that their relationship had seen its share of challenges, but they'd managed to weather them.\n\nReporting by Brendon Geoffrion
The royal family held a historic wedding this spring with the nuptials of Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle, but there's about to be one more first before wedding season is over.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's cousin, Lord Ivar Mountbatten, announced that he will marry his partner James Coyle this summer in the royal family's first same-sex marriage, reported the Daily Mail. Lord Mountbatten made history in 2016 when he announced he was gay, becoming the first member of the royal family to do so. Shortly after, he revealed his relationship with now-fiance Coyle.\n\nThe ceremony will be held in a private chapel on Lord Mountbatten's estate in Devon, England. While the wedding ceremony is limited to close family and friends, the couple invited 120 guests to the reception, but the queen and her immediate family won't be in attendance. Sadly they can't come to the wedding. Their diaries are arranged months in advance and they're not around, but they adore James. Everyone adores him, Lord Mountbatten told The Daily Mail.\n\nPrior to coming out, Lord Mountbatten was married to Lady Penny Mountbatten and shared three children with her. The couple divorced eight years ago, but there are definitely no hard feelings -- Lady Mountbatten is going to walk her former husband down the aisle. It was the girls' idea, said Lady Mountbatten, It makes me feel quite emotional. I'm really very touched.\n\nAs to why the Lord chose to make history with his wedding, he told the Daily Mail that it's all about his groom.\n\nFor me, what's interesting is I don't need to get married because I've been there, done that and have my wonderful children, said the royal. James hasn't had the stable life I have. I want to be able to give you that.
Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg hit back at conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh after he made homophobic remarks last week on his show. During a CNN town hall in Nevada on Tuesday night, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said he's willing to debate family values against Limbaugh or President Trump, who awarded Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Honor during the State of the Union earlier this month.\n\nCNN's Erin Burnett was discussing the comments from Limbaugh, who said America's not ready to elect a gay guy kissing his husband. She then mentioned Limbaugh said on his show that Mr. Trump told him to never apologize for his remarks against Buttigieg.\n\nButtigieg, who is gay and married, brushed off Limbaugh's comments on Sunday, but on Tuesday, he further dismissed any notion of morality coming from him or Mr. Trump. The idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values? he said. Sorry but one thing about my marriage is, it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse with him or her.\n\nThey want to debate family values, let's debate family values, he added. Let's do it.\n\nMy marriage has never involved me sending hush money to a porn star. I'm ready to have a debate with Donald Trump on family values. #CNNTownHall pic.twitter.com/ZVjpPjVUcb — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) February 19, 2020\n\nLimbaugh has been divorced three times and is currently married to his fourth wife, while Mr. Trump has been divorced twice and is currently married to his third wife. Buttigieg also referenced allegations by federal prosecutors that Mr. Trump directed his personal lawyer in 2016 to arrange payments to buy the silence of porn actress Stormy Daniels, who has alleged she had an affair with Mr. Trump in 2006.\n\nMr. Trump said on Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera's podcast Roadkill With Geraldo that he would be willing to support a gay presidential candidate. Buttigieg told Burnett he had a hard time believing that.\n\nNot if he's sending out his supporters to talk in this way, he said, referring to Limbaugh.\n\nWhile discussing the leading Democrats in the 2020 presidential race, Limbaugh wondered last week how some would fare against Mr. Trump in a debate. Limbaugh suggested Buttigieg wouldn't look as masculine facing Mr. Trump because he loves to kiss his husband on the debate stage.\n\nLimbaugh, who has had a long history of making inflammatory comments on the air, was awarded with the highest civilian honor during the president's State of the Union address earlier this month. A day before, Limbaugh announced he had advanced lung cancer.
FAIRFAX, Va. --A former Fairfax Countypolice officer accused of fatally shooting a man who had his hands up during a 2013 standoff pleaded guilty Monday to involuntary manslaughter, prosecutors said.\n\nThe prosecutors noted the former officer was angry about the breakup of his marriage and unfit for duty when he responded to a domestic dispute.\n\nJohn Geer CBS affiliate WUSA\n\nAdam Torres, 33, struck the plea bargain just before his murder trial was scheduled to begin in Fairfax, nearly three years after Torres shot and killed John Geer, 46, of Springfield.\n\nTorres spoke very briefly at the end of the hearing, saying, I am truly sorry ... There are no words I can say to adequately express my remorse.\n\nCommonwealth's Attorney Ray Morrogh said he agreed to the plea, in part, to spare Geer's daughters from testifying. He said that while Geer's longtime partner, Maura Harrington, supports the plea bargain, Geer's mother does not.\n\nThe plea calls for Torres to serve a 12-month sentence. Sentencing is set for June. The judge accepted the deal, but reserved the right to reject it after he reviews a presentence report.\n\nTorres was unfit for duty after fighting with his wife when he was called to Geer's home, prosecutors said. He's accused of shooting Geer after a 40-minute standoff. Torres has said he thought Geer was dropping his hands and might be reaching for a nearby handgun.\n\nWhile Geer was killed in 2013, Torres was not indicted until 2015. The two-year delay led to allegations that Fairfax County was stonewalling the investigation. The prosecutor said the county's own lawyers refused to provide internal police documents he needed to conduct his investigation. A lawsuit and an inquiry from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, prodded the county to relent.\n\nAt a pretrial hearing last month, defense attorneys sought to suppress numerous statements Torres made to other officers before and after the shooting about his anger over his marriage and his concerns that his wife was cheating on him. On three different days in the year leading up to the shooting, either Torres or his supervisors decided he was emotionally unfit to work because of his distress over his marital woes, prosecutor Robert McClain said.\n\nDefense lawyers argued that the statements were irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial to their client, and should not be used against him because he felt compelled to speak to supervisors to keep his job. Prosecutors said the statements were relevant to establish Torres' state of mind, and said Torres made the statements voluntarily.\n\nJudge Robert Smith ruled that the statements made immediately after the shooting and in the days after are admissible, but the September 2012 discussions with his supervisor were not.
Larry Kramer, the playwright whose angry voice and pen raised theatergoers' consciousness about AIDS and roused thousands to militant protests in the early years of the epidemic, has died at 84. Bill Goldstein, a writer who was working on a biography of Kramer, confirmed the news to The Associated Press. Kramer's husband, David Webster, told The New York Times that Kramer died Wednesday of pneumonia.\n\nWe have lost a giant of a man who stood up for gay rights like a warrior. His anger was needed at a time when gay men's deaths to AIDS were being ignored by the American government, said Elton John in a statement.\n\nKramer, who wrote The Normal Heart and founded the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, lost his lover to acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 1984 and was himself infected with the virus. He also suffered from hepatitis B and received a liver transplant in 2001 because the virus had caused liver failure.\n\nHe was nominated for an Academy Award for his screenplay for Women in Love, the 1969 adaptation of D.H. Lawrence's novel. It starred Glenda Jackson, who won her first Oscar for her performance.\n\nHe also wrote the 1972 screenplay Lost Horizon, a novel, Faggots, and the plays Sissies' Scrapbook, The Furniture of Home, Just Say No and The Destiny of Me, which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1993.\n\nBut for many years he was best known for his public fight to secure medical treatment, acceptance and civil rights for people with AIDS. He loudly told everyone that the gay community was grappling with a plague.\n\nPlaywright Larry Kramer (L) and David Webster pose for a picture on June 9, 2013, in New York City. Getty\n\nTributes from the arts community flooded in Wednesday, with Lin-Manuel Miranda on Twitter saying What an extraordinary writer, what a life. Dan Savage wrote: He ordered us to love ourselves and each other and to fight for our lives. He was a hero.\n\nIn 1981, when AIDS had not yet acquired its name and only a few dozen people had been diagnosed with it, Kramer and a group of his friends in New York City founded Gay Men's Health Crisis, one of the first groups in the country to address the epidemic.\n\nHe tried to rouse the gay community with speeches and articles such as 1,112 and Counting, published in gay newspapers in 1983.\n\nOur continued existence as gay men upon the face of this earth is at stake, he wrote. Unless we fight for our lives, we shall die.\n\nThe late journalist Randy Shilts, in his best selling account of the AIDS epidemic And the Band Played On, called that article inarguably one of the most influential works of advocacy journalism of the decade and credited it with crystallizing the epidemic into a political movement for the gay community.\n\nKramer lived to see gay marriage a reality — and married himself in 2013 — but never rested. I'm married, he told The AP. But that's only part of where we are. AIDS is still decimating us and we still don't have protection under the law.\n\nKramer split with GMHC in 1983 after other board members decided to concentrate on providing support services to people with AIDS. It remains one of the largest AIDS-service groups in the country.\n\nAfter leaving GMHC, Kramer wrote The Normal Heart, in which a furious young writer — not unlike Kramer himself — battles politicians, society, the media and other gay leaders to bring attention to the crisis.\n\nThe play premiered at The Public Theater in April 1985. Associated Press drama critic Michael Kuchwara called it an angry but compelling indictment of a society as well as a subculture for failing to respond adequately to the tragedy.\n\nA revival in 2011 was almost universally praised by critics and earned the best revival Tony. Two actors from it — Ellen Barkin and John Benjamin Hickey — also won Tonys. Joe Mantello played the main character of Ned Weeks, the alter ego of Kramer.\n\nI'm very moved that it moved so many people, he said at the time. Kramer often stood outside the theater passing out fliers asking the world to take action against HIV/AIDS. Please know that AIDS is a worldwide plague. Please know there is no cure, it said.\n\nWinners of Best Revival of a Play Larry Kramer and Daryl Roth speak on stage during the 65th Annual Tony Awards at the Beacon Theatre on June 12, 2011, in New York City. Getty\n\nThe play was turned into a TV film for HBO in 2014 starring Mark Ruffalo, Jonathan Groff, Matt Bomer, Taylor Kitsch, Jim Parsons, Alfred Molina, Joe Mantello and Julia Roberts. It won the Emmy for best movie. Kramer stood onstage in heavy winter clothing as the statuette was presented to director Ryan Murphy.\n\nThe 1992 play The Destiny of Me, continues the story of Weeks from The Normal Heart. Weeks, in the hospital for an experimental AIDS treatment, reflects on the past, particularly his relationship with his family. His parents and brother appear to act out what happened in the past, as does the young Ned, who confronts his older self.\n\nIn 1987, Kramer founded ACT UP, the group that became famous for staging civil disobedience at places like the Food and Drug Administration, the New York Stock Exchange and Burroughs-Wellcome Corp., the maker of the chief anti-AIDS drug, AZT.\n\nACT UP's protests helped persuade the FDA to speed the approval of new drugs and Burroughs-Wellcome to lower its price for AZT. He also battled — and later reconciled — with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has been leading the national response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nKramer soon relinquished a leadership role in ACT UP, and as support for AIDS research increased, he found some common ground with health officials whom ACT UP had bitterly criticized.\n\nKramer never softened the urgency of his demands. In 2011, he helped the American Foundation for Equal Rights mount their play 8 on Broadway about the legal battle over same-sex marriage in California.\n\nThe one nice thing that I seem to have acquired, accidentally, is this reputation of everyone afraid of my voice, he told The AP in 2015. So I get heard, whether it changes anything or not.\n\nOne of his last projects was the massive two-volume The American People, which chronicled the history of gay people in America and took decades to write.\n\nI just think it's so important that we know our history — the history of how badly we're treated and how hard we have to fight to get what we deserve, which is equality, he told AP.\n\nAt the 2013 Tonys, he was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson Award, given to a member of the theater community for philanthropic or civic efforts.\n\nA few months later, Kramer married his longtime partner, architect David Webster, in the intensive care unit of NYU Langone Medical Center, where Kramer was recovering from surgery for a bowel obstruction.
Czech filmmaker Milos Forman, whose American movies One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus won a deluge of Academy Awards, including Best Director Oscars, died Saturday. He was 86.\n\nForman died about 2 a.m. Saturday at Danbury Hospital, near his home in Warren, Conn., according to a statement released by the former director's agent, Dennis Aspland. Aspland said Forman's wife, Martina, notified him of the death.\n\nWhen he arrived in Hollywood in the late 1960s, Forman was lacking in both money and English skills, but carrying a portfolio of Czechoslovakian films much admired internationally for their quirky, lighthearted spirit. Among them were Black Peter, ''Loves of a Blonde and The Fireman's Ball.\n\nExcerpt: How not to pick up women at a beer hall, from Loves of a Blonde.\n\nThe orphan of Nazi Holocaust victims, Forman had abandoned his homeland after communist troops invaded in 1968 and crushed a brief period of political and artistic freedom known as the Prague Spring.\n\nIn America, his record as a Czech filmmaker was enough to gain him entree to Hollywood's studios, but his early suggestions for film projects were quickly rejected. Among them were an adaptation of Franz Kafka's novel Amerika and a comedy starring entertainer Jimmy Durante as a wealthy bear hunter in Czechoslovakia.\n\nAfter his first U.S. film, 1969's Taking Off, flopped, Forman didn't get a chance to direct a major feature again for five years. He occupied himself during part of that time by covering the decathlon at the 1972 Olympics for the documentary Visions of Eight.\n\nTaking Off, an amusing look at generational differences in a changing America, had won praise from critics who compared it favorably to Forman's Czech films. But without any big-name stars it quickly tanked at the box office.\n\nActor Michael Douglas gave Forman a second chance, hiring him to direct One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which Douglas was co-producing.\n\nThe film, based on Ken Kesey's novel about a misfit who leads the inmates of a mental institution in a revolt against authority, captured every major Oscar at that year's Academy Awards, the first film to do so since 1934s It Happened One Night.\n\nExcerpt: Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest:\n\nThe winners included Jack Nicholson as lead actor, Louise Fletcher as lead actress, screenwriters Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben, Forman as director and the film itself for Best Picture.\n\nThe director, who worked meticulously, spending months with screenwriters and overseeing every aspect of production, didn't release another film until 1979's Hair.\n\nThe musical, about rebellious 1960s-era American youth, appealed to a director who had witnessed his own share of youthful rebellion against communist repression in Czechoslovakia. But by the time it came out, America's brief period of student revolt had long since faded, and the public wasn't interested.\n\nRagtime followed in 1981. The adaptation of E.L. Doctorow's novel, notable for Forman's ability to persuade his aging Connecticut neighbor Jimmy Cagney to end 20 years of retirement and play the corrupt police commissioner, also was a disappointment.\n\nExcerpt: Mandy Patinkin and Elizabeth McGovern in Ragtime:\n\nForman returned to top form three years later, however, when he released Amadeus.\n\nBased on Peter Shaffer's play, it portrayed 18th century musical genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as a foul-mouthed man-child, with lesser composer Salieri as his shadowy nemesis. It captured seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (for F. Murray Abraham as Salieri).\n\nExcerpt: F. Murray Abraham and Elizabeth Berridge in Amadeus:\n\nHunting for locations, Forman realized Prague was the only European capital that had changed little since Mozart's time, but returning there initially filled him with dread.\n\nHis parents had died in a Nazi concentration camp when he was 9. He had been in Paris when the communists crushed the Prague Spring movement in 1968, and he hadn't bothered to return home, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1975.\n\nThe Czech government, realizing the money to be made by letting Amadeus be filmed in Prague, allowed Forman to come home, and the public hailed his return.\n\nThere was an enormous affection for us doing the film, he remarked in 2002. The people considered it a victory for me that the authorities had to bow to the almighty dollar and let the traitor back.\n\nNever prolific, Forman's output slowed even more after Amadeus, and his three subsequent films were disappointments.\n\nValmont (1989) reached audiences a year after Dangerous Liaisons, both based on the same French novel.\n\nThe People vs. Larry Flint (1996) was an ill-advised attempt to paint the Hustler magazine publisher as a free-speech advocate.\n\nMan on the Moon, based on the life of cult hero Andy Kaufman, did win its star, Jim Carrey, a Golden Globe. But it also failed to fully convey Kaufman's pioneering style of offbeat comedy or the reasons for his disdaining success at every turn.\n\nExcerpt: Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman performing the Mighty Mouse song in Man on the Moon:\n\nJan Tomas Forman, born in Caslav, Czechoslovakia, was raised by relatives after his parents' deaths and attended arts school in Prague.\n\nThe director's first marriage, to actress Jana Brejchova ended in divorce. He left his second wife, singer Vera Kresadlova, behind with the couple's two children when he left Czechoslovakia. He married Martina Zborilova in 1999.
Actor Antonio Banderas is going home -- returning to Spain to portray his hometown's great 20th century artist, Pablo Picasso. Our Seth Doane tagged along:\n\nTo Antonio Banderas, Málaga, Spain, becomes a little village.\n\nTo see his hometown with Antonio Banderas, well, you've gotta keep moving.\n\nYou create quite a fuss when you go someplace, Doane said.\n\nYeah, somebody's the mother or the son or the daughter or the cousin, so everybody knows everybody over here, so it's normal, he said. With the result, Everybody wants a photo.\n\nAntonio Banderas with correspondent Seth Doane on the streets of Málaga, the coastal Spanish town that was the birthplace of both the legendary painter and the man who portrays him in the new series, Genius. CBS News\n\nDodging the perils of near-constant requests for photos, Banderas took us on a whirlwind tour of his Málaga, this ancient city of half-a-million on the Spanish coast.\n\nHe wanted us to see the church where he was baptized, and where he returns each year to help carry a massive float in Holy Week processions.\n\nHis advice: Don't forget who you are and where are your roots. A man without roots is a nobody.\n\nHis roots in Málaga, growing up with his brother Javier, were humble -- far from the life of a celebrity who'd need to don a hat and sunglasses to avoid detection.\n\nA view of the ancient city of Málaga, Spain. CBS News\n\nHis father was a policeman, his mother a schoolteacher. What did they think about you becoming an actor? Doane asked.\n\nOh, they didn't like it at all! In the beginning was very bad.\n\nOf course it turned out to be very good for Banderas, who went on to star opposite Madonna in Evita, and Brad Pitt in Interview With a Vampire. He played a suave swordsman in The Mask of Zorro. And he was the big voice of the tiny cat Puss in Boots in the Shrek sequels.\n\nDoane said, Your career is hard to characterize.\n\nI love that! Banderas laughed.\n\nHis latest role hits a little closer to home. Banderas plays another famous malagueño: Pablo Picasso. I really have the opportunity here to discover a man who was born in my town, to whom I feel linked, he said.\n\nHe showed Doane around the Picasso Museum in Málaga -- but it was in a makeup trailer in Budapest, Hungary, where we saw him become Picasso.\n\nI shave my head, I shave my eyebrows; over that, they start creating the character, Banderas said.\n\nIn two-and-a-half hours, makeup artists transformed the youthful 57-year-old into a much older-looking Picasso for the National Geographic series, Genius.\n\nMakeup artists transform the actor into the painter Pablo Picasso for the series Genius. CBS News\n\nPlaying the dark side of him is hard, because he is my idol, Banderas said.\n\nPicasso, of course, was a legendary painter and philanderer. His life is chronicled in the 10-episode series premiering later this month.\n\nTo watch a trailer for Genius, click on the video player below.\n\nOn the set, Doane said, This takes endurance … take after take after take.\n\nYeah. I'm happy you are watching this, because this is the life of actors, Banderas said. People sometimes believe that we live on a red carpet or something like that. Acting in movies, in theater is hard work.\n\nWe're not used to seeing you as an older man as we saw in 'Picasso.'\n\nYeah, I found incredible liberation in that because you escape from certain labels that people put you in -- you know, the Latin lover or other thing, you know, is fine for a while and it's fun for a while. But I'm 57. I don't want to be the sexy boy my whole life, because that would be pathetic.\n\nThe actor portrays the artist Pablo Picasso in the new series, Genius. Like Picasso, Banderas was born in the coastal Spanish city of Málaga. CBS News\n\nBanderas has long been a fixture on that red carpet. His 19-year marriage to fellow A-Lister Melanie Griffith plunged him into the spotlight.\n\nIt was a long way from the small stage in Spain, where he was once arrested for doing politically-sensitive theater, and where he was discovered by ground-breaking Spanish director Pedro Amlodóvar. He stepped into territories that were totally forbidden before, [like] homosexuality, Banderas said. It was a number of things that never were seen in this Spanish cinematography.\n\nBanderas' work with Almodóvar -- specifically, the Oscar-nominated Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown -- led to a meeting with a Hollywood producer. There was only one problem…\n\nThis guy said to me, 'I told him that you speak English,' Banderas recalled. And I said, 'How can you say that? I don't speak at all!' So, I sit down and I fake the whole entire dinner -- that I was a very shy guy, just Yes and No.\n\nBut it worked! said Doane. You got the part in 'Mambo Kings'?\n\nHe believed it!\n\nSo, for his first Hollywood film, The Mambo Kings, Banderas -- who still could not speak English -- learned the lines phonetically. That was 1992.\n\nSo, I get back to Spain and I say, 'Okay, I can tell that to my grandson, I did a movie in America!' Banderas said.\n\nAnd then came Philadelphia.\n\nIn that 1993 drama Banderas played the lover of Tom Hanks' character, a lawyer with HIV. It was like a fresh air, he said. Yes, it's about time. It's about time Hollywood comes out of the closet.\n\nTop left: Antonio Banderas with Carmen Maura in Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.

Orion Classics, Miramax, Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Buena Vista Pictures\n\n\n\nHe's super-critical of himself, and his performances. I think I will die thinking, 'I didn't get that thing that I will be remembered for.'\n\nAnd it was a real-life brush with death -- a heart attack he suffered in January 2017 -- that made him more reflective of the roles he plays … a dad being the most important one.\n\nPhotos of Stella del Carmen -- his daughter with Melanie Griffith -- are up at El Pimpi, the restaurant he adores, and co-owns.\n\nEntering El Pimpi, the restaurant co-owned by Antonio Banderas. CBS News\n\nHe keeps a room for Stella in his sprawling Málaga apartment, which is filled with awards, and art -- some of it quite recognizable, such as a Picasso sketch: I had another one, but I gave it to Melanie after the divorce. She kept one and I kept the other one.\n\nAsked to describe going through the divorce, Banderas said it was painful. It's always painful, until you start discovering that not everything is over. We can keep our friendship, we can keep our memories, we can be proud of them. I think we've handled it very well. She's part of my life, and she's my family, and she will be until the day I die.\n\nUpstairs, on the roof terrace, where Moorish walls and a Roman amphitheater provide a breathtaking backdrop, he pointed out where he was raised, and where Picasso was born.\n\nA rooftop view of Málaga. CBS News\n\nDoane said, You grew up surrounded by Picasso, knowing about Picasso, being proud of Picasso…\n\nAnd finally being Picasso! he laughed.\n\nStill, he's always searching: He wants to direct again, and has gone back to school for fashion design. Antonio Banderas relishes playing many roles -- not only those on-camera.\n\nYeah, I do a lot of things. There's only one life, you have to do it, he said. And there is time. Absolutely, there is time for everything.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mikaela Bufano.
Chicago — Chicago police are investigating an officer's death last Saturday as a possible suicide. If so, that would make six police suicides there since the summer. Blue HELP, which provides mental health resources for police, said officers are twice as likely to die by their own hands than in a confrontation with a criminal.\n\nEvery week, Chicago Police Chaplain Rev. Dan Brandt rides deep into the city's most violent neighborhoods, listening to the cops who patrol these streets. What he hears are cries for help.\n\nThese officers see more evil in the course of a 10-hour tour than most anybody sees in a lifetime, Brandt said.\n\nIt can't be unseen.\n\nWhen an accountant goes home, he can talk to his spouse about the audit that he or she just conducted. But officers don't want to go home and burden their spouse with ugliness, the blood and the guts they've encountered over the last eight or 10 hours, Brandt said.\n\nChicago Police Chaplain Rev. Dan Brandt. CBS News\n\nNationwide, at least 161 police officers reportedly took their own lives last year and 160 the year before, outpacing the number who died in the line of duty. Five and possibly six in Chicago have died since July. Experts on the subject say stress creates problems at home, relationship issues and worse.\n\nThey've got the tool to do so, to end their own life, right on their hip, Brandt said.\n\nIn Chicago, contacts between officers and their families with the CPD's mental health assistance program more than doubled between 2013 and 2017.\n\nBrandt offers a sympathetic ear, kevlar for the spirit. But the need is urgent.\n\nJeffrey Sacks is a former Chicago officer and stepfather of Dane Smith, an officer who committed suicide on New Year's Day.\n\nI think there was a lot of straws that broke the camel's back, Sacks said. Working in one of the roughest neighborhoods in the city of Chicago. I believe he suffered from post-traumatic stress.\n\nIt's those neighborhoods where you find Brandt.\n\nPolice officers are a rare breed. They're called to be social workers, and 10-minute marriage counselors and peace-makers and dodgers of bullets, he said.\n\nHe knows the wounds can go deep.
Meghan Markle's half-sister said their father was under an unbelievable amount of stress because of media intrusion. Samantha Markle told the TV show Good Morning Britain on Tuesday that journalists rented the house next to him in Mexico, four or five of them. He can't open his blinds, he can't go anywhere without being followed.\n\nOn Monday, Thomas Markle said that he won't attend his daughter's wedding to Prince Harry after he posed for embarrassing photos in exchange for payment from a paparazzi agency. Thomas told TMZ that he suffered a heart attack last week and will skip the wedding -- leaving open the question of who will walk the bride down the aisle.\n\nHe is not the first person to be bruised in the collision between Britain's royal family and the media -- a relationship that is deep, complex and sometimes toxic.\n\nIt is a symbiotic and parasitic relationship which is harmful to both sides, said Graham Smith of anti-monarchy group Republic, who is resolutely unaffected by royal wedding fever. Certainly harmful to the British public in terms of the way in which we are fed this hype and nonsense ... and clearly harmful to the family.\n\nFor centuries, Britain's royal dramas played out at a distance from the public, as a deferential media protected the secrets of the monarchy. In the 1930s, the romance between King Edward VIII and divorced American Wallis Simpson was headline news in the U.S. press, but barely mentioned in Britain until the king abdicated, forced to choose between the crown and the woman he loved.\n\nThat changed by the time Prince Charles married 20-year-old Lady Diana Spencer in 1981 in a ceremony watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world. The media charted every twist in the saga that followed: the births of sons William and Harry, Diana's glamour and charity work, and her evident and growing unhappiness in the marriage.\n\nCharles and Diana both used the media as a weapon as their marriage foundered, giving TV interviews to present themselves in a sympathetic light. It was ratings gold, reaching a peak when Diana told an interviewer that there were three of us in the marriage -- Diana, Charles and his paramour Camilla Parker-Bowles.\n\nDiana turned the royal family inside out, said Ellis Cashmore, honorary professor of sociology at Aston University and author of books on celebrity culture. All the dirty secrets had come into the public domain.\n\nDiana became the most famous woman on Earth, trailed by paparazzi wherever she went -- including to her death. She was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997, while being pursued by photographers.\n\nDiana's death provoked a crisis for the monarchy -- portrayed as remote and cold at a time of national grief -- and for the media, accused of hounding a vulnerable woman.\n\nIn the years that followed, palace and press reached an uneasy truce. The royal family made concessions to popular interest, including carefully staged interviews and photo opportunities with William and Harry as they grew up. That practice has continued with the three young children of William and his wife Kate.\n\nBut Diana's sons retain a deeply ingrained mistrust of the media.\n\nHarry's attitude towards the press is he doesn't like the press, former Sun newspaper royal editor Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story, told Town & Country magazine. In Harry's mind, it was the press that killed his mother.\n\nWhen Harry and Markle decided to make their relationship public, the prince fired a broadside at the media, saying that biracial Markle had faced a wave of abuse and harassment, including racial undertones in comment articles.\n\nThis is not a game -- it is her life and his, said the statement from Harry's press secretary.\n\nStill, Markle's media experience, gained during her career as an actress, has been evident from the start. At the couple's televised engagement interview she appeared relaxed, confident and happy. It was a far cry from a 1981 interview with shy Diana and awkward Charles, who replied whatever love means when asked if he was in love.\n\nSaturday's wedding is expected to draw more than 5,000 media staff and 79 television networks from around the world to Windsor. American and international TV networks plan hours of live coverage.\n\nI don't think anything can quite prepare her, Cashmore said -- though as an independent-minded woman, brimming with confidence Markle is well equipped to deal with intense media interest that is unlikely to fade.\n\nThe media are the public's proxy, Cashmore said. The reason they go for these stories that are ever more intrusive is that we want it.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- The man who police say killed six people in the Phoenix area spent hours online griping about his ex-wife and the family court system that sided with her in a contentious divorce years ago. Dwight Lamon Jones spoke in a series of YouTube videos posted in May about the judge, counselor and prominent forensic psychiatrist in the case.\n\nThe psychiatrist, Steven Pitt, who also assisted in the JonBenét Ramsey mystery in Colorado, was called a scumbag by Jones in one of the videos. He was killed Thursday.\n\nDwight Lamon Jones Scottsdale PD via KPHO\n\nJones was divorced in 2010 and his ex-wife was awarded custody of their son. Pitt had evaluated Jones and testified that year that he had anxiety and mood disorders and symptoms of a paranoid personality.\n\nA hunch from a retired detective helped lead police to Jones and link the victims, some of whom were connected to the divorce case, authorities said after the assailant killed himself inside a Scottsdale hotel Monday with officers closing in.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, the suspect's ex-wife, Connie Jones, said her current husband, a retired police detective, made the connection between her divorce and the crime scenes and notified police of his suspicion Saturday night.\n\nThe victims included Pitt, two paralegals who worked for the law office that represented Jones' wife, and a marriage-and-divorce counselor who was apparently targeted in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nAuthorities have since named two other victims found shot dead early Monday in their Fountain Hills home as 70-year-old Mary Simmons and 72-year-old Bryon Thomas. Police said they had probable cause to link all six killings to the dead suspect, but they have not disclosed a connection between Jones and the victims in Fountain Hills.\n\nCBS affiliate KPHO reports that Jones was already on investigators' radar Monday when they saw him dumping a bag that contained a gun that had been stolen from the Fountain Hills home.\n\nConnie Jones said in a statement that her ex-husband was a very emotionally disturbed person.\n\nIn the YouTube videos, Jones appeared to be resentful about the divorce and accused his ex-wife and her attorney of spreading lies. Jones posted a total of 18 videos, some of them nearly an hour long, KPHO reports. They've since been removed.\n\nPolice released a suspect sketch, left, in the killings of four Phoenix-area professionals: Steven Pitt, top right, Marshall Levine, bottom left, Laura Anderson, bottom center, and Veleria Sharp, bottom right. KPHO-TV\n\nHer attorney told her to plant those tapes and do all that devious stuff she did, Jones said in one clip.\n\nAccording to KPHO, in another video Jones posted titled An open letter to my son, Jones said, I've been trying to contact you since the last time I've seen you which was 2011.... I know she's been telling you lies about why we got divorced.\n\nPolice say one of Jones' victims was Marshall Levine, a man who happened to take over the same office space as Karen Kolbe, who may have been his intended target because she was his son's counselor. The son is now 21.\n\nParalegals Veleria Sharp, 48, and Laura Anderson, 49, worked at the law office that represented Jones' wife. Police believe Jones may have been targeting the attorney, but she was not present Friday when Jones went to the office in downtown Scottsdale.\n\nSharp was shot in the head but ran out of the office to get help before collapsing on the street, police said. She was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nIn the videos, Jones appears bitter about the divorce, In many of the videos, Jones pointed the camera at a white mask, while speaking softly in the background, reports KPHO. In others, he narrated over a recorded risk assessment interview between his ex-wife and Pitt.\n\nBryon Thomas, left, and Mary Simmons were found dead in their Fountain Hills home. KPHO\n\nPitt was retained by Connie Jones' lawyer to conduct the interview and get a better understanding of her relationship with Jones, the station reports.\n\nIn one of the YouTube videos, Jones reportedly described a fight between himself and his ex-wife during which police were called.\n\nIt was a setup. She claimed I hit her even though the police found no evidence of a physical struggle, Jones said.\n\nBut Jones was accused multiple times throughout the 20-year marriage of being physically abusive to the woman, including one incident where he fractured her sternum in 2007, according to the couple's divorce records obtained by KPHO.\n\nRecords show Jones was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in 2009 but the status of the case was unclear. Court documents say Jones attacked Connie Jones in front of their son, backing the mother into a wall, pushing and hitting her in the face with his forearm, the station reports.\n\nThomas Mangan, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Tuesday that a .40-caliber Glock handgun legally owned by Jones was linked to some of the attacks. Mangan said the earlier incident didn't legally prevent Jones from buying the gun, which has been recovered by authorities.
Billionaire Elon Musk and actress Amber Heard have stayed mum about their dating status, but the pair appeared to confirm their relationship over the weekend on Instagram.\n\nMusk and Heard posted matching photos of the two of them dining out at a restaurant on the Gold Coast in Australia, just after Heard planted a kiss on Musk's cheek, leaving behind some lipstick.\n\nCheeky, Heard wrote in the caption.\n\nCheeky A post shared by Amber Heard (@amberheard) on Apr 23, 2017 at 5:11pm PDT\n\nThe two were also spotted zip-lining in Australia, where Heard is filming Aquaman. The Tesla scion's Instagram caption revealed that the couple were eating out with the movie's director James Wan and producer Rob Cowan.\n\nHeard, 31, divorced Johnny Depp last year after alleging domestic violence.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - A former Michigan teacher has been sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for slashing his wife's throat after she discovered evidence of an affair that investigators said involved a middle-school student.\n\nJames Chelekis was sentenced Tuesday in Kent County Circuit Court after pleaded no contest to attempted murder for attacking his wife at their home in June. The 32-year-old also pleaded guilty to criminal sexual conduct related to the student.\n\nThe attack came after Amanda Chelekis found evidence of an affair. The couple spent most of the evening discussing the issue before agreeing to marriage counseling. Amanda Chelekis wasn't aware at the time that her husband's contact was with a juvenile.\n\nStanding behind me, he kissed my forehead and slit my throat from one side to the other, Amanda Chelekis said in court. The trauma I was forced to endure was horrendous.\n\nAmanda Chelekis, who is a registered nurse, was able to contain the bleeding for almost an hour before her husband called for help. She filed for divorce after the attack. The pair has two daughters together.\n\nJames Chelekis was a math teacher at Crestwood Middle School. Investigators said he'd traded texts, chats and photos with a 14-year-old girl that suggested they began sexual encounters in June 2016.\n\nIn a statement read by prosecutors, the girl's mother wrote that James Chelekis had manipulated and isolated her daughter in order to start an inappropriate relationship with the girl.\n\nHe robbed our daughter of her innocence and childhood. And that is something that she can never get back, she wrote.\n\nJames Chelekis was sentenced to 15 to 40 years in prison on the criminal sexual conduct charge. The prison term will be served concurrently with the attempted murder sentence.

Produced by Alec Sirken, Marc Goldbaum, Paul LaRosa, Chris Young Ritzen, James Stolz and Aimee deSimone.\n\nIt's Friday night in Quincy, Illinois, and thousands have come out to cheer for the home team.\n\nThe Quincy High School Blue Devils is a revered, legendary program. One of the winningest programs in high school history, said local journalist Bob Gough, who swaps his keyboard for a microphone and moonlights as the announcer.\n\nIf you're a local sports star, you know people are always wanting to know about you, he said.\n\nAnd no one was bigger than Blue Devil's Hall of Famer Curtis Lovelace. In the 1980s, he made headlines as a star athlete and scholar at Quincy High School.\n\nCurtis Lovelace was a star student athlete at Quincy High School\n\nCurtis Lovelace was a very hard working kid, smart kid, said Gough.\n\nAnd the University of Illinois gave Lovelace - #54 -- a scholarship to play football.\n\nI mean Quincy, Illinois, doesn't produce a ton of All-Big Ten players, Gough noted.\n\nHe wasn't just any player. Lovelace, who studied business administration, was considered one of the top offensive linemen in the Big Ten -- a team captain who lead the University of Illinois to the Big Ten Championship his senior year.\n\nWas two-time All-Big Ten, even got a look in free agent camp in the NFL, Gough explained. Had a bad knee injury, which, not sure if he woulda made it or not, but that certainly didn't help the situation. But being a smart kid Curtis already had other goals in mind.\n\nWhile at school, Curtis started a long distance relationship with Cory Didriksen. They met in high school, but only started dating when they left for college. She was studying communications at the University of Iowa.\n\nShe just had a perfect smile, Cory's mother, Marty Didriksen, told CBS affiliate KHQA. And she just smiled at everyone. And she just did stuff.\n\nCory was vibrant, dynamic. A little bit of stubbornness, and she was a pistol and I loved her for that. I think that was her most endearing quality, said friend Steve Belko.\n\nBelko, Beth Dobrzynski and Bret Schrader grew up with Cory and Curtis in Quincy.\n\nCurt was easygoing he was a gentleman, fun loving, intelligent - a gentlemen, said Belko.\n\nDo you think they were well matched? Maher asked the group of friends.\n\nI did. I did. Well, they looked great together, but they had a lot of similarities and they seemed to have fun together, Dobrzynski replied.\n\nIt didn't take long before their relationship became serious.\n\nIt was Thanksgiving. We were sitting up on her bed. And we were just kinda talking about things and she said, 'Oh, by the way, I've met the man I'm going to marry,' said Didriksen.\n\nCurtis and Cory Lovelace Marty Didriksen\n\nIn 1991, just one year after graduation, they were married. Belko was Curt's best man and Dobrzynski was Cory's bridesmaid.\n\nIt was one of the best days, you know, in our lives, said Belko.\n\nCory was beautiful. It was a great night. They were very happy. The pictures you know, you could see on their faces. Whether it was cutting the cake or dancing or walking around and talking to people. It was a magical night, Dobrzynski reminisced.\n\nWith Cory by his side, Curtis Lovelace had grand plans. He attended law school and eventually became an assistant state's attorney in the city they both loved, Quincy.\n\nWhat did Cory want to do with her life? ... What were her dreams? Maher asked Dobrzynski.\n\nCory was all about family. She had a great childhood growing up, she replied. She wanted the big family. ...The happy marriage.\n\nThe Lovelace family Marty Didriksen\n\nThat dream came true in 1993, when their first child, Lyndsay, was born. They would later have three sons: Logan, Lincoln, and Larson.\n\nShe was a beautiful person, Lyndsay Lovelace said of her mother.\n\nLyndsay, now 22, told KHQA reporter Jenny Dreasler how she and her mother loved listening to the music group ABBA.\n\nWe would just have girl moments and just dance around and sing 'Dancing Queen.' I still listen to them because it brings me so much joy from that, she said.\n\nLyndsay's dad was a man on the move. In 2005, he opened up his own law firm while still at the state's attorney's office. Years later, he left to concentrate on his own practice. And, if his schedule wasn't busy enough, Lovelace was elected president of the school board. He became a captain in the Illinois National Guard, and an adjunct professor at Quincy University.\n\nHe definitely was a pillar of this community, no question about it, Gough remarked.\n\nBut friends say with power, came ego.\n\nI just felt he kinda started to talk down to me more and more each time I saw him, said Schrader.\n\nWas he arrogant? Maher asked.\n\nHe became arrogant more and more, yes, Belko said. There was a little bit of holier than thou. ...Maybe you were entitled to this living. I think he lost friends over time because of that.\n\nThe situation at home had also been changing. While Curtis had spent years focused on his professional life, the long hours away from Cory and the kids were starting to take a toll on their personal life.\n\nFrom what we learned now, and he eventually admitted, they had a volatile relationship, said Gough.\n\nNeighbors around the Lovelace house on Kentucky Street say that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between Cory and Curtis. By many accounts, both were heavy drinkers. And in this small community, it was known that at times there was a tremendous amount of turmoil in their home.\n\nShe suffered from bulimia. This is something her family has admitted, Dreasler said. And the rumors started coming out. ...Known alcoholism. The community knew that too. There've been people who've even told me ... I saw her out drinking here or out drinking there. People knew that she had an alcohol problem, but I don't think that they knew to the extent.\n\nCory and Curtis Lovelace Steve Belko\n\nAmazingly, Curtis and Cory managed to keep their problems from their closest friends, like Belko, who years before, had moved away from their small town.\n\nWas there a point in time where any of you started to see things changing between the two of them? Maher asked the friends.\n\nNo, said Belko.\n\nNo indication that there was trouble coming up? Maher asked.\n\nI never had any, Belko replied.\n\nCory was a great person, very confident, she had everything under control. And she wasn't one to you know whine or complain, Dobrzynski said. She could handle it.\n\nBut everything fell apart on Valentine's Day 2006, when Belko got a call from Curtis's father that Cory had died.\n\nHe said, 'Listen I got some bad news.' ...And I just couldn't believe it. No, that doesn't happen. She's my age. She's healthy. This just doesn't come from nowhere, Belko said. Something's wrong. There was no doubt something is terribly wrong.\n\nVALENTINE'S DAY MYSTERY\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2006, love was in the crisp winter air of Quincy, Illinois. At 1869 Kentucky, it was a school day and Cory Lovelace would usually have her hands full.\n\nCory was a stay at home mom, Gough explained. She was always hustling, always trying to get the kids wrangled around and to where they needed to be.\n\nThat morning seemed like so many others. According to Curtis Lovelace, Cory helped get the kids ready. They had breakfast and jumped in dad's car. It was 8:15 a.m.\n\nCurtis then took the three oldest children to school, Gough said. They left the youngest, the 4-year-old, there.\n\nAnd little 4-year-old Larson went upstairs to see his mom.\n\nWent in and he said that he said her name and he thought he poked her. But she didn't answer, Dreasler explained. So he ... sat and waited for his dad to get home.\n\nThen when he got back, the youngest was still there ... said something that he couldn't wake his mom up, said Gough.\n\nBy then, it was about 9 a.m.\n\nCurt went upstairs to use the restroom and glanced back in the bedroom and saw something wasn't right. Went in to see Cory, tried to shake her. And nothing, said Belko.\n\nThat was the moment a normal Valentine's Day morning turned into a mystery. Behavior turned suddenly strange, starting with Curtis Lovelace.\n\nTook the youngest to Cory's mother's house. Gave the youngest child to Cory's mother and said, 'Cory's dead' and left, Gough said. The first call was not to 911. The first call was not to the paramedics. The first call was his boss, the state's attorney.\n\nStill strikes you as odd, Maher noted.\n\nVery much so, said Gough.\n\nWho walks over to their mother-in-law's house, gives them their youngest ... and says, 'Your daughter's dead, here's my child. Take care of him,' Maher commented.\n\nThe whole scenario was bizarre, said Gough.\n\nWas Curtis Lovelace in shock?\n\nPeople do process grief differently, sure. If it was my wife, I think I'd have called 911 screaming and ranting and trying to perform CPR, which he didn't do, said Gough.\n\nThe grim details of the day would be embedded in the minds of those who were there. E.M.T Cole Miller was among the first on the scene.\n\nShe was laying in the bed and her arms were drawn up by her chest, he explained, holding up his arms to show how Cory's were positioned. And I went in there to check for signs of life, checked her carotid pulse in her neck, and then checked her wrist and saw that it was cold and stiff.\n\nIt was just surreal, said Dobrzynski.\n\nWhen I did find out I was very shocked, said Schrader.\n\nWhat happened in the house that morning, when it happened -- just how long Cory Lovelace had been dead -- would be questions that would haunt a town and destroy a family.\n\nShe'd been dead long enough that there was no need to start CPR. It wouldn't do any good, said Miller.\n\nQuincy Police Detective Jeff Baird would not speak to 48 Hours. But that day he did speak with Curtis, who told his version of events -- a morning Curtis swears to police and to friends, Cory was still very much alive.\n\nWhat did he say happened? Maher asked Steve Belko.\n\nThat Cory had been ill the night before ... had thrown up and wanted some Tylenol and he got her some, he explained. Apparently she did come down to help. He told me he just remembers her at the bottom of the steps, they walked out and he took the kids to school.\n\nAccording to Curtis, his wife Cory was not feeling well that Valentine's Day morning. She came down the stairs and sat down for a while. Detective Baird said that three of the children also told him they saw their mother alive that morning.\n\nHe interviewed the three oldest children. Those interviews were not recorded, video or audio. He just took notes and then turned in a report in which he spoke to the three oldest children individually, without their father being there. And they all told him they had seen their mother that morning, said Gough.\n\nWhy is the time Cory Lovelace died so critical? Ask a man who deals in death for a living, Deputy Coroner James Keller. That Valentine's Day morning, he was there to transport Cory's body.\n\nUpon entering the bedroom, I notice the female lying on the bed on her back with her hands kind of in an upright position, Keller explained.\n\nCan you show me? Maher asked.\n\nHands kind of above her, he said, holding his arms up, elbows bent, in front of his chest. Kind of this direction here ... a very odd position.\n\nHowever long Cory Lovelace had been dead, to Keller it certainly appeared that medical rigor mortis had set in -- a process he says usually takes close to 12 hours.\n\nShe was in the state of full rigor, said Keller.\n\nFull rigor? Maher asked.\n\nFull rigor, he affirmed.\n\nAlmost like a mannequin? Maher asked.\n\nCorrect.\n\nFully stiff?\n\nFully stiff.\n\nKeller was told that Cory saw the kids off to school, handing one a Valentine's class project. And someone on the scene told Keller Cory Lovelace had died in the morning.\n\nKeller's response to that was, What day?\n\nDid it make any sense to you that they were saying it was that morning? Maher asked.\n\nIt did not, Keller said. It just didn't seem to add up.\n\nOver the years, James Keller has learned one undeniable truth of his trade: the dead do speak.\n\nA body always tells a story the way you find them, he said.\n\nWhat is the story that Cory's body was telling you? Maher asked.\n\nThat she had passed earlier that prior evening or day, Keller replied.\n\nTen to 12 hours earlier, possibly?\n\nCorrect. Yes ma'am, Keller affirmed.\n\nBut that medical assessment of time of death wasn't matching what Curtis and the kids were saying -- that Cory has been alive that morning.\n\nIt was just not what she was telling. It was just not what she was saying, said Keller.\n\nDid you tell anybody about that afterwards and as the inquisition went on? Maher asked.\n\nThere's numerous people ... the coroner Gary Hamilton, he replied. ... everybody had some reservations, maybe concerns.\n\nJames Keller was a deputy coroner at the time, second to sitting coroner Gary Hamilton, who was also at the Lovelace home. An autopsy, including toxicology test, was conducted the day after Cory was found dead, and Hamilton signed off. The cause of death was undetermined.\n\nWell 'undetermined' ... if you don't have a cause ... leaving it 'undetermined' was the right thing to do, said Keller.\n\nDespite the odd position of Cory's arms and despite an unexplained cut on her lip, two days later, at her mother's request, Cory Lovelace was cremated and Quincy police officially closed the investigation.\n\nAnd life went on? Maher asked Gough.\n\nYeah, he said.\n\nNobody cared to look deeper?\n\nNope.\n\nEight years would pass, and then a curious cop followed a hunch.\n\nYou had a detective in the Quincy Police Department, Adam Gibson, Gough explained.\n\nAnd lookin' at the photos ... and with -- with Cory's body bein' in that condition, it just -- it just didn't make sense to me, said Det. Gibson.\n\nA FRESH LOOK AT THE CASE\n\nWithin six months after the mysterious death of his wife, Cory, on Valentine's Day 2006, Curtis Lovelace rekindled his love life and began dating a student in a class he taught at Quincy University. The woman, named Erica, was eight years his junior. They married two years later, but she and his then-14-year-old daughter, Lyndsay, didn't get along. Lyndsay became estranged from her father.\n\nLyndsay, apparently, didn't have a place in that family. Why, I don't know, said Steve Belko.\n\nLyndsay then moved out of her father's house and in with her grandmother Marty Didriksen, Cory's mom.\n\nCurt chose his second wife over his daughter, said Belko.\n\nMarriage number two fell apart in 2013.\n\nBut once again, Curtis Lovelace didn't stay single for long. He got married for a third time months after his divorce in 2013, this time to his current wife, Christine, whom he had known in high school and reconnected with years later.\n\nChristine and Curtis Lovelace Christine Lovelace\n\nHe is a funny, charming, sweet, kind, compassionate, wonderful husband, she told 48 Hours. We're actually best friends.\n\nWhile the end of 2013 marked a new beginning for Curtis and Christine ...\n\nWe'd go on dates not typical of romantic date nights -- eat fried chicken, go across the bridge to Missouri, have hot fudge sundaes with extra cherries, she said.\n\n... it was around that same time that a newly-promoted detective at the Quincy Police Department, Adam Gibson, took a fresh look at Cory's death.\n\nSometimes it takes fresh eyes to see things, said Det. Gibson.\n\nAnd I was at the office ... just reading old case files, and the Lovelace case popped into my head, he said.\n\nThe more Det. Gibson read about the 8-year-old case, the more he was intrigued.\n\nWhat in that file made you say, 'Huh, I'm gonna go find the pictures and the hard copy of this file? Maureen Maher asked the detective.\n\nJust the general description of the position of her hands, he replied.\n\nAnd when you saw the pictures, what was your first reaction?\n\nIt did not appear to me that could've been a natural death, said Det. Gibson.\n\nA drawing by artist Bill Beard of a graphic photo of Cory Lovelace\n\nThe pictures show Cory's body in bed - lifeless, but with her arms bent at the elbows and bizarrely frozen in the air.\n\nThat didn't really make sense, and there was no real explanation for 'em, said Det. Gibson.\n\nGibson consulted King County Coroner James Keller, who was the deputy coroner in 2006.\n\nIt bothered me for years, said Keller.\n\nSo when you found out that Detective Gibson was moving forward, what was your reaction? Maher asked.\n\nI think it -- it is definitely time to open, Keller replied.\n\nDetective Gibson kept investigating the old case secretly, out of the public eye. He consulted the original pathologist, Dr. Jessica Bowman, who had ruled the death undetermined. Bowman told Gibson she would no longer participate in the case, but sent him for another opinion to another pathologist she knew in Chicago, Dr. Shaku Teas.\n\nShe said basically that she saw nothing suspicious about the death, Det. Gibson said of Dr. Tea's ruling.\n\nSo why wasn't that the end of it for you? I mean, you have Dr. Bowman who says undetermined, you have now Dr. Shaku Teas, who is accredited and is telling you, 'look it's undetermined, I don't see a problem with it,' Maher asked the detective.\n\nBecause I didn't believe that the information that Dr. Teas had given was credible to what I already knew, he replied.\n\nSo Det. Gibson sought yet another opinion. Enter Dr. Jane Turner, an assistant medical examiner in St. Louis.\n\nWhat do you remember as the first thing that struck you about that file? Was there anything in there that you looked at and said, 'Well, that's interesting,' Maher asked Dr. Turner.\n\nYes. It was the scene photographs ... the presence of rigor mortis and the position of the hands is unusual ... the hands weren't resting on a surface. They were almost suspended in air, which tells me that there was ... an object that had been there previously that had been removed, she replied.\n\nCould you show me, put ... my arms in the position that you saw Cory Lovelace's body in while she was laying down still in the bed? Maher asked Dr. Turner.\n\nSo she was on her back. And her arms were like this. A little bit lower than that, she replied, positioning Maher's arms, as shown in the photo above.\n\nAnd-- if they were stuck in this position, they're in rigor-- what does that tell you at that point? Maher asked.\n\nWell, that more time has passed than the witness stated, Dr. Turner replied.\n\nThe witness being Curtis Lovelace, who said he had talked to his wife less than an hour before finding her dead.\n\nIn my report, I stated 10 to 12 hours. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. And with her arms in that position, which -- with the -- the emergency responders coming in, they were still in that position, suggests to me that she was in full rigor, said Dr. Turner.\n\nBased on the photos, the autopsy report and police reports, Dr. Turner pinpointed the cause of death: suffocation at the hands of another.\n\nWhat did you determine would have caused the suffocation? Maher asked.\n\nWell, with the position of the hands, it suggests that there was an object between her hands and her body. ...And it appears that there is a pillow missing, Dr. Turner replied. So I suppose that a pillow was used to suffocate her.\n\nWhile Det. Gibson had a new timeline and a cause of death, he also had one big problem. Remember, the three oldest Lovelace children insisted they saw their mother alive that morning, sitting on the stairs.\n\nThe one thing I do know is, the science of Cory Lovelace doesn't match that story, said Gibson.\n\nGibson believes the children may have simply been mistaken. Maybe that's because they weren't interviewed by the original detective, Jeff Baird, until two days after their mother's death. But if Curtis Lovelace did kill his wife the night before, as Dr. Turner believes, what was his motive?\n\nWas there a life insurance policy, Maher ask Gough.\n\n...he said there was no life insurance, he replied.\n\nWas he having an affair?\n\nI have not heard that, said Gough.\n\nSo what's the motive? What does he gain? Maher asked.\n\n...he told one of the witnesses that their last 90 days of their marriage hadn't been good, Gough replied.\n\nPeople fight and argue all the time, Maher noted to Det. Gibson.\n\nThat's true, he said.\n\nHow did it lead to murder in this situation? Maher asked.\n\nThat's the million-dollar question, Det. Gibson replied.\n\nA new detective ... found a doctor to give him the answer he was looking for. There's not one bit of evidence ... that Cory ... was murdered, said Christine Lovelace.\n\nHow certain are you now that Curtis Lovelace murdered his wife, Cory?\n\nI'm 100 percent certain. The science tells me that, said Det. Gibson.\n\nA BATTLE OF EXPERTS\n\nIn August 2014, eight years after the death of Cory Lovelace, Curtis Lovelace was leaving his law office at lunchtime when police confronted him - and arrested him for his wife's murder.\n\nNobody had any idea that this was, this was happening. None of the local media, said KHQA reporter Jenny Dreasler.\n\nThe same day as a grand jury indictment comes down, he's arrested in broad daylight, cuffed and stuffed right outside his law office and taken down to booking, said local journalist Bob Gough.\n\nA good friend who works for a news station in Quincy, he texted me ... said 'Christine, Curt's been arrested for Cory's murder,' Christine Lovelace told 48 Hours. I said,'that makes no sense, Cory was not murdered.'\n\nThere was nothing to prepare us for this, it was probably worst day of my life, she said.\n\nThe former golden boy would spend the next 17 months in jail, held on $5 million bond.\n\nI was a little stunned, friend Steve Belko said. He looked old, haggard. Something I'd never seen before.\n\nCurtis Lovelace pleaded not guilty, awaiting his trial until just over three weeks ago.\n\nA decade after Cory Lovelace's death, the murder trial of her husband was about to begin at the Adams County Courthouse. After hearing all the evidence, it may come down to just one question for the jury: Do they believe Cory's children, who say they saw their mother alive that morning? Or do they believe two medical examiners who insist the science says she was killed the night before?\n\nSome of the jurors who would decide Curtis' fate spoke with 48 Hours.\n\nAnd by show of hands, how many of you knew Curtis Lovelace and his family or knew of them prior to this? Maher asked the group. Four of the six jurors raised their hands. OK, so a majority of who are here.\n\nIs it the trial of century in Quincy? Maher asked Gough. Yes, he replied.\n\nAnd why is that, just because of who he is?\n\nYes. Absolutely, Gough replied. I mean, bigger they come, the harder they fall.\n\nQuincy was consumed with this trial on social media and in the coffee shops.\n\nI don' think the case should've been brought to start with ... all they got is circumstantial evidence, no smoking guns, a resident told 48 Hours.\n\nThe prosecution laid out its dramatic case -- that Curtis Lovelace smothered his wife, Cory, the mother of his four children, with a pillow the night before Valentine's Day.\n\nJurors heard from world-renowned pathologist Dr. Michael Baden and Dr. Jane Turner. They both testified that Cory had to have died the night before.\n\nIt's the whole picture -- she had drying artifact of her lips. She had drying artifact of her eyes. Again, something that develops with the passage of time after death, Dr. Turner told Maher. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. And with her arms in that position ... suggests to me that she was in full rigor.\n\nThe prosecution uses Dr. Turner to explain how a cut found during the autopsy on Cory's lip was caused by her being suffocated.\n\nThere's a bruise on the inside of the lip and -- and with it a laceration. And that's from blunt force trauma. So some forceful pressure was applied to the mouth, she explained.\n\nBut then, in this battle of the experts, the defense counters with their own, Dr. George Nichols. He says Cory most likely died of causes related to an enlarged liver due to drinking and her bulimia.\n\nI think she died as a result of natural diseases related to her liver disease. But the corroborative tests to confirm that were not performed, so I cannot come to that conclusion scientifically, said Dr. Nichols.\n\nMy opinion is, there's no proof that this woman was murdered, he said.\n\nAnd as to Dr. Turner's claim that the degree of rigor mortis shows she had to be dead 10 to 12 hours?\n\nAs I said repeatedly in there, rigor mortis does not occur at a specific, fixed time. There's huge variability from person to person, Dr. Nichols stated.\n\nFurther, he said, Dr. Turner was only working from photos -- she never actually saw Cory's body in person.\n\nAnd as to that single cut on Cory's lip? Nonsense, says Dr. Nichols.\n\nThat's eliminated, because she does not have sufficient injuries to the inner surface of her lips, he told 48 Hours.\n\nBut she did have that one injury, a 48 Hours producer pointed out.\n\nOne. Not multiple. How many teeth do I have? Dr. Nichols said, showing his teeth. OK? Each of those is capable of making at least one, if not more, injuries to the inside of my lips as I'm fighting back against someone who's holding a pillow over me.\n\nIf the testimony of the dueling pathologists had jurors scratching their heads, it was in stark contrast to the testimony of the Lovelace boys, which clearly pulled at their hearts.\n\nThe kids will be in my mind probably forever, said juror Theresa Tarr.\n\nThe prosecution called the youngest son, Larson, who was 4 years old at the time of his mother's death, who recounts his story about poking mommy to wake her up. Juror Theresa Tarr was struck by the image.\n\nIt was an emotional testimony, she said. Thinking that a four-year-old mighta been pokin' his dead mom, it was very emotional.\n\nMy children have dealt with enough pain in their life for them to feel any kind of pain, an emotional Christine Lovelace said.\n\nThen, the defense called the two older sons, Logan, now 18, and dressed in his military uniform, and Lincoln, now 17. A normally stoic Curtis breaks down when each of the two older boys takes the stand, recounting how Curtis came to school that day to tell them their mother had died.\n\nNews report: This is the first day we saw any real emotion out of Curtis Lovelace as he broke down in tears as his two oldest sons took the stand.\n\nBoth boys emphatically tell the court, they are 100 percent certain they saw their mother alive that morning. Logan said he even remembers asking his ailing mom if he could stay home from school to take care of her.\n\nThere are people who have accused the kids of lying, that's not who the kids are, Christine Lovelace said. Kids will share experiences as they know them, not what they're told to.\n\nAnd then came Lyndsay, the final key testimony for the prosecution. She was 12 at the time her mother died, and now she's the star witness at her father's trial.\n\nSo how important is Lyndsay's testimony? Maher asked Gough.\n\nOh, it's critical. It's the whole ballgame, he replied.\n\nUp until this trial, Lyndsay had always insisted she saw her mother alive that morning. But now, at age 22, and under oath in the courtroom, she says can't be sure about what she remembers from that day.\n\nAnd I've had a long time to think about that and it's almost frustrating not to remember, because you want to, she said in an interview with Dreasler.\n\nAnd yet, immediately afterwards, defense attorneys show a videotape made just two years earlier, where Lyndsay tells Det. Adam Gibson she absolutely remembers seeing her mom alive that morning.\n\nIn the end, if you can't, you can't remember, she said. ...and just say, 'I'm sorry. It was 10 years ago I can't remember.'\n\nWere you surprised by Lyndsay's testimony when she got up and said, Now I don't remember. I can't definitively say anything? Maher asked Det. Gibson.\n\nYeah. You never know what anybody is gonna say, he replied.\n\nLyndsay changing her story, the testimony of her brothers, and the dueling medical experts -- it all had the jurors heads spinning.\n\nShe didn't remember, and that, to me, was very hard. Because two years earlier, she had given a statement to Adam Gibson, that she remembered a lot, said jury foreperson Adam Buss.\n\nIn the course of deliberations, I changed my mind, said juror Mike Hayden.\n\nYou answer one question. But it spawns another question, Maher noted.\n\nRight, another juror agreed.\n\nJURORS WEIGH THE CASE\n\nOn Feb. 4 2016, closing arguments begin. Curtis Lovelace, who has prosecuted cases in this very courthouse, walked in for the conclusion of his own murder trial. His new wife, Christine, says the trial has taken a toll -- especially on Curtis' sons.\n\nWe know that everyday the focus is bringing their father and my husband home, she said. It's so cumbersome to be raising a family while we're still doing all that we're doing. We're managing, it's difficult but we're managing.\n\nFor Det. Adam Gibson, who started it all, the stakes couldn't be any higher.\n\nI want people to remember Cory outta all this ... she deserves to have her day just like everybody else, he told Maher. The jury will decide if somebody took that life from her.\n\nAnd you'll live with the decision, whatever it is? Maher asked.\n\nWhatever it is, Det. Gibson replied.\n\nBut that decision may not be so easy.\n\nThe length of time that it takes for rigor mortis to set in, I think I've heard it a half a dozen different ways, so I'm not sure. And if I'm not sure, I'm not sure a jury member is sure, Gough pointed out.\n\nHow many of you thought it boiled down to you either believed the kids, or you believed the science? Maher asked the group of jurors. All six raised their hands.\n\nGoing back on the hands thing, that was the most debated thing in that deliberation room, as far as I'm concerned, juror Adam Buss said. I mean, we had jury members on the floor, you know, just - 'How do we lay? How you know, do we hold the covers?'\n\nJury members got on the floor -- put themselves in this position like this. To try and figure it out, Maher commented.\n\nRight, said Buss.\n\nAnd did that help? Did the show-and-tell of it help you?\n\nIt did. But it--it almost left more questions than answers, he said.\n\nMeanwhile across town, Lyndsay Lovelace -- estranged from her father, stepmother and brothers -- awaited the verdict from the comfort of the home she shares with her grandmother.\n\nYeah, we need a verdict. We need some kind of closure -- some kind, said Steve Belko.\n\nAnd hopefully the boys, the family, the grandparents--that everybody can get back together again someday down in the future, said Beth Dobrzynski.\n\nIf found guilty, Curtis Lovelace could spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\nI haven't gotten a lot of sleep in the last year-and-a-half. Every minute is spent thinking about what we could we be doing ... with the goal of bringing Curtis home and proving his innocence, said Christine Lovelace.\n\nAfter 16 1/2 hours of jury deliberations over two days, Lyndsay received that much anticipated call.\n\nBreaking news here inside the Adams County Courthouse. Judge Hardwick did just now declare a mistrial, Jenny Dreasler reported.Curtis' current wife could be seen sobbing ... the three Lovelace boys all holding hands before that verdict was reached.\n\nIt was unreal and ... I felt so empty and out of breathe and the only thing I could do was hug my kids and let them know it is going to be OK and it is going to be OK, Christine Lovelace said of the jury's decision.\n\nThis is just dragging it out more. But if they're hung, they're hung. And there's nothing we can do about it. We just wait for the next round, Lyndsay said of the outcome.\n\nIt's set for retrial. And we plan to retry it, said Prosecutor Ed Parkinson.\n\nIf there's no new evidence, how do you paint it in a different light and not put yourself in a position of a hung jury again? Maher asked.\n\nMaybe not paint in a different light. Might paint it in the same light and with a different jury, he replied.\n\nBut this jury fought until the end.\n\nDid it ever become contentious? Maher asked the six jurors.\n\nIt did. I think, probably five of the jurors said, 'There is no way anybody is ever gonna change my mind.' And two of those, I think, were for guilty, three for not guilty, juror Mike Hayden said. And that just deflated me so much.\n\nJoyce ... you believe he did it? Maher asked.\n\nI believe he did it, said Stevens.\n\nHe's not guilty. And they didn't prove it to me, said Tarr.\n\nI had a feeling, after that first day, we weren't gonna come to a unanimous decision, said Stevens.\n\nWe're stuck, Maher noted.\n\nIt was pretty -- it was pretty obvious, Stevens affirmed.\n\nSteve, do you think that Curt killed Cory? Maher asked Steve Belko.\n\nI don't know. I don't wanna believe it. Because everything I know about Curt, he could not have done it. And -- I don't even know if it would've been done in a crime of passion, he replied. I think of Cory on that. Because I know Cory is -- is one tough cookie. She'd have fought to the death to defend her children.\n\nI don't hear anyone in this little triad saying, 'No way, no how, he didn't do it,' Maher said to the Lovelace's friends. There's nobody here pounding their fists saying, 'My friend didn't do it.'\n\nI wouldn't go that far. I'm not entirely sure, said Belko.\n\nI wouldn't go that far, either, said Beth Dobrzynski.\n\nIt's definitely put a huge question in my mind. Was there something-- some reason she died other than natural causes, said Bret Schrader.\n\nAs the entire town awaits this new trial, speculation and gossip continue.\n\nThe question everyone has: what does the future hold for Curtis Lovelace?\n\nHow does he get his life back ... in his hometown? said Gough.\n\nBecause in the court of public opinion, you think people will always feel like he did something, said Maher.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And again when this ends ... I just don't see how he's gonna be given the benefit of the doubt, said Gough.\n\nChristine Lovelace says she will never stop fighting to clear her husband's name.\n\nThere's nobody guilty for this crime because there was no crime committed, she said. We will not allow him to sit in that jail cell for one day longer than he has to.\n\n...whatever it takes to make sure my husband is exonerated and the truth is known and that he comes home. That's what matters, she continued.\n\nWith Curtis' fate in limbo, Lyndsay Lovelace and her grandmother, Marty Didriksen, continue to try to move forward while keeping the focus on the cherished life they lost.\n\nYou don't want to lose sight of Cory. She died too young. She left children. There's a family here. I mean, Lindsey and her brothers. So try to put that back together if we can and move forward, she said.\n\nCory Lovelace Steve Belko\n\nI just want everyone to find happiness again. And be able to remember the good times rather than the bad times, said Lyndsay.\n\nShe was an amazing woman ... she loved with the biggest heart. She had a beautiful personality, Lyndsay said of her mother. She touched so many people and that's who she needs to be remembered as.\n\nCurtis Lovelace's new trial date is scheduled for May 31.\n\nHis bail was set at $5 million. He remains in jail.
Season 22 of Arthur kicked off with a special wedding episode that had people across the country talking. However kids in Alabama did not see the May 13 episode, in which Arthur's teacher, Mr. Ratburn marries his partner. That's because it was never aired.\n\nAlabama Public Television (APT) chose not to air the episode, entitled Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone, according to AL.com. Instead, Arthur fans in the state saw a rerun episode.\n\nThe decision was made back in April, when the local PBS station was notified about the content of the episode, Mike Mckenzie, director of programming at APT, told AL.com. CBS News has reached out to Mckenzie and several other people at APT for comment and is awaiting response.\n\nArthur and his friends at first try to stop the wedding – then they realize Mr. Ratburn is not marrying an uptight woman, but a instead, a man. PBS/Arthur\n\nMckenzie told AL.com that APT has no plans to air the episode at a later date. Parents have trusted Alabama Public Television for more than 50 years to provide children's programs that entertain, educate and inspire, Mckenzie said in an email to the station.\n\nMore importantly – although we strongly encourage parents to watch television with their children and talk about what they have learned afterwards – parents trust that their children can watch APT without their supervision, he said. We also know that children who are younger than the 'target' audience for Arthur also watch the program.\n\nIn the premiere episode, Arthur and his friends worry their teacher is going to marry an uptight woman, but when they get to the wedding ceremony, they learn Mr. Ratburn is marrying a man. They're relieved and happy for their teacher.\n\nIt is not the first time APT has pulled an episode of the children's show from air. In a 2005 episode, Arthur's friend, Buster, meets a child who has two mothers. APT did not air that episode either.\n\nAt the time, APT's then-director, Allan Pizzato, told AL.com: Our feeling is that we basically have a trust with parents about our programming. This program doesn't fit into that.\n\nIf parents in Alabama want their kids to see the season 22 premiere episode, Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone is available on PBS' website.
How important is it to know your partner's finances before either dating or marriage? That's a question mortgage broker LendingTree asked in a recent survey of randomly selected men and women. The overall response: somewhat important prior to dating, but it mattered much more before marriage.\n\nLendingTree also asked, Would you run a credit check on a partner, or consider Hiring help -- such as a dating service -- to marry wealth? Most respondents said they would be uncomfortable checking their partner's credit, and an overwhelming percentage wouldn't use a dating service to find someone financially suitable.\n\nBut the flipside of the survey was the smaller pool of respondents who considered it extremely important to know about a partner's finances before dating or tying the knot, as well as those who had or would check their partner's credit or try a dating service geared to finding out about financials.\n\nLendingTree, which offers auto, mortgage, personal and other types of loans, has a vested interest in learning how love affects money. The lender's survey used generic profiles of 10 men and 10 women. First, respondents were asked to rate them without any financial information. Then it tacked on varying amounts of debt -- business, car and student loan debt and credit card obligations to see how they now fared.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nA man's attractiveness went up only when his debt was no more than half his income.\n\nSchool debt didn't hurt attractiveness as much as car or credit card debt, possibly because medical and graduate students are among those with the highest debt.\n\nNot surprisingly, subpar credit wasn't all that important when casual dating, and more than a quarter said finances weren't important at all. But opinions changed significantly when the topic of marriage came up. Almost 90 percent said the information was particularly important.\n\nMore than twice as many women as men felt that it's very important for their partner to be employed.\n\nWomen's attractiveness didn't fall nearly as much as men's if their debt increased. So does this mean that women are more likely to be gold diggers?\n\nPerhaps they're just more practical, because when dating became serious and both parties began discussing home buying and planning for children's college funds, it may become difficult to picture a future with a seemingly irresponsible person, the survey said.\n\nCouples who argued about finances once a week were more than 30 percent likely to divorce, according to a report from Utah State University entitled How it is tough to love when you owe. In other words, the debt load you bring into a relationship is very likely to blow it up, no matter how good looking you are.\n\nThe LendingTree survey also addressed a second series of questions. If it's important to know about a date's or partner's finances, how do you find out? And where would you draw the line without invading someone's privacy? For example, how do you tell their real financial status? He or she could be drowning in payments for that flashy that car picks you up.\n\nWhen LendingTree asked about how far men and women would go to uncover wealth, approximately a quarter of men, and slightly less women, said they would use a dating service to find a partner with good financial standing. But 70 percent of men and nearly three-quarters of all women said they would never do that. These elite dating services advertise in most airline magazines.\n\nSurprisingly though, almost 30 percent of men and about 36 percent of women said they would run a credit check on their partner, and about 5 percent had actually done so. Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are the three major credit reporting services from which you can obtain a credit report.\n\nA credit check isn't always doable without the other person's knowledge, unless you know the person's Social Security number. If you're asking that on dating apps, expect a lot of 'swipe lefts,' said LendingTree Content Manager Mike Ouyang. But he added that you have other ways to play private detective.\n\nDo they spend freely without much thought?\n\n\n\nDo they purchase a lot on credit or borrow for most purchases?\n\n\n\nDo they keep bills and mail organized?\n\n\n\nHave you seen any warning letters?\n\n\n\nIf you start talking about finances, does your partner display either nervousness or excessive bravado? Both could be red flags, warned Ouyang.\n\n\n\nMany people -- particularly millennials -- Google someone they want to date or are already dating, just by entering the person's name with quotes around it, then narrowing the search by address or city. Finding that person on social media could involve a connection request.\n\nThen there's a Google image search. Websites, such as www.peekyou.com, will even try to find someone by his or her online identity.\n\nIf all else fails, try the old-fashioned way. Build trust in the relationship, and be truthful, said Ouyang. But he warns: These things take time.\n\nTheoretically, so does a marriage, which is supposed to last for the rest of your life.
Only on CBS This Morning, Oprah Winfrey revealed the next selection for her book club: Love Warrior by bestselling author Glennon Doyle Melton.\n\nIn the memoir, the recovering alcoholic and bulimic recounts her healing journey after discovering her husband's infidelity.\n\nI'm a person who hid from pain for the first half of my life. I was an addict, and that's what we do. We hide from love and pain because it seems so risky, Melton said Tuesday on CBS This Morning. And so what I'm doing now, what the warrior does, is instead of hiding from pain, she just kind of gets up in the morning and rushes straight towards it.\n\nMelton believes people in the power of vulnerability.\n\nWe can be shiny and perfect and admired, or we can be real and honest and vulnerable and loved. But we actually do have to choose. And I just keep choosing this real and vulnerable and honest place, not because you don't get hurt there – because I do – but because this is the pain that grows us, Melton said. There's pain in both places, and nothing hurts as much as not being known.\n\nShe also said being at the rock bottom is the best place on earth.\n\nIt's just the beginning of everything. Because life just wants to hold us down until we say… 'Help.' And then all of the angels rush to our side, Melton said.\n\nDownload an excerpt of Love Warrior and a reading guide at the bottom of this page.\n\nLove Warrior author Glennon Doyle Melton and Oprah Winfrey Rob Howard/Oprah Magazine\n\nAbout this book\n\nTen years into her marriage, Glennon Doyle Melton learns a devastating truth that leads her to the brink of divorce. But instead of bolting from the pain or drowning in her grief, she chooses to listen to the still, small voice inside her that urges her to find the gift in this crisis. Melton decides to welcome the pain, to see it through and discover what it has to teach her.\n\nShe is not sure she wants to save her marriage, but she is determined to save herself-a self long ago saddled with beliefs about beauty, sexuality, and a woman's role in the world. To move forward, she must sit with the feelings of discomfort-a hot loneliness she has been trying to numb all her life. She must develop a new understanding of intimacy, a new relationship with grace, and a new perspective on forgiveness, family, and what it means to be in love.\n\nOn this journey, Melton reconsiders far more than her marriage and discovers what it means to be true to oneself, to claim her true identity as a Love Warrior.\n\nQuestions\n\nPart One\n\nInitially, Melton assumes her marriage began with her wedding. In what ways do we expect weddings to function as beginnings? When do you think a marriage begins?\n\nBy the time she graduates high school, Melton has come to see that there are hidden rules about how to matter as a girl (p. 30 & p.187). Melton later understands how she's been hurt by the messages our culture sends about what success should look and feel like for a woman. What are those messages? Where do they come from? What hidden rules did you follow, or feel pressured to follow, as a child or a teenager? How about now? How has following those rules affected your life?\n\nWhen Melton runs out of places to go, she drives toward God (p.52). How does her experience with Mary compare to her conversation with the priest? Why do you think she feels safe in the presence of Mary? How could the priest have been more helpful or supportive?\n\nAt Melton's first twelve-step meeting, she is relieved to notice that there are no representatives in this circle, just folks who are ready to quit pretending (p.67). Discuss a time you felt like you had to show up as your representative instead of your true self. How would it have felt to stop pretending?\n\nAfter Melton accepts her pregnancy as an invitation to come back to life and Craig proposes, she decides she will be a new person. Have you ever wanted to put your old self into a box and tuck it away? Do you believe it's possible to be a new person?\n\nFor Part Two, Three and suggestions for ways to enhance your book club, download the reader's guide:\n\nRead an excerpt of Melton's book here:\n\nCheck out last month's Oprah's Book Club, The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead.
Only on CBS This Morning, Dylan Farrow is speaking candidly for the first time on television about her sexual assault allegations against her adoptive father, actor and director Woody Allen. At the age of seven, Farrow told her mother, actress Mia Farrow, that Allen had molested her.\n\nAllen has always denied the allegations.\n\nFarrow has stood by her story for more than two decades. She first went public in 2014 with an open letter in the New York Times. Now, she's sharing her story to CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King who spoke with her at Farrow's Connecticut home.\n\nSome of the details she described are graphic.\n\nDYLAN FARROW: I want to show my face and tell my story. … I want to speak out. Literally.\n\nDylan Farrow shares her story with CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King CBS News\n\nAt 32, Dylan Farrow has been married for almost eight years. She's the mother of a 16-month-old girl. And she's still carrying the emotional scars she says she got at the hands of her father.\n\nFARROW: I loved my father. I respected him. He was my hero. And that doesn't obviously take away from what he did. But it does make the betrayal and the hurt that much more intense.\n\nGAYLE KING: Let's go to August 4, 1992. And if you could tell us what happened that day.\n\nFARROW: I was taken to a small attic crawl space in my mother's country house in Connecticut by my father. He instructed me to lay down on my stomach and play with my brother's toy train that was set up. And he sat behind me in the doorway, and as I played with the toy train, I was sexually assaulted… As a 7-year-old I would say, I would have said he touched my private parts.\n\nKING: Mmhmm. Okay\n\nFARROW: Which I did say.\n\nKING: Alright. Alright.\n\nFARROW: As a 32-year-old, he touched my labia and my vulva with his finger.\n\nKING: Where was your mother?\n\nFARROW: She went shopping that day.\n\nKING: And then after you told her, what happened?\n\nFARROW: She was upset. … My first impulse was that I had done something wrong.\n\nMia Farrow took Dylan to the pediatrician, but when the doctor asked her where she had been touched, the little girl pointed to her shoulder.\n\nFARROW: She said, Why didn't you tell the doctor what you told me? And I told her that I was embarrassed. And then we went back in.\n\nKING: You went back in and then you told him.\n\nFARROW: And I told the doctor.\n\nKING: The same thing that you had told your mother.\n\nFARROW: Yes.\n\n(L to R) Actress Mia Farrow, son Satchel, Woody Allen, daughter Dylan David Mcgough/DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nAllen had suggested that Dylan changed her story because she had been coached by her mother. Months earlier, Mia had found in his apartment nude pictures of her daughter, Soon-Yi, whom she had adopted during an earlier marriage. Allen confessed to an affair with Soon-Yi. The two remain a couple to this day, married for more than 20 years.\n\nKING: You could see why he might make that claim. He would say that she was filled with rage after his affair with Soon-Yi had been discovered, and that she was out for revenge and full of rage.\n\nFARROW: And what I don't understand is how is this crazy story of me being brainwashed and coached more believable than what I'm saying about being sexually assaulted by my father?\n\nKING: Because your mother was very angry, so that she would try to coach you, and try to get you to turn against your father.\n\nFARROW: Except every step of the way, my mother has only encouraged me to tell the truth. She has never coached me.\n\nKING: I wanted to play a clip from 60 Minutes. An interview that he did at the time where he was asked about that incident. Are you okay with looking at it? You're ok?\n\nFARROW: [Nods] Mmhmm.\n\n60 MINUTES INTERVIEW WITH ALLEN: Isn't it illogical that I'm going to at the height of a very bitter acrimonious custody fight, drive up to Connecticut where nobody likes me and I'm in house full of enemies – I mean Mia was so enraged at me and she had gotten all the kids to be angry at me – that I'm going to drive up there and suddenly on visitation, pick this moment in my life to become a child molester. It's just, it's just incredible. I could if I wanted to be a child molester, I had many opportunities in the past. I could have quietly made a custody settlement with Mia in some way and done it in the future. You know, it's so insane.\n\nKING: What do you say to that?\n\nFARROW: [Crying] I'm really sorry.\n\nKING: Don't apologize, don't apologize.\n\nFARROW: I thought I could handle it. I –\n\nKING: Are you crying because of what he said or seeing him? What is upsetting you?\n\nFARROW: He's lying and he's been lying for so long. And it is difficult for me to see him and to hear his voice. I'm sorry.\n\nAllen had adopted Dylan and her 13-year-old brother, Moses, the previous December. The couple also had a younger son, Ronan. But as Mia Farrow's boyfriend, Allen had been a part of Dylan's life since she was a baby. Dylan says that the incident in the attic wasn't the only time his behavior had been inappropriate.\n\nKING: What would he do?\n\nFARROW: He would follow me around. He was always touching me, cuddling me and if I ever said, you know, like I want to go off by myself, he wouldn't let me.\n\nKING: Some could say that's a very doting and loving father.\n\nFARROW: Except he wasn't this way with Ronan.\n\nKING: What else would he do?\n\nFARROW: He often asked me to get into bed with him when he had only his underwear on and sometimes when only I had my underwear on.\n\nWoody Allen was never charged with a crime in this case. Both New York state child welfare investigators and a report by the Yale New Haven hospital found that the abuse did not happen. The Connecticut state prosecutor on the case, Frank Maco, questioned the Yale New Haven report's credibility saying there was probable cause to charge Allen but he thought Dylan was too fragile to face a celebrity trial.\n\n\n\nKING: Do you wish that they would have gone ahead and filed the charges because then you would have had to taken the stand?\n\nFARROW: You know, honestly yes. I do wish that they had, you know, even if I'm just speaking in retrospect. I was already traumatized. … Here's the thing. I mean, outside of a court of law, we do know what happened in the attic on that day. I just told you.\n\nWe reached out to the former Connecticut prosecutor, Frank Maco. He told us that in his experience, There was no manipulation by Mia Farrow. He adds nothing in the state police investigation indicated that Farrow was in any way being controlled or manipulated.\n\nWhen this claim was first made more than 25 years ago, it was thoroughly investigated by both the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital and New York State Child Welfare. They both did so for many months and independently concluded that no molestation had ever taken place. Instead, they found it likely a vulnerable child had been coached to tell the story by her angry mother during a contentious breakup.\n\nDylan's older brother Moses has said that he witnessed their mother doing exactly that – relentlessly coaching Dylan, trying to drum into her that her father was a dangerous sexual predator. It seems to have worked – and, sadly, I'm sure Dylan truly believes what she says.\n\nBut even though the Farrow family is cynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time's Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation, that doesn't make it any more true today than it was in the past. I never molested my daughter – as all investigations concluded a quarter of a century ago.\n\nFarrow is also speaking up to have her voice included in the Time's Up and #MeToo conversations. Over the past two weeks, several celebrities have voiced their support for Dylan, including actress Natalie Portman.\n\nThis week, Timothée Chalamet announced he's donating his entire salary from his work in an upcoming Woody Allen movie to three charities that fight sexual abuse and harassment, including Time's Up. He wrote on Instagram: I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\n\nIn an interview on CBS Sunday Morning, Portman said, I believe Dylan. I would want to say that. I believe you, Dylan.\n\nDylan was visibly moved by seeing the support from Portman.\n\nFARROW: Now I'm going to start crying but, wow.\n\nShe's been searching for that acknowledgement, most of her life.\n\nFARROW: With so much silence being broken by so many brave people against so many high profile people, I felt it was important to add my story to theirs because it's something I've struggled with for a long time and it was….It was very momentous for me to see this conversation finally carried into a public setting.\n\nAs the #MeToo movement continues, Dylan took to social media to call out celebrities who have starred in Woody Allen's films.\n\nKING: Are you angry with the people, with the celebrities that are starring in his movies, that hold him in high regard and continue to compliment him?\n\nFARROW: I'm not angry with them. I hope that, you know, especially since so many of them have been vocal advocates of this Me Too and Time's Up movement that, um, they can acknowledge their complicity and maybe hold themselves accountable to how they have perpetuated this culture of – of silence in their industry.\n\nKING: And how are they complicit?\n\nFARROW: Because I have been saying this – I have been repeating my accusations unaltered for over 20 years and I have been systematically shut down, ignored or discredited. If they can't acknowledge the accusations of one survivor's how are they going to stand for all of us?\n\nKING: People say it's a family matter. It was many years ago. I don't really know the details of this case.\n\nFARROW: So find out. I mean, it's really like I said, it's so easy in this day and age. It's a family matter but here's another thing. I am a real person and I've been struggling, coping on my good days, with the aftershocks of being sexually assaulted as a small child and that's real. And that matters.\n\nKING: How has this affected your life?\n\nFARROW: It's affected every part of my life. You know, growing up, and like I said, I pushed it to the side, I tried to pretend or tried to convince myself that this was something moving forward that I did not need to bring with me even though it came anyway. It's impacted everything.\n\nMarried and a mother to a 16-month-old daughter, Dylan is an advocate for victims of sexual abuse.\n\nFARROW: I have a wonderful husband and I have this amazing little girl now.\n\nKING: So what will you tell her when the time comes? What will you tell her about how to be in this world?\n\nFARROW: That if she was ever in a position that she's not helpless. Because one of the things I remember very clearly as a small child is this feeling of helplessness.
Produced by Chuck Stevenson and Greg Fisher\n\n[This story previously aired on June 7, 2014. It was updated on Sept. 3, 2016.]\n\n(CBS News) SANTA MONICA, Calif -- This was a targeted offense. Without question... a targeted offense, and she was the target, said former Los Angeles County prosecutor Alan Jackson.\n\nShe was Juliana Redding, a beautiful 21-year-old student and model in Los Angeles.\n\nThis is the type of neighborhood that Juliana lived in. The last place in the world that she would ever think she's being stalked or hunted, Jackson, the original prosecutor on the case, told 48 Hours correspondent Maureen Maher.\n\nThe front bungalow right here, this was Juliana's bungalow. The bedroom where her body was ultimately found is the back bedroom, Jackson explained as they stood outside Redding's home.\n\nJuliana's L.A. story started out like a lot of other young women. She came here in 2005 from Arizona with stars in her eyes and high hopes of making it big. Occasionally she was getting work as an actress and model, but mostly, she was taking classes at a local college and trying to make ends meet as a hostess.\n\nGenevieve Stewart met Juliana at Santa Monica College, where they were both full-time students. They were both ambitious.\n\nShe was getting jobs ... to model products or being in music videos and stuff, Stewart said. ... on average, probably $3,000 and up per job.\n\nJuliana also had a taste for the good life.\n\nShe lived a pretty fancy lifestyle, Stewart said. She was a jet setter, she liked to travel, she liked to do fun things.\n\nJack Leonard writes about crime for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nI usually write about the underbelly of society, he told Maher. I don't usually get to write about whodunits. This was a whodunit!\n\nWhen you opened the [front] door, the first thing you see is a coffee table with a big decorative candle and the candle's lit. When the police got here and the firefighters got here, when they opened the front door the first thing that happened is they were hit by a wall of this natural gas odor, Jackson said. They realized this was a bomb waiting to go off. It probably would have leveled this entire building.\n\nAnd there'd be no evidence, Maher noted.\n\nThere would be zero, said Jackson.\n\nBut police got lucky. It was an old house and the gas didn't concentrate enough to explode.\n\n...and the bars that I see now, were they here at the time of the crime? Maher asked of the bars on the windows.\n\nThey were, they were, said Jackson.\n\nSo whoever was in, got in through the door, said Maher.\n\nAbsolutely, Jackson said. This was not a break-in. There was no sign of a struggle to get in or out.\n\nIt was a cool Saturday evening, March 15, 2008. Police believe the killer entered Juliana's bungalow just before 10 p.m.\n\nThings just got out of hand, it got violent, the fight was on, one thing led to another ... they're fighting throughout the house, fingernails are being broken, Juliana's head is being smashed against the floor. She had deep contusions of the skull, her throat was being crushed, Jackson said. This was an absolute fight. This was a brutal, brutal fight.\n\nA fight to the death, Maher commented.\n\nA fight to the death, said Jackson.\n\nThere's plenty of DNA at this crime scene?\n\nYes, Jackson replied.\n\nI can tell you in 18 years of prosecuting cases, I've never had this much DNA, Jackson continued. The DNA was on the door lock, DNA on a plate in the sink, DNA on that stove knob which you'd expect because someone turned it on, DNA on the front and back of Juliana's T-shirt and possibly, most importantly, DNA on her throat.\n\nThe first DNA identified belonged to Juliana. It was embedded under her own fingernails.\n\nWhen you're being strangled, you tend to grapple at your own neck, said Jackson.\n\nTrying to get that person's fingers off of your throat? Maher asked.\n\nTrying to get that person's fingers off your throat, he replied with his hands on his neck. That's the natural reaction and that's an extremely common injury that we see ... you immediately grab for your own throat, and Juliana did that in this case.\n\n-- and indicative of just how hard she fought to try to live, Maher pointed out.\n\nAbsolutely, said Jackson.\n\nAnd there was plenty of other DNA.\n\nThere's DNA... there's DNA belonging to a mysterious person that is all over the crime scene, said Leonard.\n\nPolice sent those DNA samples to the lab. Meanwhile, they built a timeline.\n\nA neighbor had reported hearing screams and furniture moved around 9:53 p.m. Another telling clue was found in Juliana's cell phone.\n\nWhen Juliana's phone was recovered, the evidence very clearly shows that 911 was dialed and the call was terminated before it could go through, said Jackson.\n\nDetectives were quick to talk to the people closest to Juliana, starting with her father, Greg Redding. 48 Hours obtained the police videotapes:\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: As a dad, my message always to her was ... be vigilant, keep your eyes peeled, you know?\n\nRedding, a pharmacist from Arizona, almost immediately had a suspect in mind.\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: You've talked to John Gilmore? ... and she's been on and off with him for a year or two ... I think it was John...\n\nJohn Gilmore is a surfer who had been dating Juliana. He went by her house the morning after the crime -- before her body was discovered.\n\nHe, too, was interviewed by police:\n\nJohn Gilmore | Police interview: I looked through the security door... but you could totally see the candle lit on the table.\n\nGreg Redding told police that his daughter's sometime boyfriend had a history of violent behavior:\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: He went into some kind of drunken fit of rage and kicked in the door of her car.\n\nAnd that's not all. Redding even told police that Gilmore tried to break into Juliana's apartment.\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: I told Juliana -- I said you get outta there ... this guy's dangerous.\n\nBut Juliana didn't listen to her father. She stuck with Gilmore on and off for nearly two years. They argued often, including the day before the murder.\n\nDetective: You said you got into an argument?\n\nJohn Gilmore | Police interview: I called her ... And I was like ... I'm gonna have beers with the boys and she is like OK fine and then hung up on me.\n\nThat might not seem like much, but Gilmore admitted to police that he did have the occasional outburst, though he claimed it never became physical.\n\nJohn Gilmore | Police interview: Yeah. We would yell. That time I kicked the door... I was pissed. I kicked it a couple times.\n\nWhatever the state of their relationship was, Gilmore's story was that night he and Juliana had each gone their own way: Juliana was out with a girlfriend and Gilbert was out with his surfing buddies at a house party several miles away.\n\nBut the two were still exchanging text messages until about 10 p.m., when Juliana abruptly stopped communicating.\n\nBy the next afternoon, Gilmore says he became increasingly concerned because he still had not heard from Juliana.\n\nJohn Gilmore | Police interview: I called Juliana numerous times.\n\nJuliana's mother was also concerned and called police.\n\nJohn Gilmore | Police interview: The police just opened the doors, and then they told me she was in there [holds his head in his hands].\n\nIt would take the lab three months to fully process all the evidence found at the crime scene, but it was worth the wait because the results would take the case in a new direction.\n\nThey discovered that all that DNA found on Juliana's throat, on her clothes, on the stove, on the door knob and even on that plate -- it all belonged to a woman.\n\nA REAL WHODUNIT\n\nSo I'm just speculating here, but you have this beautiful young girl in her apartment, she's been horribly brutalized. She's been strangled. She's been beaten, Maureen Maher noted to former prosecutor Alan Jackson. I mean, investigators must have been saying, 'Who the heck could have done this?' This is really a whodunit.\n\nJuliana Redding\n\nThat's exactly what they were saying, said Jackson.\n\nSo then, all of a sudden, a wealth of DNA is found and it comes back as female, said Maher.\n\nThe head scratching went on for some time, said Jackson.\n\nAuthorities began gathering DNA samples.\n\nThose individuals included just about every female that you could imagine in or around Juliana's life, and every one of them were testing negative, negative, negative, Jackson said. Forty-one females.\n\nInvestigators were left with very few options. So they began to dig deep into Juliana's relationships. Perhaps the most interesting one was with an older man, a flashy surgeon named Dr. Munir Uwaydah.\n\nDr. Uwaydah, described by Jackson as a Lebanese -American in his early 40s, was an international man of mystery -- a rich Los Angeles-based surgeon with expensive real estate all over the world.\n\nAttorney Birgit Jarsen knew Dr. Uwaydah when she argued a case against him in court in 2008.\n\nThere's a horse farm in Germany, there is a house by the beach ... at least one other house in Beverly hills and just the whole status as a renowned surgeon in the community. It's very impressive, said Jarsen.\n\nUwaydah got his medical degree in Beirut, Lebanon, then completed his training in New York City and at Stanford. He became a surgeon and a successful medical entrepreneur with several clinics.\n\n... it appears that he can be a very successful businessman, that he can be a very charming and attentive companion... but then there's also allegations that he has a much darker side, said Jarsen.\n\nThat darker side involved allegations of fraud.\n\nCourt records show Dr. Uwaydah's multimillion-dollar medical businesses have been under investigation.\n\nFor example, there's one case in which he conned a company out of a million-dollar CT scanner. He never paid for it.\n\nHe'd ordered a medical device that he didn't pay for. The appellate court found that he'd committed fraud and they ordered him to pay almost a million dollars in a judgment, said Jackson.\n\nRegardless of the questions surrounding his professional life, Dr. Uwaydah had a well known flamboyant personal life, along with his houses, horses and cars. He also apparently liked to collect women -- beautiful women, like Juliana Redding. They met in 2007.\n\nShe was young, she was beautiful, and she was working in a restaurant., Jackson told Maher of how they met. Dr. Uwaydah saw her before she saw him.\n\nIt was in Santa Monica, where Juliana was a hostess. Within days, Dr. Uwaydah offered her a job.\n\nWhat was she doing for him, Maher asked.\n\n...an assistant of some sort. She didn't have any formal medical training, Jackson said. ... he ran a clinic, a series of medical businesses... I think he paid her a very decent salary.\n\nApparently, a nice paycheck was only one of the many perks.\n\nWe went to her car to get something and its like a white Range Rover and I'm thinking, like, 'Damn!' Stewart recalled with a laugh.\n\nMoney, a car, and soon the relationship really began to heat up.\n\nKelly Duncan, once a contestant on The Bachelor, was a close friend of Juliana's. She was also interviewed by police.\n\nKelly Duncan | Police interview: She ended up living in his house for a while... like it turned into something...\n\nShe's like Oh, my God. I really like him... They were like dating. She told her parents that it was no longer like, Munir the boss. It was, like, Munir, the guy I'm dating.\n\nJuliana moved into a lavish Beverly Hills home apparently owned by Dr. Uwaydah.\n\nCertainly he made it easy on her, said Jackson.\n\nEasy perhaps, but the relationship, according to Kelly Duncan, became uncomfortable .\n\nKelly Duncan | Police interview: ... the guy's obsessed with her ... he's obsessed with her ... she was giving him the time of day, and he loved it. ... he loved having her around, she was like arm candy, he was obsessed. I could see it in his eyes trying to, like, buy her.\n\nAnd according to friends, he even suggested marriage and offered even more elaborate gifts.\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: On her 21st birthday he was going to buy her a Lamborghini.\n\nBut Juliana was becoming uneasy with the relationship. She wanted to cool things off a bit. She turned down the Lamborghini, and, in September, she moved out of the Beverly Hills home and into the bungalow, paid for by her father, in Santa Monica.\n\nIn spite of that, Juliana stayed in touch with Dr. Uwaydah, even planning a birthday trip with her girlfriends and the doctor to Las Vegas.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Uwaydah turned his attention to Greg Redding, Juliana's dad.\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: He told me, Greg, I can offer your daughter the world.\n\nHe even offered Redding a job -- a pretty good one -- over $400,000 a year working as a pharmacist in one of Dr. Uwayadah's businesses.\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: I think he wanted my daughter.\n\nThe whole thing, you know, I'm not stupid. I thought, is this guy for real? I don't buy this. I just don't believe anything ...\n\nGreg Redding already suspected that the doctor had some murky business dealings, but he wanted to find out more about a man who seemed to be offering the world to both him and his daughter.\n\nSo Redding started digging into Uwaydah's background. The story picks up in Las Vegas.\n\nThey took a chartered plane to Las Vegas along with several others, including some of Juliana's girlfriends, said Jackson.\n\nThe plan was to celebrate Juliana's 21st birthday, but it didn't quite work out that way.\n\nKelly Duncan | Police interview: Her dad called her and said, Munir is married in another country.\n\nUwaydah was married to a woman in Lebanon and they had three children. All of that was news to Juliana.\n\n...the evidence suggests she was very, very angry. And unforgiving that she had been lied to, said Jackson.\n\nThat night in Las Vegas, she confronted Uwaydah.\n\nThey got into a fight, Jackson told Maher. Juliana said, 'that's it.'\n\nFive months later, Juliana was dead.\n\nTHE SUSPECT\n\nIn a hotel room in Las Vegas, the news that Dr. Uwaydah was a married man ruined Juliana's big birthday party. Juliana finally broke up with him.\n\nJuliana and her girlfriends then got a separate hotel room ... and the next morning, they flew back.. That ended up being the end of the relationship, said Alan Jackson.\n\nThat was in October 2007. Juliana may have been done with Dr. Uwaydah, but he was far from over her.\n\nKelly Duncan | Police interview: ... she told me that she was scared to death of Munir in the end...scared to death...he was stalking her.\n\nKelly Duncan says Juliana told her that what started with persistent text messages from Uwaydah soon moved to him driving by her house and showing up at places she frequented around town.\n\nUwaydah also continued to pursue Juliana's father, Greg Redding.\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: ... he actually flew me out for [a] Christmas present to Vegas to watch the Mayweather fight. Him and I went ... those tickets were like $1,500 bucks a piece.\n\nAnd surprisingly, despite reservations about his daughter carrying on personally with the doctor, Greg Redding continued to negotiate his own professional relationship with Uwaydah. Perhaps it was the lure of that six-figure salary or all the trappings that went with it:\n\nGreg Redding | Police interview: I was gonna stay at his Beverly Hills house. He made me all these promises. You can stay at my home... I'll help you get a down payment and buy you a house... I'm gonna buy you a car. You pick out any car you want.. You want a Lamborghini or whatever...I'll get it for you.\n\nBut in March of 2008, the deal fell apart and less than a week later, Juliana was found murdered.\n\nCould the broken business deal between Dr. Uwaydah and Juliana's father be the motive for this murder? Or could it be Uwaydah's bruised ego after Juliana's rejection?\n\nInvestigators threw out the bruised ego theory and went with the broken deal.\n\nThe prosecution's motive was that Dr Uwaydah was in business negotiations with Juliana Redding's father, reporter Jack Leonard explained. ... that motive involved Juliana's father breaking off business negotiation with him just days before Juliana's murder.\n\nBut that would be argued at court. The other side claimed there was no motive, because it was Dr. Uwaydah who broke off the business deal.\n\nWhatever happened, investigators were now clearly focused on Dr. Uwaydah even though the mysterious DNA at the crime scene was female and Uwaydah was out of the country at the time of the murder.\n\nStill, the Uwaydah connection gave police some new possibilities.\n\nThey struck out on these ... women that they were checking DNA, Leonard explained. It was only when they were looking at female associates of his that they finally happen on Kelly Soo Park.\n\nKelly Soo Park, 47, was a licensed real estate broker, born and educated in Southern California. She was an employee of Dr. Uwaydah's and was said to work closely with him on many of his business deals.\n\nPolice followed Park and picked up one of her cigarette butts.\n\nIt was stunning... there were jaws that dropped, said Jackson.\n\nThe DNA from Park's cigarette matched the DNA at the crime scene.\n\nBased on the evidence that was presented at trial, that DNA all matched Kelly Soo Park, said Jackson.\n\nDo you believe that Juliana had ever even seen Kelly Soo Park before that night? Maher asked.\n\nNo. The prosecution theory ... was very, very clear. These two women absolutely, positively did not know one another. There was no connection between them except Dr.Munir Uwaydah. He dated one of them and employed her and he employed the other, Jackson replied.\n\nStill, there was the question why? Why would Park attack a woman she didn't even know?\n\nInvestigators take a closer look at Kelly Soo Park. What do they find? Maher asked Jackson.\n\nThey find that she is deeply entrenched ... Kelly Soo Park may have been hired by Munir Uwaydah in a ... capacity that of a enforcer, that of an intimidator, that of muscle, which sounds odd.\n\nWhen I saw Kelly Soo Park for the first time, she presented herself like a thug, said Cindy Ogden, a real estate agent who had several deals and several business disputes with Dr. Uwaydah.\n\nOgden told investigators she encountered the nearly 6-foot-tall Kelly Soo Park.\n\n... like she was an enforcer... a Yakuza or something. That's what I felt. It was like she was gonna come in and kick some ass, she continued.\n\nOgden was brokering a multimillion-dollar commercial real estate deal with Dr. Uwaydah when, she says, Uwaydah used Kelly Soo Park and several other women as intimidators. She says she felt they were pressuring her to come to their terms. She never did.\n\nHe's sending out these vixens to do his bidding, Ogden said. We were looking at this as a movie, like a 'Charlie's Angels' type of thing where he's directing these women, but the dark side, you know, the dark side of 'Charlie's Angels,' Ogden explained.\n\nOgden told her story to police, but prosecutors thought they had stronger examples of Park working as muscle and presented two others in court documents, including one with a banker named Jerry Lukiewski.\n\nSo is it true there's a wire? And the police hear Uwaydah telling Kelly to go over and straighten that 'blank' Jerry out? Maher asked Jackson.\n\nYes. Except he didn't say 'blank,' said Jackson.\n\nThat is exactly what investigators say happened in Juliana's murder.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Kelly Soo Park was sent to Juliana's house by Dr. Uwaydah to scare her and her father back into that broken business deal.\n\nWhat the prosecution wanted to argue at the trial was that Kelly Soo Park was muscle for Dr. Uwaydah, said Leonard.\n\nArmed with the back story of Kelly Soo Park as Dr. Uwaydah's muscle and that powerful DNA, on March 17, 2010, Park was arrested for the murder of Juliana Redding. She pleaded not guilty and was given a $ 3.5 million bail.\n\nSomeone paid her bail, but prosecutors were unable to prove what they believed: that Dr. Uwaydah supplied the money. There is no doubt though that he transferred other money to Park.\n\nBeginning in June of 2008, for about the next 18 months, Kelly Soo Park was given over a million dollars by Munir Uwaydah, Jackson said. A million, over a million, and that is inconsistent, according to the prosecution, with her ongoing normal employment. What was she, a real estate broker? Did she do some work on the side for him?\n\nThat would be a hell of a salary for any particular job, Maher commented.\n\nYeah, unless, of course, as the prosecution suggested, it wasn't a salary, it was a pay off , said Jackson.\n\nBut Kelly Soo Park will face her trial alone. Two days after she was arrested, Dr. Munir Uwaydah vanished. He was believed to be over 7,000 miles away in Beirut.\n\nTHE TRIAL OF KELLY SOO PARK\n\nNearly three years would pass before Kelly Soo Park faced trial. Alan Jackson, the original prosecutor, moved on to private practice. He was replaced by Stacy Weise.\n\nBefore trial, there were two critical decisions from the court: one hurt the prosecution, the other hurt the defense.\n\nThe defense disputed all the allegations about Park operating as an enforcer for Dr. Uwaydah.\n\nJudge said, 'you can't bring this in ... you haven't shown that she's actually acting violently, that she's doing any of the kinds of things you're alleging she did with Juliana Redding, said Leonard.\n\nThe jury never hears this? Maher asked.\n\nNo, Leonard replied. That means that the prosecution can't argue one of the main theories that they have ... which is that Kelly Soo Park was a muscle -- was an enforcer for Doctor Uwaydah.\n\nIt is a significant setback, but the defense is also dealt a blow when the judge disallows one of its strongest arguments.\n\nRemember Juliana's sometime boyfriend, surfer John Gilmore?\n\n... the defense wanted to argue that Juliana's boyfriend may have been the killer, said Leonard.\n\nBut according to prosecutors, Gilmore had a solid alibi.\n\nJohn Gilmore was almost immediately cleared of wrongdoing, Jackson explained. There was video of him at a convenience store, there was video of him at a Jack In the Box, there was video of him at another location ... there was a party at which several individuals all identified him the evening of March 15 between 9:45 and 10:15 or so. The investigators were very comfortable. They knew exactly where John Gilmore was and he was not at Juliana's apartment.\n\nAsked if Gilmore had a history of violence, Leonard told Maher, Basically it's very difficult for the defense to argue that someone else did it. They have to show that there was more than just a motive, more than just an opportunity.\n\nBut on TV, Jack, they do it all the time, Maher noted.\n\nThey do, Leonard laughed.\n\nThey always say, 'the boyfriend did it,' said Maher.\n\nThat's right, Leonard replied, but it's pretty unusual.\n\nIn May 2013, five years after Juliana's murder, the trial finally begins. The prosecution opened with what many believed was an unimpeachable DNA case.\n\nThe killer, the defendant, got her DNA on Juliana's tank top during the struggle and during the murder, prosecutor Stacy Okun-Wiese addressed court.\n\nKelly Soo Park's DNA is on the front door in the locks. Kelly Soo Park's DNA is on Juliana's telephone, Jackson explained. Kelly Soo Park's' DNA is on the front and the back of Juliana's tee shirt. We know that Juliana died of strangulation and Kelly Soo Park's DNA is on her throat.\n\nThat sounds like a slam dunk, Maher noted to Leonard.\n\nThat's how the prosecution portrayed it, he replied.\n\nAnd there was even more: a single, but telling drop of blood.\n\n...guess where the blood was found? In a fingerprint on a plate in the sink and the fingerprint was Kelly Soo Park's left thumb, said Jackson.\n\nAfter the prosecution rested, the defense never even challenged the so called slam dunk DNA.\n\nI think that's a very telling point that the defense didn't bother trying to say well 'it's not Miss Park's DNA,' said Dr. Nathan Lents, a professor of forensic biology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n48 Hours asked Dr. Lents to help us understand the DNA evidence.\n\nThe statistics are so good, that generally, when you find someone's DNA at a crime scene ... they're not gonna dispute that it's their DNA ... they'll try to dispute how it got there.\n\nThat's exactly what happened in this case.\n\nDefense attorney George Beuhler waited until closing arguments to launch his attack.\n\n...when I touch an object, if I leave my DNA, then someone else can come along and touch that object and pick up my DNA and they may go to touch another object, leave my DNA and I never touched that object, Beuhler told the court.\n\nThe defense had a really bold argument here, Leonard said. They argued that the DNA had been transferred from somewhere else ... into that murder scene. \n\nThat much DNA? Maher asked.\n\nThat much DNA, Leonard replied.\n\nHad you ever heard that argument before?\n\nI had never heard it before, said Leonard.\n\nIn his closing argument, Beuhler proposed an entirely new theory of the crime, complete with a mysterious killer.\n\nYou have a killer who's got a rag, he's going around. He's wiping the places to get rid of his fingerprints, his DNA, and he's got Mrs. Park's DNA, unbeknownst to him, but to his great benefit on that rag.\n\nThe real killer could have cleaned up the crime scene, expunged it of all DNA, then inadvertently planted Kelly Soo Park's DNA by using a towel that Kelly may have used once five months earlier at Dr. Uwaydah's Beverly Hills house -- a place Park had visited and Juliana had once lived.\n\n... so maybe she just packed some things quickly and moved and she actually brought with her to her apartment a plate that Mrs. Park had touched and left a fingerprint on and a drop of blood on and maybe a towel, Beuhler continued.\n\nI would say it's exceedingly unlikely that you could accomplish that, said Dr. Lents.\n\nDr. Lents says that would be an extremely complicated process and gave 48 Hours a demonstration.\n\nWell, primary transfer of DNA is if you have any object that you touch, you're going to likely leave behind some of your DNA, Dr. Lents explained, holding a beaker.\n\nSo what if I touch the beaker -- I pick it up, I put it down and you pick it up, said Maher.\n\nSo first of all, I'm gonna deposit my DNA now, mixed in with yours on the glass. That would be called a secondary transfer. So if someone were to swab my hand later, they might get some of your DNA on my hand, with the cup being the intermediate, Dr. Lents explained.\n\nAsked if that's common, Dr. Lents told Maher, We don't see a lot of secondary DNA transfers in case work.\n\nIn your expert opinion then, it's possible that the killer picked up a towel that had been used by the suspect ... if there are two different people as the defense claims, and tried to clean the area up using the same towel that had the suspects DNA on it? Maher asked Dr. Lents.\n\nThat you could deposit DNA from a towel onto a surface while also removing DNA from that same surface in the other direction without any mixture in both places, I would say that's exceedingly unlikely, he replied. If it happened once, I would be very, very surprised. If it happened throughout the crime scene, I think we can safely say that hypothesis doesn't hold any weight.\n\nBeuhler didn't have to prove his theory - he only had to raise reasonable doubt.\n\nDon't be fooled by the DNA evidence, he told jurors.\n\nHe also told the jury Park didn't even know Juliana -- had no history of violence or motive and neither did Dr. Uwaydah:\n\nThere's nothing here to show that even Dr. Uwaydah has a motive to do this... let alone that Kelly Park would have done it for him, Beuhler said in court.\n\nAnd he argued, Park was not strong enough:\n\nMs. Park may have 3 inches and 40 pounds on Ms. Redding. I submit to you that that's not enough to account for the brutality, said Beuhler.\n\nAnd about that million dollars Kelly Soo Park received from Dr. Uwaydah:\n\n... what have they shown you about Kelly Soo Park that she's a successful businesswoman, said Beuhler.\n\nFor more than a week, Juliana's family and friends came to court reliving every horrible detail of her death. Now, they would wait another seven long days for the jury to render its verdict.\n\nFinally, the jury spoke: not guilty.\n\nBut Juliana's loved ones would get the last word, with outbursts in the courtroom:\n\nFemale voice: Murderer. Female voice: Go to hell. Whore. Female voice: Something wrong here. God bless us all.\n\nTHE CONSULTANT\n\n...the jury acquitting Kelly Soo Park ... they just took that knife and twisted it a little bit deeper, said Genevieve Stewart said of the verdict. I believe that Kelly Soo Park got away with murder.\n\nWould you have ever, in your wildest dreams imagined that it would have been an acquittal? Maher asked Jackson.\n\nNo. That was not something that I was predicting. I can say that, he replied.\n\nHere was a case the prosecution thought was a slam dunk: all of Kelly Soo Park's DNA at the crime scene, and yet a verdict of not guilty.\n\nPhotos: Juliana Redding\n\nFor one woman who played a key role for the defense, a not guilty verdict meant justice.\n\nA case like this where there's so much evidence, that people would say, you know, 'You are working to exonerate a guilty person, Maher commented to jury consultant Lee Meihls.\n\nBut why should I believe she's a guilty person? Meihls replied. ... the prosecution did not meet their burden of proof..\n\nMeihls is president of a company called Trial Partners. Park's defense team hired her to help pick the jury.\n\nAsked what outcome she was expecting, Meihls told Maher, A hung jury.\n\nDid you think that was the best you could get? Maher asked.\n\nYes, I did, I did. We left people on the jury that I never thought in a million years would acquit, said Meihls.\n\nMeihls was worried because DNA evidence can be very powerful.\n\nOur biggest challenge was for most people, DNA is DNA and it tells the truth, she explained. Everybody gets that from TV. So we had to have another story about DNA.\n\nWhat turned out to matter in this case was the alternate theory put forth by the defense: their story about DNA transfer.\n\nI felt ... our side of the story, made more sense -- in terms of, you know, it's possible. They're both in the same place, maybe even on the same day, not necessarily at the same time, you know? And their -\n\nReally? You thought it was possible that all that DNA could be casually transferred, door knobs and stove knobs and the neck and the clothes and the telephone? Maher asked.\n\nIt's possible... said Meihls.\n\nPossible... and what the defense needed was a jury open to its story.\n\nWe're only allowed 20 minutes to ... question the prospective jurors, Meihls explained, so I felt that I had to rely on as much of the art of what I do as the science.\n\nGive me some specifics of who you were looking for to be on this jury. What you needed, said Maher.\n\nI'm looking for, sometimes, a contrarian, Meihls said, someone who doesn't matter what you say, they're gonna start challenging you.\n\nAnd to find that kind of person, Meihls turned to popular TV crime shows. She asked jurors which shows they liked the best.\n\nProbably our most favorite juror, who ended up being the foreperson -- one of his favorite shows was 'The Good Wife'. I thought that was perfect, said Meihls.\n\nhttps://secure-fly.cbsnews.com/videos/jury-consultant-what-your-favorite-tv-shows-say-about-you\n\nhttps://secure-fly.cbsnews.com/videos/jury-consultant-what-your-favorite-tv-shows-say-about-you\n\nhttps://secure-fly.cbsnews.com/videos/jury-consultant-what-your-favorite-tv-shows-say-about-you\n\nhttps://secure-fly.cbsnews.com/videos/jury-consultant-what-your-favorite-tv-shows-say-about-you\n\nWhat is it about that show that made it appealing it for you? Maher asked.\n\nThey're openly confronting the fact that they're often working for clients that they think look guilty, and yet they give them the very best defense possible, Meihls replied.\n\nBut there were other shows that signaled to the consultant that those potential jurors might favor the prosecution.\n\n'Criminal Minds' and 'Blue Bloods', if those were a juror's favorite show ... they might be more prosecution-oriented, Meihls explained.\n\nDo you believe in this verdict? Maher asked.\n\nYes, Meihls replied. I think this was a model jury. They did their job. I know it was not a popular verdict. Neither are verdicts in a lot of cases that I've worked on. But they did their job.\n\nThe verdict really showed that DNA alone is not enough to convict someone. At least for this jury, Leonard said. That was going to be a surprise to a lot of people.\n\n...people don't have to agree with the verdict. People can be shocked. People can be troubled. I'm troubled. But that's my personal opinion. I'm troubled, said Jackson.\n\nAnd there's something else about the case that bothered people.\n\nYou've got this character who's being portrayed in court ... but we never get to see him in person. We never get to hear from him, Leonard said. He's looming over the case.\n\nDr. Munir Uwaydah has never been charged with any crime in connection with Juliana's murder.\n\nAfter the verdict, Juliana's parents issued a statement. It read in part:\n\nOur family is deeply saddened and shocked... we believe the evidence against the defendant is enormous and that justice has not been served.\n\nCASE UPDATE\n\nTwo years and two months after her murder acquittal, Kelly Soo Park was arrested and she found herself back in court. This time, as Dr. Uwaydah's office manager.\n\nPark and a dozen other associates pleaded not guilty to conspiracy, lying to patients, disfiguring some in botched surgeries, and cheating insurance companies out of $150 million. Dr. Uwaydah was not present; his whereabouts are unknown.\n\nUwaydah and his staff allegedly tricked 21 people into thinking he would perform their operations. Instead, they were done by a physician's assistant -- which is against the law.\n\nRichard Winton has been following the story for the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThis isn't your typical med fraud case, he said. They're … claiming, 'hey -- you put people in danger.'\n\nWhat sets this part is essentially the enormous amount of cash involved, Winton explained. But in the end, it does come down to one real big X factor, which is Kelly Soo Park.\n\nAttorney George Buehler, who stood by Park's side at her murder trial, was with her again when she was arraigned for fraud.\n\nI don't think that she is guilty in this case, Buehler said. The D.A.'s office may have an interest in making her suffer because she was acquitted … So there may be some desire for payback.\n\nPark's bail was originally set at $10 million. It was later reduced when the court dismissed the charges relating to disfiguring patients. In April 2016, Kelly Soo Park was released on bail of more than $1.5 million.\n\nNo date has been set for the fraud trial.\n\nDr. Munir Uwaydah's California medical license has been cancelled.
Michelle Troconis has been dubbed the other woman in a headline-making story about a Connecticut mother of five, Jennifer Dulos, who vanished and is believed to have been killed by her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos. He was charged with murder but died by suicide weeks after his arrest — leaving Troconis the focus of the investigation, as she faces multiple charges in connection with Jennifer Dulos' presumed murder.\n\nThis has shattered our life because my sister is not the person that they're saying, says Michelle Troconis' sister Claudia Troconis. And she never would be capable of anything they've said that she has done.\n\nMichelle Troconis, Fotis Dulos' girlfriend, was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, evidence tampering and hindering prosecution – all charges she denies. And in some exclusive excerpts from interrogation videos, she insists she has no information about Jennifer Dulos' disappearance.\n\nMichelle Troconis tells detectives she has no idea what happened to Jennifer Dulos, the estranged wife of ex- boyfriend Fotis Dulos, in newly obtained interrogation excerpts. Her family, speaking out for the first time, claims Fotis Dulos deceived her. Jon Schoenhorn\n\nI have no idea what happened to Jennifer. I have no idea where Jennifer is, Troconis tells police.\n\nWhen Detective John Kimball tells her they believe she has information she's not sharing, Troconis responds: I don't have, John, but I can walk the whole world with you if you want … I can do whatever you want but I didn't do it.\n\nJennifer Dulos disappeared on May 24, 2019 after dropping her five children off at school. Police found her abandoned SUV near a park 3-and-a-half miles away from her Connecticut home. At the time, she was in the middle of an ugly divorce and custody battle with her husband, Fotis Dulos. Investigators believe Dulos attacked Jennifer that morning, killing her, and then disposed of her body. Jennifer's body has never been found. Fotis Dulos died in January 2020 after attempting to take his own life.\n\nMichelle Troconis is currently out on bond. She has pleaded not guilty and her family is adamant she is innocent. They say Troconis is not the person portrayed in stories about the case.\n\nDid your sister have anything to do with the death of Jennifer Dulos? Moriarty asks Claudia Troconis.\n\nNo, she did not, Claudia Troconis responds.\n\nDo you believe that Michelle knows where Jennifer's body is? Moriarty asks Danielle Troconis.\n\nMy sister is innocent, Daniela Troconis responds. Absolutely not.\n\nA MOM GOES MISSING\n\nJennifer Dulos was a gifted woman, says her close friend Carrie Luft. She was a writer of plays and cofounder of a theatre troupe, a runner, a woman with a keen mind and an infectious giggle. But in her blogs, she was first and foremost, a mother.\n\nCARRIE LUFT [reading from Jennifer's blog]: I loved the bedtime routines, the rituals, the saying good nights, the books read, the hugs and kisses given, the songs sung. CARRIE LUFT [reading from Jennifer's blog]: I just wanted to freeze the moment. Snap a picture. Take them all in…. They grow too fast.\n\nHer writings are filled with a mother's musings about the ordinary blessings of family life.\n\nCARRIE LUFT [reading from Jennifer's blog]: The best part of my night now, hands down, is when I give our baby… a bath and then her bottle, in my arms.\n\nCarrie Luft: Jennifer loved her children just beyond compare. … She had this … wonderful young and growing family. Her existence was … mostly about the kids.\n\nJennifer Dulos was reported missing by her worried family and friends around 7 p.m. on May 24, 2019. Police quickly determined that the mother of five would never have willingly left her children. Carrie Luft\n\nThe morning of May 24, 2019 was no different — the organized chaos of getting five kids ages 13 and under dressed and off to school.\n\nBut shortly after 8:05 a.m., the normal rhythm of daily life stopped forever.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: She was scheduled for a dentist appointment … later that morning in New York City … She never made it to her dentist appointment.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca [driving]: This was definitely one of the biggest investigation to come to the State Police.\n\nConnecticut State Police Sergeant Kenneth Ventresca would become one of the lead investigators.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: People couldn't get a hold of her…\n\nCarrie Luft: And then, when we had radio silence, we knew that something was gravely wrong.\n\nThe children were taken to the home of their maternal grandmother, Gloria Farber, in New York City. By 7 p.m., all-out panic set in and Jennifer was reported missing.\n\nA little over an hour later, the police had ominous news. Officers found Jennifer's abandoned Suburban SUV near Waveny Park, about 3-and-a-half miles from her home.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca [in the park]: The tailgate was backed up against this tree. … The Suburban was not running; keys were not in the ignition. The gear lever was actually stuck in reverse. The doors were locked. … On the passenger side of her Suburban when — at the time, you could see the cleanup of the blood-like substance all over the passenger side under a flashlight.\n\nNew Canaan Police Chief Leon Krolikowski immediately launched a massive search across the 300 acres of Waveny Park.\n\nErin Moriarty: And how would you describe the initial search for her?\n\nChief Leon Krolikowski: It was enormous. I mean, literally from other police departments sending their canines to search to FBI team coming in, search for evidence to New York State Police helicopter, to divers checking the water within the park. And it's 300 acres, it's pretty comprehensive.\n\nCarrie volunteered to become the spokesperson for family and friends.\n\nCARRIE LUFT [to reporter]: All I want to say is, Jennifer, we love you and we are doing everything we can to bring you home. Your kids miss you. We all miss you.\n\nSergeant Ventresca says the one person who didn't seem worried about Jennifer was the father of her five children — her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos.\n\nErin Moriarty: Did he help at all in the search?\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: No, no.\n\nErin Moriarty: Did he seem concerned about his wife as time went on?\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: No. Never seemed concerned about his wife.\n\nIt wasn't always that way.\n\nCarrie Luft: Jennifer very much wanted to have a loving relationship and to start a family, and he seemed to want the same things.\n\nFotis and Jennifer Dulos Sotiria Kontouli\n\nOn the face of it, they seemed an unlikely pair: Jennifer, deep-thinking and introverted, grew up in wealth and privilege in New York City, the daughter of a father who made a fortune in finance.\n\nFotis, athletic and extroverted, was an international waterskiing champion born in Turkey and raised in Athens, Greece.\n\nBoth outstanding students, they first met in 1986 at the prestigious Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. But it didn't turn romantic until some 17 years later — after a chance meeting at the Aspen Airport.\n\nJennifer put it this way in her blog: I was home, back in New York, and an email came to me … he wanted to get together.\n\nErin Moriarty: What did she like about him, eventually love about him?\n\nCarrie Luft: Well, you know, he was a really a very charismatic and charming person. He was very handsome. He was smart and funny.\n\nAnd an ambitious real estate developer and builder of luxury homes. Fotis and Jennifer married in 2004 and settled in Farmington, Connecticut, an upscale enclave outside Hartford, where old money mingled with new.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi | Fotis's sister: The couple was very, very happy. And in two years, they had their first set of twins. Another two years they had the second set of twins. … And another two years they had a little daughter.\n\nThey moved into one of Fotis's magnificent homes at 4 Jefferson Crossing and raised their children with all the advantages that money affords, with an emphasis on sports — especially waterskiing, Fotis's passion.\n\nCarrie Luft: They would compete internationally, you know, even as, you know, 6 or 7-year-olds. So, they were incredibly good. But that was also … because they trained incredibly hard.\n\nJennifer believed Fotis was pushing them too hard, and later said her kids' mental and physical health was suffering because of Fotis's obsession with training.\n\nCarrie Luft: She often served as a buffer or a shield.\n\nAnd that led to fights, says Carrie.\n\nErin Moriarty: Did he have a temper?\n\nCarrie Luft: He could be volatile, yes.\n\nErin Moriarty: Even with the kids?\n\nCarrie Luft: Sure.\n\nLife behind the grand brick façade grew ever more distant and unhappy. The couple who seemed to have it all – looks, money, children – were living all but separate lives.\n\nErin Moriarty: Was she lonely?\n\nCarrie Luft: I'm sure.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: For all of us who were outside of the romance, we knew that they were two incompatible characters.\n\nBy 2016, Fotis was away as many as 10 ten days a month, often chasing the latest waterskiing competition.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: And one of his travels to Miami in the ski club with his children, he met Michelle.\n\nSoon after meeting in Miami, Fotis Dulos and Michelle Troconis, a Venezuelan-raised single mother, began an affair. Sotiria Kontouli\n\nMichelle Troconis was Fotis's type: she rode horses, she reported for ESPN in South America on snow skiing, and even more to Fotis's liking, she was a competitive water skier.\n\nSoon after meeting in Miami, Fotis and the Venezuelan-raised single mother began an affair.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: And it was serious. He was very much in love.\n\nAnd not very good at hiding it from his wife, says Carrie. In March of 2017, Jennifer confronted Fotis and he confessed.\n\nErin Moriarty: Was that an event that she just realized, OK, there's no going back?\n\nCarrie Luft: I think learning about the infidelity was horrible, you know, that was a deal breaker for her.\n\nJennifer moved her kids into a rented home about an hour-and-a-half away in New Canaan, Connecticut, and filed for divorce. Michelle and her young daughter moved into Fotis's Jefferson Crossing house in Farmington.\n\nClaudia Troconis | Michelle's sister: She said she had met a charming guy, that he was very family-oriented like us, that he was into sports like her, and they had many similarities. And she really liked him.\n\nIt would be the biggest mistake of Michelle Troconis's life.\n\nClaudia Troconis: This has shattered our life because my sister is not the person that they're saying. And she would never be capable of anything they've said that she has done.\n\nA BAD FEELING\n\nAs the search for Jennifer dragged on, Carrie Luft tried to hold on to hope. But she knew in her bones, as early as the day Jennifer disappeared, it was hopeless.\n\nCarrie Luft: I had a horrible foreboding sense that she was not alive.\n\nThe New Canaan police officers also had a bad feeling as they searched Jennifer's house the night she went missing.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: When they go to the house, they go in the garage, they noticed blood like substance … blood spatter throughout the garage.\n\nSergeant Ventresca and Detective John Kimball of the state's Major Crime Squad were summoned to the scene.\n\nDet. John Kimball: In addition to blood evidence in the garages, there was evidence that someone had attempted to clean up blood. There were swirls, what appeared to be swirl marks on the sides of the vehicles.\n\nDet. Kimball, left, and Sgt. Ventresca outside of Jennifer Dulos' rented home in New Canaan, Connecticut. CBS News\n\nAll the markings of an unhappy ending, says Sgt. Ventresca.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: A serious violent assault occurred in that garage … there's definitely some sort of foul play involved.\n\nThe scene in the garage was all Richard Colangelo, now Connecticut's Chief State's Attorney needed. He immediately took on the case.\n\nRichard Colangelo Jr.: When it started, it was a whodunit.\n\nBut someone soon went to the top of the list. At the time of her disappearance, Jennifer was embroiled in a bitter divorce and custody battle with her estranged husband, Fotis Dulos. According to divorce documents, she was terrified of him:\n\nI am afraid that my Husband will harm our children to punish me. He is dangerous and ruthless when he believes that he has been wronged. … He must always win at all costs.\n\nDet. John Kimball: I don't think Fotis liked to lose in any aspect of his life, and I don't think that he'd like to be losing in court at the hands of his wife.\n\nHe had spent thousands of dollars in lawyer fees and court costs. His business was floundering. And worse, he lost shared physical custody of his children after going against court orders regarding his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis.\n\nErin Moriarty: What did he do or didn't do?\n\nCarrie Luft: Well, he didn't comply with the court order that Michelle not be part of the children's lives.\n\nJennifer Dulos, 50, was last seen on May 24, 2019 near her New Canaan, Connecticut, home after dropping her children off at school. New Canaan Police\n\nFotis didn't even pretend to hide his feelings toward Jennifer when he agreed to go to the New Canaan Police station the day after Jennifer disappeared.\n\nErin Moriarty: Did he agree to sit down and talk?\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: No.\n\nHe'd brought his civil attorney with him.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: His lawyer was already on the phone with a criminal defense attorney at the time from the parking lot.\n\nErin Moriarty: What does that say to you?\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: To me … it was alarming, because the mother of your five children are missing and you're worried about calling attorneys?\n\nBefore he left, Fotis inadvertently gave the detectives something more important than an interview.\n\nRichard Colangelo Jr.: The detective that was there said, is that your phone? Yeah. Can I see it? He gave it to him. He asked him for the password. He told them the password.\n\nFotis demanded his phone back, but the detective refused. Investigators got a search warrant and were able to retrieve the data.\n\nRichard Colangelo Jr.: And … from there, we were off and running.\n\nInvestigators tracked Fotis's cell phone to Albany Avenue in Hartford around 7 p.m. the evening of May 24, roughly the same time Jennifer was reported missing. They then contacted the Hartford Police, who downloaded a treasure trove of videos that had been captured on security cameras.\n\nNew Canaan Police Officer Thomas Patten couldn't believe his eyes.\n\nErin Moriarty [watching surveillance video]: What are you seeing?\n\nOfficer Tom Patten: Well, as he was driving around, he would be — he was depositing black garbage bags and various receptacles. … Obviously, he was intent on spreading out the garbage bags.\n\nErin Moriarty: And is he alone?\n\nOffice Tom Patten: No, in one of those pictures, you can see a female that's leaning outside of the passenger side of the truck.\n\nIn one of the surveillance clips, police noticed a woman with Fotis Dulos — she can be seen reaching towards the sidewalk [right side of truck]. She was later identified as his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis. Jon Schoenhorn\n\nTurns out that female reaching for the sidewalk was Michelle Troconis.\n\nDet. John Kimball: My first thought was … What are they doing? Why are they … dumping trash in Hartford?\n\nThey would soon find out. A team of detectives was dispatched to go digging through the trash.\n\nDet. John Kimball: So, some of the things retrieved from the Albany Avenue garbage were used zip ties with human blood and DNA of Jennifer Dulos on them … female undergarment … a Vineyard Vine[s] shirt in the size that Jennifer wore. There were two ponchos … which contained copious amounts of blood and the DNA of Jennifer Dulos.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: It's not every day someone throws out bloody evidence, bloody clothes, you know, cut up. I mean, who does that?\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: We shifted gears, and we turned this into a homicide investigation.\n\nFotis Dulos and Michelle Troconis following their arrests in connection with the disappearance of Dulos' estranged wife, Jennifer Dulos. Photos taken June 1, 2019. New Canaan Police Department\n\nOn June 1, eight days after Jennifer vanished, both Fotis Dulos and Michelle Troconis were arrested – not for murder, but for tampering with or fabricating physical evidence and first-degree hindering prosecution.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: We weren't fully convinced he did the murder yet, but he was involved in some way, shape or form.\n\nBut they couldn't place him in New Canaan that morning. For one reason, says Sgt. Ventresca, the location of Fotis's phone.\n\nErin Moriarty: At the time that Jennifer Dulos disappeared from her house, her husband was at home, according to his phone.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: According to his phone, yes\n\nAnd according to Michelle Troconis. She told police Fotis was with her that morning.\n\nDave Altimari | Hartford Courant reporter: She told them that Fotis was in Farmington at the Jefferson Crossing home early that morning, that they had woke up together and that they had sex and they had a shower … so her … in effect, she gave him an alibi.\n\nBoth Fotis and Michelle were released — each on a $500,000 bond and ordered to wear ankle bracelets. They were also ordered not to communicate with one another. Michelle moved into her own apartment and Fotis stayed in his glittering mansion at 4 Jefferson Crossing.\n\nBut neither would be able to escape the presumption of guilt.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: Fotis was tried and convicted in the … court of the public opinion, that is sure.\n\nDaniella Troconis: What they have said about my sister, the media, and the police, is not who my sister is.\n\nClaudia Troconis: She had nothing to do with this.\n\nQUESTIONING MICHELLE\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi was at home in Greece when she learned about her brother's arrest.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: I thought that this will be an issue of one or two days and the police will understand that they are making a mistake.\n\nShe was wrong. He quickly became the prime suspect in a multi-agency murder investigation.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: Fotis was the easy solution for the police.\n\nAnd an easy target for the press, says Rena.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: The cameras was following him when he was jogging. When he was going to the grocery store … People are … innocent until proven guilty. They never gave … this opportunity to Fotis, never.\n\nAfter the arrest, Rena – Fotis's only sibling – flew from Athens to stand by her brother's side.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: What have we done to the life of an innocent person?\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: I know that it is impossible for him to do such a thing. … It is impossible. It is a big no.\n\nIn December 2019, Fotis Dulos' attorney allowed 48 Hours into Fotis's home. He was under a gag order and refused to answer any questions. Fotis is pictured with his sister, Rena. CBS News\n\nIn December 2019, Fotis's attorney allowed 48 Hours into Fotis's home. He was under a gag order and refused to answer any questions. And we were witnesses to an almost surreal scene of a man suspected of a monstrous crime relaxing with his family. His nieces, Angelika and Klelia, had just arrived from Europe.\n\nKlelia Kyrimi: It was very important for us to be here with him during this Christmas, 'cause it's a tough Christmas.\n\nAngelika Kyrimi: Trying to support him… to keep his spirits up.\n\nFotis was banned by the court from seeing his own children.\n\nAngelika Kyrimi: It's very, very hard. These kids are his heart and his soul … everyday he wakes up and it's just – you see it in his face.\n\nThey tried to cheer him up by doing all of their favorite things.\n\nAngelika Kyrimi: Playing board games … and cooking and talking … we've always been close. We've always been spending the holidays together.\n\nThey knew it could be their last Christmas all together. Fotis's attorney had told him to expect murder charges after the New Year.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: We will be here to stand by his side, whatever it comes.\n\nLike Rena, Michelle's family couldn't believe it was happening.\n\nClaudia Troconis: My mom called us and told us Michi has been arrested. I remember dropping to the floor and saying, Why? Why? What happened? … it's been devastating.\n\nAnd just like Rena, they refuse to even think about the possibility that Michelle could have been involved in Jennifer's disappearance.\n\nErin Moriarty: What makes you believe that your sister had absolutely nothing to do with this?\n\nClaudia Troconis: How we were brought up, our principles … just that she's never been a violent person. She's never been revengeful you know … she's a mother herself.\n\nCarlos Troconis: She wouldn't harm anybody or anyone.\n\nMichelle Troconis walks with her father, Carlos, and sisters Daniella and Claudia, in Farmington. The family spoke out in defense of Michelle to 48 Hours. CBS News\n\n48 Hours met Michelle's father, Carlos Troconis, a cardiac surgeon, and sisters Daniella and Claudia in Farmington. They are speaking out for the first time.\n\nClaudia Troconis: She's not the person that they've portrayed and they've accused her of … They've said that, you know, she's a whore, that, you know, she entered this. That she should rot in jail.\n\nThey say the public image of Michelle as a homewrecker is simply not true.\n\nErin Moriarty: And what did Fotis tell Michelle about his marriage?\n\nClaudia Troconis: That it was the same. That he was separated … that they each had their separate lives, and that they were going through an amicable divorce, because they had the five children.\n\nErin Moriarty: Fotis Dulos lied to Michelle?\n\nJon Schoenhorn: It appears that he did on more than one occasion, which, in my view … casts suspicion on him.\n\nMichelle Troconis with her attorney, Jon Schoenhorn, He claims Fotis Dulos deceived Michelle with lie after lie. CBS News\n\nMichelle, who accompanied her family to our interview, refused to answer questions. But her attorney, Jon Schoenhorn, did. He claims Fotis deceived Michelle with lie after lie — and that included the trip to Albany Avenue in Hartford.\n\nErin Moriarty: And you're saying she had no idea what was in those bags that Fotis was getting rid of?\n\nJon Schoenhorn: She not only did not know what was in those bags, she had no idea … what he was actually doing. He'd invited her to go out to Starbucks … But he claimed he had to just take care of a few items. … Practically the entire time he's driving in Hartford, she's on either WhatsApp, texting or making phone calls during that whole time.\n\nHe says she was chatting with friends and family.\n\nErin Moriarty [referencing the surveillance photo of Michelle reaching for the sidewalk]: What is she doing there?\n\nJon Schoenhorn: She told the police that she had — was chewing gum and she had gotten it on her fingers, and she tried to fling it out the window. It wouldn't come off, so she wiped her hand on the sidewalk.\n\nSchoenhorn recently released excerpts from interrogation videos hoping to prove his point that: Michelle was cooperative – even helpful – and repeatedly denied any involvement in Jennifer's disappearance:\n\nDET KIMBALL: We think you have information. MICHELLE TROCONIS: I don't have John, but I can walk the whole world with you if you want. … I can do whatever you want, but I didn't do it. … I have no idea what happened to Jennifer. I have no idea where Jennifer is.\n\nBut detectives believed she knew more than she was saying:\n\nDETECTIVE: So, if you know stuff that you're not telling us ... MICHELLE TROCONIS: No, I don't know ... DETECTIVE: That's the man you're protecting, 'cause that's the sick s---. MICHELLE TROCONIS: I'm not protecting him. I'm not protecting him.\n\nBut the more she talked, the more suspicious they became.\n\nRemember, Michelle told the police in her first interview that Fotis was with her the morning Jennifer disappeared; that they had a shower and were intimate. By the third interview, she was telling a different story.\n\nDave Altimari: And every time they … would push her, she changed her story. And then by the third time, she basically told them that it was a lie, that he was not in the house on that morning as she … had initially told them.\n\nShe also acknowledged that Fotis had left his phone behind.\n\nDave Altimari: The phone being in Farmington was clearly part of the alibi. At least that's the state police's belief — that he left the phone there so no one would know where he was.\n\nAfter 8 months of investigation, on January 7, 2020, the police arrested Michelle for conspiracy to commit murder.\n\nDaniella Troconis: It's been devastating, because we know my sister is innocent.\n\nErin Moriarty: Sometimes women do ridiculous things for love.\n\nClaudia Troconis: Not my sister.\n\nDaniella Troconis: That's not Michelle.\n\nClaudia Troconis: Other women, but not my sister.\n\nDaniella Troconis: Michelle would never harm anyone in any way.\n\nErin Moriarty: But would she possibly cover up for a man she loved?\n\nDaniella Troconis: No! She would never put herself in harm ways, not even herself or her daughter. No, she's not capable of doing so.\n\nClaudia Troconis: That would affect her life, so she wouldn't.\n\nThe police came for Fotis the same day; Rena was there.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: It was like a movie. … They went out of the cars with the weapons like they were going to arrest Al Capone. … It was a terrible moment. It was terrible moments, believe me.\n\nInvestigators believe they have the killer. But they still don't have the victim: Jennifer Dulos.\n\nAnd Fotis's attorney, Norm Pattis says that raises questions whether there was a murder at all.\n\nNorm Pattis: We defy the state to prove that she is in fact dead.\n\nTHE STATE'S CASE\n\nNORM PATTIS [to reporters]: Here's our message to the State of Connecticut: Mr. Dulos is not guilty. We are ready for the court. There's the courthouse. If you want to try the case, bring it on.\n\nNorm Pattis likes to stir things up. And he did a good job of it for his client, Fotis Dulos.\n\nNORM PATTIS [in court]: There is no body that we're aware of and I'm sick and tired of hearing about it.\n\nFotis Dulos with attorney Norm Pattis. WFSB\n\nHe aimed straight for the state's weak spot. No body. No murder.\n\nNORM PATTIS [to reporters]: We take the position there is insufficient evidence to conclude that she's even dead.\n\nPattis launched a public campaign to cast Fotis as a loving father unfairly deprived of seeing his children. And Jennifer as the villain.\n\nNorm Pattis: We are actively contemplating a revenge suicide hypothesis as an explanation for her disappearance.\n\nAnother defense theory Pattis suggested was Gone Girl – that just like in the thriller and hit movie, Jennifer disappeared to frame her husband for murder.\n\nRichard Colangelo Jr.: When Attorney Pattis raised it and talked about it, I begged him to do it in front of a jury … You could drive a bus through all the holes in that theory or that argument.\n\nEven so, Chief State's Attorney Richard Colangelo knew that proving murder without a body was not going to be easy.\n\nRichard Colangelo Jr.: We tried to leverage everything we could and we didn't leave any stone unturned.\n\nBit by bit, Colangelo says they built a case of premeditated murder and cover-up — a story they laid out in detailed arrest warrants.\n\nIt starts in the pre-dawn hours of May 24, with an old red Tacoma truck. Not Fotis's truck — but a truck that belonged to one of his workers.\n\nAt 7:57 a.m., police found video from a passing school bus of the Toyota Tacoma [lower left] on the side of the road near Waveny Park in New Canaan. It was approximately 100 feet from where Jennifer' Dulos' Suburban would later be found. Connecticut State Police\n\nInvestigators believe Fotis took the Tacoma without permission and left the 80 Mountain Spring Road property – one of the homes owned by his company – around 5:35 a.m. He then drove it 70 miles south to New Canaan.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: We crunched about 12 hours of video surveillance … of the Merritt Parkway, where we eventually located a red Toyota Tacoma pickup truck matching the worker's Toyota Tacoma driving southbound.\n\nAt 7:57 a.m, the Tacoma was spotted again by a passing school bus, this time in New Canaan. The Tacoma was parked on a country road near Waveny Park.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: This is where he had parked it.\n\nInvestigators believe Fotis had brought a bicycle with him and biked the last three miles to Jennifer's house.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: He came over in the back road over there. He waited for her to drop the kids off at school. She came home in the morning … She enters the garage … And that's where the violent assault occurred in the house.\n\nFotis left behind two pieces of evidence critical to the investigation, says the sergeant: his DNA on the doorknob of the mudroom and a mixture of his and Jennifer's DNA on a faucet inside Jennifer's house.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: Fotis Dulos's DNA being in that house is highly suspicious in nature. It shouldn't be in the house.\n\nSergeant Ventresca believes Fotis spent about two hours cleaning up, then put Jennifer's dead or unconscious body in the back of her Suburban and drove it away.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: ... and then her vehicle is left about 3-and-a-half miles away down a road near Waveny Park …\n\nJust 100 feet from where police say he had parked the Tacoma.\n\nDet. John Kimball: There's storm drains down here…\n\nInvestigators cannot account for the next 40 minutes. It's possible Fotis used that time to get rid of Jennifer's body, but they think it's more likely that he was transferring incriminating materials from the Suburban to the Tacoma.\n\nDet. John Kimball: If he had things to move, like a lot of bloody clothing, he had to do so carefully, and he had to wait for breaks in traffic. It could've taken 40 minutes.\n\nDet. John Kimball: We believe … the body of Jennifer Dulos was transferred to the Tacoma and taken north.\n\nWhat happened to Jennifer after that, they don't know. What they do know is that the Tacoma returned to 80 Mountain Spring Road at 12:22 p.m.\n\nMichelle told the police that Fotis met her for lunch around 1 p.m.\n\nJon Schoenhorn | Michelle's attorney: I have seen no evidence that Michelle knew anything about what Fotis Dulos had done during the day other than the time that they had lunch together.\n\nAfter lunch, according to Michelle, they spent much of the afternoon at the 80 Mountain Spring property cleaning. She claims Fotis was getting the house ready to show to a client.\n\nErin Moriarty: So, what do you think was happening that afternoon at 80 Mountain Spring?\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: I think that the evidence that was found in Hartford … was being bagged up.\n\nTo be discarded in those trash cans later that evening.\n\nFive days later, Fotis and Michelle took the Tacoma to the car wash and detail shop.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: For a 20-year-old Toyota work truck, it was immaculate. … You can eat off the floorboards in this truck. That's how clean it was by the time we got it.\n\nBut Fotis made one major miscalculation, says Richard Colangelo.\n\nErin Moriarty: What did you learn from the employee who actually owned that Tacoma?\n\nRichard Colangelo Jr.: That Mr. Dulos wanted him to change out the seats and get rid of them. But he kept them in his garage. And when we went to execute the search warrant, he said Hey, do you want the seats? … So, he gave us consent to take them and we took them.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca: On the passenger seat … there was a blood-like stain on the fabric of the seat, which was cut out, tested at the lab, and it came back to Jennifer Dulos's DNA – blood. … And that was paramount for this investigation.\n\nThere was still a lot missing. Investigators never found a murder weapon and couldn't even positively identify Fotis as the driver of the Tacoma in the surveillance footage. But they believed they had enough circumstantial evidence to prove Fotis killed his wife.\n\nBut the case would never go to court.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: I could never imagine … he had such a tragic end.\n\nUNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES\n\nOn a cold winter day three weeks after his arrest for murder and kidnapping, Fotis Dulos was ordered to court for an emergency hearing on whether to revoke his bond.\n\nHe never made it.\n\nKevin Smith: I called him and called him and called him.\n\nWhen Fotis failed to show up, one of his attorney's, Kevin Smith, alerted authorities. Emergency responders rushed to his home. They found Fotis locked in the garage, in the front seat of his Suburban, surrounded with pictures of his five children — almost dead from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nEMT's shielded his motionless body as they frantically worked to get a heartbeat. And then they found a faint pulse. He was still alive.\n\nFotis was airlifted to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx.\n\nWCBS NEWS REPORT: He is in critical condition after a suicide attempt at his home.\n\nFotis's sister Rena was on the next transatlantic flight out of Greece.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: We had to be there because … we had hopes that maybe he can come back and he can breathe by himself.\n\nBut it was not to be.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: I could never imagine this would happen.\n\nPolice found Fotis Dulos unresponsive on January 28, 2020, while sitting in his running vehicle inside the garage of his Connecticut mansion CBS News\n\nTwo days after attempting suicide, Fotis was taken off life support.\n\nNORM PATTIS [to reporters]: Fotis Dulos was declared dead tonight at 5:32.\n\nThat evening, 48 Hours drove with Norm Pattis to Fotis's Jefferson Crossing home in Farmington.\n\nNorm Pattis: I'm angry, I'm hurt, I'm determined, I'm sad.\n\nPattis met Kevin Smith at the house. Together they secured the home and reflected on the day's events.\n\nNorm Pattis: You know Mr. Dulos was tried and convicted in the court of public opinion and ultimately in our view executed in that court.\n\nFotis went to his grave professing his innocence. In his suicide note, he wrote, I refuse to spend even an hour more in jail for something I had NOTHING to do with.\n\nErin Moriarty: As you sit here right now, do you believe that Fotis Dulos killed his wife, Jennifer?\n\nCarrie Luft: Yes.\n\nDet. John Kimball: To me, the suicide of Fotis Dulos was, in essence, an admission of guilt in his involvement in his wife's murder.\n\nDetective John Kimball believes Fotis knew it was over; he knew he was likely going to jail after the bond hearing and might never get out. And the man who hated to lose was not about to live with a murder conviction.\n\nDet. John Kimball: Because Fotis committed suicide before he went to trial, he will never be convicted of his wife's murder. It's frustrating that he didn't see justice.\n\nBut Rena says she will never stop fighting to clear her brother's name.\n\nRena Dulos Kyrimi: He didn't have any trial … so they cannot call him a murderer without a trial.\n\nEven with Fotis dead, the State of Connecticut is moving forward.\n\nErin Moriarty: Where does that leave Michelle Troconis?\n\nJon Schoenhorn | Michelle's attorney: Well, I think the right expression here is she's left holding the bag.\n\nMICHELLE TROCONIS [ interrogation]: I'm not protecting him. I'm not protecting him.\n\nJon Schoenhorn: But they've spent millions of dollars of taxpayer money. … So here they are. They got to show something for their effort at this point.\n\nMichelle Troconis and Kent Mawhinney. Pool\n\nMichelle Troconis isn't the only one facing trial.\n\nFotis's friend and sometime lawyer Kent Mawhinney is also charged with conspiracy. He was at Fotis's house the morning Jennifer went missing, and police say he was frequently vague or evasive and otherwise suspicious to investigators. But, after spending 9 months in jail, he is free on a reduced bail. He has turned state's witness. And, according to Michelle's attorney, Jon Schoenhorn, he is now implicating Michelle to save himself.\n\nIn a statement to 48 Hours, Schoenhorn wrote: …These new accusations directly contradict what he told investigators in 2019, and I look forward to the chance to cross-examine him …\n\nKent Mawhinney's attorney told us he couldn't comment on an ongoing criminal case.\n\nBoth Michelle Troconis and Kent Mawhinney have pleaded not guilty.\n\nErin Moriarty: If either one of them came up with information that led to finding Jennifer, would there be a deal for them?\n\nRichard Colangelo Jr.: Believe it or not, I'm a very open-minded person. So, I'm not going to close the door on anything.\n\nErin Moriarty: I will take that as a yes. That's how much you would like to know where Jennifer is.\n\nRichard Colangelo Jr.: Absolutely.\n\nNot a day goes by that Sgt. Kenneth Ventresca doesn't think about Jennifer Dulos.\n\nSgt. Kenneth Ventresca : I'm confident we are going to find her body, and we are not going to stop. You know, you think about the kids and now the five children don't have a mom or a dad.\n\nCarrie Luft: They all embody Jennifer in so many ways. … And she did such a great job of instilling them with love and delight.\n\nIn May 2021, it will be two years since Jennifer disappeared, and despite police efforts, they have been unable to find her body. Carrie Luft\n\nJennifer left a legacy in words. A parting gift to the five children she adored.\n\nCARRIE LUFT [reading from Jennifer's blog]: Breathe, be alive, slow down, enjoy life … Do less, but live more fully … healthy, calm, joyful and at peace.\n\nThe children are being raised by Jennifer's mother in New York City.\n\nProduced by Liza Finley and Elena DiFiore.

Cicely Tyson, the award-winning actress who trailblazed a career across several decades and appeared in countless TV shows, films and Broadway plays, died Thursday at age 96, according to her manager. Tyson's role as a sharecropper's wife in the film Sounder landed her an Oscar nomination in 1973.\n\nWith heavy heart, the family of Miss Cicely Tyson announces her peaceful transition this afternoon, Tyson's family said in a statement from her manager. At this time, please allow the family their privacy.\n\nTyson, who first entered the spotlight as a model, was well-known across the entertainment industry, earning two Emmy Awards — best lead actress in a drama and best actress in a special — for her role as a former slave in the 1974 TV drama The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. In a defining moment of the film, Pittman walks up and drinks from the whites-only water fountain.\n\nWell, when I'm working, I just tell everybody. I said, 'I don't care what you see. Please don't tell me about it ... because I work so organically,' Tyson said. So the next day, when I came on the set, I knew something had happened. And I simply said, 'Please don't tell me. I don't want to know ...' and people were talking about the walk. I said, 'What walk?'\n\nActress Cicely Tyson holds the two Emmy Awards that she won for her performance in The Autobiography Of Miss Jane Pittman on May 28, 1974, in Los Angeles. Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nIn 1994, she won a supporting actress Emmy for her role in Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All, and a Tony Award in 2013 at age 88 for best leading actress in the play The Trip to Bountiful. She starred alongside Vanessa Williams, who was inspired by Tyson's work ethic, according to a 2015 interview.\n\nShe did not miss one performance ever. ... There's no excuse to not show up when Cicely Tyson can show up every day, Williams said at the time about Tyson.\n\nTyson was among a group of 21 actors, musicians, athletes and innovators in 2016 who were awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom — the nation's highest civilian honor — by former President Obama.\n\nIn her long and extraordinary career, Cicely Tyson has not only succeeded as an actor, she has shaped the whole course of history, Mr. Obama said at the presentation, per ETonline. Cicely was never the likeliest of Hollywood stars. The daughter of immigrants from the West Indies, she was raised by a hardworking and religious mother who cleaned houses and forbade her children to attend the movies. But once she got her education and broke into the business, Cicely made a conscious decision not just to say lines, but to speak out.\n\nIn 2015, Tyson was celebrated with a Kennedy Center Honor for her contributions to American culture, paving the way for African Americans in the industry.\n\nIn 2018, she was awarded an honorary Oscar statuette at the annual Governors Awards, according to The Associated Press. I come from lowly status. I grew up in an area that was called the slums at the time, Tyson said at the time. I still cannot imagine that I have met with presidents, kings, queens. How did I get here? I marvel at it.\n\nIn 2020, Tyson was inducted into the Television Academy's Hall of Fame and received a Career Achievement Peabody Award.\n\nHer memoir, Just As I Am, was released on January 26, the same day that CBS This Morning aired an interview between the iconic actress and Gayle King, where Tyson was able to reflect on her roles.\n\nWhenever I'm offered a script ... what I'm interested in when I get it is, 'why me?' she said. Who was that character and why did they want me to play it ... and when I get to the point where I feel like her skin has fitted my arm or my mind, then I know there's something about her.\n\nBorn in 1924 to West Indian parents, Tyson said she was a very shy child, the youngest of three. AP said her parents had moved from the island of Nevis in the Caribbean to New York City's East Harlem neighborhood. At an early age, her friends urged Tyson to take up modeling because of her striking looks.\n\nCicely Tyson is honored with a hand and footprint ceremony during the TCM Classic Film Festival at the TCL Chinese Theatre IMAX on April 27, 2018, in Hollywood, California.

Tyson became pregnant when she was 17 and had a short marriage that lasted just over two years. Her decision to begin an acting career as a single mother brought conflict at home, including her mother kicking her out of the house.\n\nOh, she told me I couldn't live there and do that, Tyson said. Suddenly I found something that I loved to do. And I had a child to support.\n\nAmerican actors (left to right) Paul Winfield (1941-2004), Yvonne Jarrell, Eric Hooks, Cicely Tyson (1924-2021) and Kevin Hooks as a family of sharecroppers talk with American blues musician Taj Mahal (right) as Ike in this publicity still from the 1972 film Sounder, directed by Martin Ritt. 20th Century Fox via Getty Images\n\nTyson made her on-screen debut at age 31 in the 1956 black-and-white film Carib Gold. Through sheer determination, her career blossomed after landing the headline role of playing the wife to a sharecropper in Sounder — the 1972 film based on the William H. Armstrong novel. Her character was confined in jail for stealing a piece of food for the farmer's family and was forced to care for their children and attend to the crops.\n\nAt the time, a review from The New York Times read: She passes all of her easy beauty by to give us, at long last, some sense of the profound beauty of millions of Black women.\n\nIn Tyson's memoir, she speaks of her love story with jazz great Miles Davis, who put her on the cover of his 1967 album, Sorcerer. The two married in 1981, but divorced less than seven years later. However, their romance spanned decades. Tyson told King that she was never able to find a love like that again.\n\nAt age 96, Tyson was asked by King what it's like to be considered a legend.\n\nI'm amazed every single day I live, she said. I mean, what my life became is not what I expected ... I had no idea that I would touch anybody.\n\nWhen King asked Tyson: When the time comes, what do you want us to remember about you?\n\nShe replied: I done my best. That's all.\n\nThe Associated Press and ETonline contributed to this report.
Erin Moriarty is a 48 Hours correspondent. She investigates the case of Tiffany Mead, a young Utah mom found in a car with a gruesome neck injury, for the episode, Don't Scream, airing Saturday, Dec. 15 at 9/8c on CBS.\n\nPolice officers are often criticized for the way they conduct citizen stops and arrests, but in Davis County, Utah, a team of deputy sheriffs and prosecutors are getting praise for going above and beyond to, not just solve a case, but to prevent a murder.\n\nLate in the evening of July 23, 2013, a young woman called 911 from her car sitting on the side of the road in Davis County, Utah. She needed help, she told Shelley Campbell, the operator on call that night.\n\nMy neck's bleeding, she said. I need help quick.\n\nThe young woman, 22-year-old Tiffany Mead, told Campbell that she had cut her own throat in an effort to commit suicide, but the operator had her doubts almost immediately. Tiffany told her that both her husband and young son were in the car, but the husband seemed too calm and disinterested. The operator had to tell him to use his own shirt to try to staunch the bleeding. And why was his wife the one calling for help?\n\nShelley Campbell's instincts were right.\n\nWhen Deputy Paramedic Jason Sorensen reached the scene and began treating Tiffany, she told him that, in fact, her estranged husband, Kris Ertmann, had cut her.\n\nShe was rushed to the hospital in critical condition while investigators, like Sergeant Bob Thompson, tried to figure what really happened.\n\nThompson, who suspected that this was a terrible case of domestic violence, began by questioning the husband, Kris Ertmann, who had been detained. Ertmann said that he and his wife, who had two young children, were in the middle of a divorce. They had met that night, Ertmann said, so he could give his wife a child support check.\n\nWe exchanged a few words and I don't know how she did ... being able to put a knife to her throat, is how Ertmann explained what happened, showing little emotion. Thompson wondered why, if Tiffany Mead cut her own throat, the weapon was nowhere to be found. And Tiffany Mead's injuries appeared to be too severe to be self-inflicted.\n\nThompson arrested Ertmann and charged him with attempted murder, when, despite all odds, Tiffany Mead survived. However, proving that case would turn out to be much more difficult than he and his boss, Lieutenant Jen Daley, expected.\n\nTiffany Mead and Kris Ertmann Tiffany Mead\n\nDespite more than a week of searching, the weapon was never recovered. Thompson and Daley believed that Kris Ertmann had thrown it out of the car window. To complicate matters more, the judge handling the case received an unsigned letter from a person claiming to be a friend who supported Ertmann's story that Tiffany had cut her own throat and was trying to frame him for the assault. Thompson and Daley had to take the letter as credible and tried unsuccessfully to track down the writer.\n\nMore troubling, Davis County attorneys Richard Larsen and Jason Nelson told the detectives that proving the case of attempted murder would require more evidence.\n\nWe were absolutely convinced that he had inflicted the injury. That wasn't the big question....the big question was what was his intent when he did it?\n\nThis is the problem with so many domestic abuse cases -- a difficulty in preventing further violence between two people tied together by marriage, children and history. Did Kris Ertmann really intend to murder his wife? After all, he allowed her to call 911 for help. He gave her his shirt to use to apply pressure against her wound. If he only intended to hurt or scare his wife, prosecutors might only be able to convict him of aggravated assault, a lesser charge that could mean as little as a year in prison.\n\nSo how to keep Tiffany Mead safe? Lieutenant Daley was convinced that Ertmann would try again to kill his wife.\n\nI was angry, internally angry....I couldn't even wrap my head around it, that you could do that to a human being in front of a child, and a year later, you're free to walk around.
She was a child star in every sense: Tatum O'Neal was only nine when cameras rolled for 1973's Paper Moon, but she stole nearly every scene. Playing opposite her dad, superstar Ryan O'Neal, and directed by Peter Bogdanovich, it was her first-ever film. And it wasn't easy for her, or anyone else on the set.\n\nA lot of those takes took 40 takes, O'Neal said. I didn't really read very well during the film.\n\nEverybody hated you, on set? asked correspondent Tracy Smith.\n\nPretty much, yeah, she replied. Until they saw, like, what they had. And then they were like, 'Oh, now we love her!'\n\nMoses (Ryan O'Neal) and Addie (Tatum O'Neal) pull a scam on an unfortunate cashier in Paper Moon:\n\nAnd at the Oscars in 1974, the Academy loved her, too.\n\nBut when asked if she had any idea, at age 10, what it meant to win that Oscar – becoming the youngest ever to win in a competitive category – O'Neal said, No idea.\n\nStill, she was pretty poised for a ten-year-old, and her acceptance speech was an example of brevity that winners tonight could probably learn from: All I really want to thank is my director, Peter Bogdanovich, and my father. Thank you.\n\nHer next film, The Bad News Bears, was nearly as big; she played an ace Little Leaguer opposite the great Walter Matthau. And there were other roles after this, but perhaps none equal to the promise of her first film.\n\nSmith asked, What does it do if you start your career, first movie you're in, boom?\n\nI think it really screws you up, O'Neal said. Case in point: I think I would work consistently, but I suck at auditioning. So the fact that, like, I can't get myself a job because I can't f**king audition, the fact that I can't get a job because I can't audition properly is funny to me.\n\nSo, you've worked on this auditioning thing because you didn't have to audition coming out of the gate?\n\nCorrect. Yes.\n\nShe still found other work, and time to play. As a teenager she was seen at all the right places with other famous faces. She dated Michael Jackson, partied at Studio 54, and hung out with Cher. Yeah. I was an adult, she said. I didn't see a problem with it. It was just when they had to get a crane to get me out of Cher's house because she had, like, a really amazing family. Like, she had her mom and her sisters and all these amazing women. And I'm like, 'Wait, there's no women at my house.' Well, there are, but they come and they go, every day.\n\nDad's girlfriends, kind of coming and going? Smith asked.\n\nIf you want to call them that!\n\nBut Cher was like stability for you? Smith asked.\n\nTotally. Yeah.\n\nBut the instability in her life took a toll, professionally and personally. Tatum O'Neal has always been remarkably open about her struggles with addiction, and her bitter divorce from tennis great John McEnroe, with whom she has three kids: Kevin, Sean and Emily.\n\nBut now, at 56, she says her biggest challenge ever is her latest one: rheumatoid arthritis, a disorder that can make every move a painful struggle.\n\nSmith asked, What does that mean for your daily life?\n\nThat means that my hands stopped working, O'Neal said. It means that I can't tie my shoes. I have to re-learn to write. And I definitely need surgery on my left knee and my neck coming up in the next week.\n\nAnd through it all, she says her daughter, actress Emily McEnroe, has been her rock. My mom is incredibly loving, Emily said. She's childlike and always has been. She's just bright. My mom lights up every room that she enters. And that's true.\n\nI don't know why you're embarrassed, she said to Tatum.\n\nNo, that's such a sweet thing to say, she replied.\n\nBy the way, O'Neal says that she and Emily's dad are on good terms now, and that having her three children may have saved her life. I was really ready to kind of fall down and not get back up, she said. I was not myself. I was, at 22, and then the kids gave me a kind of a real reason to keep going and fight. And still, the happiest times of my life were the times that I was married, funny enough. So, sometimes we think we're making the right decision and maybe we aren't. And I have to live with that, too.\n\nWhat do you mean? What decision?\n\nWell, to leave my marriage.\n\nThat maybe looking back it wasn't the right decision?\n\nPerhaps not, O'Neal said. I was loved, I was cared for. ... That's it, that's what one wants, isn't it, in a marriage? I've never met anyone who even comes close to my ex-husband.\n\nHe's happier, and I'm happy for him. And that makes me happy.\n\nHer relationship with her father seems a bit more strained these days. They teamed up for a reality TV show in 2011, but since then it's been complicated. Would I love if my dad and I were closer? There are no words, O'Neal said. He was the first love of my life. But sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to. And I can love unconditionally without reciprocal. And I think my dad does love me. So, that's what I tend to believe, even though we don't talk as often as I would like, or see each other as often as I would like.\n\nAnd you can bet Tatum O'Neal will keep trying with the same grit that she showed on screen 40 years ago, and the belief that there are bigger prizes still to come.\n\nSmith asked, Do you dream of winning another Oscar?\n\nNo, O'Neal replied. Because that's not why I'm in it. Would I like that? I guess. For me, the biggest achievement would be that I did the best audition that I could do, that I got the role that I really wanted, and that I'm self-supporting through my own contributions.\n\nAnd how does she see her future? I think the best years are still ahead of me. How 'bout that? I do.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nProduced by John D'Amelio.
Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire mogul and power broker who built a casino empire spanning from Las Vegas to China and became a singular force in domestic and international politics, has died after a long illness, his wife said Tuesday. Adelson died at 87 from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Las Vegas Sands announced.\n\nAt one point the third-richest man in the world, Adelson brought singing gondoliers to the Las Vegas Strip and went all-in betting Asia would be a bigger jackpot than Sin City.\n\nHe was the son of Jewish immigrants, raised with two siblings in a Boston tenement, who over the second half of his life became one of the world's richest men. The chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. foresaw correctly that Asia would be an even bigger market. In 2018, Forbes ranked him No. 15 in the U.S., worth an estimated $35.5 billion.\n\nIf you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow, he said during a 2014 talk to the gambling industry in Las Vegas.\n\nBlunt yet secretive, Adelson resembled an old-fashioned political boss and stood apart from most American Jews, who for decades have supported Democrats by wide margins. Adelson was considered the nation's most influential GOP donor over the final years of his life, at times setting records for individual contributions during a given election cycle.\n\nIn 2012, Politico called him the dominant pioneer of the super PAC era.\n\nAdelson regularly hosted the party's top strategists and most ambitious candidates at his modest office, wedged among the casinos on the Strip. Throughout, he helped ensure that uncritical support of Israel became a pillar of the GOP platform, never more visibly demonstrated than when the Trump administration relocated the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018.\n\nThe inflammatory move had been adamantly opposed by Palestinians and was long a priority for Adelson, who had even offered to help pay for it, and for the Republican Jewish Coalition, of which he was the primary benefactor. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, were front and center at the ceremony in Jerusalem.\n\nSheldon's life was one of great consequence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement posted to Twitter. The world, Israel and the United States are safer because of his work.\n\nWhen asked at a gambling conference what he hoped his legacy would be, Adelson said it wasn't his glitzy casinos or hotels, it was his impact in Israel. He donated $25 million, a record sum for a private citizen, to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. He established a think tank in Jerusalem. He was closely aligned with the conservative Likud party and funded a widely read free daily newspaper called Israel Hayom, or Israel Today, so supportive of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that some Israelis nicknamed it Bibi-ton.\n\nIn the U.S., Adelson helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel, helped build a new headquarters for the lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and later was a top supporter of the Israeli-American Council, whose conferences have attracted top Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, and Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He sponsored Birthright trips to Israel for young Jewish adults that were criticized by some participants as intolerant of opposing views.\n\nHis attachment to Israel was life-long and so deep that he once said he wished his military service had been in an Israeli uniform instead of an American one.\n\nAdelson was a late bloomer in business and in politics. He didn't become a casino owner, or a Republican, until well into middle age. Through the 1990s and after his wealth soared and his engagement in politics intensified. He was a supporter of President George W. Bush and backed Republican Rudolph Giuliani for the 2008 presidential race before turning to the eventual candidate, Senator John McCain, who lost to Barack Obama.\n\nSheldon battled his way out of a tough Boston neighborhood to build a successful enterprise that loyally employed tens of thousands — and entertained millions, said Mr. Bush in a statement Tuesday. He was an American patriot and a strong supporter of Israel. Sheldon was a generous benefactor of charitable causes, especially medical research and Jewish heritage education. He will be missed by many — none more than his beloved family.\n\nAdelson's leverage grew considerably in 2010 after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision lifted many restrictions on individual campaign contributions. He and his wife spent more than $90 million on the 2012 election, funding presidential candidate Newt Gingrich and later Mitt Romney, who also lost to Mr. Obama.\n\nI'm against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections, he told Forbes magazine in 2012. But as long as it's doable I'm going to do it.\n\nAdelson came around slowly to Donald Trump, who during the 2016 campaign had said he would be neutral in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Trump even ridiculed his initial liking for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, tweeting in 2015, Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree! Adelson eventually endorsed Mr. Trump but remained hesitant through much of 2016. He gave more than $20 million in the final weeks of the campaign after reports that he would contribute $100 million and was more generous with congressional races.\n\nBut after Mr. Trump's surprise victory, the new president spoke often with Adelson and embraced his hardline views on the Middle East. He cut funding for Palestinian refugees and withdrew from the Obama administration's nuclear nonproliferation deal with Iran. He moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem even though earlier administrations — Democratic and Republican — avoided doing do because it directly challenged the Palestinian view that the ancient city should be part of any peace agreement.\n\nAdelson, in turn, aided Mr. Trump financially, including $5 million for his inauguration, and supported him through his media holdings. Late in 2015, Adelson secretly purchased the Las Vegas Review-Journal — the paper's own reporters revealed he was the new owner — and soon raised concerns he was imposing his own views. Some longtime staffers left in protest.\n\nIn what was widely seen as a mark of the Adelsons' influence with Mr. Trump, Miriam Adelson was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018.\n\nAdelson, who contributed more than $100 million to the 2018 off-year elections, held extraordinary power among Republicans even though he didn't always agree with them. In a 2012 interview with the Wall Street Journal, he called himself basically a social liberal, supporting abortion and immigrant rights. He cited taxes and differences over Israel as major reasons for leaving the Democratic Party.\n\nHis life made him a fearless advocate for freedom and entrepreneurship and a source of counsel and support to a generation of conservatives, including me, said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California.\n\nIn Nevada, his influence was such that even the state's most prominent Democrat, Senator Harry Reid, hesitated to take him on. In a 2014 interview with MSNBC, the then-Senate majority leader differentiated between Adelson and fellow GOP billionaire donors Charles and David Koch. Reid had sharply criticized the Koch brothers as callous and greedy, while saying that he respected Adelson because he was not in it to make money, a widely challenged opinion.\n\nHe had previously told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that he remained friends with Adelson despite their political differences.\n\nSheldon Adelson and I still meet and have conversations. He has a problem, I try to help him, Reid said.\n\nAdelson was married twice. He and his first wife, Sandra, were divorced in 1988. Three years later, he married Miriam Farbstein-Ochshorn, an Israeli-born doctor he met on a blind date and whom many believe helped deepen his involvement with Israel. Their honeymoon trip to Venice inspired Adelson to raze the historic Sands hotel-casino, once a favorite hangout for Frank Sinatra among others, and replace them with a pair of massive complexes: The Venetian and The Palazzo, one of the city's tallest buildings.\n\nSheldon Adelson adopted his first wife's three children and had two children with his second wife. Among numerous philanthropic projects, he and Miriam Adelson were especially committed to the research and treatment of substance abuse, a personal cause for Sheldon Adelson. His son Mitchell, from his first marriage, died of an overdose in 2005. (Sheldon Adelson would spend millions opposing state efforts to legalize marijuana).\n\nSheldon Garry Adelson was born in 1933, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. His father was a taxi driver, his mother the manager of a knitting store. A natural entrepreneur, he was selling newspapers by age 12 and running a vending machine business at 16. After dropping out of City College of New York and serving in the Army, he attempted to start dozens of businesses, from toiletries to de-icing windshields.\n\nAdelson, who said he disdained email, began to amass his fortune with a technology trade show, starting computer convention COMDEX in 1979 with partners before selling his stake in 1995 for more than $800 million.\n\nWhen he bought the Sands Hotel in 1989, he was thinking convention space, not just gambling, would make money. It did. He built a convention hall to keep his hotel rooms full on weekdays and others soon followed the business model. Meanwhile, his effort to replicate the Strip in Macao, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal, made his wealth grow exponentially.\n\nWhen faced with water and marshland, Adelson directed his company to build land where there wasn't any, piling sand up to create the Cotai Peninsula. Soon his Macao revenue outstripped that of his Las Vegas holdings. He later expanded his business to Singapore, where his Marina Bay Sands hotel and its infinity pool were featured in the hit film Crazy Rich Asians, and had been pressing to open a casino in Japan.\n\nHis Macao business also spawned a long-running wrongful termination lawsuit brought by a former chief of Sands China Ltd. who accused Adelson and the company of firing him for exposing a host of misdeeds. Adelson often clashed with attorneys while appearing on a Clark County courtroom's witness stand.\n\nThe Sands China lawsuit was among dozens involving Adelson, whose cases included his suing a Wall Street Journal reporter for calling him foul-mouthed (the parties settled, the words remained) to being sued by his sons from his first marriage for cheating them out of money (he won).\n\nA long-running feud with fellow casino tycoon Steve Wynn turned to friendship when Wynn joined Adelson's effort to end online gambling. Critics said Adelson was trying to stifle competition. Adelson countered that there was no way to ensure children and teenagers wouldn't gamble and said he was not in favor of it exploiting the world's most vulnerable people.\n\nMr. Trump's election would again prove useful to Adelson. During the Obama administration, the Justice Department said online gambling that does not involve sporting events would not violate the Wire Act, a 1961 federal statute. In a legal opinion that became public early in 2019, the department reversed itself and decided the statute applies to any form of gambling.
LOS ANGELES -- Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor announced Friday that they are separating after 17 years of marriage.\n\nStiller and Taylor released a joint statement Friday announcing their breakup. They were married in May 2000 and have two children, who they said will remain their priority.\n\nWith tremendous love and respect for each other, and the 18 years we spent together as a couple, we have made the decision to separate. Our priority will continue to be raising our children as devoted parents and the closest of friends, the actors wrote. We kindly ask that the media respect our privacy at this time.\n\nTaylor has appeared in several of Stiller's films, including Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, ''Tropic Thunder and Zoolander and its sequel.\n\nThe statement was first reported Friday by Entertainment Tonight.\n\nThe pair told Entertainment Tonight in February 2016 that it was the best working together during their then 15-year union.\n\nIt's the best. I mean, I think that, you know, the reality is there's such an unspoken connection, Taylor told ET. I feel like for us, when we first met, it was on set... He's amazing.\n\nTaylor said having a sense of humor is the greatest thing in their marriage.\n\nI say that's the secret to a happy marriage anywhere in any city, not just Hollywood, Stiller told ET. I think you got to laugh, because after a while, you know, life is life. We all have to deal with what life throws at us, so you got to have a sense of humor about it. If you can share that, at the end, it makes a huge difference.
Weddings tend to be expensive affairs, but here's one reason why costs can spiral out of control: Vendors sometimes jack up their prices and add hidden fees and unexpected costs.\n\nAbout one out of four vendors raise their prices when they learn the event is a wedding, rather than an anniversary party, according to Consumer Reports, which sent out secret shoppers in five metropolitan areas to gather prices. The publication collected information for 40 vendors in a dozen states, which it noted isn't enough to paint the entire wedding industry as prone to the practice but should raise red flags with brides, grooms and their families.\n\nConsumer Reports discovered that hidden fees, such as caterers' per-person cake-cutting fees, can be as high as $7 per person. And some hotels add service charges that can make costs add up quickly.\n\nThe bottom line, according to financial experts, is that consumers should be aware of these practices and take steps to protect themselves, such as shopping around, negotiating and thoroughly reading the fine print. After all, a lot of money is at stake, given that the average wedding costs about $31,000.\n\nIt's true: Often prices are inflated once the vendor finds out the event is a wedding, said Courtney Jesperson, a retail expert at the financial site NerdWallet. From the vendor perspective, they often say because a wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime occasion, brides and grooms tend to be extremely demanding, which requires more attention to detail and extra work when planning.\n\nShe added, As a consumer, however, this just doesn't seem fair. To avoid the extra expense, we advise staying away from pricey wedding packages and making selections, like flowers and food, on an individual basis.\n\nBeyond that, she said, don't be afraid to haggle or ask questions. Friends and family members who have tied the knot can be a great source of information about unexpected costs and fees that they encountered, which can help future brides and grooms avoid similar pitfalls.\n\nBefore meeting with caterers and other wedding vendors, couples should set a budget. One place to start is with an online wedding cost calculator. Some ideas for keeping costs low include picking a buffet meal instead of a served meal, holding your wedding on a Sunday and trimming down the guest list.\n\nIn the end, a wedding is just one day, so it's not something that's worth going into long-term debt over, Jesperson said. Another place to start is seeing how much money you have in savings already and create your budget based on that figure.\n\nSome families turn to loans to help pay for the wedding day, which NerdWallet advises against. Consumer Reports National Research Center found that about 11 percent of couples relied on loans to pay for their weddings, while 41 percent drew on their savings. About 9 percent of people younger than 50 said they withdrew money from a retirement account, which not only hurts a couple's retirement prospects but adds the pain of an early withdrawal penalty.\n\nIf you find that you don't have the funds to pay for your wedding, you should either reduce your costs by trimming your budget or postpone your wedding until you have enough money, Jesperson said. After all, if you take out a personal loan, you'll end up paying interest on it, and you don't want to start off your marriage in the hole.
Thanks to the internet, the views of movie critics nationwide are being forged into a single critical mass. Jim Axelrod shows us how it's done:\n\nIf the artwork in the lobby of this California tech company doesn't tip you off, take a walk down the hall, past the themed conference rooms, such as the Casablanca room.\n\nOr listen in to the discussion at the morning meeting. Our top movies are 'Black Panther' and … it's just 'Black Panther'! said Zoey.\n\nThe website ranks films according to critical and popular appeal. Beware of film ratings that go SPLAT! RottenTomatoes.com\n\nWelcome to the headquarters of Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nEven as the entertainment industry gathers tonight to see which of this year's films the Academy thought best, this company may be re-shaping the way we go to the movies -- and how we choose what we see.\n\nWithout a Rotten Tomatoes, I as an individual, I guess I'd have to go read a hundred reviews, said Paul Yanover, the president of Fandango -- the online ticket company that acquired Rotten Tomatoes two years ago.\n\nPerfect marriage here of a technology company and an entertainment company, he said.\n\nRotten Tomatoes VP Jeff Voris, and Fandango President Paul Yanover. CBS News\n\nMore than a third of moviegoers now make checking Rotten Tomatoes the last thing they do before buying a ticket. The site aggregates dozens of reviews curated from thousands of company-approved critics, and calculates the percentage that are positive.\n\nWe're democratizing that research, and then we are democratizing access to it through the internet, said Yanover.\n\nJeff Voris, a vice president at Rotten Tomatoes, explained: A curator will go find a review, put it in the system, and then read it to determine, is it 'fresh' or 'rotten'? If they're not sure, then our process is we send it to three other curators on the team who all read it independently.\n\nYanover added, If there's real uncertainty, we'll go to the source and say, 'You're not being clear. Are you recommending this movie, or are you not?'\n\nLupita Nyong'o, Chadwick Boseman and Danai Gurira in Black Panther. The superhero adventure currently has a Rotten Tomatoes score of 97%. Marvel Studios\n\nIf 75% or more of the critics post positive reviews (like 97% did with Black Panther), the movie is Certified Fresh.\n\nA score of 60 to 74 on the Tomatometer (like Beauty and the Beast, with 71%) only gets you a Fresh.\n\nWhat you are trying to avoid as a filmmaker is a number under 60. That gets a Rotten thrown at it.\n\nSplat! 50 Shades Freed was not well-reviewed. CBS News\n\n50 Shades Freed, for instance, had a Tomatometer score of 12!\n\nIt's Siskel and Ebert for the digital age.\n\nWhen asked how wigged out studios are by Rotten Tomatoes, Ethan Titleman, who works for the National Research Group (a polling firm that tracks industry trends), said, I think they're scared. It's still that shortcut.\n\nAnd you can agree or disagree with the reviewer, but really nothing beats seeing that score at the end to know, yeah, I wanna spend my money or I don't wanna spend my money on this movie.\n\nAnd that's exactly what spooks the studios: The idea their marketing machines may not be as able to overcome bad reviews in the age of Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBaywatch earned a Rotten Tomatoes score of 18%; it ranked 3 in theatres on opening weekend. And The Emoji Movie was number two its opening weekend, despite a Tomatometer score of 9%. Paramount/Sony\n\nRotten Tomatoes came on the scene, and it wasn't the voice of individual reviewers that mattered; it was a collective voice of Rotten Tomatoes, said Michael Lynton, the former CEO of Sony Entertainment. I do know people pay a lot of attention to it. And I do think it does have an effect on how a movie opens. And it certainly has an effect on what the legs of a picture are.\n\nPerhaps that's why director Martin Scorsese recently called Rotten Tomatoes hostile to serious filmmakers, in a column for the Hollywood Reporter:\n\nThey rate a picture the way you'd rate a horse at the racetrack, a restaurant in a Zagat's guide, or a household appliance in Consumer Reports. They have everything to do with the movie business and absolutely nothing to do with either the creation or the intelligent viewing of film. The filmmaker is reduced to a content manufacturer and the viewer to an unadventurous consumer.\n\nIt's a very oversimplified system -- fresh/rotten remarked Claudia Puig, president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, who sees more negative than positive with Rotten Tomatoes. And there's a lot more nuance in film criticism. There's a lot more nuance in people's appreciation of film. I wish that there were more categories -- that there was, you know, a slightly overcooked tomato, a slightly raw tomato!\n\nFilm critic Claudia Puig. CBS News\n\nEven with her issues with Rotten Tomatoes, Puig is still one of their top reviewers.\n\nIt seems there's no disputing the website's influence these days. Certainly, studios are thinking, 'How are we going to reach the largest amount of people? How are we going to make the most money?' said Puig.\n\nAnd to do that in this day and age, she said, You gotta get a good score on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nAxelrod asked Fandango's Paul Yanover, Do you dispute the notion that Rotten Tomatoes has now almost achieved make-or-break status for movies being released?\n\nI think that's too strong a statement, he replied. I don't think it's make-or-break.\n\nJeff Voris said, We don't think that at all. We believe that, if anything, we help shine a light often on films or TV shows that you might not know a lot about otherwise.\n\nIf you can't beat 'em, join 'em: Rotten Tomatoes scores a mention in a commercial for Wonder Woman. Warner Brothers/DC\n\nAxelrod said, I guess the school of thought there is, if you want to make a successful movie now, you've got to thread this Rotten Tomatoes needle. Do the moviemakers, the producers, the studios, do they have a point?\n\nYanover said, I look at it this way: Right now, there are nine Oscar-nominated movies [for Best Picture]. I believe every single one of them is Certified Fresh.\n\nThis year's Best Picture Oscar nominees, in order of Rotten Tomatoes' Certified Fresh ranking:\n\nGet Out 99%\n\nLady Bird 99%\n\nCall Me By Your Name 96%\n\nDunkirk 93%\n\nThe Shape of Water 92%\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 92%\n\nPhantom Thread 91%\n\nThe Post 88%\n\nDarkest Hour 86%\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Gabriel Falcon.
TOKYO -- Panasonic, the first major Japanese company to start recognizing same sex partnerships in its ranks, has gotten both praise and harshly negative responses to the new policy.\n\nI never felt this much how different a response can get by nation, Tetsuya Senmatsu, a human resources manager, told reporters Friday, while declining to specify the nations where the change was poorly received.\n\nThe policy was welcomed in the U.S. and Europe, he said.\n\nPanasonic Corp. has offices around the world, including the U.S., China, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nThe policy, which kicks off on April 1, recognizes same sex partnerships as the equivalent of marriage in Japan, where Panasonic Corp. is headquartered. Details of how the policy will be applied in each nation are still under consideration, he said.\n\nSenmatsu said the main reason for the policy is that the company opposes all forms of discrimination. The possibility that it might be a plus for recruiting talent was not what drove the decision, he said.\n\nThe new policy could help when an employee in a same sex partnership gets moved to another city or nation on assignment, according to Senmatsu.\n\nHe said the company does not know how many employees might be affected by the new policy.\n\nIn general, it's said that might be 7 percent of the population, he said.\n\nIn China, South Korea, the Philippines and much of the rest of Asia, coming out of the closet still has serious consequences, for individuals and also for family members who might become targets of abuse and ostracism. It's an act that takes courage in Asian cultures that value conformity, traditional family structures and harmony.\n\nPanasonic has handled media queries on the same-sex marriage policy in a low key way, declining interview requests. The media opportunity with Senmatsu, which covered general personnel policies, was the first since the new policy was disclosed.\n\nAmong other changes, the company also will start encouraging employees to take more time off work, both paid, and unpaid for longer periods, to pursue studies and other interests outside work.\n\nWe think our workers need to go outside the company and learn about the world, Senmatsu said.\n\nOsaka-based Panasonic has had job cuts in recent years, but, for decades after the original company's founding by humanitarian Konosuke Matsushita in 1918, it had stuck to the practice of lifetime employment once prevalent in Japanese corporate culture.\n\nJapanese companies tend to foster extreme loyalty; many workers keep long hours, sometimes dying from overwork; and salarymen tend to make their jobs the center of their lives.
Nearly half of the nation's top 100 jobs for 2021 are in health care, perhaps no surprise amid a worldwide pandemic that has been raging in the U.S. for almost a full year.\n\nForty-two of the 100 jobs included in U.S. News and World Report's annual Best Jobs list this year fall under health care or health care support roles, like physician, dentist, anesthesiologist and occupational therapist.\n\nOne thing the global pandemic has reinforced is the need and value of health care professionals, Antonio Barbera, consumer advice editor at U.S. News said in a statement. This year's rankings affirm that it is a good career sector for many, with typically high median salaries and low unemployment rates.\n\nHealth care jobs have also surged in recent years as baby boomers get older. Over the next 10 years, the baby boomer generation will enter the 65- to 85-year-old age range and that will put more demand on health care and health care roles, Barbera told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nPhysician assistant ranks No. 1\n\nFor the first time, physician assistant tops the list of the best jobs. The role typically requires a master's degree and involves diagnosing illnesses, implementing treatment plans and performing certain procedures.\n\nAmong the reasons to become a PA, who typically work alongside a licensed physician or surgeon: excellent pay and employment prospects. The median salary is more than $112,000, and the unemployment rate is below 1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The field is expected to grow and create more than 39,000 new jobs over 10 years. Physician assistants also report being highly satisfied in their jobs.\n\nRachel Schwartz, a 32-year-old PA in Denver, said she is highly involved in patient care and has the independence to perform bedside procedures and operate alongside physicians.\n\nAt the same time, I am able to live my life to the fullest by enjoying time with family and friends and partaking in all of my favorite recreational activities. It truly is the best of both worlds, Schwartz told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nU.S. News reviewed federal labor data to identify jobs with the greatest hiring demand and scored them based on a variety of measures including projected growth rate, median salary, employment rate, future job prospects, stress level and work-life balance.\n\nOther top health care jobs as ranked by U.S. News include nurse practitioner, which came in at No. 3, and medical and health services manager (No. 4).\n\nEarning more than $100k a year\n\nSixteen of the 25 best jobs paying more than $100,000 per year are also in health care. Orthodontist, anesthesiologist, and oral and maxillofacial surgeon ranked one, two and three by pay, with each boasting a median salary of around $208,000.\n\nNon-health care jobs that made the 100 Best Jobs list include software developer (No.2), statistician (No.6) and information security analyst (No.15). Jobs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics are hot given their ample salaries and relatively reasonable work-life balances.\n\nU.S. News and World Report also ranks jobs based on location and the level of education required. For example, home health aides, also a health care role, is the top post for a job seeker without a college degree. A high school degree is needed, and the median salary for the role is $25,280.\n\nFollowing are the top 20 jobs on U.S. News' list of the best jobs for 2021:\n\nPhysician assistant\n\nSoftware developer\n\nNurse practitioner\n\nMedical and health services manager\n\nPhysician\n\nStatistician\n\nSpeech-language pathologist\n\nData scientist\n\nDentist\n\nVeterinarian\n\nOrthodontist\n\nIT manager\n\nPhysical therapist assistant\n\nAnesthesiologist\n\nInformation security analyst\n\nSubstance abuse and behavioral disorder counselor\n\nFinancial manager\n\nOral and maxillofacial surgeon\n\nOccupational therapist\n\nMarriage and family therapist\n\nClick here for the full ranking.
ORLANDO, Fla. -- If jurors in a federal trial in Florida believe government prosecutors, the wife of the man who carried out one of the U.S.'s biggest mass shootings gave a green light to her husband when he wanted to execute his terrorist-inspired attack. But if they accept Noor Salman's attorney's account that she was a devoted mother with an IQ of 84 and was the victim of Omar Mateen's repeated lies throughout their marriage, they could decide she had no prior knowledge of the attack.\n\nThe 31-year-old Salman went on trial Wednesday in Orlando, after pleading not guilty in January to charges of aiding and abetting her husband in his attack on the Pulse nightclub in June of 2016. She's also charged with obstruction of justice. If convicted, she faces life in prison.\n\nProsecutors portrayed a woman who knew Mateen was buying rounds of ammunition for his AR-15, helped him spend thousands of dollars before the attack and knew about his plan when he left the house in the hours before the shooting. They also say she lied, tried to mislead FBI agents and had knowledge of her husband's sick fascination with violent jihadist videos and terrorism.\n\nNone of the victims that night knew the horrific events that would unfold. No one knew except for two people: Omar Mateen and his wife, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Mandolfo said. The defendant gave Omar Mateen the green light to commit terrorism on behalf of ISIS.\n\nIn his hourlong opening statement, Mandolfo gave several examples of Salman's conflicting statements to FBI agents in the hours after the attack. In one conversation with authorities, before they informed her of any details of the attack, she said, My husband is safe with guns.\n\nSaid Mandolfo: No one ever told her about guns.\n\nHe described a wife that knowingly went to at least two locations with Mateen to scout sites of potential terrorist attacks. One was City Place, an open-air shopping center in West Palm Beach. The other was Disney Springs, a crowded dining and shopping area near the famed theme parks, Mandolfo said.\n\nWhat would make people more upset, an attack at a club or an attack at Disney? Mateen asked his wife, according to Mandolfo.\n\nSalman also knew her husband was fascinated with violent jihadist videos, even pulling their 3-year-old away from the screen, Mandolfo said.\n\nThe statements she made to the FBI after the attack will be key to the trial.\n\nSalman's attorney, Linda Moreno, argued in opening statements that some of the claims are contradicted by cellphone records and other evidence.\n\nShe cooperated with the FBI completely, said Moreno, adding that her client never asked for a lawyer and consented to a home search. The FBI in their hourslong questioning manipulated and coerced her, Moreno asserts.\n\nNoor Salman denied any knowledge of Omar Mateen's plans for hours, she said, adding that agents told Salman that she could go to jail and not see her child.\n\nHer attorney said Mateen had a secret life that involved meeting women online and cheating on Salman. Moreno called Mateen misogynistic. According to court records, Mateen abused Salman, including when she was pregnant.\n\nThe only sin was that she married a monster, said Moreno, adding that the jury can honor the victims of the attack by seeking the truth of her client's actions.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul G. Byron said the trial could last three weeks or more, after taking several days to pick a jury of 12 with six alternates.\n\nMateen, who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, was killed by police in the hours after the shooting that killed 49. At the time of the attack, it was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. It was surpassed last October by the fatal shooting of 58 people in Las Vegas.\n\nSalman was arrested in 2017 in California, where she was staying with family, and has been jailed since then.
Drew Carey, the new host of The Price Is Right, got engaged to Nicole Jaracz, a recent graduate of culinary school, on Tuesday, said his spokeswoman, Christina Papadopoulos.\n\nIt will be the first marriage for both. No date for a wedding has been set yet, said Papadopoulos, adding that Carey and his bride-to-be are very happy and excited about their future together.\n\nNo further details were provided.\n\nIt wasn't until the 49-year-old comedian became the new face of The Price Is Right that he realized game shows were his true calling. Carey makes his Price debut on Monday.\n\nUnbeknownst to me, I was preparing myself to be a super game-show host of the 21st century, Carey says with a smile between tapings at CBS' Bob Barker Studio. I wouldn't be good at this if it wasn't for all that other stuff I did.\n\nHe started with standup and starred in The Drew Carey Show and Whose Line is it Anyway? before saying goodbye to TV in 2004. Carey was enjoying a semi-retired life of leisure when he was tapped to host a new CBS game show, Power of 10.\n\nCarey says he got kind of trashed when his sitcom ended so he was reticent to return to TV.\n\nIt kind of left me with a bad taste in my mouth, he says. He accepted the Power of 10 gig only because it was a smart show and I thought nobody could make fun of me if I did that.\n\n2 Then he was invited to take Barker's place on The Price Is Right. Carey immediately declined. Worst-case scenarios filled his mind.\n\nIf you think I'm going to sit at 'The Price Is Right' so everybody can take potshots at me, forget it, he remembers thinking.\n\nCBS called again a few weeks later and convinced Carey he was just who they were looking for. His friends and advisers told him to go for it. Suddenly the semi-retired comedian who spent his time reading and taking photography classes was coming back to television in a big way with daytime and prime-time game shows.\n\nCarey studied games from The Price Is Right such as Pick-a-Pair and Line 'em Up as he shuttled between Power of 10 tapings in New York and Price tapings in Los Angeles.\n\nPower of 10, in which contestants try to predict how most Americans respond to moral, social and political poll questions, is stimulating, Carey says. But it was Price that showed him he was a born game-show host.\n\nIt's like meeting the right girl, he says. This is a really good fit. I'm really comfortable here and it seems like I should have been doing this a long time ago.\n\nBarbara Bloom, senior vice president of daytime programs for CBS, says Carey is the perfect choice for the job.\n\nI can't wait for people to see how well Drew has taken to the show, she says. There's just something special about the way he's made the position his own in such a short time and has endeared himself to everyone, both in front of and behind the cameras.\n\nOther than its new host, nearly everything else on The Price Is Right is the same as it was during Barker's reign. The games are unchanged. The new, portable set looks almost exactly like the one it replaced.\n\nContestants still come on down wearing customized T-shirts, only now they honor the new host instead of the former. (One group wore matching tops that read Drew's Crew. Another had shirts bearing the blue eye-shadowed image of Mimi from The Drew Carey Show and the phrase Carey's Beauties.)\n\nWhile Barker typically took questions from the crowd during commercials, Carey switches it up, interviewing the audience to learn where they've come from and what they do for work. It's fascinating to me, says the self-described people watcher.\n\nBut Carey closes the show each day the same way Barker did: Have your pets spayed or neutered.\n\nIt's a tradition, he explains. It's been here all this time. I don't want to get rid of that.\n\nThe new host has added his own end-of-show touch, though. Once the cameras have stopped rolling, Carey urges the crowd to keep hoping for the best for others as they do when they cheer for their fellow audience members who end up as contestants on the show.\n\nIt's like my Zen of 'Price Is Right,' he says.\n\nThe 83-year-old Barker, who hosted The Price Is Right for 35 years and Truth or Consequences for 19 years before that, says he plans to tune in to see Carey's take on Price.\n\nOf course I'm going to watch. I'm curious just like everybody else, Barker says, adding, I hope he gets a huge rating.\n\nContestant LaShawn Warner, who won an assortment of sleds during a recent taping of the show, predicts Carey will be just as popular as Barker was.\n\nOnce people start watching it, they'll get into Drew like they were with Bob, she says. He's just so silly. He keeps it interesting and he keeps it fun.\n\nFans can't help but compare the only two hosts the venerable show has had, but Carey won't.\n\nYou can't replace Bob Barker, he says. I don't compare myself to anybody. ... It's only about what you're doing and supposed to do, and I feel like I'm supposed to be doing this.
Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, could face her father in the legal battle against a British tabloid that published parts of a private letter between her and her father, Thomas Markle. The Mail on Sunday, the paper that Meghan is suing, is planning to call her father as a key witness for the defense, its sister paper The Daily Mail reports.\n\nThe duchess sued the paper in October, claiming it illegally published a private letter she sent to her estranged father. The lawsuit accuses the tabloid and its parent company, Associated Newspapers, of misusing private information, infringement of copyright, and breach of a U.K. data protection act that went into force in 2018.\n\nIn an official statement announcing the lawsuit, Prince Harry said Meghan has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press, and noted that the lawsuit hinges on only one instance in a long and disturbing pattern of behavior by British tabloid media.\n\nNow, The Mail on Sunday has filed defense papers at the High Court in London that indicate Thomas Markle, 75, is prepared to give evidence against his daughter, The Daily Mail reports. Thomas Markle has provided lawyers for the paper with text messages he sent to the couple in the lead-up to their royal wedding in May 2018.\n\nThe BBC reports that Samantha Markle, Mr. Markle's daughter from his first marriage, said that if her father is called to testify, he will come to the United Kingdom.\n\nIn Prince Harry's statement, he claimed the paper strategically omitted certain paragraphs, sentences, and words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year. The paper responded to that claim, saying that the edited portions it released accurately conveyed the tone, content and meaning of the letter, the BBC reports.\n\nThe paper appears to be mounting the defense that Thomas Markle had a right to publish the letter. (He) had a weighty right to tell his version of what had happened between himself and his daughter, including the contents of the letter, the paper claims, according to The Associated Press.\n\nFurthermore, the paper argued that Meghan's actions show she was aware the letter would be seen publicly. In legal documents, the paper said the letter was immaculately copied in Meghan's elaborate handwriting, implying she anticipated it would be read by an audience, the BBC reports.\n\n(The Royal Family) rely on publicity about themselves and their lives in order to maintain the privileged positions they hold and promote themselves, according to the paper's legal filing, which also notes, There is a huge and legitimate public interest in the Royal Family and the activities, conduct and standards of behavior of its members.\n\nIt adds, This extends not merely to their public conduct, but to their personal and family relationships because those are integral to the proper functioning of the monarchy.\n\nMeghan is currently in Canada with her 8-month-old son Archie. She returned to Canada after the royal couple made the bombshell announcement that they will be stepping away from their senior royal roles and splitting their time between the U.K. and North America.
LONDON -- The head of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Bruce Curry, will speak at the wedding of Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle, says Kensington Palace. Curry, from New York, will give the address -- a sermon -- at the event in Windsor.\n\nCurry is the first African-American to have served as presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, an offshoot of the Church of England in the United States. It is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion.\n\nHe will join the dean of Windsor, the Rt. Rev. David Conner, and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who will officiate at the service. Welby baptized Markle ahead of her marriage to Harry, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, who is the supreme governor of the Church of England.\n\nPresiding Bishop Curry will join The Dean of Windsor, The Rt.

Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows #RoyalWedding — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 12, 2018\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury said in a tweet he is thrilled the couple asked Curry to preach at their wedding, calling him a brilliant pastor, stunning preacher and someone with a great gift for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ.\n\nI'm thrilled that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have asked Bishop Michael Curry to preach at their wedding. @PB_Curry is a brilliant pastor, stunning preacher and someone with a great gift for sharing the good news of Jesus Christ. — Archbishop of Canterbury (@JustinWelby) May 12, 2018\n\nThe royal wedding will be held on May 19, and the fabled Household Cavalry, Prince Harry's fellow soldiers, will be part of the big day, CBS News' Charlie D'Agata reported this week. The regiment is an elite fighting force, serving on the front lines of Iraq and Afghanistan, where Harry served two tours.\n\nTo be part of that for anyone's wedding, anyone's special day, is an incredible moment or event, said Maj. Daniel Snoxell, a Household Cavalry soldier. For it to be Mr. Wales, an officer I served with, that adds an extra factor.\n\nEpiscopal Church Presiding Bishop-elect Michael Curry gives waves to the crowd as he arrives at the Washington National Cathedral, Sunday, Nov. 1, 2015, in Washington.

By Abby Hayes/Credit.com\n\nFor years, the standard financial advice for couples was to combine their finances. All income, debts and expenditures belong to both parties, so why not put them together?\n\nCombining finances makes sense for many reasons, but not everyone wants to take this direction. If you're preparing to tie the knot, you might wonder which option is best for you. We've collected the pros and cons of combining your finances and keeping them separate so you can decide which method will work for you.\n\nThe Pros of Combining Your Finances\n\nCombining your finances can be tricky, especially if both parties have their own debts, accounts and assets coming into the marriage. But it might be worth it for the following reasons:\n\nWomen May Have Greater Security\n\nOther research shows that women have greater security when they combine finances with their spouses. That might seem counterintuitive, but remember, women are typically more prone to income interruptions, as they may take time off to start families.\n\nIt Keeps Things Simple\n\nSplitting finances may work for some couples, but it can also lead to complicated conversations. Who pays which bills? Should you split evenly when there's income disparity? Who should pick up the check on date night? If all the money is going into and coming out of the same pot, it may help simplify things.\n\nIt Allows for More Flexibility\n\nWhen you can rely on your spouse to foot the bill while you take parental leave, go back to school or start a new business, you may be more likely to take certain career risks. And in the long run, those risks can be good for the couple if they pan out. If, on the other hand, you have to keep paying your share of the bills, you might be less likely to take the leap.\n\nIt Creates Shared Goals\n\nWhen all the money comes from the same place, the couple needs to communicate. That can be a good thing, as couples can thrive on having common financial goals to work toward.\n\nThe Cons of Combining Your Finances\n\nCombining finances may not be the solution for everyone. This strategy also has some potential downsides:\n\nMaking Debt a Bigger Issue\n\nIf one partner comes into the marriage with big financial problems — including hefty debt or terrible credit — that can turn the relationship sour. In these instances, it can sometimes be better to separate accounts while the indebted spouse works on their finances. (You can keep tabs on your finances by viewing two of your credit scores for free on Credit.com.)\n\nYou Can Feel Constrained\n\nAs an adult, it's natural to want to spend your money however you see fit. After all, you earned it. When all the money is combined, you may not get to spend on those personal things you have in mind, especially if your spouse has a say in your spending.\n\nIt Can Cause Arguments\n\nWhat if each spouse has a different idea of what financial responsibility looks like? Maybe one spouse prefers to pay down the mortgage, while the other thinks it's wise to invest. Or maybe one spouse is frugal, while the other's a spendthrift. In this case, combining finances requires take serious communication and the ability to compromise.\n\nThe Pros of Keeping Things Separate\n\nThere are plenty of ways to keep your finances separate. Some partners split expenses down the middle while others split them according to who earns more money. Some partners maintain a joint account for overarching expenses like housing but hold separate accounts for everything else. Regardless of how you do it, keeping separate finances can be good for a few reasons:\n\nKeeping Spouses From One Another's Messes\n\nIf you're going into marriage with a lot of student loan debt or an otherwise complex financial situation, you may want to keep your money — and money problems — to yourself. This can make your spouse more comfortable and shield them from disaster in an emergency.\n\nGiving Both Spouses More Autonomy\n\nPerhaps the main reason couples decide not to combine finances is because they like having autonomy. Having control over your own money may cut down on fights and allow each spouse to meet their own financial goals.\n\nThe Cons of Keeping Things Separate\n\nHere are a few reasons to avoid this option:\n\nIt Can Devalue a Spouse\n\nSplitting household expenses by income may seem like a good idea, but it can make each spouse feel their value in the marriage is tied to their salary. However, splitting things 50-50 can make things stressful for the spouse who earns less.\n\nIt May Diminish Risk-Taking Ability\n\nAs we noted above, one of the advantages of a joint financial approach is that it allows for risk taking. When you have your spouse's income to fall back on, you can go start a business or have a baby. The opposite may be true of couples who split their finances, unless the couple works out a system to allow for such ventures.\n\nFor many couples, the best approach to will be somewhere in between. My husband and I, for instance, combine most of our finances. But we each maintain a separate checking account for fun money. We can transfer a predetermined amount of money out of the joint checking account each month and spend that money however we wish. This helps us have a bit more autonomy, but ensures we're still on the same page about our finances.\n\nWhichever approach you choose, keep evaluating what works and what doesn't. And don't be afraid to discuss your feelings and change your approach if things aren't working.
Kevin Hart and his wife Eniko Parrish announced that they're expecting their first child together.\n\nOn Mother's Day, Hart took to Instagram to break the happy news.\n\nCelebrating Mother's Day with my beautiful wife, he wrote.

P.S. It's a boy, straight chillin' already.\n\nHart and Parrish married in August. Hart has two kids from a previous marriage to Torrei Hart -- daughter Heaven, 12, and son Hendrix, 9.\n\nIn September, Hart talked about the possibility of being a new dad again and told ET, Me and my wife are in an amazing place, he shared. We're still newlyweds, we're still fresh in this marriage so we're enjoying the new steps in marriage.\n\nIt's about having the patience to deal with another kid, the comedian added. See, my kids are old enough where I can say, 'Go do something,' and they go do something. I gotta make sure I have the patience to follow a baby.
Just as Hungary sits in the middle of Europe, so too, does it reside at the gravitational center of the right-wing populist movement: a worldwide shift impacting countries from Poland to the Philippines. By today's definition, populism unlocks national pride and nostalgia while taking a hardline stance on immigration. But what does it look like on the ground? We went to Hungary to see populism in practice, examining a specific government program, designed to stimulate birthrate in the face of a sharply declining population. The Hungarian government has taken over most private fertility clinics, offering free treatments, and also gives away cash, loans and even, get this, subsidies to buy minivans to young couples who become new parents. It's an effort to, keep Hungary Hungarian, as the slogan goes. But peel back the layers and it reveals something else entirely: social engineering designed to yield only a certain kind of Hungarian baby.\n\nIt's an almost relentlessly pleasant Saturday outside of Budapest. The Skanzen Park has been transformed into a festival of good, clean all-ages fun, balloons and comic books and piggy-backs. It's the annual celebration sponsored by Hungary's Association of Large Families and for the first time there is a mass wedding, five couples embarking on marriage in front of hundreds of their closest friends.\n\nKatalin Novak, Hungary's Minister of State for Family and Youth Affairs is on-hand as well, spreading the government's message of clan and country.\n\nIt is good to share their joy, Novak said. Which is why the government protects the marriage of man and woman, and why we protect the families and children in Hungary.\n\nShe spearheads what is termed the Family Protection Action Plan. This sweeping government program was unveiled last year at a cost of $2.5 billion, that's 5% of Hungary's GDP and four times what the country spends on military. The plan offers couples who have three kids a subsidy to get one of those minivans.\n\nI mean, the car sounds nice, Zoltan Benko, one of the grooms from the day's mass wedding, said. But two, three kids. I-- I mean-- I mean, I think that's-- that's all we can handle right now. I mean, even in imaginary terms.\n\nIt's not just minivans they're offering. Almost like a prize list at an arcade. The mere promise to have one child gets you a $30,000 loan. Rates are slashed after two kids and forgiven after three. Commit to having four kids or more? Mom doesn't have to pay income tax for life.\n\nTerms and conditions apply and the plan isn't open to everyone. But it does address a huge problem that the country faces: A low birth rate and the hemorrhaging of people. Hungary's population, now under 10 million, has declined for 37 straight years.\n\nIt's a curious place, Hungary, a mix of Eastern and Western Europe. Its capital, Budapest is a regal city, divided by the Danube, Buda on one side and Pest on the other. It trades on its classic grandeur and nods to the past. Budapest has long been a city of sensual pleasures and its thermal baths, taking the waters, as it's called, has adjusted for the times. The place has a language and cuisine like no other. And for centuries, Hungary has been a sort of territorial football, passed around among Turks and Germans, Hapsburgs and Communists. After World War II, Hungary was part of the Soviet bloc.\n\nIn 1989 Hungary set off a chain of events that brought down the Berlin wall.\n\nIn May, Hungary began cutting down the barbed wire, becoming the first East Bloc country with an open border, CBS News' Anthony Mason reported at the time.\n\nHungary might have been the first country to puncture the Iron Curtain, but 30 years later, it is at the vanguard of the European right.\n\nSo much so that Hungarians we asked, struggled to characterize the country's current form of government.\n\nAnna Donath\n\nAnna Donath is a Hungarian member of the European Parliament and a leader of the Momentum Party, a political upstart which opposes the government that's now been in power for ten years.\n\nDo you not feel you're living in a democracy right now? correspondent Jon Wertheim asked Donath.\n\nWell, it's a tricky question, because by law and regulation, it's a democratic country, Donath said. It would be too easy to say that-- that it's a dictatorship. It's not. It's clearly not. We can say that it's an autocratic regime, but autocracy is a scale.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban certainly doesn't see himself as an autocrat. He popularized a term to describe his regime, illiberal democracy. You heard that right: illiberal democracy. It's a system governed by a forceful ruler with a public that won't or can't fall out of step.\n\nEditor's Note: The Hungarian government is currently seeking to extend, indefinitely, a state of emergency imposed across the country due to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report from Reuters. Legislation submitted March 20, 2020, would send people to prison for up to five years for spreading false information or hindering measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus. The proposal would give virtually unlimited powers to the government with no clear end date, think tank Political Capital said.\n\nThe European Union has deep concerns about Hungary's membership. It recently voted to sanction the country, accusing Orban of systematically rolling back democracy and it has leveled charges that read like a sort of strongman's playbook: redrawing voting districts, rewriting the constitution, restricting freedom of speech and stacking the courts.\n\nOrban's policies, though, have been delivered not as brutally forceful blows, but as well-placed jabs: gradual, subtle, and, arguably, above the belt. Orban and his manipulative maneuvers provoke outrage among opponents but also draw a measure of grudging respect.\n\nHe's a genius in one hand, Donath said when asked how she would describe Orban. He's a political strategist.\n\nYou take serious his power? Wertheim asked Donath.\n\nWell, actually, you can feel it in your skin in everyday life in Hungary, you feel that—his power, Donath said. There is a higher power, a big brother, watching you everywhere, listening what you are saying.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban\n\nOrban's creeping control is presented as reasonable public policy. On the face of it, the Family Protection Plan does make it easier for families to have kids.\n\nBut it doesn't take much to shade into something darker. Just listen to the speaker of Hungary's Parliament at a conference last September: In Europe, those who propagate that having children is a private matter, are serving the culture of death, he said. Countries with declining population are becoming houses of coffins and not cradles.\n\nThat sounds very dystopian, Wertheim said to Donath. Very dramatic.\n\nYou're right. And it's absolutely horrifying, Donath said. And me, as a young woman who just got married and wants to start a family, I'm sorry, but I don't want to accept that my prime minister, my government, the state wants to tell me what kind of family and how I should start with. And they are actually blaming me that I'm 32 and I don't have a kid yet.\n\nDo you feel that? Wertheim asked.\n\nAnd they said that I'm supporting the culture of death, whatever it means, Donath said. Actually, this makes us really, really angry.\n\nAnd she highlights a glaring irony in all this. The same government that strenuously tries to boost population, also goes to extraordinary lengths to keep non-Hungarians out. In 2015, hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants, most from the Middle East, passed through Hungary. They were told they were not welcome to stay.\n\nWe must state that we do not want to be diverse and do not want to be mixed, Orban said in a speech last year. We do not want our color, traditions and national culture to be mixed with those of others. We do not want to be a diverse country.\n\nPeter Kreko, a social psychologist, is head of the Political Capital Institute, a Budapest think tank. He said that though Hungary is overwhelmingly white, Orban paints migrants as the enemy, a threat to Hungary's homogeneity.\n\nStories being that refugees and migrants are all around, Kreko said. They are stabbing the people. They are raping the women. They are killing everyone. There is no rule of law.\n\nHow does this new family protection plan, Wertheim asked Kreko, how does that fit into Orbán's overall strategy?\n\nHow does it fit in one sentence? 'We don't want migrants. We want-- want Hungarian mothers to give birth to more children,' Kreko said. This is how we want to solve the demographic crisis.\n\nPeter Kreko\n\nFor Prime Minister Orban it reduces to a simple concept: procreation, not immigration. He did what President Trump promised to do. In 2015, Orban slammed Hungary's gates shut, building, essentially, a border wall, a $500 million fence 180 miles long on the southern border with Serbia.\n\nLaszlo Toroczkai, the mayor of the small border town of Ásotthalom, was one of the loudest voices urging the Hungarian government to erect the fence. When he got his wish, he became something of a populist, cult hero.\n\nThis is about preserving, we keep hearing, 'European values,' Wertheim said to Toroczkai. What does that mean?\n\nFor me, the-- the European culture, the-- the European values are the classical music. Mozart. Beethoven. Tchaikovsky, Toroczkai said.\n\nIt goes beyond pleasures of the ear, though. He also objects to mixing tastes.\n\nThe foods, the European foods, Toroczkai said. For example, the doner, kebab, in Berlin, Budapest. I would like to eat the Doner Kebab in Istanbul.\n\nWe're spending a half a billion dollars on a fence to keep out Doner Kebabs? Wertheim asked.\n\nYou know-- we need this border fence to preserve our-- our safe country, Toroczkai said.\n\nIn the same town, we found Sandor Nagy, who's part of the mayor's posse, patrolling for migrants. You might think he would be precisely the kind of person to benefit from the Family Protection Plan. After all, he and his wife moved from Budapest to raise their eight children in this pastoral paradise. But he's excluded, not enough savings to qualify.\n\nThis really helps families if they have enough capital and their own money, Nagy says but I think there are many families in the country who do not have their own basic capital and the plan cannot help them.\n\nAnd they are not alone. Other Hungarians have found themselves ineligible because they are gay, unmarried, divorced. Read the fine print, and this becomes clear: The Family Protection Plan only seeks to protect what the government sees as the right kinds of families. Prime Minister Orban seldom speaks to western media, but we did speak with Secretary of State Katalin Novak, who says the plan is entirely consistent with Hungarian values.\n\nWe speak about not only preserving Western civilization, we also, to say it openly, that Christian culture we would like to preserve, Novak said.\n\nChristian culture? Wertheim asked.\n\nYeah, that's the way of life in Europe, in Hungary, that we have a Christian way of life, Novak said.\n\nWhen you hear your colleagues in government, including the prime minister, talk about ethnic homogeneity and the dangers of-- of mixing blood and purity, Wertheim said, can you see how people perhaps don't hear echoes of some of Europe's darker chapters in those remarks?\n\nIt makes me upset, because I think it means that people who-- who-- who have this interpretation either don't really know what they are talking about, or don't know Hungary, Novak said.\n\nYou're saying, there's no code in that, Wertheim said. There's no code when we talk about 'keep Hungary Hungarian' or pure Hungarians, or we talk in terms of purity. There's no--\n\nBut again, you say pure Hungarian. Why? What-- we don't say that, Novak said. We say, 'Keep Hungary Hungarian,' that's true. We say that.\n\nWhile more than 100,000 couples have already taken advantage of the incentives, it's too early to tell whether the Family Protection Plan will actually be effective, whether it will cause the desired population bounce or deepen a rift in Hungary, much like the Danube cleaves Budapest.\n\nProduced by Michael H.

Don't mess with Mel B! Simon Cowell learned that the hard way on America's Got Talent after he made fun of the singer's failed marriage.\n\nCowell was giving feedback after an escape artist's act was ruined by technical difficulties. He said, I kind of imagine this would be like Mel B's wedding night. A lot of anticipation, not much promise or delivery.\n\nQuickly, Mel B got up and threw a cup of water at Cowell's face before storming off the stage. She returned to her judge's chair for the next performance.\n\nThe subject is a touchy one, as Mel B filed for divorce from her husband Stephen Belafonte in March and alleged that he abused her.\n\nHe should know, if you say something inappropriate he's gonna get, like, stuff thrown at him, Mel B said to ET. In a friendly way. I made sure there was no ice in it this time … just fizzy water.\n\nCowell apparently took it in good stride.\n\nI told him he was an a**hole and that was it, and he goes, 'Oh, whatever,' Mel B told ET.\n\nThis is not the first time Mel B has thrown water at Cowell on the show. During the audition rounds, Cowell joked that she was able to get famous without knowing how to dance, prompting her to throw her water at him.\n\nHost Tyra Banks alluded to the incident on Twitter and said, So much went wrong but that's what makes live TV so cray!
Snowdonia in the United Kingdom looks as majestic as its name sounds, a Welsh landscape of jagged peaks and cascading waterfalls where visitors are first greeted by curious sheep. It's also where, on the second floor of a former church inside a small workshop, a man and his apprentice make music.\n\nSixty-year-old Pete Howlett is not a professional musician, but the ukuleles he handcrafts have put him on the map -- 8,000 miles away -- in Hawaii. The volcanic islands are the birthplace of the ukulele. Adapted from an old Portuguese design, ukuleles have been Hawaii's signature musical instrument since the late 19th century.\n\nIn the Pacific state, Howlett's ukulele is considered one of the best.\n\nUkulele craftsman Pete Howlett CBS News\n\nWhat goes on in your mind when you think about your name and your instrument showing up halfway around the world? CBS News' Jonathan Vigliotti asked Howlett.\n\nWell, he said, laughing, I just think it's bizarre.\n\nBizarre maybe, but when you look at his finished product you'll understand why.\n\nThere is something about making a ukulele that you've either got it or you haven't, Howlett said. You've either got the mojo to do it or you haven't.\n\nHowlett's mojo begins in the wood room, a treasure chest of rare species from around the world. This wood will be molded, chiseled, sanded and polished to perfection. Each piece fetches up to $3,000.\n\nBut 30 years ago, Howlett struggled to make ends meet.\n\nI ran a furniture-making design business for eight years, sold insurance for five years. ... It wasn't until 1994 when I lost a business and a local guitar maker said, 'Come and have some therapy, make yourself a guitar,' Howlett said.\n\nThat guitar would later catch the eye of a Hawaiian ukulele dealer.\n\nHe said, 'Can you make a ukulele?' And I said, 'Well, I've never seen one,' Howlett recounted.\n\nBut Howlett was a quick study and soon outpaced Hawaiians.\n\nHad you ever been to Hawaii prior to making ukuleles? Vigliotti asked.\n\nNo. I've never been, Howlett said.\n\nIt was performances like Smells Like Teen Spirit by the emerging Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain that would increase popular demand for ukuleles and make Howlett a name beyond the islands.\n\nSuddenly people thought, 'I could do that,' and there was ukulele groups popping up all over the place, Howlett said.\n\nAnd you have Nirvana to thank for this? Vigliotti asked.\n\nYeah! I have a bunch of old farts playing 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' he said.\n\nHowlett has made 725 ukeleles so far and had the goal of 1,000 by the time he's 70. But in December a shaky hand and a visit to the doctor changed everything.\n\nI went to see a specialist who in five minutes diagnosed me with Parkinson's, he shared.\n\nHowlett was told the neurological disease would eventually rob his hands of their craft.\n\nThere's two ways of approaching it, isn't it? You ought to give in to it and then just become a miserable old man, or you say, 'OK, so this is an opportunity for me to do something completely new,' Howlett said.\n\nHowlett and his apprentice, Tommy CBS News\n\nThat's where Howlett's young apprentice steps in. Two years ago, Tommy came to the workshop from Germany to intern with the master craftsman.\n\nWhen was the moment that you knew Tommy was the one? Vigliotti asked.\n\nThe day I cried when he left after his internship, Howlett said.\n\nAfter Howlett was diagnosed, he asked Tommy to come back and help him with his race against time. Tommy's hands will not only help Howlett reach 1,000, but they will also eventually inherit the business.\n\nI am really happy to be here, the chance he gave to me and gives me at the moment, Tommy said.\n\nIs finding someone to carry on your legacy like a marriage? Vigliotti asked.\n\nYes, it is, Howlett said.\n\nWhen Howlett does finally hand over his tools, you'll still find a piece of him in each of his ukuleles -- a silhouette of Snowdonia's tallest peak adorns every single headstock. Howlett and his music play on.\n\nMaking his 1,000 ukuleles and teaching others how to do so is his way of taking control of Parkinson's, he said.\n\nWhen I can't do it, I will be able to show people how to do it, and that way I've won. I've really won, Howlett said.
As the crowds cheered, American-born Meghan Markle arrived at St. George's Chapel.\n\nIn the car with the bride were her best friend's 7-year old twin sons.\n\nAnd then the moment millions had been waiting for…the wedding dress revealed.\n\nAnd it didn't disappoint. Meghan Markle chose a classic silk dress with an open bateau neckline and three-quarter sleeves by British designer Clare Waight Keller. Keller is the first female artistic director of French fashion house Givenchy.\n\nI was completely blown away by the dress and it was nothing like I was expecting. I was expecting beads, small pearls exuberance, says fashion expert Tim Gunn. This was a sculptural masterpiece. I have chills just talking about it …An instant icon.\n\nThe 16-foot veil, also designed by Keller, featured the distinctive flora of each of the British Commonwealth countries.\n\nIt was embroidered by hand…hundreds of hours of hand work was done on this veil, fashion designer Reem Acra explains.\n\nThe soon-to-be royal was wearing a sparking tiara borrowed from the Queen's collection.\n\nShe was wearing Queen Mary's tiara and it's an intricate bandeau and it sort of bends in the middle with a broach in the center, says Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine.\n\nAll of Britain was wowed. Americans were just as dazzled.\n\nWhen you see Harry's face, when he looks at her he looks at her with love and affection. And this dress symbolizes the whole look…this affection, this simplicity, the purity of love between them, says Acra.\n\nToday, Meghan Markle has redefined what a princess could be, says Gunn.\n\nAnd then as the orchestra played and soloist Elin Manahan Thomas's voice soared through the chapel. In a break with tradition, Meghan Markle began the walk down the aisle alone.\n\nTrailing the bride was the bridal party. Meghan chose not to have a maid of honor in order not to have to choose amongst her friends.\n\nIn keeping with a typical British wedding, the bridal party was made up of children under the age of 11. Harry's nephew Prince George was a pageboy and Princess Charlotte a mini-bridesmaid. Their new baby brother, Prince Louis, remained at home.\n\nPrince Charles, stepping in for her father, met Meghan at the choir to accompany her to the altar.\n\nI love the moment when Charles took her up the aisle. It was the Windsors validating Meghan, says Tina Brown, author of The Diana Chronicles and The Vanity Fair Diaries.\n\nLooking on were the small number of celebrities invited; Sir Elton John, Serena Williams, the Beckhams, Oprah Winfrey, George and Amal Clooney and members from the cast of Suits.\n\nThere were no heads of state in attendance and the few royals invited were mostly from Prince Harry's family.\n\nBy royal standards, is a scaled down wedding … that's what Harry and Meghan wanted, Seward explains.\n\nCompared to Westminster Abbey where Prince William and Kate Middleton were married in 2011 in front of more than 1,000, St. George's Chapel is smaller -- more intimate. There were only 600 invited chapel guests.\n\nSt. George's Chapel is an extremely fine piece of architecture, says architectural historian Dr. Jonathan Foyle.\n\nThis chapel—a Gothic masterpiece—is a special place for Prince Harry and the royal family and it's steeped in history and sentiment.\n\nTen kings are laid to rest in there, which is remarkable, Foyle explains. Henry VIII -- he's buried under a plain slab in there … And the queen intends to be laid to rest here as well.\n\nBut the chapel has been the site of joyful celebrations as well. In 2005, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles had their blessing ceremony here after their civil union…and Prince Harry was baptized here in 1984.\n\nAnd it probably means something very personal to him that, you know, he began the sacraments in this building, says Foyle.\n\nAnd now, Prince Harry is about to undertake the sacrament of matrimony to Meghan Markle … a commoner with nothing common about her.\n\nALWAYS A PRINCESS\n\nI never thought someone I knew would be a future princess, said Jax Tranchida, a sorority sister of Meghan Markle's at Northwestern University. But if it was gonna be anybody, yeah, it makes sense that it was Meg. …She's beautiful. …She's warm …She's welcoming … I wasn't surprised.\n\nShe was always a princess. Meghan was always a princess, said Suits director Kevin Bray.\n\nMeghan Markle was born and raised in the kingdom of Los Angeles -- royalty only in her child's imagination. Home video shows the 8-year-old pretending to be a queen, wearing a crown and being addressed as Your Royal Highness by her friends.\n\nMarkle's mother, Doria Ragland, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Her father, Thomas Markle, was an Emmy Award winning lighting director. Although her parents split when she was just 2, the family remained close knit at that time.\n\nShe never heard her father or her mother say an unkind thing about the other, said Vanity Fair's Sam Kashner, who wrote the first major profile of Markle for the cover of the magazine.\n\nMarkle's father remained a steady presence in her life while she was growing up. She has joked that she was practically raised on the set of the irreverent sitcom Married with Children, where her father worked for a decade.\n\nUm, which is a really odd place for a little girl to grow up, let me tell you, Meghan told an audience of AOL's BUILD Series in 2016.\n\nBUDDING ACTIVIST\n\nBut it was not all levity and film sets. Her parents were aware that as a biracial child, Markle might face challenges. So they made her feel special instead of different.\n\nShe told a very touching story ... being in seventh grade and having to fill in a box, Kashner told CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King. Caucasian. Black. Hispanic…\n\nShe didn't know what to check or she didn't want to check, said King.\n\nWell to check 'Black' meant she was kind of insulting her father, Kashner explained. And to\n\ncheck 'Caucasian' would be a kind of renunciation of her mother and her mother's family.\n\nMarkle's mother is a descendant of slaves.\n\nAnd she put down her pencil and she didn't do it, Kashner continued. Her father said a wonderful thing to her, which I think kind of helped to define her over the rest of her life, he said, 'Well … you make your own box.' That she is who she is and that you are not defined by your race.\n\nKashner said Markle developed a keen sense of social justice at a young age thanks to her mother who would often bring her to feed the homeless on skid row. She's always been aware of suffering in the world.\n\nBut the cause that would most shape the future royal were women's equality issues.\n\nWhen 12-year-old Markle was a sixth grader at Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse, she was struck by a commercial she saw in class.\n\nAnd a commercial came up for Ivory dishwashing soap, said Linda Ellerbee , then-executive producer and anchor of Nick News.\n\nProctor and Gamble commercial: The gloves are coming off—women are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory clear.\n\nAnd this child, this 12-year-old child looked at that and thought to herself, 'That's wrong, said Ellerbee.\n\nIt's always 'mom does this and mom does that,' said 12-year-old Meghan.\n\nAt age 12, Meghan Markle was already working to change the world Coleman-Rayner\n\nYoung Meghan wrote to Ellerbee. And in her letter she said after that commercial, the little boys in my class began to tease the girls and say 'See that's all you're good for. That's what girls do. Girls do dishes.'\n\nThey knew it was gonna hurt my feelings, the then-12-year-old said.\n\nEllerbee profiled young Meghan Markle on her show.\n\nEncouraged by her father, Meghan had also written a letter to Proctor and Gamble.\n\nSo I was wondering if you'd be able to change your commercial to 'people all over America.' Thank you, Meghan Markle, she read aloud on Nick News.\n\nProctor and Gamble later changed the commercial and an activist was born.\n\nAnd you can really make a difference for not just yourself but lots of other people, Meghan said on Nick News.\n\nI knew after that story that this little girl wasn't going to change. That she was going to change her world, said Ellerbee.\n\nBut as Markle sat in front of Buckingham Palace on a trip, she never knew what opportunities her future would hold.\n\nTHE IT FACTOR\n\nHer heart is so big and so wide and so genuine … And she's also very savvy about how the world works, said Maria Pollia, one of Meghan's teachers at Immaculate Heart High School in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd I think she loved to rise to challenges, added fellow teacher Christine Knudsen.\n\nMarkle was a top student, but it was also clear that she had the acting bug.\n\nWe all knew she wanted to be an actress … She was in all the plays and in all the musicals, Knudsen recalled. And you knew also that she had the gift. … 'She's got it. She's got it.'\n\nMarkle chose prestigious Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, because of its fine theater program.\n\nShe was the rush chair the year that I rushed, said Tranchida. But as the rush chair she's the one who … welcomes you to Kappa. And she opened the door … it's like a ray of light shining from above.\n\nAnd I just always remember saying that she, like, looked like a princess (laughs) I don't know how else to describe it, says sorority sister Erica Bethe Levin. She just radiates this, like, ridiculous aura.\n\nSorority sister Payal Adhikari added, She was very beautiful, but she also seemed really genuine … it never seemed like she was acting the role that she was. It was just who she was.\n\nIn 2003 Markle graduated college -- the first in her family to do so -- and moved back to L.A. The next year she started dating film producer Trevor Engelson.\n\nJust two years later, she landed a gig as a briefcase girl in the NBC game show Deal or No Deal. Finding good acting roles proved difficult.\n\nShe was kind of horrified to read these scripts that she was being sent, Kashner told King. These parts … they didn't even have names, it was, you know, pretty girl number one.\n\nShe played the hot girl in the 2005 Ashton Kutcher movie A Lot Like Love.\n\nIt was such a short part, but we were so excited, 'cause that was, like, a big deal, says sorority sister Liz Kores Graham.\n\nThe roles eventually got better, but Markle felt her ethnic ambiguity may have made things more challenging in a label-driven town.\n\nA BIG BREAK\n\nBut in 2011, the legal drama Suits changed everything. Meghan auditioned for the part of Rachel Zane, a paralegal-turned-lawyer that had no assigned ethnicity.\n\nI think the qualities that we were looking for in Rachel Zane were—intellect, beauty, humor, approachability, said Bray. Meghan was the right person for the job.\n\nThat same year, Markle married Trevor Engelson in Jamaica, but the marriage crumbled after less than two years. She continued living in Toronto where the TV series is filmed.\n\nShe was a lovely, lovely actress. She really kept me on my P's and Q's, says Suits actor Wendell Pierce, who joined the cast in the second season. His role would shock some viewers.\n\nIt was a bit of a surprise when they brought you in as her father, wasn't it? King noted.\n\nFor some people, I guess, Pierce replied.\n\n…because I thought they didn't know exactly what her ethnicity was. And then you show up and you're the black father! said King.\n\nRight …that was the reveal.\n\nMarkle was disappointed by some of the racist reactions on social media, but wasn't surprised -- she had dealt with the issue all of her life as she shared in a public service announcement:\n\nMeghan Markle Characters Unite PSA: I'm biracial … Some of the slurs I've heard or really offensive jokes or names -- just hit me in a really strong way. …I'm proud of both sides.\n\nMeghan Markle, always an activist and now a rising actress, recognized that she now had a platform to effect change. Little did she know that across the ocean, a young prince was being raised with the same drive and compassion and that together, they would make history.\n\nSaid Pierce, When I found out about it, I was, like, 'Oh. That's the -- that's the twinkle in her eye. That's the smile on her face,' you know?

Vanessa Bryant delivered emotional remarks about her late husband Kobe and daughter Gianna at the public memorial service honoring their lives at the Staples Center on Monday. As she announced earlier this month, the Celebration of Life was held on a special date: 2/24/20 — #2 for Gigi's jersey number, #24 for Kobe's jersey number, and 20 for the number of years the All-Star played in the NBA.\n\nAt the memorial, Vanessa Bryant spoke publicly for the first time since her husband and daughter died in a helicopter crash along with seven others on January 26. In front of a crowd of thousands of people, she opened up about the pain she has experienced after losing two of the loves of her life.\n\nHere are eight memorable moments from her speech:\n\n1. Kisses from Gianna\n\nGianna Bryant is an amazingly sweet and gentle soul. She was always thoughtful. She always kissed me goodnight and kissed me good morning, Vanessa Bryant said.\n\nVanessa Bryant spoke about her daughter, Gigi, who was just 13 years old when she died in a helicopter crash alongside her dad, NBA star Kobe Bryant.\n\n2. Watching Gigi grow up\n\nWe will not be able to see Gianna go to high school with Natalia … we didn't get the chance to teach her how to drive a car, Vanessa said.\n\nVanessa Bryant became emotional during the memorial service at the Staples Center as she honored her daughter, Gigi, who died at the age of 13.\n\n3. Kobe the girl dad\n\nWe had always talked about how we'd be the fun grandparents to our girls' children. He would've been the coolest grandpa, she said.\n\nKobe was father to Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and Gigi. He was a self-proclaimed girl dad, who coached his daughter's basketball team.\n\n4. Kobe the romantic\n\nHe was truly the romantic one in our relationship, and looked forward to Valentine's Day and our anniversaries every year. He planed anniversary trips and a special traditional gift for every year of our marriage. He even handmade my most treasured gifts, Vanessa said, revealing one of the special gifts her husband gave her.\n\nVanessa Bryant said she and Kobe had been together since she was 17 and a half years old. She called him her best friend.\n\n5. He was my sweet husband\n\nKobe was known as a fierce competitor on the basketball court. The greatest of all time. A writer. An Oscar winner. And the Black Mamba, Bryant said to cheers from the crowd.\n\nVanessa Bryant called her husband of nearly 19 years her soul mate.\n\n6. Gigi the basketball player\n\nShe was very maternal since she was really little. Gigi would have most likely become the best player in the WNBA, Vanessa Bryant said to applause.\n\nKobe coached his daughter's team at his Mamba Academy. Proceeds from memorial service ticket sales will be donated to the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation.\n\n7. Kobe and Gigi's secret talent\n\nShe was competitive like her dad but Gianna had a sweet grace. Her smile was like sunshine, Vanessa said.\n\nVanessa Bryant recalled how much her daughter Gigi was like her husband, Kobe Bryant.\n\n8. Kobe and Gigi together\n\nVanessa Bryant closed her speech talking about Kobe and Gigi together. Babe, you take care of our Gigi, she said.
By Christine DiGangi/Credit.com\n\nYou're probably going to die with some debt to your name. Most people do. In fact, 73 percent of consumers had outstanding debt when they were reported as dead, according to December 2016 data provided to Credit.com by credit bureau Experian. Those consumers carried an average total balance of $61,554, including mortgage debt. Excluding home loans, the average balance was $12,875.\n\nThe data is based on Experian's FileOne database, which includes 220 million consumers. (There are about 242 million adults in the U.S., according to 2015 estimates from the Census Bureau.) To determine the average debt people have when they die, Experian looked at consumers who, as of October 2016, were not deceased, but then showed as deceased as of December 2016. Among the 73 percent of consumers who had debt when they died, about 68 percent had credit card balances. The next most common kind of debt was mortgage debt (37 percent), followed by auto loans (25 percent), personal loans (12 percent) and student loans (6 percent).\n\nThese were the average unpaid balances: credit cards, $4,531; auto loans, $17,111; personal loans, $14,793; and student loans, $25,391.\n\nWhat Does Happen to Debt After You Die?\n\nFor the most part, your debt dies with you, but that doesn't mean it won't affect the people you leave behind.\n\nDebt belongs to the deceased person or that person's estate, said Darra L. Rayndon, an estate planning attorney with Clark Hill in Scottsdale, Arizona. If someone has enough assets to cover their debts, the creditors get paid, and beneficiaries receive whatever remains. But if there aren't enough assets to satisfy debts, creditors lose out (they may get some, but not all, of what they're owed). Family members do not then become responsible for the debt, as some people worry they might.\n\nThat's the general idea, but things are not always that straightforward. The type of debt you have, where you live and the value of your estate significantly affects the complexity of the situation. (For example, federal student loan debt is eligible for cancellation upon a borrower's death, but private student loan companies tend not to offer the same benefit. They can go after the borrower's estate for payment.)\n\nThere are lots of ways things can get messy. Say your only asset is a home other people live in. That asset must be used to satisfy debts, whether it's the mortgage on that home or a lot of credit card debt, meaning the people who live there may have to take over the mortgage, or your family may need to sell the home in order to pay creditors. Accounts with co-signers or co-applicants can also result in the debt falling on someone else's shoulders. Community property states, where spouses share ownership of property, also handle debts acquired during a marriage a little differently.\n\nIt's one thing if the beneficiaries are relatives that don't need your money, but if your beneficiaries are a surviving spouse, minor children — people like that who depend on you for their welfare, then life insurance is a great way to provide additional money in the estate to pay debts, Rayndon said.\n\nHow to Avoid Burdening Your Family\n\nOne way to make sure debt doesn't make a mess of your estate is to stay out of it. You can keep tabs on your debt by reviewing a free snapshot of your credit report, in addition to sticking to a budget that helps you live below your means. You may also want to consider getting life insurance (this blog post explains how to know if you need it) and meeting with an estate planning attorney to make sure everything's covered in the event of your death. If you're worried about leaving behind debt after death, here's more on how protect your loved ones.\n\nPoor planning can leave your loved ones with some significant stress. For example, if you don't have a will or designate beneficiaries for your assets, the law in your state of residence decides who gets what.\n\nIf you don't write a will, your state of residence will write one for you should you pass away, said James M. Matthews, a certified financial planner and managing director of Blueprint, a financial planning firm in Charlotte, North Carolina. Odds are the state laws and your wishes are different.\n\nIt can also get expensive to have these matters determined by the courts, and administrative costs get paid before creditors and beneficiaries. If you'd like to provide for your loved ones after you die, you won't want court costs and outstanding debts to eat away at your estate.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Credit.com.
Debbie Boyd spent an agonizing 15 years wondering where convicted killer Mario Garcia hid the body of her murdered daughter Christie Wilson.\n\nWas she in an ocean? Was she in a ditch? asked Boyd. And for 15 years, I never went to bed without wondering 'where is she? Where did Mario Garcia put her?'\n\nWe wanted to find her to show Mario, you're not going to win, you're not winning this, said investigator Don Murchison. We're going to find her and bring her home to the family.\n\nThrough sheer will and wit, and the help of two determined investigators, Boyd finally got her answer.\n\nChristie Wilson, 27, was last seen leaving the Thunder Valley Casino in Lincoln, California, in the early morning hours of October 5, 2005. Debbie Boyd\n\nMario Garcia met Christie Wilson in a casino in 2005. It was the last time the 27-year-old woman was ever seen. Garcia denied having anything to do with Wilson's disappearance.\n\nWhat happened to her, Mario? How could she simply disappear after she was with you? 48 Hours correspondent Erin Moriarty asked Garcia in 2006. I don't have answers for that, he replied.\n\nA jury disagreed. Years passed since he was convicted and in 2018, Garcia let Boyd know he wanted to be released early from his 59-year sentence. Boyd considered negotiating with him, but changed her mind.\n\nThis would be such a disgrace, she said. He will not use my daughter's body as a bargaining chip.\n\nLast summer, investigators working for the district attorney in Placer County, Calif., got a tip from an unlikely source that led them back to Garcia's former home. There they started digging until something emerged from the ground.\n\nWe found Christie, says Boyd. This is a day that we had hoped for. My prayers have been answered. We can now move forward without the torment of the last 15 years.\n\nTHE BIGGEST GAMBLE\n\nTiffney de Vries: Christie and I were definitely soul sisters for sure …we grew up together in school and just loved pretty much doing everything together.\n\nTiffney de Vries says best friend Christie Wilson just had a knack for making her laugh.\n\nTiffney DeVries: I picture her in our front room … just dancing and laughing and having so much fun … I could be having the worst day … And she would always be there for me. … We always knew that no matter what, we were there for each other.\n\nBut Tiffney was not with Christie in early morning hours of October 5, 2005. That's when a surveillance camera in a California casino captured Christie walking into a parking lot with a man she met that night.\n\nChristie Wilson and Mario Garcia are seen leaving the casino together at 1:13 a.m. Placer County District Attorney\n\nTiffney DeVries: That was really scary because we didn't know where she was or if she could be alive.\n\nChristie was then only 27 years old. Her mother Debbie Boyd can hardly believe how much time has passed.\n\nDebbie Boyd: You know, I try not to think of it too much because it actually kind of takes me to a very sad place.\n\nSince the moment Christie vanished, Debbie vowed not to rest until she knew what Christie's killer had done with her body.\n\nDebbie Boyd: I'm her mother forever, and I was not going to give up.\n\n48 Hours has been covering the Christie Wilson case for the past 15 years. It began like so many of these stories do: with a concerned boyfriend telling authorities that his girlfriend had gone missing.\n\nDanny Burlando [2005]: I loved her, and I know she loved me, and we cared about each other very much.\n\nOn the evening of October 4, 2005, Christie's boyfriend Danny Burlando says she went to the Thunder Valley Casino to play blackjack.\n\nErin Moriarty: Did it surprise you to hear she had been at a casino that night?\n\nTiffney de Vries [2005]: You know it -- it didn't -- because recently she um -- she had been telling me she'd been, you know -- playing some blackjack.\n\nBack in 2005, Tiffney de Vries was a young newlywed. She's thought about why Christie left the casino that night with a stranger, and she had a theory.\n\nTiffney de Vries [2005]: Sometimes I think, Well what if -- you know -- someone put something in her drink?\n\nDebbie was aware her daughter was gambling, partly because she was between jobs and low on money. Her boyfriend Danny felt Christie was gambling too much.\n\nErin Moriarty: When's the last time you actually talked to her?\n\n\n\nDanny Burlando [2005]: At 10:28 p.m. Tuesday, October 4th. We had a 55 second conversation.\n\nChristie Wilson seen in the casino on the phone with Danny Burlando at 10:28 p.m. on October 4, 2005. Placer County District Attorney\n\nDanny Burlando [2005]: I told her to come home and … she was like, OK, I'm finishing up. I'll be home soon.\n\nBut when Danny awoke, there was no sign of Christie. He began leaving dozens of desperate messages on Christie's cell phone:\n\nA quarter after 10 on Wednesday. It's now been 24 hours since I talked to you last, and I'm worried sick about you … Please call me. If you're OK, call me. If you're not OK, call me. Let me know what's going on.\n\nDanny filed a missing person's report. Investigator Don Murchison interviewed Burlando back in 2005 and says Danny was very cooperative.\n\nDon Murchison [2005]: Anything that I wanted from him when I was at that residence, he allowed me to have.\n\nMurchison says investigators soon found their prime suspect when that casino video surfaced. They were able to track down a 53-year-old man named Mario Garcia by his player's casino card. Sheriff's deputies arrested and held him on a weapons charge.\n\nMario Garcia: Christie Wilson came and sat on my left between me and another individual.\n\nIn 2006, Mario Garcia told 48 Hours what he says happened in the hours before Christie disappeared.\n\nChristie Wilson and Mario Garcia Placer County District Attorney\n\nMario Garcia: We were at that table for a period of time until that table got hot. She asked me, Hey, you want to go with me to another table? And I said, Sure.\n\nTheir night of gambling ended just past 1 a.m. Wednesday, October 5. Garcia claimed that he and Christie walked to his car and then went their separate ways. And he suggested that Christie may have met someone in the parking lot.\n\nErin Moriarty: Well, wouldn't that be seen on camera?\n\nMario Garcia: Well, they don't see that she got in my car, do they? They don't see where she went, correct?\n\nSome 3 minutes and 41 seconds later, Garcia's car reappears on the cameras and it looks as though he's the only one inside.\n\nGeorge Malim [2005]: She hasn't called any family. Any friends.\n\nInvestigations Commander George Malim helped coordinate a massive search for Christie through the rugged and varied terrain of Placer County.\n\nGeorge Malim: We utilized search and rescue people and their vehicles … and they drove every road they could … every driveway, looked in every culvert … and still nothing was found.\n\nAmong the searchers was Christie's heartbroken older sister Stacie.\n\nStacie Wilson [2005]: You wanna hear details, but you don't. It's just like you get this image in my head of god, what she must have been going through.\n\nThe physical searches turned up nothing, but then investigators began looking into Mario Garcia's past … and what they found was chilling.\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: You don't cross Mario. You don't cross him, especially if you're a woman and you're alone. You don't cross him.\n\nGARCIA'S PAST\n\nEven though Mario Garcia was the last person seen with Christie Wilson, to some he appeared an unlikely murder suspect. He was a project manager for a local hospital, married with two teenage boys.\n\nMario Garcia: I am, and I have been happily married.\n\nJean Garcia [2006]: Your husband … is your destiny … and with him I have that feeling. I just have that connection.\n\nJean and Mario Garcia Jean Garcia\n\nGarcia's wife Jean defended him.\n\nJean Garcia: He is a family man … if he's not working we will take the kids for sports.\n\nAnd his son Kris, then 19, said he's a great dad.\n\nKris Garcia [2006]: … he was always there for us … you know he'd always come home, make sure … we all sit at the table. … we're just a good family.\n\nThe family lived in a house on five beautiful acres in Auburn, California – Gold Country.\n\nJean Garcia: With Mario, I always feel good about him.\n\nBut investigators were not about to take Jean's word for it. Four days after Christie disappeared, they went to Garcia's home to question him and ran a criminal background check. And that's how they found Wendy Ward, a woman from Garcia's past.\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: When I first met him, I found him to be very intelligent, very articulate, very warm.\n\nWendy Ward and Mario Garcia met and began dating in 1978. Wendy Ward\n\n\n\nWendy Ward met Garcia in 1978 near Oakland, when she was 26 and he was 27, and they began dating.\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: I would say a very supportive person. It felt like he cared a lot.\n\nBut Wendy says he also had a temper, and he reached a boiling point after she ended the relationship. He grabbed her one night and drove off with her in his van.\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: He was holding my neck, or he was holding my head … and he says, `You do anything, you do anything, I will take your head and I will smash it.\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: I think he said to me, Take off your clothes or - -or something like that, and I said, No. … I just was clawing, scratching, whatever I could do. … Then he started to choke me. I couldn't -- I couldn't breathe. I couldn't breathe.\n\nErin Moriarty: Did you think you were going to die?\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: I did. I really did.\n\nShe says he raped her and then took her back to his apartment.\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: … he pulled a gun out of his cabinet … and he held it to my head … and he pulled the trigger. … he says, well it wasn't loaded this time, but basically, I can come and get you anytime I want.\n\nWendy says he raped her again. And then, he casually made himself a sandwich, ate it, and drove her home.\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: I'm surprised that I actually am alive. I -- I'm very lucky.\n\nWendy immediately went to the hospital, and police arrested Garcia. But the court case stalled for two years, before prosecutors offered him a deal.\n\nWendy Ward [2005]: I figured it's better than nothing and let's do this and then let's move on. Garcia agreed to plead guilty to one count of assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to 18 month's probation. Believe it or not, Garcia says he's the one who was railroaded.\n\nMario Garcia CBS News\n\nMario Garcia [2006]: She made allegations that were not true.\n\nErin Moriarty: There was a gun involved, wasn't there?\n\nMario Garcia: There was no gun involved.\n\nErin Moriarty: You pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and there was no gun involved? You just offered to plead guilty?\n\nMario Garcia: I possess guns, I possess guns but there was no -- we had a stormy relationship.\n\nErin Moriarty: When you say stormy relationship, did you hit her?\n\nMario Garcia: No, I did not.\n\n\n\nWendy never forgot about Garcia, but she moved on … until October 2005, not long after Christie went missing, when she was tracked down by Detective Murchison.\n\n\n\nErin Moriarty: When you heard that Christie Wilson disappeared and the last person to see her alive was Mario Garcia, what was your reaction?\n\nWendy Ward: I felt sick to my stomach.\n\nWendy told Murchison what happened with Garcia, and she said there was something else about Garcia they needed to know.\n\nWendy Ward: I felt, after my own incident with him … that he could very easily do this again with someone else.\n\nIt wasn't long before something terrible involving Mario Garcia happened again.\n\nTom Davis [2005]: My younger sister and I were pals, we were friends. She was a lot of fun to be around. She was very outgoing.\n\nTom Davis' sister Lynette dated Mario Garcia after Wendy in 1979. It, too, was a volatile relationship, and Garcia was upset with Lynette because she ended a pregnancy with his child. But the couple still celebrated Christmas with Lynette's mother. After dinner, the three of them got into Lynette's car.\n\nJohn Cave [2005]: The streets were dry; the weather was clear.\n\nRetired officer John Cave was the chief accident investigator for the Oakland Police Department. That Christmas night, he got a call that a car had plunged into the water near the Oakland airport.\n\nJohn Cave: The witnesses said the car pulled over to the right shoulder. They drove by, and the car accelerated. … And there was a ledge, like into the pier, and the car shot off that ledge out into the water … And that's where it sunk.\n\nLynette Smith and Violet Davis Tom David\n\nGarcia was the only survivor.\n\nMario Garcia: I panicked and eventually, I took my seat belt and I opened one of the windows … all this rush of water came into the car. I got out and everybody else, I presumed, got out.\n\nHe told police Lynette was driving, but they couldn't confirm who was behind the wheel.\n\nErin Moriarty: If in fact Mario Garcia was the driver and he intended to kill Lynette and her mother … it's not a very efficient way to get rid of somebody, is it?\n\nJohn Cave: It worked didn't it? … and, if he was the driver, he got away with it.\n\nCave wanted to question Garcia further, but he got a lawyer the next day.\n\nErin Moriarty: Why, if it were just a simple accident, would you not talk to the police and would you hire a criminal lawyer?\n\nMario Garcia: It's the thing to do. It's the legal right of every citizen of the United States. And my attorney advised me not to talk to them.\n\nAfter the accident, a heartbroken Tom reached out to an old friend from his hometown. Incredibly, it was Wendy Ward. As they talked, she asked how his sister was doing.\n\nTom Davis: I said, Yeah, she was killed in a car accident, involved with this guy named Mario Garcia. Mario Garcia?\n\n\n\nWendy Ward: It goes beyond disbelief.\n\nTom Davis: She says, I used to date him. I was involved with him. I have rape charges against him.\n\nNo charges were ever filed against Garcia for Lynette and her mother's deaths. But Debbie Boyd had heard all she needed to about Mario Garcia.\n\nDebbie Boyd [2005]: You're not fooling anybody, and especially not me. … And I will continue to pursue you and pursue you and pursue you.\n\nTHE CASE AGAINST MARIO GARCIA\n\nAfter three weeks of searching, Placer County authorities made a tough decision: to charge Mario Garcia with Christie's murder even though they hadn't found her body. Her mother Debbie Boyd worried there wasn't enough evidence.\n\nDebbie Boyd [2005]: The thought of him getting off on this case, once again, scares the living daylights out of me for every woman.\n\nGaren Horst [2006]: It was a large case to put together.\n\nGaren Horst, the Placer County deputy district attorney at the time, had the unenviable task of prosecuting the county's first no-body murder trial in September 2006.\n\n\n\nErin Moriarty: So, what do you believe happened to Christie Wilson?\n\nGaren Horst: She went out of the casino with the defendant. … At some point in the vehicle at the casino, he incapacitated her.\n\nMario Garcia leaves the parking lot in his car, seemingly alone. Placer County District Attorney\n\nGaren Horst: He was probably putting her in the backseat so that when he drove away nobody could see. … As far as what he did … afterwards, that's anybody's guess.\n\nErin Moriarty: Was she in your car?\n\nMario Garcia [2006]: No, she never was inside my car. … At some point in time, she says that she left her cell phone in the casino and we embrace. … And that, that was the end of the conversation.\n\nInvestigators did later find Christie's phone in the casino, but there is no footage of her returning to get it and no footage of Christie getting into Garcia's car. But Horst says the evidence prove Christie was inside the car.\n\nGaren Horst: One of Christie's pulled hairs was found in that trunk.\n\nSmall amounts of Christie Wilson's blood was found on the door and backseat of Mario Garcia's car, and her hairs were found in his trunk and on a door handle. Placer County District Attorney\n\nCrime scene investigators also found tiny drops of her blood on the backseat and door.\n\nMario Garcia: Why is it that the DNA on the door, claimed to be of Christie Wilson, was the only thing that was found? Why is it that the DNA from my sons, my wife and other people that were in the car were not found?\n\nErin Moriarty: By your own admission, you cleaned the car.\n\nMario Garcia: I cleaned everybody else's DNA except Christie Wilson? That's the only thing they found. So how did it get there?\n\nErin Moriarty: What's your reaction when the defense insinuates … that was planted?\n\n\n\nDon Murchison [2006]: It greatly angers me … They couldn't defend what was there, so they had to say it was planted.\n\nThe prosecution says the evidence that incriminates Garcia is as plain as the scratches on his face and body left by Christie as she fought for her life.\n\nWhen police spoke with Garcia four days later, he had scratches on his face and chest. Investigators believed Christie Wilson left the marks during a struggle. Placer County District Attorney\n\nErin Moriarty: Did you get the scratches … through Christie Wilson?\n\nMario Garcia: No. Absolutely not.\n\nBut the morning after that trip to the casino, several of Garcia's co-workers say they saw scratches on Garcia's face, and he visited the eye doctor.\n\nMario Garcia: Those are injuries that I received through poison oak and falling from a tree.\n\nYet Robert Royer, an emergency room doctor who sat at the same table as Garcia at the casino, told investigators he could clearly see Garcia's face that night.\n\n\n\nErin Moriarty: How far is -- is Mario Garcia from you?\n\nRobert Royer [2006]: Two feet? Less than a meter.\n\nErin Moriarty: Did he seem to have any injuries on his face?\n\nRobert Royer: I didn't see any injuries, no … and I'm reasonably good at making those kind of observations 'cause that's what I do for a living.\n\nErin Moriarty: Why wouldn't the emergency room doctor see those?\n\nMario Garcia: I cannot answer what he saw or didn't see.\n\nAnd no one can answer why Christie left the casino with Garcia. Those who knew her had wondered if he put something in her drink. And the prosecution presents evidence to support that theory.\n\nA week after Christie disappeared, Garcia searched online for information about how authorities test for date rape drugs. But when Garcia takes the stand, he insists he's done nothing wrong.\n\nMario Garcia [to Erin Moriarty]: I wanted to tell the court that I am very sorry Christie Wilson is missing. But I don't know where she's at.\n\nThe jury doesn't get to hear about Garcia's violent past even though he comes face-to-face with a reminder.\n\nWendy Ward travelled to Sacramento to meet Debbie and Christie's family for the first time. CBS News\n\nTo show her support, Wendy Ward travels to Sacramento to meet Debbie and Christie's family for the first time.\n\nWendy Ward [2006]: I couldn't stop hugging her. I just wanted to hold her and hug her and all the family. They're just going through so much.\n\nWendy heads to court with the Boyds for closing arguments, where Garcia's lawyer suggests that no one even knows if Christie is dead.\n\nErin Moriarty: Are you saying that Christie Wilson may still be alive?\n\nMario Garcia: Do we know if she's dead?\n\nThe jury concluded it did know: Case 55517 We the jury in the above and titled action find the defendant Mario Flavio Garcia guilty of a violation …\n\nDEBBIE BOYD [to reporters]: Absolutely justice has been served. It's about time. Now, if he's any kind of a man, he'll tell us where he disposed of my daughter.\n\nAt Garcia's sentencing in January 2007, the Boyds still held out hope that Garcia would disclose where he left Christie's body in exchange for a lesser sentence.\n\nMario Garcia addresses the judge at his sentencing. CBS News\n\nMARIO GARCIA: I suppose that at this hearing I'm supposed to ask for mercy, for forgiveness, and to show remorse. However … I will not do such thing [sic] … I did not kill Christie Wilson. I am innocent.\n\nGarcia's sentence, 25 years to life, is doubled because of his assault on Wendy Ward. When other charges were added, his total sentence became 59 years-to-life.\n\nDebbie Boyd [after the sentencing]: At this point, I don't ever expect that he'll disclose what he did with Christie.\n\nJean Garcia [2006]: The truth is out there. And Mario told me that we have to found [sic] Christie and that's the only hope he has.\n\nJean Garcia did not know that her own family would play a key role in the search for Christie.\n\nWHERE IS CHRISTIE?\n\nMario Garcia's murder conviction in 2006 was hardly the end of the case for Christie's mother. Garcia was sent to prison and the years dragged by. But he refused to say what he did with her body. It's been the mystery at the center of this case, and it has gnawed at Deb's soul.\n\nDebbie Boyd: Debbie is forever changed. Mario Garcia changed that. He changed me.\n\nThe loss of her daughter was crushing, but Debbie knew she couldn't allow Garcia to control her life.\n\nDebbie Boyd: We made a commitment … he is not going to take our marriage … He's not going to take the marriages of our children. He's not going to disrupt our jobs. We are not giving him any more.\n\nThat was not easy as Garcia filed one appeal after another.\n\nDebbie and Pat Boyd CBS News\n\nDebbie Boyd: You can't move forward completely when you have all these appeals … You know, it's like you move forward five steps and then you're back in it again.\n\nPat Boyd, Christie's stepfather and a former San Jose detective, knew the stakes were high.\n\nPat Boyd: 'Cause it's not like we had a tremendous amount of evidence. A small amount of evidence being lost, the case would have been lost.\n\nNuno Tavares: The concern is always there for appeals but it was not a distraction that it took us away from … our, our tasks and our mission to try to find Christie.\n\nNuno Tavares, an investigator for the Placer County District Attorney's Office, and fellow investigator Don Murchison had been on the case from the beginning and never let go.\n\nInvestigators Don Murchison and Nuno Tavares. CBS News\n\nErin Moriarty: Why is it so important to the two of you to bring her home?\n\nDon Murchison Because the family needed her … They needed a place where they could go and to spend time with her.\n\nNuno Tavares: We wanted to give Debbie and her family back control … up until this point, he controlled the location of Christie's remains. And that didn't sit well with me.\n\nMorgan Gire: They are incredibly dedicated. They are very experienced … their balance between tough cop and teddy bear is the appropriate balance.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire gave Nuno and Murch, as Debbie calls them, the green light to keep looking for Christie and they ran with it — going to extraordinary lengths to find her no matter how dirty the job.\n\nDon Murchison: We actually pumped an entire septic tank out … We pumped out the entire 2,000 gallons of sewage and went through it by hand.\n\nErin Moriarty: That is determination.\n\nAll those searches over all those years turned up nothing but the investigation entered a new phase in 2017 after Tony Lopez, an anchor for the CBS Sacramento, conducted an interview with Debbie. She directed some carefully chosen words to Garcia.\n\nDEBBIE BOYD [CBS Sacramento interview]: I now view him as a lost soul … And that I often wonder -- I want him to know I often wonder how he ever became the man that he did. … If Mario were to pass away with me not having had the opportunity to sit and just talk with him, I know I would forever regret it.\n\nDebbie says Garcia spotted that interview and began writing letters to her and Placer County officials. Garcia apologized for what Debbie had gone through but did not accept responsibility for Christie's murder.\n\nDebbie Boyd: I wanted Christie back so bad that I thought, you know what? Let's see how far this goes.\n\nMorgan Gire: Deb had struggled with the idea that, you know, what do you negotiate with a man who has been convicted of the murder of your daughter who knows where she is?\n\nBut ultimately, Debbie changed her mind—she could not bring herself to negotiate with Garcia.\n\nDebbie Boyd: I was sitting there thinking, what on Earth are you doing, Debbie? Get a grip. This would be such a disgrace … He will not use my daughter's body as a bargaining chip.\n\nMorgan Gire: And we certainly weren't going to agree to let him out in exchange for the location of her remains. So really, the only option was, find her.\n\nNuno and Murch reapproached Garcia's family. Investigators knew Jean Garcia had divorced Mario after his conviction. She had reached a point where she no longer believed Garcia.\n\nNuno Tavares: … she said she was very convinced that Mario had something to do with Christie's disappearance and murder.\n\nThe investigators also reached out to Garcia's sons, Kris and Andy, and walked them through the four days in October 2005 after Christie went missing but before police began questioning Garcia. What did they see? How did their father behave?\n\nNuno Tavares: We went through -- every day Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then it got to Saturday. And that's where the story got a little bit interesting. … Kris had an important soccer game.\n\nNuno Tavares: He saw his dad working on a tractor … working kind of frantically and had kind of a crazed look in his eyes as he was working around the property … And he told Kris, I'm not going. And it was a very firm, I'm not going. … Kris found that out of character for Mario.\n\nIn August 2020, Nuno Tavares and Don Murchison went back and searched the property around the home where Mario Garcia and his family lived at the time of Christie's disappearance. CBS News\n\nThe investigators asked Kris to accompany them back to his childhood home, which the family lost in 2007, to pinpoint the spot where he had seen his father working on the tractor.\n\nNuno Tavares: He said it was right next to the detached garage, right along the road.\n\nIt was barely 100 yards from the Garcia house. But if he had been digging in that spot with a tractor just days before deputies searched the property, why hadn't anyone noticed?\n\nDon Murchison: It wasn't just a small area where he had landscaped … there was landscaping all over the property.\n\nNuno Tavares: And you've got to remember, he had time. Mario has four or five days to really do this right …\n\nDon Murchison: Mario did a extremely good job … making the terrain look like it just fit the area.\n\nAnd Nuno and Murch also knew that cadaver dogs had roamed the property back in 2005 and had found nothing.\n\nNuno Tavares: … cadaver dogs are a tool like any other tool that we use. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.\n\nA year passed and in August 2020, investigators decided they would take another look. This time, they brought with them a company that specialized in ground penetrating radar or GPR. Nearly the entire 5 acres were scanned, and technicians pinpointed eight spots where there were voids or pockets beneath the surface. The first two holes produced nothing.\n\nErin Moriarty: You struck out twice.\n\nNuno Tavares: We've been going for a long time. Three is now my favorite hole … it's my favorite hole because that's where Mario was working that day …\n\nErin Moriarty: And how far did you go?\n\nNuno Tavares: … we started pulling back about 25 feet, pulling just a couple of inches at a time, went about 18-feet wide … and out of the corner of my peripheral, I see a bone popping up out of the ground.\n\nNuno Tavares: I was a little bit short of breath, I'll tell you that … The blood was rushing … And we stopped everything. We froze everything.\n\nIt was the moment of truth — had Nuno and Murch found Christie Wilson?\n\nWE FOUND CHRISTIE\n\nBuried on what was once Mario Garcia's property, Nuno and Murch had found what looked like a human bone. They needed confirmation, so, they called in archeologist Cindy Arrington. She immediately told them the bone was human, but the detectives weren't convinced.\n\nCindy Arrington: He's like, you're not close enough. I said, oh, yes, I am [laughs]. … And he said, get closer. … So, they had me get down in the trench and really double check, triple check. OK, yes. It's human.\n\nAt the third location, just 100 yards from Mario Garcia's former home, investigators recovered nearly a full skeleton. Tests would later confirm it was Christie Wilson's. Placer County District Attorney\n\nHuman -- but was it Christie's? More identification work needed to be done but finding any human bones on Garcia's property was big news and they immediately shared it with the sheriff and the DA.\n\nNuno Tavares: They came to the conclusion that … we need to get this news to Debbie quickly.\n\n\n\nAnd they knew how they needed to get it to her. For years, Debbie and Wendy Ward have helped the detectives teach a class for homicide investigators. And just two months earlier, someone in the class asked Debbie a question no one had ever asked before.\n\nDebbie Boyd: Mrs. Boyd, if your daughter was ever recovered, how would you want to be notified? … And I just said, you know, please don't ever just call me on the phone.\n\nNuno and Murch flew to Scottsdale, Arizona. It was nearly midnight when the Boyds' doorbell rang. Debbie was asleep on the couch. Pat answered the door.\n\nDon Murchison: He opened up the door and he looked at us and he got a big smile on his face. He said, Hi, guys, how's it going? … And then you could see him pause and you could see things starting to click the gears in his head.\n\nDebbie Boyd: And I got up. … I just was in a fog … And I looked at them and he said, Debbie. It's Murch. And it's Nuno. I said, what are you doing here?\n\nDon Murchison: So. that's when we told her that we had found human remains on Mario's property that we believed were Christie's, but we couldn't confirm that.\n\nNuno Tavares: I remember her that night saying, is it OK to be happy or joyful? She kept looking around going, Is that OK?\n\nPat Boyd: We didn't know whether we should open a bottle of champagne, what -- it was just a lot of hugs, some quietness and sometimes just sitting there letting it sink in.\n\nDebbie made plans to fly to California to tell her daughter Stacie. And before she left for the airport the next morning, Nuno and Murch heard that their team had had found nearly an entire skeleton and it was definite — the bones were Christie's.\n\n\n\nDays later, Debbie shared the news with the world and made sure to thank Nuno and Murch.\n\nDEBBIE BOYD [to reporters]: Today is a day that absolutely reflects some of the greatest level of perseverance and police work that a victim's family could ever ask for.\n\nPat Boyd: They brought two people home. They brought my daughter home. They brought my wife home.\n\nErin Moriarty: Do you feel that you got Deb back? Tell me about that.\n\nPat Boyd: She can think of more than just where is Christie?\n\nKris and Jean didn't want to speak publicly, but they're grateful to have closure for Christie's family, and their own.\n\nNuno Tavares: Kris, Andy, Jean — they didn't ask to have a dad and a husband who was a murderer, who buried his victim on their property, where they lived and played. They didn't ask for that.\n\nAnd then there were the other victims of Mario Garcia who were hit hard by Christie's murder, like Danny Burlando, her boyfriend at the time.\n\nDanny Burlando: I didn't realize … how much had really been bottled up for 15 years. … I think I may have been judged, misjudged, misunderstood through the process … and that didn't really allow me to grieve and be a victim in this, in this whole thing.\n\nWendy Ward was also relieved. She knows how lucky she is to have survived her own encounter with Garcia and has used art to help transform the feelings that she's held onto for all these years.\n\nWendy Ward: It helped shift those feelings into something positive — what came up in me to create that and to survive and to say no more.\n\nEveryone involved takes pride that Christie was found without making a deal with Garcia. And the discovery lays to rest any doubts about Garcia's guilt.\n\n\n\nDebbie Boyd: I mean, there's no greater proof.\n\nThe autopsy revealed that Christie's hand and nose were broken, but it couldn't establish a cause of death.\n\nErin Moriarty: Do you believe he strangled her?\n\n\n\nDon Murchison: I think that's very likely … what — what occurred that day … But we just don't know.\n\nThose who loved Christie try to focus on the life she lived. Her best friend Tiffney de Vries says she's reminded of Christie by the little things she loved — a song on the radio, or the way Christie danced.\n\nTiffney de Vries: For me, Christie has never been completely gone. I've been carrying her spirit with me every day.\n\nIn October 2020, to mark the anniversary of Christie's death, Debbie Boyd visited the pier in Capitola, California, where the family put a plaque many years ago. CBS News\n\nDebbie and Christie's father Dennis had Christie's remains cremated. In October 2020, to mark the anniversary of her death, Debbie visited the pier in Capitola where the family put a plaque many years ago.\n\nDebbie Boyd: This is a place that Christie just absolutely loved … It was what she called her happy place.\n\nDebbie says no longer having to wonder where Christie is changes everything.\n\nDebbie Boyd: We can grieve the way that we should have been able to grieve 15 years ago. There's a peace about that.\n\nDebbie Boyd: I was so blessed to be her mom for 27 years and that I will carry with me forever.\n\nMario Garcia died of pneumonia on December 24, 2020.\n\nHe died without ever admitting guilt.\n\nProduced by Paul LaRosa and Dena Goldstein.

Bob Hawke, Australia's longest-serving Labor Party prime minister, whose charisma and powers of persuasion earned him near-folk hero status among many Australians, died on Thursday, his wife said. He was 89.\n\nThe former union leader dedicated much of his political career to trade union issues, and he was widely regarded as a man of his people. He had a down-to-earth attitude, a passion for sports and legendary status among beer lovers — for once drinking himself into the record books.\n\nHe won four terms as prime minister, serving from 1983 to 1991 before being ousted by his own center-left party when the economy soured. Only two other prime ministers served Australia longer, and both were members of the conservative Liberal Party.\n\nHe had been actively supporting Labor's campaign for elections on Saturday after six years in opposition. He also said he doubted he would survive to see the Labor victory predicted in opinion polling.\n\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten said Hawke had transformed Australian society and protected the environment, a reference to his government preventing the damming of a wild river in Tasmania state to generate electricity in a major environmental conflict in 1983. We have lost a favorite son. Bob Hawke loved Australia and Australia loved Bob Hawke, Shorten said.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said Hawke had defined the politics of his generation and beyond.\n\nBob Hawke was a great Australian who led and served our country with passion, courage, and an intellectual horsepower that made our country stronger, Morrison said.\n\nFormer President Clinton also paid tribute to Hawke.\n\nEven though I never had the chance to serve with him, I always liked and admired Bob Hawke for his progressive record and great sense of humor, Mr. Clinton said on Twitter. My thoughts are with his family and the people of Australia.\n\nEven though I never had the chance to serve with him, I always liked and admired Bob Hawke for his progressive record and great sense of humor. My thoughts are with his family and the people of Australia. — Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) May 16, 2019\n\nRobert James Lee Hawke was born in the agricultural community of Bordertown, South Australia, to a Congregationalist minister father.\n\nBy the time he entered politics, Hawke had abandoned his religious upbringing and declared himself agnostic. His lifelong involvement with the labor movement began in 1958, when he joined the Australian Council of Trade Unions, first as a researcher and later as a union advocate.\n\nAfter scoring several high-profile wins before the Arbitration Commission, Hawke rose through the ranks of the ACTU and was elected its president in 1969. Over the next decade, Hawke developed strong ties with both union representatives and their traditional rivals — employers and government agencies — winning him a reputation as an easy operator.\n\nBob Hawke toasts Hawke's Lager at the launch of Hawke's Lager at The Clock Hotel on April 6, 2017, in Sydney, Australia. Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images\n\nNegotiations over labor disputes were as likely to take place at the bar over copious beers as before the courts. His reputation as a tippler was cemented during his years as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University in England, where he earned a Guinness world record by downing 2 1/2 pints of beer in 11 seconds.\n\nThis feat was to endear me to some of my fellow Australians more than anything else I ever achieved, Hawke wrote of the 1955 stunt in his autobiography. In 1980, Hawke publicly swore off alcohol and was elected to Parliament, immediately taking up a high-profile role as the opposition's spokesman for industrial relations, employment and youth.\n\nStill, he never shook his booze-loving reputation, and in his later years, did little to discourage it. A January 2012 video of a then-82-year-old Hawke chugging a beer at a cricket match as cheering and laughing fans shouted, One for the country, Robert! exceeds a million hits on YouTube.\n\nNot everyone loved him, of course. Some viewed him as arrogant, sexist, even obnoxious.\n\nHawke was notorious for his short temper and womanizing ways; he admitted to repeatedly cheating on his first wife, Hazel Masterson, during their 39-year marriage and married his biographer and mistress, Blanche d'Alpuget, shortly after their divorce. Today we lost Bob Hawke, a great Australian - many would say the greatest Australian of the post-war era, d'Alpuget said in a statement.\n\nPrime Minister Hawke and his treasurer, then successor, Paul Keating modernized the Australian economy, paving the way for an unprecedented period of recession-free economic growth and job creation, she said. Australians embraced Hawke as a larrikin, an Aussie term for someone considered endearingly mischievous.\n\nOn the strength of his personality and growing popularity with voters, Hawke was elected prime minister on March 5, 1983, after less than three years in Parliament and only one month as leader of the Labor Party. He came to power preaching consensus and, through his intimate knowledge of both the trade union and business communities, was able to forge a wage accord that helped to minimize industrial disputes.\n\nOn the back of his success, Hawke called an early election and was again swept to power in 1984. Hawke broke a 1984 campaign promise and called early elections again in 1987, after the Senate twice rejected a government proposal to introduce a national identity card, which Labor said was necessary to crack down on tax evaders and welfare cheats.\n\nHe was narrowly elected to a fourth term in 1990. But as Australia plunged into recession, Hawke's enormous popularity began to wane and his rule as prime minister finally ended on Dec. 20, 1991, when he was ousted by his own party.\n\nHe retired from Parliament the following year. Despite his background in the union movement, Hawke's approach to the economy was largely conservative.\n\nIn 1983, he oversaw the floating of Australia's currency and later set in motion the sale of several state-run industries — including airlines, banks and telecommunications companies — and curbed government subsidies to underperforming sectors. Like many Australians, Hawke was an avid sports fan, always ready to roll up his sleeves and place a bet.\n\nIn 1983, when Australia broke the United States' 132-year winning streak in the America's Cup yacht race, Hawke proclaimed the day a national holiday, famously saying, Any boss who sacks anyone for not turning up today is a bum. D'Alpuge said she will hold a private funeral with his children Sue, Stephen, Rosslyn and stepson, Louis, and his grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held in Sydney in the coming weeks.
Two cousins who say they are in love with each other have created an online petition calling for the state of Utah to allow them to get legally married. My first cousin and I have been in love with each other our whole lives but we are prohibited from marrying in the state of Utah where we live, Angela Peang writes in the petition. We believe that the law is outdated and it needs to be changed so that we can socially legitimize our love.\n\nThe couple's goal is to get 1,000 signatures; as of Wednesday morning, about 75 have signed on. Peang told CBS News she's loved her cousin, Michael Lee, since she was in second grade. Peang's father is the oldest of 12 children; his sister, the fifth child in that family, is Lee's mother.\n\nWe just always played a lot, Peang remembered of her childhood interactions with Lee. We went into a closet and we were kissing and dancing together. It just felt really natural.\n\nAngie Peang realized she was in love with her cousin Michael when she was in second grade, she says. Angie Peang\n\nHe told my mom he was going to marry me, Peang said. Her mom told Michael they couldn't get married but they could be friends. Each time they saw each other at family functions the connection between them stayed strong. The cousins were caught kissing once by family members, Peang remembered. We got in trouble, she said. After that we were kind of kept apart.\n\nThe cousins each got married to other people and Peang had three children with her husband. But both couples eventually divorced. Angie and Michael hadn't seen each other in about 10 years when they both showed up to their grandmother's house last Christmas. They immediately reconnected.\n\nWe felt a lot of love and missed each other over the years, Peang said. We decided that we were just going to be open with our love. It was really scary to think about how our family would react because they are conservative Mormons... we thought we might be excluded.\n\nShe said they received mixed responses from their family members. Their parents feel the cousins' love may threaten the family's identity, Peang said. She said her youngest child was OK with it, but her two older daughters felt it was wrong and weird. They started to come around eventually and when we told them we were getting married they were like, 'OK, we're cool [with it],' Peang said.\n\nThe cousins are not legally allowed to get married in Utah, but the law is different in Colorado. Peang and Lee went to Grand Junction, Colorado, on Monday to tie the knot at the courthouse. Lee posted a celebratory message on Facebook. I am officially a married man with a bright future, he wrote. I am completely ecstatic about finally being married to my Angie.\n\nPeang and Lee went to Colorado to get legally married. They are now trying to raise awareness in Utah so the marriage law is changed there. Angie Peang\n\nMost do not allow marriage between first cousins, but Inside Edition reports six states do permit it under certain conditions. Some impose age limits or require proof of therapy between the couple. Utah is a state that allows marriage between first cousins only if both are over the age of 65.\n\nThe couple wants the law changed so their marriage is recognized in their home state. We hope to spread awareness about our situation, and we hope with this awareness and education we can shift people's perspectives, Lee said. It really isn't something they should be afraid of or against.\n\nGetting married in Colorado was one step and gathering the signatures is another one, she said.
The only Democratic candidate for president who has campaigned at a drag club, is now the first candidate to present an agenda to protect the rights of gay and transgender Americans. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand announced Saturday — the first day of Gay Pride Month — her plan to help enforce LGBTQ rights.\n\nGillibrand's plan sorts priorities into four categories: equal rights, families and children, health care, and safety.\n\nTo safeguard equal rights, Gillibrand would call on two federal agencies to fight LGBTQ discrimination. Upon being elected, she would overturn the Trump administration's ban on transgender men and women serving in the military, and direct the Department of Defense to ban restrictive policies affecting HIV-positive members of the military.\n\nGillibrand would also use the Department of Justice to classify LGBT individuals as a protected class and direct specific attorneys in the department to focus on the abolition of LGBT discrimination.\n\nGillibrand specifically noted decreasing the murder rate of transgender people as a Justice Department objective. According to the Human Rights Campaign, 23 trans people were killed in the U.S. in 2016, 29 in 2017, 26 in 2018, and five have been killed so far in 2019.\n\nRegarding families and children, Gillibrand outlined multiple policy plans focused on gay parents and children. She would codify gay marriage, nominate an Education secretary who focuses on LGBTQ issues, and ban conversation therapy – the controversial practice of coaching, sometime aggressively, gay children into believing they are heterosexual.\n\nIn the agenda, Gillibrand contrasted her policies with President Trump, claiming the president is a bigoted, cowardly bully who makes the LGBTQ community more vulnerable.\n\nGillibrand called to fully support the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was signed into law by former President Obama in 2009. The bill provides federal funding and assistance for hate crime investigations.\n\nThe senator's agenda also promised to fight LGBTQ homelessness. A 2017 University of Chicago study found that young people who are gay or transgender are 120% more likely to fall into homelessness than their peers.\n\nGillibrand – who supports Medicare for All – would require hormone therapy, treatments used to medically assist trans men and women transition, be covered by insurance.\n\nShe would also make PrEP, a leading HIV drug, more affordable, and repeal the FDA's regulation preventing gay men from donating blood if they have had sex twelve months prior to intended donation.\n\nGillibrand, who has been criticized for having more conservative views during her time as a member of the US House of Representatives, has touted her Senate voting record on gay rights on the campaign trail. Last month, Gillibrand visited Iowa's oldest drag club where she was interviewed by Marti Gould Cummings, a popular drag queen known from the TV series Shade: Queens of NYC. Sen. Gillibrand also was the first candidate to call for a third gender option on birth certificates.\n\nIn May, the senator proposed her Family Bill of Rights and has been an outspoken critic of restrictive abortion laws. The proposed LGBTQ agenda marks another moment for Gillibrand to show she is working to position herself as a champion for social issues.
Ein al-Basha, Jordan — Ammar Haj lives in a modest three-room apartment with his wife and five children. Every night they gather for a simple meal of lentils, rice and salad at their home outside the Jordanian capital of Amman.\n\nThis is the only time I get to see my children, Ammar told CBS News as he ate with his family. I usually have to be at work before they wake up in the morning.\n\nAmmar isn't from Jordan. He's one of 23,000 refugees who fled the village of Khirbet Ghazaleh in southwest Syria when it became an early battleground in Syria's vicious civil war — a conflict that's still raging a decade later, and still taking an unspeakable human toll.\n\nThe bombed-out, looted remains of buildings along a main road in the southwest Syrian town of Khirbet Ghazaleh are seen in a 2018 photo provided by the media organization Syria Direct. Syria Direct\n\nHis town was one of the first places seized by rebel forces. President Bashar Assad's army later reclaimed the ground, and razed most of the homes there in the process.\n\nNo other option\n\nSince the war started in March 2011, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) says it has driven unprecedented devastation and displacement, forcing more than 5 million people to flee their country and leaving another 6 million displaced within Syria's borders.\n\nI had no other option but to take my family and illegally cross into neighboring Jordan, Ammar told CBS News. His life as a refugee started in the sprawling Zaatari refugee camp in 2013, but he later moved to the town of Ein al-Basha, northwest of the capital.\n\nSyrian refugee Ammar Haj eats with four of his children at their home in Ein al-Basha, outside the Jordanian capital of Amman, March 9, 2021. CBS/Amjad Tadros\n\nI did all sorts of jobs to survive, said Ammar, who used to work in Syria as a land surveyor before the war. I worked in dirt, in construction, in factories — I did any job to be able to survive.\n\nNow he works in a clothing store, bringing home less than $260 per month. His income is supplemented with another $230 per month worth of food vouchers provided by UNHCR.\n\nMy income hardly lasts me and my family to the end of the month, Ammar told CBS News. We are living from hand to mouth.\n\nFour of Ammar's children came with him from Syria and a fifth was born in Jordan. Mohammed, his eldest, is now 16, and the proud father boasts that he's been the first in his class for the past two years.\n\nWith schools across Jordan closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the five children have been trying to keep on top of their studies remotely by sharing their mother's cell phone and an outdated tablet. Ammar said it has hit Mohammed, who loves to study, badly.\n\nGetting worse, not better\n\nPeople are at a breaking point, UNHCR senior communications advisor Rula Amin told CBS News. While the attention of the world has shifted from the Syria crisis and people tend to think that maybe it has become easier, with every passing year, it becomes more difficult, not easier for Syrian refugees.\n\nSelling Organs to Survive Millions of Syrians escaped the violence in their country. But some are now so short on money that they've taken to selling their organs just to pay the rent. Posted by Down to Earth by CBS News on Monday, August 12, 2019\n\nWhatever savings they had brought with them they have spent. Whatever patience they had brought with them, and the hope they had that they would go back very quickly and they can rebuild their lives again, is also disappearing.\n\nThat loss of both hope and resources is hitting children particularly hard, Amin said — and many of them even harder than Mohammed.\n\nThere's an increase in child marriage. There's an increase in refugee children who are engaged in child labor. There is an increase in violence against women and domestic violence, she told CBS News. Combined with COVID, past achievements and gains to help the refugees to be self-reliant and give them access to services like education and health services are being eroded.\n\nShe said that over the last year, UNHCR helplines have seen a significant increase of refugees calling to report self-harm and attempted suicides... There's a sense of desperation and people cannot cope.\n\nAmin called on the international community to find a way out of the conflict, and until that happens, she said support needs to be stepped up if we are to save the day. At stake is the future of a whole generation of Syrians, Syria and the region.\n\nFor the sake of my children\n\nIn 2016, Ammar applied with the U.S. government for refugee status, hoping to be relocated to America with his family.\n\nI submitted all my papers and did two interviews to go to the USA, he said. I am 45 years old now - it is too late for me, but I just hope that we will be able to go to the USA for the sake of my children.\n\nHe's still waiting to hear back about his application.\n\nIn the meantime, Ammar's had enough of life as a refugee, and of the seemingly endless cycle of war and blame preventing his return to what was once home.\n\nToo much blood has been spilled. We don't care anymore who is guilty and who is innocent, Ammar told CBS News. The international community has been supporting us, but this is not enough. We wish to go back to our country and live with honor and dignity.
The world of home renovation shows is full of TV couples, teaming up with their spouses to turn fixer uppers into dream homes. There's Chip and Joanna Gaines. There's the soon-to-be-divorced Christina and Tarek El Moussa. Plus, there's a slew of sibling duos, like Property Brothers' Jonathan and Drew Scott. But Bravo is introducing a new real estate couple in TV town and fans of the home improvement genre should probably brace for the renovation earthquake that's about to hit New York City.\n\nBethenny Frankel is teaming up with Million Dollar Listing's Fredrik Eklund.\n\nYou read that right: The tough-talking SkinnyGirl titan, known for taking no prisoners on Real Housewives of New York City, is going into business with the slickest realtor in the Empire State. She's going from a Bravo franchise, famous for flipping tables, into the world of flipping ultra luxury apartments.\n\nFredrik has very, very, very fancy taste, but he doesn't understand a budget, she tells CBS News. Now, it's his own money that he's investing. So, the better the price is -- and the less, you know, we have marble enrobing the toilet bowl -- the more we can make some actual money. And, you know, I'm not his client anymore. We're partners now, so I'm seeing under the hood. And I'm seeing how his whole thing really works. When he's telling everybody, 'This is the hottest neighborhood,' I'm like, 'Wait. But isn't Chelsea the hottest neighborhood? Isn't the Lower East Side the hottest neighborhood? Isn't Hudson Yards the hottest neighborhood? Isn't the Village the hottest Neighborhood?' You know, real estate people are salespeople. I'm a realist and I'm a straight shooter.\n\nIt's a business marriage made in Bravo drama heaven, as two of the biggest personalities to ever hit reality TV go head-to-head in pursuit of big transformations and even bigger pay-offs.\n\nI bought my apartment in TriBeCa several years ago and I renovated it. It's the possibilities that you see in an apartment that I think are amazing, Frankel tells CBS News. Fredrik has a different perspective on it. He just cares about the deal and the price. So, if it's brand new and there's nothing to do, like he sees that it's a good deal, he just wants to sort of flip it. Me? I want to go in and find something that's really raggedy and do that. I enjoy renovating. I find it therapeutic, believe it or not. People get stressed out by it. I love it. As long as I don't have to live in the place I'm renovating!\n\nEven so, however, Frankel reveals that both she and Eklund are anxious about the big-money risks they're about to be taking with the cameras rolling.\n\nWe're both nervous, she says. He's less nervous because he doesn't think that way. He sort of just thinks that everything he touches is going to turn to gold, and I'm more of a realist about that because I actually have built a business and I know how challenging it is. So, I think I bring his feet back to the ground.\n\nBack at it #Beklund @fredrikeklundny A post shared by Bethenny Frankel (@bethennyfrankel) on May 9, 2017 at 4:19pm PDT\n\nWell, she certainly isn't going to go easy on him. While CBS News was at SkinnyGirl HQ this week, Frankel made a call to Eklund to check on his progress filming and demand that more listings be sent her way.\n\nYou sent me four total listings and you're going on another trip, she prodded. Since we started this, which is weeks ago, you went to Thailand for over two weeks. You went to Paris and London. And now, you're going to Africa on safari. Yeah, so this is called grownup work. It's like real work. Like you have to actually work, not just be pretty and look cute in suits and sell apartments.\n\nBethenny Frankel, this is very simple, Eklund fired back over speakerphone. You have access to the same listings systems that I do. You're not my boss. I don't work for you ... You keep bringing up this Africa trip over and over again. I honestly think you're jealous.\n\nSo badly, Frankel retorted without skipping a beat. I want to wear khakis and listen to you talk about how beautiful you are.\n\nIf that candid conversation is any indication of what their new series, Keeping It Real Estate will be like, we're all in for quite the show. But it actually isn't the only new show on which fans will see Bethenny's wit on display this season. She's also set to swim with the sharks.\n\nNo, we don't mean Real Housewives. Frankel has signed on to be a guest judge on ABC's Shark Tank.\n\nI guess I am a shark after all. Watch out @sharktankabc - comin' for u this fall. Are you as excited as I am? #sharktank A post shared by Bethenny Frankel (@bethennyfrankel) on May 15, 2017 at 7:53am PDT\n\nI think it's a smart choice, she tells CBS News. You know, they're a little more conservative than I am. I think I bring something different to the table, which will be good. I mean, I've been that person with that idea, begging somebody to listen. You know, 'Anyone who will listen, please help me.' You've got be so intent and strong in your idea, and I was.\n\nShe's been in their shoes, but that doesn't necessarily mean she'll go easy on the contestants.\n\nDepends upon what they need to hear, she says. I think it's important to tell people how hard it is because you don't want to watch people blow their retirement fund on a pipe dream. I think I'm a realist, for sure.\n\nIn terms of her own business, Frankel's latest exploit is a line of low-sodium, all-natural deli meats, called Skinnygirl Market Fresh Deli.\n\nIt's a category that is grim in its variety, health and possibilities, she explains. As a mom who makes sandwiches for my kid, it's disgusting what's in that refrigerator ... Someone asked me before, would I do cheese? And I said, maybe, but I don't think so because cheese is good. There are good cheeses out there. In this category, everything's disgusting.\n\nQuick, easy, & so delish. Ur gonna love! Find at a @Publix near u @ the #linkinbio. #meatthenewgirls #skinnygirlhasgoodtaste A post shared by Bethenny Frankel (@bethennyfrankel) on May 11, 2017 at 12:17pm PDT\n\nWhen asked what her deli meats' Real Housewives tagline would be, she quickly responded: I'm salty and I'm sometimes sweet, but I'm always good for you.\n\nFrankel also opened up about her new charity, explaining that after the ugliness of her divorce from Jason Hoppy, she teamed up with Dress for Success on the B Strong Initiative because she wanted to do something to help women in crisis.\n\nI was going through a really negative personal time. And I felt depressed and lonely and just helpless, she tells CBS News. And then I beat myself up about that because I feel bad for feeling bad when I have such a blessed life, but your problems are still real, you know? Just 'cause you have a nice bed to lay on, you still feel emotionally upset. So, I decided to go to Dress for Success and said, I want to start a charity ... They have women that you help with their resumes and get them dressed and confident ... But these women that I'm talking about can't even get out of bed to get there and get a resume done. They really feel like they're in crisis. And I thought to myself, if I'm feeling so bad, what about a woman who can't put her lights on? What about someone who's dealing with a medical issue or financial issues, abuse?\n\nIt's a way for the Real Housewives star to find light in the darkness and give back. One area she can't find a whole lot of light, though? Her ongoing situation with fellow housewife Ramona Singer.\n\nThe infamous 2010 moment, in which Ramona Singer chewed Bethenny Frankel out on the Brooklyn Bridge, telling her that she had no friends and would surely screw up her relationship as well. Bravo\n\nRamona's always had this venomous streak, explains Frankel.\n\nAnd she says that the Heather Thompson phrase, Singer Stinger, makes it sound too light and sweet.\n\nThis is bad, she says. We haven't even begun this season. It's like a roller coaster and it's going to keep ticking to the top and then it's going to blow. It goes across the whole group, but definitely has to do with me. She's got something going on inside her about me and you end up finding out what it is. It comes out.
if you're lucky enough to have visited Paris, maybe you walked by it, and marveled at the red windmill. But have you ever been inside the Moulin Rouge? The famous Paris cabaret is the same age as the fabled Eiffel Tower – both opened 130 years ago.\n\nAt that time, it was the first building with electricity when it first opened, said Fanny Rabasse, who has been at the Moulin Rouge for a quarter-century.\n\nIt's really quite something when you look around, said correspondent Alina Cho.\n\nYes, and I like the warm atmosphere, the red. You know the little red lamps? They are made only for us, Rabasse said.\n\nThe Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris opened its doors in October 1889. CBS News\n\nThe Red Mill (that's the English translation for Moulin Rouge) sits in Montmartre, a section of Paris that was filled with windmills. A few still stand today.\n\nIt was a way to pay tribute to these windmills of Montmartre, said Rabasse.\n\nAnd why was it painted red? Because they wanted it to be seen from everywhere.\n\nIt didn't hurt that Joseph Oller and Charles Zidler, the two businessmen behind the Moulin Rouge, also put on an eye-popping show. Author Francesco Rapazzini said, Here was the party. Here were the girls. Here was the music. Here was the freedom. And here all the classes were mixed together. There were the bourgeois, there were the aristocrats, there were the laundry girls. There was everybody.\n\nThe chorus line at the Moulin Rouge cabaret in Paris. CBS News\n\nRapazzini said the Moulin Rouge attracted greats like Ernest Hemingway, Pablo Picasso and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the diminutive painter who came to the cabaret almost every night.\n\nHe lived not far from here, Rapazzini said. And he loved to be between the women. But he was a dwarf, and women escaped from him. And here he could be in the middle of them and see them dance and laugh and drink. And he loved to drink a lot, too.\n\nCBS News\n\nToulouse-Lautrec was behind the now-familiar posters for the Moulin Rouge, and the originals still hang there. He painted dancers like Jane Avril, the inspiration behind Nicole Kidman's character in Baz Luhrmann's 2001 movie.\n\nAnd the Moulin Rouge has even come to New York, in a hit Broadway musical set to modern-day pop songs. It is a show that, Tony Award-winning set designer Derek McLane points out, is not the real Moulin Rouge: This is the Moulin Rouge of the imagination.\n\nEven so, McLane visited the real Moulin Rouge to help him visualize the stage version. You know, I really wanted it to feel like this is the club, that you're transported to another world, he said.\n\nSo, McLane transformed almost every inch of the Al Hirschfeld Theatre from boring beige to raging red.\n\nIn John Logan's script, he describes this club very simply. He says, 'The club: sex and smoke,' laughed McLane.\n\nToday, the smoke is gone, but the Paris show is sexier than ever. Sixty women (and men) perform twice a night, 365 days a year.\n\nJanet Pharaoh, a former dancer herself, is an artistic director.\n\nCho asked, What are you looking for?\n\nI'm looking for very good dancers, good classical training, Pharoah said. The girls also need to be tall. At least 5'8, but really these days you're looking at more than 5'10 and going to 6-foot.\n\nAnd the can-can doesn't come cheap. Each elaborate handmade costume can cost $50,000.\n\nAustralians Amanda Chapman and Jessica Evans are long-time dancers.\n\nSome of the routines are very difficult, Chapman said.\n\nThe can-can is the hardest, I think, said Evans. I think the stamina to get from the beginning to the end, 'cause it's just so difficult.\n\nBackstage at the Moulin Rouge. CBS News\n\nAnd revealing. Most of the 90-minute show is performed topless.\n\nCho asked, There are people who are going to watch this and say, 'Do we need to see so many nude girls dancing on stage? Isn't it demeaning?'\n\nA topless dancer at the Moulin Rouge in Paris. CBS News\n\nThe 2,000 people watching the show tonight don't seem to think that, do they? Pharoah replied. And the girls don't think it. They're not forced to be here or do anything. They've come because they want to do it. … They're earning enough money to be totally independent at the age of 18. They are totally independent. They are reliant on no man.\n\nChapman said, We can do this and be so proud of our bodies and doing it in an artistic way, in a beautiful way. It's completely normal and it's OK.\n\nAfter 130 years, there is still something romantic about the Moulin Rouge – so much so, marriage proposals are common. But not all have a Hollywood ending.\n\nFanny Rabasse said, In the past, we used to agree that people can ask and do the proposal on the stage of the Moulin Rouge – after the show, of course. But one evening there was a guy from America. He took the microphone and he ask his girlfriend, 'Do you want to marry me?' And in front of 900 people, she said, 'No.' So from now on, we decided that there won't be any more proposals on stage. Now you can come and do your proposal at your table in a more intimate way. But that's it!\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nMoulin Rouge, Montmartre, Paris\n\nMoulin Rogue: The Musical at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre, New York City | Ticket info\n\nMoulin Rouge (2001), directed by Baz Luhrman (Official site), available on Digital Download, Blu-ray and DVD\n\nLe Moulin Rouge en folies by Francesco Rapazzini (in French), available in Trade Paperback and eBook formats via Amazon\n\n\n\nStory produced by Jay Kernis.
White House staffer David Sorensen has resigned amid allegations of spousal abuse, two White House officials confirmed to CBS News. Sorensen denied to the allegations to The Washington Post, which first reported the story.\n\nBefore we were contacted by the media, we learned last night that there were allegations, Deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah said. We immediately confronted the staffer, he denied the allegations and he resigned today.\n\nSorensen texted the Post he didn't want the White House to have to deal with this distraction.\n\nSorensen's ex-wife told the Post that he allegedly ran a car over her foot, put out a cigarette on her hand, threw her into a wall and she feared for her life when he grasped her menacingly by her hair while they were alone on their boat in remote waters off Maine's coast. At the time, Sorensen was working as a policy aide for Maine Gov. Paul LePage.\n\nSorensen told the Post in a statement that he had never committed violence of any kind against any woman in my entire life.\n\nIn fact, I was the victim of repeated physical violence during our marriage, not her, hesaid. He said he was considering a defamation suit against her.\n\nSorensen's ex-wife told the Post she reported his behavior to the FBI while they were conducting a background check. She said she didn't report the incidents at the time because of Sorensen's connections to law enforcement.\n\nA White House staffer told CBS News Sorensen's background check was ongoing, and his position did not require security clearance.\n\nA source told CBS News Sorensen was a low-level staffer who worked in the Executive Office Building.\n\nSorensen's departure comes in the same week that former staff secretary Rob Porter resigned after allegations that he abused his two ex-wives were published.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly has faced mounting questions about how much he knew about the allegations against Porter. Initially, Kelly defended Porter as a man of true integrity and honor, and I can't say enough good things about him.\n\nBy Wednesday night, Kelly said he was shocked by the new allegations released today against Rob Porter. Deputy press secretary Raj Shah said Thursday the White House could have handled the allegations better.\n\nShah said Thursday that Kelly only became fully aware of the allegations against Porter on Wednesday, but Shah wouldn't elaborate about what fully aware meant.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump said we certainly wish [Porter] well.\n\nAs you probably know, he says he's innocent, Mr. Trump said.

MORRO BAY, Calif.-- As marriage proposals go, Michael Banks' was a cliff-hanger.\n\nBanks, 27, scaled 600-foot Morro Rock on the Southern California coast Thursday morning to propose to his girlfriend live, on the Facetime app.\n\nThe good news, Morro Bay fire Capt. Todd Gailey said: The man's girlfriend said yes.\n\nThe bad news: Banks got stuck, and had to be plucked by helicopter for a tricky, post-proposal flight to safety.\n\nAfter the successful proposal, Banks took a different trail down, much steeper, Gailey said. He couldn't go any direction, on a sheer ledge, with his feet dangling 80 feet off the ground.\n\nRescuers called in a helicopter, and Gailey descended by cable to hoist Banks from the narrow ledge, with the rotors spinning near the cliff and the rotor wash battering both men.\n\nBanks was calm for most of the ordeal, but a little unnerved at that part, Gailey said.\n\nMorro Rock has been the site of several fatal falls over the years.\n\nCBS affiliate KCOY reported that Banks was cited for misdemeanor trespassing.\n\nThe man said nothing during the rescue about any second thoughts on his choice of setting for the proposal, the fire captain said.\n\nWhen it comes to such momentous moments, however, there's plenty of safe and beautiful areas that people can choose from where you're not in danger of falling off a cliff, Gailey said.
Being funny helped keep comedian Kevin Hart out of fights when he was growing up in a tough Philadelphia neighborhood, but it also kept him out of the dating world, he tells Tracy Smith in an interview for CBS' Sunday Morning, to be broadcast May 28.\n\nNobody wants to fight the funny guy, Hart tells Smith. Nobody wants to mess with the funny guy. Everybody wants to be around the funny guy. And that's what I was.\n\nWomen in those early days, however, had a different reaction to being around the funny guy, Hart recalled:\n\nNot gonna, not even going to lie to you. This would have been a perfect place to put that lie. It would have been a perfect place to put that lie. 'Yes, women were all over…' No, not the case. Not the case at all.\n\nWomen bring out a different side out of you. So it's, like, you can be cool and you can be funny. But to women, you can be goofy when it's time to not be funny. I didn't know how to shut the funny off with women. That was my problem when I was younger.\n\nKevin Hart with correspondent Tracy Smith. CBS News\n\nHart has put those days behind him, and is now married to model Eniko Parrish. The couple is expecting their first child together. Hart also has two children from a previous marriage.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, Hart (who has just written a new book, I Can't Make This Up: Life Lessons, published by Atria, a division of Simon & Schuster) talks with Smith about his childhood in Philadelphia, what he learned from his parents about life, and fatherhood.\n\nHe says the most important part about being a father is simply being there for the kids. Be there. Be present. Hands down. Hands down. Nothing else matters, Hart tells Smith. All the money in the world does not add up to time to a child.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning CBS Sunday Morning, hosted by Jane Pauley, is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET.

ALBANY, N.Y. -- During nearly four decades of marriage, Akosua Budu Amoako and her husband tried to have a child, without success. But last month, at age 59, Budu gave birth to her first child after fertility treatments.\n\nThe full-term 7-pound, 4-ounce boy was born June 15 at Bellevue Woman's Center in Niskayuna, near Albany. He's named after his father, Isaiah Somuah Anim.\n\nThey're doing super, very well, Dr. Khushru Irani, who delivered the baby, told The Associated Press on Monday. The couple, he added, are so happy about the whole thing.\n\nBudu said she and her 59-year-old husband, who live in Schenectady, had tried for years to get pregnant naturally after they married 38 years ago, but they eventually stopped trying. Then last year, after learning that a 60-year-old woman in the couple's homeland of Ghana gave birth to triplets after fertility treatments, the couple, both medical professionals at a local hospital, decided to try once again to have a child.\n\nIrani said he was apprehensive at first, noting the risks of complications that can arise from giving birth at such an advanced age.\n\nInitially, when I saw her, I'm saying no, it's not a good idea for your health to have a baby at your age, the doctor said. But they were very insistent and they wanted to try it out.\n\nBudu underwent in vitro fertilization at an Albany-area clinic using her husband's sperm and a donor egg. The entire process, from initial screening to successful fertilization, cost $20,000 and took about a year, the elder Amin told the newspaper.\n\nWe haven't gotten much sleep, but I feel fine and I think he already knows our voices, Budu told The Albany Times Union.\n\nThe couple, who came to the United States in 2005, are naturalized U.S. citizens.\n\nAnd our son is born an American, and a New Yorker, Amin said.
[This story originally aired on April 4, 2020. It was updated on February 20, 2021.]\n\nWhen police were called to the upscale Gainesville, Florida, home of Mike and Sue Reuschel in the early morning hours of February 3, 2018, they found the couple stabbed and bleeding.\n\nMike told cops an intruder had crept into their house and attacked them. But when Sue awoke from surgery for her life-threatening in juries, she gave police a different story—saying Mike was her true attacker.\n\nThe motive? Prosecutors say Sue told Mike that night that she wanted a divorce, and he attempted to kill her to avoid having to split his multimillion dollar fortune with her.\n\nThis case is about … the power of money, says prosecutor David Byron. It's about the power of desire for control.\n\nMike and his defense claim Sue was an abusive wife who was often in conflict with Mike over his daughter Caroline — and Caroline's expensive wedding only made things worse.\n\nThere's no way on God's green earth that my father would … stab anyone, says Caroline Reuschel. Never in one million years would I think that my wedding would be the catalyst for all of this.\n\nSo, what really happened that night?\n\nAN ATTACK\n\nPeter Van Sant: Where were you and how did you learn that your father on February 3rd, 2018, had been arrested?\n\nCaroline Reuschel: I was in Chicago with my husband. And I got … an incoming call on my cell phone and it was a recording that said, An inmate from the Alachua County Jail has called you.\n\nMinutes later, the phone rang again. Caroline Reuschel quickly answered and heard the voice she'd known her entire life.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: And he said, Caroline …you have to get me out of here … You need to call my lawyer. And I dropped to the sidewalk [crying] and I just sat on the sidewalk.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Mike Reuschel began to unwind very early that morning after he called police.\n\n911 OPERATOR: Tell me exactly what happened? MIKE REUSCHEL: I don't know. Someone's in the house and the next thing I know I wake up next to my wife and I'm bleeding.\n\nMike reported that he and his wife Sue had been stabbed by an intruder inside their home in an upscale section of Gainesville.\n\nOFFICER: So, you're fighting with the subject and then he just ran off, you managed to scare him off. MIKE REUSCHEL: Yeah, I guess.\n\nSue's injuries were life threatening and, as medics rushed to save her, Detective David Visconti was called to the scene.\n\nDet. David Visconti | Alachua County Sheriff's Office: [driving with Peter Van Sant]: There was no forced entry initially observed by any of our deputies.\n\nPeter Van Sant: No broken window, no knocked down door. Nothing like that at all?\n\nDet. David Visconti: No, sir.\n\nStill, Visconti had no doubt that something terrible had happened inside that house.\n\nThere was most certainly a struggle, Alachua County Sheriff's Detective David Visconti said of the bloody bedroom. Alachua County Sheriff's Office\n\nDet. David Visconti: There was most certainly a struggle … There was a vast amount of blood around the bed that was located on the wall of the bedroom …\n\nBut overall, the scene was missing something, Visconti said, and he did not believe a violent intruder had been there.\n\nDet. David Visconti: Typically, we'll see many things — knocked over, furniture, items broken, indentations in the walls, in the drywall.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you see any of that?\n\nDet. David Visconti: None of those things were present.\n\nWhat's more, the Reuschels had security cameras covering the outside the house.\n\nDet. David Visconti: The intruder allegedly fleeing the house from that direction is something that would have been captured on video.\n\nThe veteran detective was becoming suspicious. Then, hours later, Sue awoke from surgery and broke this case wide open — telling detectives that the story about an intruder attacking them was a lie. She claimed that Mike concocted the whole thing, and that he was her true assailant. Mike was arrested and charged with attempted murder.\n\nMike Reuschel was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of his wife Sue. Alachua County Sheriff's Office\n\nDidi Hoffman: … he could never have done anything like this.\n\nMike's ex-wife Didi Hoffman was incredulous.\n\nDidi Hoffman: I have known Michael James Reuschel since I was 19 … and I wouldn't be here today if I thought Mike was possibly capable of harming another person.\n\nDidi met Mike in college; they married and had two daughters, Caroline and Kate.\n\nPeter Van Sant: During your many years with Mike, was he ever physically abusive to you?\n\nDidi Hoffman: He never touched me. Not ever. Never.\n\nBut, like in many marriages, there were problems. Mike made millions in the technology business; his job required him to travel all over the world.\n\nDidi Hoffman: Truthfully, he wasn't around much, so it was — it was hard.\n\nIn 2005, after 25 years of marriage, Didi asked for a divorce. Didi said she moved out of the family home so their children, away at college, could always return to the house where they were raised. But soon, another woman unexpectedly joined the family.\n\nDidi Hoffman: I moved out in July … But then, all of a sudden … Susan moves into our house.\n\nSue was then 38 years old and a hospice nurse. She and Mike, 49, met on Match.com and Didi says Sue quickly became the lady of the manor. Didi says everything she left behind—including her dog—became Sue's.\n\nDidi Hoffman: Mike and I were really opposites. He was engaging and outgoing and …And I was really — and I think I still am — more reserved and … not quite so exuberant. And I think he was looking for exuberance.\n\nCaroline remembers the first time she met Sue at a dinner.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: And my dad seemed to be laughing and having a good time.\n\nBut Caroline says she couldn't help but notice how much Sue was drinking.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: We've never seen anyone take down five to six martinis and be able to stand and speak.\n\nSome two years after they met, Mike married Sue in August 2007. Mike stopped traveling and bought a local business. The couple's happier times are reflected in some of the thousands of text messages that surfaced during legal proceedings. Mike refers to Sue as his trophy bride, and writes that their lives together are simply amazing.\n\nFrom the outside, the Reuschels seemed happy and enjoyed a luxury lifestyle. Here they are photographed in Dublin in 2016. Michael Reuschel\n\nBut Caroline says Sue became jealous of the close relationship she had with her father and tried to keep them apart.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: She had such walls around him … He wouldn't call me unless he was in a car alone. He wasn't allowed to take my call in front [voice breaks] of her.\n\nBut surprisingly when Caroline announced in 2016 that she was getting married, Sue was happy to help. But, Caroline says, Sue wanted to do it her way.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: Sue was pretty adamant about throwing me a shower … My mother was invited, but none of my mother's friends were invited. So, the majority of the guests were Sue's friends and family\n\nBut Caroline admits the shower was a lot of fun and she was looking forward to the wedding. Sue helped her pick out a dress.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: I tried on a dress and I liked it … and Sue kept telling me like, this is your dress. This is your dress. It's so beautiful. You have to have this.\n\nCaroline Reuschel on her wedding day.\n\nSue handed over her credit card and it was done.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you mind me asking how much the dress was worth?\n\nCaroline Reuschel: Ugh. This is so gauche — I think it was 11.\n\nPeter Van Sant: $11,000?\n\nCaroline Reuschel: Yes.\n\nThe wedding itself in November 2017 would be a royal-like affair. The setting was the sumptuous Oheka Castle on Long Island. 160 people attended the wedding and Caroline says the day was magical.\n\n\n\nCaroline Reuschel: My husband and I know how lucky we are to have had that weekend … it was beyond beautiful.\n\nCaroline says it was nearly perfect except for something that caught her eye — an unusual mark on her father's face.\n\nJust before their walk down the aisle, a photographer captures the moment Caroline Reuschel notices a white scar down the left side of her father's face.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: The last thing I saw before walking down the aisle at my wedding was … this white scar from here to here [left cheek to chin]. And in my mind, I was, like, What is that?\n\nWeeks later, she found out. Michael revealed to Caroline a dark, disturbing secret: Sue, he said, had been physically abusing him for years.\n\nA TOXIC MARRIAGE\n\nCaroline Reuschel: I called him on his birthday…. And I said … How are you doing? And he just started crying.\n\nIt was late November 2017, just three weeks after her fairy-tale wedding, when Caroline says her father shared a disturbing secret about Sue that he had promised not to tell.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: And he said … Sue was arrested … And he said … 'she started attacking me. … and I think he was so victimized … that he was really scared to tell anyone.\n\nSue had been charged with domestic battery, but the details of what happened that day would not become public until two years later at Mike's trial for attempted murder, when they both testified about the last tumultuous months of their marriage.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What was the state of their marriage?\n\nDavid Byron | Prosecutor: I think it was in the lowest place that it could possibly be before divorce\n\nSUE REUSCHEL [in court]: I was upset.\n\nSue told prosecutor David Byron that shortly after Caroline's wedding, Mike told her it had gone nearly $150,000 over budget:\n\nDAVID BYRON: Was it fair to say that you were partially upset with the defendant, but mostly at Caroline? SUE REUSCHEL: Yes.\n\nMike says Sue attacked him when the fight escalated:\n\nMIKE REUSCHEL: She throws the phone at me and charges around the bed, pushes and starts her typical beating like this [bangs his fists].\n\nBut Mike didn't call 911 that day — Sue did:\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: I just felt as though things were a little out of control.\n\nSue Reuschel was arrested for domestic battery on November 20, 2017. The charge was later dropped. Alachua County Sheriff's Office\n\nWhen police arrived, Sue admitted to pushing Mike and agreed to go to their beach condo to defuse the situation. But she was arrested a half an hour later when she hadn't yet left the house:\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: He said, Please place your hands behind your back. You're under arrest.\n\nSue told the jury that she was ordered to stay away from Mike. She moved to their beach condo and got counseling for alcohol and anger management. Weeks later, Mike declined to pursue the battery charge and it was dropped.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did she have a problem with alcohol?\n\nSean Brewer | Prosecutor: Susan Reuschel has testified … that at times when she would drink, she would lose her temper.\n\nBut Mike says Sue's actions went way beyond a bad temper. He told the jury she had tormented him for years:\n\nMIKE REUSCHEL: She lunged at me again, punched in the face, scratched my face, punched me in the arms and bent my glasses, actually.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: She would throw things at him. Very heavy things like vases and very heavy coffee mugs.\n\nSue denies abusing Mike and Mike never reported any of the alleged incidents to police.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is it true that you have seen your father with a black eye?\n\nCaroline Reuschel: He's sent me multiple pictures of him with a black eye.\n\nMike did take photos of some injuries which he shared with Caroline and later, the jury.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: He has a picture … that he showed me …of his face gushing blood. And there was one mark from here to here [moving her finger from her right cheek to her chin].\n\nMkie Reuschel documented some of his injuries. Caroline Reuschel\n\nThe prosecution admits this injury may have been caused by Sue, but they say the evidence shows Sue was fighting for her life after Mike attacked her.\n\nDavid Byron: There are text messages where she accuses him of smothering her with a pillow, which in fact is the same instance that she ended up scratching him in the face.\n\nDespite the alleged abuse and Sue's arrest, Mike says he still loved his wife and wanted to stay married. In February 2018 he asked Sue to come to Gainesville for the weekend.\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: Mike had asked me to come in. …He wanted us to work on the marriage.\n\nThey decided to go to their favorite steak house. Sue is seen on home security video getting ready and enjoying a glass of wine. Mike arrives home, and the two share a kiss before heading out. But over steaks and more wine, old wounds reopened.\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: He had just received a text message from Caroline.\n\nSue says that's when Mike admitted he had betrayed her trust by telling Caroline about Sue's arrest.\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: He and I both agreed that we weren't going to discuss that.\n\nMike drove home alone. Sue followed in an Uber, her anger spilling into a series text messages about Caroline: Good luck with your bitch … She will ruin any relationship you have\n\nOnce home, they went to separate parts of the house. Sue continued her angry texts: I am filing for divorce. I will leave in the morning. The last text from Sue is sent at 10:13 p.m. You have serious boundary issues with your daughter.\n\nLater, Sue says she was alone in the guest room when Mike entered. There are no cameras inside that room:\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: And he just hopped on top of me … and I felt, like, this pressure … right here [leans back and gestures to her stomach]. And then all the sudden I saw a knife coming. … I said, Oh, my God Mike, did you just stab me? And he said yes. DAVID BYRON: At some point does he say something to you? SUE REUSCHEL: He said, uh, Sue, we're not getting a divorce.\n\nSue says Mike was on top of her, pinning her arms with his legs. In the struggle, her left thumb was sliced. Then, she says, Mike stabbed her again:\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: In my neck. Right here.\n\nSue says Mike then started slashing her wrist:\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: I felt like he was mutilating me. … My hand, it was like this [showing her scars]. I couldn't feel anything, and I could see into my arm\n\nSue Reuschel says Mike attacked her because she told him she was divorcing him that night. CBS News\n\nLosing blood, her life in danger, Sue says she vomited and lost control of her bodily functions. She says she tried to wriggle out from under Mike, and they ended up lying sideways across the bed:\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: He just said to me, Sue, we're just going to lay here until you die.\n\nSue says as she was lying there, struggling to stay awake, she saw Mike raise the knife yet again. Desperate, she offered him a way out.\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: I said, Michael we don't have to divorce. … I won't divorce you … he just put the knife down.\n\nSue says after Mike put the knife down, she begged him to call for help — but he would only do that if she agreed to say an intruder had stabbed her.\n\nSean Brewer: When she agrees … to go with his story of the intruders, she saved her life.\n\nA toxic marriage, texts brimming with hate, and a bloody room. Mike Reuschel's future will now depend on whether he can convince jurors that he is the real victim.\n\nMIKE'S CLAIMS OF ABUSE\n\n\n\nWhen first responders entered the bloody scene in the early morning hours of February 3, 2018, they'd been told by Mike Reuschel that a stranger had broken into their home and assaulted his wife — and then him — with a knife.\n\nBut in court, now with his defense attorneys Patrick McGuinness and Ann Finnell, Mike admits that story was a lie, and says he's finally ready to tell the truth. He says, despite Sue's drinking and violent outbursts, he was hoping to reconcile that night.\n\nMIKE REUSCHEL: I don't care if she's a mellow drunk the rest of her life. Just the anger's got to go.\n\nBut at dinner, once again, they fought about Caroline and that fight continued back at the house. After that, Mike and Sue's stories diverge. Mike says he came into the guest room a little after 10 p.m. and was startled to see Sue kneeling on the bed, holding a knife.\n\nMIKE REUSCHEL: I said Sue, give me the knife. And then next thing I know … I felt searing heat, that's — that's all I remember and I'm just trying to get my hands on it. And I'm on the bed with her now, we're all on our knees.\n\nMike doesn't say how he got his hands on the knife, but he says as they struggled and fell over on the bed, he felt the blade go into Sue's stomach.\n\nMIKE REUSCHEL: She's falling backwards and I'm falling in front and on top. I felt the knife penetrate here [pointing to his stomach] and I rolled off as fast as I could because I was afraid that if it went in her it would kill her.\n\nMike offers no explanation for how Sue was stabbed in the neck or thumb, but he does say about one minute into the struggle, he somehow calmed her down and put the knife out of reach.\n\nPATRICK MCGUINESS | Defense attorney: Now, you're both bleeding during this point in time, right? MIKE REUSCHEL: Yeah, but it's not spurting, and there's no blood at all you can see on Sue through the — through here [points towards his upper torso, where Sue was first stabbed]. MIKE REUSCHEL: I said, Sue, we need to go to the hospital. And she said, Then make up a story so I don't get arrested.\n\nMike says they argued about a possible cover story, but then, as bizarre as it sounds, they just lay together — bleeding — for several hours, having what Mike says was one of the best conversations of their lives about future vacations to Europe:\n\nMIKE REUSCHEL: We talked about … going to Germany on the Rhine and Moselle River cruise. … maybe we'd do Burgundy next.\n\nIf Mike is speaking the truth, this happy conversation happened on a bed soaked with blood and human waste. Mike never mentions that, and prosecutor David Byron suspects why.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is this believable?\n\nDavid Byron | Prosecutor: I don't think it's believable at all. ... He held her there and he can't admit that.\n\nDavid Byron: Michael Reuschel had months and months to go over the evidence and construct a story that fit with things that he couldn't admit.\n\nAccording to Mike, at about 3 a.m., their dog, Susie, wandered into this bloody scene, where violence was about to erupt again.\n\nMIKE REUSCHEL: I get up out of the bed to deal with the dog, and — and behind me was the knife. And next thing I know … She sliced her right wrist with her left hand. PAT MCGUINNESS Did you talk to her about why she had cut herself? MIKE REUSCHEL: Yeah, she said she doesn't want to go to jail. …I said, Sue, I'm not going to send you to jail. I'm not going to get you arrested. Calm down. She goes, You promise? You promise? I said, Yes.\n\nAs Mike tells it, Sue cooked up the whole idea to lie to police, and he reluctantly agreed in order to protect her.\n\nMIKE REUSCHEL: I said then the only chance I have is to turn the cameras off to give a window of opportunity to say someone broke in and did this to us.\n\nMike says after Sue cut her own wrist, he left the room to turn off security cameras and stage a break-in. Twenty-five minutes passed before he called 911 and turned the cameras on again.\n\nDavid Byron: And he's doing that with the knowledge that with every beat of her heart, more of her blood is pouring into that bed.\n\nBut the defense thinks the blood at the crime scene helps to prove their case.\n\nMichael Berkland: People lie. The forensics don't lie. And that's why the blood spatter was so important in this case.\n\nMichael Berkland is a former doctor and blood stain pattern analyst who testified for the defense.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What do you consider the most important blood evidence inside that bedroom?\n\nMichael Berkland: The arterial spurt patterns.\n\nBerkland says he reviewed records which stated a small artery in Sue's wrist was cut that night. And he believes the blood on the pillowcase and on the nightstand came from that artery.\n\nMichael Berkland: The important thing about arteries though is that you get blood coming out of that with every beat of the heart.\n\nBerkland uses stage blood and a small syringe to demonstrate the way Sue's blood may have travelled, making a line or fine spray of drops.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, the blood, in your opinion, gives us a timeline as to when Sue's wrist was actually cut.\n\nMichael Berkland: Correct… because arteries don't close up on their own.\n\nBlood spatter on the bedroom wall and nightstand. Alachua County Sheriff's Office\n\nRemember, Sue says the attack, including the cuts to her wrist, started sometime after 10:13 p.m. But Mike says Sue cut her own wrist at around 3 a.m. — hours later. Berkland says if Sue's wrist was cut before 11 p.m., she would have died long before help arrived.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How much time did she have to live, in your opinion?\n\nMichael Berkland: If the wounds happened no later than 11:00, she's dead before it ever hits midnight.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Which leads you to believe what?\n\nMichael Berkland: When it comes to this injury to the wrist, Michael's story makes more sense.\n\nThe defense team says if we can't trust Sue's account about what time things happened, then her entire story is suspect.\n\nANN FINNELL | Defense attorney: It is absolutely impossible to have happened the way she claims it did.\n\nWHO WAS THE TRUE AGGRESSOR?\n\nInside a box, encased in protective plastic, are the remnants of the vicious confrontation inside that bedroom that prosecutor Sean Brewer is certain contain evidence of an attempted murder.\n\nSean Brewer | Prosecutor: This is the knife that was used to stab Susan.\n\nPeter Van Sant: The bending in this knife you believe is a result of it … hitting bone, and … it bent the blade?\n\nSean Brewer That's correct.\n\nThe knife used in the attack. Alachua County Sheriff's Office\n\nPeter Van Sant: This is a lot of blood. Brewer: This is a lot of blood\n\nPeter Van Sant: This is Mike Reuschel's pajamas?\n\nSean Brewer: Yes, and they are soaked in blood.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And whose blood is that?\n\nSean Brewer: Well, Susan is the one who had the injuries that provided the mass amount of bleeding.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, if blood could talk, this blood is telling you what?\n\nSean Brewer: This blood is telling me that Michael … was on top of her while he was stabbing her, and she was bleeding quite a bit without any aid.\n\nProsecutors say this evidence backs up Sue's testimony that Mike attacked her. They also say the items on that bedside table help prove this was not a dynamic fight between two people. David Byron says that only one person had control of the situation: Mike Reuschel.\n\nDavid Byron | Prosecutor:: There's a full glass of wine, there's some glasses, there's a lamp. And its evidence of the fact that Michael Reuschel was so physically capable of constraining her that none of those things are disturbed.\n\nPolice and prosecutors believe the evidence in the Reuschel home shows Mike constrained Sue to the bed during the attack. Alachua County Sheriff's Office\n\nAnd the prosecution disputes defense expert Michael Berkland's claim that these stains on the nightstand came from spurting blood from Sue's wrist. Instead, their expert says the blood was most likely castoff— flung from the knife and not from Sue cutting her own wrist:\n\nDavid Byron: The castoff shows that he was swinging that knife as he's plunging it into her stomach and into her neck.\n\nProsecutor Brewer not only attacks Berkland's conclusions, he also challenges his credibility, letting jurors know that his medical license was suspended, and he was later arrested for storing body parts from autopsies in Tupperware containers — in an unusual place:\n\nSEAN BREWER: You were storing them at Uncle Bob's storage shed, weren't you?\n\nMICHAEL BERKLAND: In a climate-controlled room.\n\nSEAN BREWER: Were you storing them at Uncle Bob's Storage shed?\n\nMICHAEL BERKLAND: Yeah. SEAN BREWER: and the actual organs that you were storing included brains and hearts?\n\nMICHAEL BERKLAND: I did have some hearts and brains, yes.\n\nBerkland says the organs were preserved for private cases he was working on while he was still a licensed doctor.\n\nMICHAEL BERKLAND: I used the storage locker because they were safe and secured … either that or I put them in my house. This was safer than my house.\n\nSue Reuschel had injuries to her neck, stomach, wrist and thumb. Alachua County Sheriff's Office\n\nThe charges were later dropped. Prosecutors also want the jury to know that the severity of Sue's wrist wound suggests she did not do it herself:\n\nDavid Byron: The one that was truly life-threatening was the cuts that the defendant made to her wrist.\n\nSean Brewer: She was cut all the way down to the bone.\n\nMike's injuries were a lot less serious. He had some small cuts on his fingers and stomach. And Sue says the larger cuts to his forearms were, in fact, self-inflicted.\n\nSUE REUSCHEL: He put the knife in my hand … and he stabbed himself in the arm.\n\nAnd what about that story Mike told investigators that an intruder did all this? The prosecution says it was all his idea to cover up what he had done.\n\nSean Brewer: He turned off the cameras and did things to make the police believe that there had been a burglar.\n\nMike Reuschel says he lied about the intruder to protect Sue from getting arrested for attacking him. CBS News\n\nAnd the motive for this alleged attack? The prosecution believes it was all about money … that Mike didn't want to give up half his fortune — millions of dollars — in a divorce.\n\nDAVID BYRON: You didn't tell this jury … that after all you've been through, it didn't seem fair for Susan to take half your money? MICHAEL REUSCHEL: Yeah, that is true. It didn't seem fair.\n\nThe prosecution refutes Mike's claims that he still wanted to reconcile the troubled marriage by pointing out that he had visited three dating sites:\n\nDAVID BYRON: Ukrainian single girl, Irina. She's 18 years old, right? MIKE REUSCHEL: I looked at pictures of women with clothes on, yes, sir. DAVID BYRON: I understand they have clothes on, sir. The question I'm asking is, you were looking for your next girlfriend, right? MIKE REUSCHEL: No, I'll tell you exactly what I was looking for. DAVID BYRON: Sure. MIKE REUSCHEL: All I want out of a woman in my life is someone to be kind and nice to me. That's all I care about. … I looked at pictures and descriptions of … how they would treat their male. And Sue and I looked at these together many times in our relationship and say Sue that's all I need from anybody. Please be nice to me, please.\n\nThe defense counters that Mike's other internet searches prove that he was being abused by Sue:\n\nPAT MCGUINNESS: Did you visit numerous sites related to battered husbands? MIKE REUSCHEL: Yes, I did.\n\nBut the prosecution doesn't think it's credible that Mike was a battered spouse.\n\nDavid Byron: He has all of the economic resources. He's not cut off from any family members. … Michael Reuschel doesn't meet any of the criteria for what a battered spouse is.\n\nThe defense also tries to counter Sue's claim that Mike's attack came after she threatened divorce. They produced dozens of text messages going back to 2015 that show Sue had made that threat many, many times:\n\nANN FINNELL: You actually say, for the 50th time, I want a divorce. SUE REUSCHEL: It's just an expression, like saying for the, you know, one hundredth time. ANN FINNELL: But it is about 50 times, isn't it? SUE REUSCHEL: I don't know. I didn't count.\n\nAnd defense attorney Ann Finnell suggests those texts also reveal Sue's destructive intentions:\n\nANN FINNELL: Have you told him I hate you? SUE REUSCHEL: Yes. ANN FINNELL: OK. You've said, I will destroy you. SUE REUSCHEL: Yes. ANN FINNELL: And on your anniversary in 2017, hate u … Happy 10th anniversary. I'm divorcing u … U d—k. You said that? SUE REUSCHEL: Yes.\n\nIn her closing argument, Finnell insists Mike would never try to kill for money. She says Sue was the aggressor that night, and Mike was just defending himself:\n\nANN FINNELL: She hates everybody. She hates his daughters; she hates his former spouse … That's how hateful this woman was and is.\n\nBut the prosecution says there is no question Mike wanted Sue dead.\n\nDAVID BYRON: This is not a frenzied struggle between two adults. This is a blood bath committed by one person who has imprisoned the other on that bed.\n\nIn the war of the Reuschels, jurors will soon decide which one they believe.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nPeter Van Sant: As the jury goes out to deliberate — what are those minutes and hours like for you?\n\nCaroline Reuschel: [Crying] I just, like, couldn't talk to anyone. I spent the past year-and-a-half, like, mentally preparing myself for the worst and hoping for the best.\n\nCaroline does not have long to wait. After a 9-day trial, it took little more than 4 hours for the jury to reach a verdict.\n\nPeter Van Sant: They say a quick verdict is often a prosecutor's verdict.\n\nDavid Byron: It's a thought that creeps into your head … but you never really know what a jury is going to do.\n\nJUDGE: Members of the jury, I understand you have reached a verdict? JURY FOREPERSON: We have your honor. JUDGE: Would you please pass it to my bailiff? FOREPERSON: We the jury unanimously find as follows defendant Michael James Reuschel in this case, as to count 1 the defendant is guilty of attempted first-degree murder as charged.\n\nGuilty. Mike Reuschel is convicted of the most serious count against him.\n\nCaroline Reuschel reacts when hearing her father's guilty verdict. CBS News\n\nCaroline Reuschel: We were all so shocked.\n\nFOREPERSON: As to count two, the defendant is guilty of false imprisonment ...\n\nIn quick succession, the jury also finds Reuschel guilty of four additional crimes including false imprisonment and tampering with evidence.\n\nJurors utterly reject Mike's story of a knife fight with his wife. Prosecutor Sean Brewer says justice was served to a man who lied to investigators and to the jury.\n\nSean Brewer | Prosecutor: Michael went through great lengths to try and kill Susan. He just wasn't very good at it.\n\nAnd what's more, Brewer says, Mike Reuschel tried to kill Sue not once but twice. While he was in jail awaiting trial, an informant came forward to claim Mike tried to hire a hit man to kill Sue — a charge Mike strongly denies.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you believe that your father, in jail, plotted to hire someone to murder his wife?\n\nCaroline Reuschel: No … honestly, I don't mean to laugh. But it is beyond laughable.\n\nAs we were interviewing Caroline, she got a phone call that surprised us.\n\nCaroline Reuschel: Dad? Hi! I'm good. I'm — with 48 Hours right now, literally — with cameras.\n\nMike Reuschel allowed Van Sant to ask a few questions.\n\nCaroline Reuschel answers a call from her father while talking with '48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant. CBS News\n\nPeter Van Sant: Mike … I just wanna hear you tell me…. Did you … take a knife into the room that night on February 2nd, 2018, and attack your wife?\n\n\n\nMike Reuschel: Absolutely not.\n\n\n\nPeter Van Sant: And you're telling me the truth?\n\nMike Reuschel: Absolutely. On my children's lives … all I did was defend myself … when I got attacked.\n\nIn December 2019,, everyone returns to Judge William Davis' courtroom for sentencing. The victim in this crime, Sue Reuschel, does not appear in person.\n\nWhen it's Caroline's turn to speak, the moment is charged with emotion:\n\nCAROLINE REUSCHEL: [Crying]: No one is as positive, generous and caring as this man… I will say I am and will always be a proud daughter. MATT F.: He is one of the most caring, kind gentle people I have ever met.\n\nSeveral colleagues and friends speak of Mike in glowing terms:\n\nJENIFER L: He's a good person. CLAYTON C.: The Mike Reuschel I know is a stand-up gentleman.\n\nThen, Judge William Davis took center stage. Mike was about to learn his fate.\n\nJUDGE WILLIAM DAVIS: The person I heard through the evidence and the witnesses was someone who was cold, they were brutal … On count one, the attempted first-degree premeditated murder, I'm going to sentence you to 30 years imprisonment.\n\nMike Reuschel, 64, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. CBS News\n\nAll told, the judge gives Reuschel 30 years, not the 50 years requested by prosecutors. But for Mike, who is 64 years old, it is, in essence, a life sentence.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Here are two sophisticated people, very wealthy, living in paradise, one of most beautiful parts of Florida and yet they couldn't work this out … It's a real tragedy, isn't it?\n\nDavid Byron: Absolutely. I mean, when you hear who Michael and Susan Reuschel were before this all occurred, they lived exemplary and mostly normal lives. And to see it get to this point … really is a tragedy.\n\nThe war of the Reuschels is not over. Mike and Sue are divorcing and continue to fight over the marital assets, including the house where Sue was nearly stabbed to death.\n\nThe murder-for-hire charges against Mike Reuschel were dropped.\n\nProduced by Sarah Prior, Paul LaRosa and Dena Goldstein.

NORRISTOWN, Pa. — The judge in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial rejected demands Thursday from the comedian's defense lawyers that he step aside because his wife is a social worker and advocate for assault victims.\n\nJudge Steven O'Neill said at a pretrial hearing that he's not biased or prejudiced by his wife's work and that the assertion that he shares the same views as his wife or has let his rulings be influenced by her profession is faulty, plain and simple.\n\nCosby's lawyers are in court Thursday making a last-ditch effort to postpone the comedian's sexual assault retrial after losing their bid to overturn O'Neill's ruling allowing up to five additional accusers to testify.\n\nJury selection is scheduled to begin Monday, but Cosby's lawyers could appeal that decision to the state Supreme Court.\n\nThe 80-year-old Cosby faces charges that he drugged and molested former Temple University athletics administrator Andrea Constand at his home in 2004.\n\nAs Cosby's lawyers are battling with O'Neill, who also oversaw his first trial, they also are counting on him to make critical rulings to bolster their defense that Constand is a money-grubbing liar.\n\nThe judge's wife, Deborah O'Neill, is a psychotherapist at the University of Pennsylvania and coordinates a team that cares and advocates for student sexual assault victims.\n\nCosby's lawyers emphasized their concern over a $100 donation made in Deborah O'Neill's name to an organization that gave money to a group planning protests outside Cosby's retrial.\n\nO'Neill said the donation was made 13 months ago by the university department where his wife works and that it wasn't a personal donation using her own money or their joint assets.\n\nHow are my wife's independent views of an independent woman connected to me? O'Neill said. She's an independent woman and has the right to be involved in anything that she believes in.\n\nO'Neill said Thursday that Cosby's old lawyers raised the prospect of having him step aside in December 2016, but never followed through. He added that he could've rejected the recusal request simply because Cosby's lawyers waited too long to ask.\n\nHe said they were aware of Deborah O'Neill's work as far back as December 2016, but that they waited until getting several adverse rulings just before retrial to raise it as an issue.\n\nO'Neill spoke glowingly about his wife and said it was difficult to have her accomplishments trivialized in a legal motion. He said Cosby's lawyers had presented an antiquated view of marriage where spouses must agree on everything.\n\nWhat we do not share are unified views, O'Neill said, adding that his wife's views, do not influence me one iota.\n\nThe defense request for the judge to step down was just one of the issues being argued during the pretrial hearing Thursday.\n\nCosby's lawyers want permission to call a witness who says Constand told her that she was not assaulted but could make up allegations to sue and get money, and they want jurors to hear how much Cosby paid her in a 2006 civil settlement.\n\nProsecutors, who have decried the defense attacks on O'Neill as a thinly veiled attempt to delay and pollute the jury pool, are looking for the judge to keep out talk of a prior investigation into Constand's allegations and a recent political race where putting Cosby behind bars was at issue.\n\nProsecutors say former District Attorney Bruce Castor's stated reasoning that he did not charge Cosby in 2005 because the case was weak and he wanted him to speak freely in a civil deposition is irrelevant to the case at hand.\n\nThey say Castor's unsuccessful campaign against current DA Kevin Steele in 2015 and his ongoing legal skirmish with Constand also are irrelevant.\n\nSteele's predecessor, Risa Vetri Ferman, reopened the investigation in 2015 after The Associated Press fought to unseal parts of Cosby's deposition testimony — including lurid passages about him giving drugs to women he wanted to have sex with. Cosby was charged shortly before the statute of limitations was set to expire.\n\nDocuments made public showed that prosecutors have chosen model Janice Dickinson as one of the women they plan to have testify. She says Cosby drugged and raped her in Lake Tahoe in 1982.\n\nThe AP does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand and Dickinson have done.
You're just starting work on a major home improvement project when your insurance agent calls. You need more coverage, he says. But the real question is: How did he even know you were building an addition? Did he smell the sawdust or hear the hammer?\n\nNeither. Thanks to a supercomputer owned by LexisNexis, the data analytics subsidiary of London-based RELX Group (RELX), your insurance company knows so much more than that.\n\nVery little in your life isn't known, said Victor Bayus, who runs the new Active Insights program at LexisNexis. It enables other companies to predict, assess and manage risk.\n\nBayus' program allows insurers to find out as much as possible about you to market new products to you, get you to increase your coverage or, if you've done something wrong, like driving while intoxicated, either raise your premium or drop your coverage. Newly divorced? New driver in the family? Newborn baby? New business venture? You could say it knows just about everything.\n\nInsurers themselves do this, too, but they don't know as much about you, and their methods are more obvious, such as direct mailings.\n\nThat's why they hire LexisNexis, which collects information from 10,000 sources, including 45 billion public records that tell the story of birth, marriage, home ownership and death. It also has a proprietary database of home improvement permits throughout the U.S. And with the help of utility bills, LexisNexis can tell when you move in, move out or if your house is vacant.\n\nBusinesses affiliated with LexisNexis also contribute to its bulging database. They include auto, home, life and business insurers. Even though they're competitors, these insurers all submit their data to LexisNexis for crunching.\n\nUntil recently this expansive amount of data was mostly used to verify information like a fender bender or house fire. But supercomputing -- and LexisNexis has one with more power than 4 million desktops combined -- changes the playing field and allows insurers and other companies to use predictive analytics.\n\nHow does it work? LexisNexis sorts its data into 15 life events and drills down to the individual to find out his needs, wants and, yes, even his vulnerabilities, such as auto accidents and moving violations. Other life events include first-time homeownership, foreclosures and home inspections.\n\nThen it passes this information along to insurers, which can contact their own policyholders and ask certain questions to which they already know the answers. Your insurer may even know if you're shopping for another policy.\n\nThe Active Insights brochure gives the example of a teenager who has just turned 16 years old. The insurer wants to know if he's driving, or about to, and if the policyholder plans to include him on the policy. But the policyholder could be shell-shocked by the 79 percent increase and so may start shopping for a cheaper policy.\n\nBy calling the policyholder and working with him, the current insurer is more likely to get him to retain the policy, albeit at a higher rate.\n\nWe target customers at their point of need and engage them. We don't see this as a negative for the consumer. We want to provide a helpful answer, said Bayus. In other words, LexisNexis is trying to be both bad cop and good cop.\n\nAs an example, Bayus recounts his own experience when he got a call that someone might be using his credit card. His credit card company knew it wasn't him because it already knew his purchase history. In that case, more information was helpful, Bayus pointed out.\n\nThe recommendation that Active Insights provides goes to the insurance company, not the consumer. And the data that determined the recommendation is locked in the supercomputer and labeled private.\n\nThere are certain regulations that our data lives under, said Bayus. We only provide it to insurers for their existing book of business, and if they make their customers angry, they lose business and don't get value from it. So, we give them recommended things to say.\n\nPeople can change their auto or home insurer, but they can't get LexisNexis out of their lives unless they go off the grid. When you apply for car insurance you give the insurer permission to check out your background. If you have a home mortgage, chances are that an insurer, and LexisNexis, will be watching.\n\nLexisNexis isn't the only company vying for the top seat in the realm of supercomputing and data analytics for insurers. Credit reporting agencies like TransUnion (TRU) are also trying to gain an edge. And insurers have their own number-crunchers supplying data to their agents and salespersons.\n\nIn a world where every keystroke is often recorded, don't think for a second you can remain anonymous.
Through eight grueling years of the Revolutionary War, and another eight as the first President of the United States, George Washington was sustained by a dream … of the day he would return to Mount Vernon, his beloved plantation high above the Potomac River, where at 65 years old he aspired to a peaceful retirement as a farmer.\n\nBut that's not quite how it turned out. He got anything but a peaceful retirement, said biographer Jonathan Horn. His retirement was filled with controversy, intrigue, and personal torment.\n\nGeorge Washington's home at Mount Vernon, Va. CBS News\n\nHorn is the author of Washington's End: The Final Years and Forgotten Struggle (published by Scribner, a part of ViacomCBS), which begins where most Washington biographies end – as he rode off into the sunset.\n\nScribner\n\nBut at Mount Vernon, he quickly became restless. Horn compares him to a lion in a cage.\n\nHe was waiting for news from the capital of Philadelphia … he'd be pacing back and forth, Horn said. He could go for miles on this piazza.\n\nThe year was 1798. France was attacking American ships at sea, and war with the former ally seemed imminent. Washington was named commander in chief of the new army, even though, according to the Constitution, that title belonged to President John Adams. Even though, Washington accepted the position, and just over a year after stepping down as president, he was back in Philadelphia.\n\nSo, he just couldn't let go? said CBS News chief Washington correspondent Chip Reid.\n\nIt was really hard to let go, Horn said. He had created this country. This country is his legacy. And he's worried about what's going to happen to it.\n\nHis prized reputation took a beating, as enemies – including former friends Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and James Monroe – condemned him for acting like a king.\n\nSo, that should dispel the idea that all of our founding fathers were good friends, said Horn.\n\nIn a remarkable parallel to today's politics, Washington's Federalist Party accused France of meddling in the presidential election at the request of Jefferson and his fellow Republicans.\n\nThe so-called quasi-war with France soon cooled off, and Washington returned to Mount Vernon. Though he was just 66 years old, he was plagued with a series of torments, including his health.\n\nAs Horn writes: His hands are not as steady as they once were. His back stoops. His hearing has weakened but not so much that he does not hear the whispers about his senility. His memory, always bad, has become worse. His vision has declined.\n\nBut perhaps worst of all, his teeth were gone, replaced by dentures, not made of wood as the old story goes, but of ivory, animal teeth, and human teeth (possibly from enslaved people he owned). It's no wonder Washington rarely smiled.\n\nGeorge Washington's dentures. CBS News\n\nAs for his relationship with Martha Washington in those final years, Horn said, By this time in his life he will tell you that marriage is the great joy of life.\n\nBut he and Martha were raising two grandchildren from her first marriage, and even the Father of Our Country struggled to keep up with the demands of parenthood. He's constantly disappointed by Martha's grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, said Horn. He keeps dropping out of schools. The boy promises to do better, he never actually does.\n\nDespite his good relationship with Martha, he still appeared to have strong feelings for Sally Fairfax, a married woman he had loved in his youth.\n\nWe know that because he wrote a letter to Sally Fairfax, said Horn, and he said all of the things he had done in his life since then had not brought him as much joy as the time he spent with Sally Fairfax as a young man.\n\nOther family secrets may be lost forever because, tragically for historians, Martha burned almost all of their letters to protect their privacy.\n\nCBS News' Chip Reid with Doug Bradburn, president and CEO of Mount Vernon. CBS News\n\nReid asked Doug Bradburn, president and CEO of Mount Vernon, What did this place, Mount Vernon, mean to George Washington?\n\nThis was home for him. It was his sanctuary, he replied.\n\nBradburn said, despite all the challenges here, Washington did fulfill some of his dreams: He became a pioneer of modern farming, experimenting with seeds and fertilizers, and he built one of the nation's largest whiskey distilleries.\n\nBradburn showed Reid Washington's study: I like to call it his man cave. I mean, this is where he loved to do his work, massive correspondence, corresponding with people all over the world.\n\nGeorge Washington's desk. CBS News\n\nSuccessful as he was, it's important to note that Washington would have never done well as a farmer and businessman without the 300-plus enslaved people who toiled at Mount Vernon. Bradburn said that during the war Washington's views on slavery changed in part due to the heroism of black soldiers.\n\nHe hopes there's some way that legislation will be passed to end slavery, he said.\n\nBut his actions sometimes contradicted his words. According to Horn's book, Washington said that getting work out of his slaves sometimes required a little of the overseer's whip. He remained a slave-owner until his death.\n\nGeorge Washington passed away in his and Martha's bedchamber. And, sadly, what a grim death it was, from a throat infection, easily cured with antibiotics today. His doctors repeatedly bled him (the practice at the time) of about five pints of blood, which only made him weaker.\n\nSaid Bradburn, He basically suffocated to death.\n\nThe father of our country suffocated to death, in his bed? asked Reid.\n\nIt's a brutal way to go.\n\nGeorge and Martha Washington's bed chamber. CBS News\n\nWhen death was near, he dressed in fine clothes. Surrounded by family, doctors, and slaves, his last words were simply: 'Tis Well. George Washington was 67 years old.\n\nHe went out in that sort of stoical fashion that he wanted to project, said Bradburn, and he knew people would be telling this story for centuries. And so, he wanted to do it in style.\n\nGeorge Washington let go of life like he let go of political power: bravely, and with one eye on history.\n\nREAD AN EXCERPT: Washington's End by Jonathan Horn\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Maggie Dore.
Americans are growing more convinced than ever that climate change is having an impact on our world, and the issue is becoming a more important part of their lives. That is the conclusion of a new report by the Yale Program on Climate Communication and George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication, based on a survey of Americans nationwide.\n\nAbout 72 percent of Americans now say that climate change is important to them, an increase of 9 percentage points since last March, and a 16-point increase since March 2015.\n\nIn addition, the number of Americans convinced that climate change is mostly caused by humans has spiked to 62 percent, a jump of 8 points in just one year.\n\nMy bet is that we've entered a new era of public concern about climate change says Dr. Ed Maibach, director of the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication.\n\nAn October 2018 CBS News poll found a similar result, with 61 percent of Americans saying global warming is human-caused, up 7 percent from April 2018. Four years earlier, an AP-GFK poll found only 33 percent were extremely or very confident that was true.\n\nProfessor Michael B. Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, is cautiously encouraged. Sometimes public opinion shifts quickly, as it did with smoking and same-sex marriage, he said.\n\nMaibach feels that may be happening now with climate change. We appear to have reached an inflection point in that half of Americans now see climate change as happening here, now, to us — and they feel that they and/or members of their family will be harmed by it.\n\nClimate change has often been thought of as a distant problem whose impact might appear decades or centuries in the future. But recent studies show that extreme weather over the past few years has been supercharged by climate change. People are connecting the dots through their real-life experience.\n\nMore Americans are now personally experiencing concrete, harmful impacts from climate change with their own eyes. People are more convinced when they learn experientially than when they learn analytically, says Maibach.\n\nThe numbers in the Yale-George Mason study support that. About half of Americans surveyed believe this past year's extreme events, such as Hurricanes Florence and Michael and the California wildfires, were made worse by climate change.\n\nFurthermore, nearly half of Americans (46 percent) now say they have personally experienced the effects of global warming, an increase of 15 percentage points since March 2015.\n\nBut opinions vary widely based on political affiliation. The CBS News poll found 85 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of independents agree climate change is caused by human activity. While most Republicans acknowledge climate change is happening, only 34 percent of them agree humans are responsible.\n\nAnother large gap in perception emerges when people are asked about the scientific consensus on this issue. According to the Yale-George Mason study, only 1 in 5 Americans realize there is overwhelming scientific agreement that climate change is caused by humans. This is called the Consensus Gap.\n\nVarious studies have indeed shown that approximately 97 percent of climate scientists are convinced climate change is caused mainly by humans.\n\nIf the public understood that virtually all climate scientists were convinced that human-caused climate change was happening, and that it was serious, then the public would demand action, Maibach explains.\n\nScientists warn that fast and bold action is needed to avoid what some have called an unprecedented climate future. But so far congressional action on climate change has been slow, and President Trump has cast doubt on whether any action is necessary.\n\nMaibach believes the public's increasing concern about climate change will make a difference, especially when politicians are convinced that their voters will hold them accountable for taking action or not taking action.\n\nGerrard feels that we may be reaching a threshold. The cascade of alarming scientific studies, the unprecedented wildfires, hurricanes and floods, and the activation of young voters who see their futures at risk may be giving action on climate change an unstoppable momentum.
Just days before Mother's Day, a source confirms to ET that Janet Jackson is pregnant with her first child.\n\nThe baby news comes after the 49-year-old singer -- who will turn 50 on May 16 -- announced last month that she will be postponing her tour to start a family with husband Wissam Al Mana.\n\nWe're in the second leg of the tour and there actually has been a sudden change, Jackson explained in a video posted to Twitter on April 6. I thought it was important that you be the first to know. My husband and I are planning our family, so I'm going to have to delay the tour.\n\nPlease, if you could try and understand that it's important that I do this now, Jackson asked of her fans. I have to rest up, doctor's orders. But I have not forgotten about you. I will continue the tour as soon as I possibly can.\n\nJackson secretly wed Al Mana in 2012, but didn't confirm the news until early 2013. This is the singer's third marriage.Check out ET's behind-the-scenes look at Jackson's new music video for Dammn Baby.
DUBLIN -- An abortion debate that has inflamed passions in Ireland for decades will come down to a single question on Friday: yes or no?\n\nThe referendum on whether to repeal the country's strict anti-abortion law is being seen by anti-abortion activists as a last-ditch stand against what they view as a European norm of abortion-on-demand, while for pro-abortion rights advocates, it is a fundamental moment for declaring an Irish woman's right to choose. couple\n\nIf the yes side prevails and the constitutional ban on abortions is repealed, the government plans to introduce legislation that would allow abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and later in specific cases when the woman is at grave risk or the fetus is likely to die in the womb or shortly after birth. Parliament would then debate this plan.\n\nOpinion surveys suggest a continuing change of attitudes in Ireland, a traditionally Roman Catholic country that surprised many by voting in favor of same-sex marriage in 2015. Both sides generally agree that the frenzied campaign ahead of Friday's vote has not produced the dramatic shift in public opinion that anti-abortion campaigners were hoping for.\n\nStill, David Quinn of the socially conservative Iona Institute says the no forces opposed to abortion rights still have a fighting chance, and recalled other recent political upsets.\n\nRemember: Brexit wasn't supposed to pass, and Donald Trump wasn't supposed to get elected, he said.\n\nActivists from both sides have put up thousands of emotional signs pleading their case and there were small demonstrations in Dublin on Wednesday as the vote neared.\n\nFriday's poll will be the fourth time in as many decades that Irish voters have been asked to decide on the issue of abortion.\n\nBut this time the debate has been roiled by two factors that voters have not faced before: The extraordinary power of social media and the increased availability through telemedicine websites of new drugs that allow women to make profound decisions over whether to end a pregnancy in the privacy of their homes.\n\nFacebook and Google have both taken steps to restrict or remove ads relating to the referendum in a move designed to address global concerns about social media's role in influencing political campaigns, from the U.S. presidential race to Brexit.\n\nAt the heart of this vote is whether or not to reverse a far-reaching 1983 referendum that inserted an amendment into Ireland's constitution that committed authorities to equally defend the right to life of a mother and that of a fetus from the moment of conception.\n\nThe issue has been revisited repeatedly after heartrending hard cases that, abortion rights activists say, exposed vulnerable women to miserable choices - and even, at times, death.\n\nAbortion is legal in Ireland only in rare cases when the woman's life is in danger, and several thousand Irish women travel each year to terminate pregnancies in neighboring Britain. That number has fallen dramatically in recent years as women turned to online websites to illegally import drugs that end pregnancies.\n\nOne woman who flew to the Netherlands for an abortion she could not get at home says she is voting yes to support others in a similar predicament.\n\nTara Flynn was 37 when she found out she was pregnant. She had used the day-after contraceptive pill but it failed.\n\nI felt trapped in my body and trapped in my country, said Flynn, now 48. And because of the eighth amendment I didn't even know where I could turn to for help.\n\nAfter researching online, Flynn traveled to Amsterdam for the abortion. She said she felt isolated, ashamed and excluded when she returned.\n\nA vote for 'yes' tomorrow isn't a vote for abortion, it is a vote for solidarity, it is a vote for compassion, she said. It is a vote to say, I don't send you away anymore.\n\nSinead Fidgeon told CBS News that she would be voting no.\n\nI think what we are expected to vote on tomorrow is removing the rights of the unborn child, and that's what I don't want, she said.\n\nThe Irish Times said in its editorial Thursday that the constitutional abortion ban must be repealed because it has left doctors confused as to what is legal, and led women to travel abroad in secrecy and shame for abortions.\n\nIt cited as the type of grotesque spectacle the ban has caused the case of a 14-year-old who became pregnant and suicidal after being raped. She had to go to the Supreme Court after the government blocked her from traveling to get an abortion.\n\nPro-abortion rights activists have sought to focus public attention on the difficult cases, including the fate of Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old Indian dentist who had sought and been denied an abortion before she died after a miscarriage in a Galway hospital on Ireland's west coast in 2012. The man who led the Irish health service's inquiry into her death has called for the constitutional ban on abortion to be repealed.\n\nIn an effort to neutralize the hard cases argument, some prominent anti-abortion campaigners have lately shifted their stance, even suggesting that new laws could be enacted to permit abortions in certain limited cases.\n\nBut that compromise was dismissed by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, a medical doctor who favors repealing the constitutional ban. He said it is the country's hard laws that create hard cases.\n\nFriday's referendum has placed the abortion debate on center stage, with many on Dublin's crowded city streets wearing buttons or T-shirts that align them with the yes or no side.\n\nAn elderly Dublin man, John Byrne, wore a no button on his lapel.\n\nI believe in life. I believe God is the giver of life, the 78-year-old said, adding that he credits God with helping him overcome alcohol addiction.\n\nI drank, and I remember sleeping in the bushes in Merrion Square. God bailed me out. ... It's high time I did something for him, he said. We've gone too liberal in Ireland altogether, and we would be better off if we respected our Christian values.\n\nVoting has already started on remote Tory Island, off Ireland's northwestern coast. A helicopter landed Thursday with a ballot box that will be brought back to the mainland for counting after the roughly 70 residents have voted.
LONDON -- Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and model-actress Jerry Hall married Friday at an aristocratic palace in London.\n\nThey were photographed emerging with smiles Friday from Spencer House, which was built in the 18th century by ancestors of the late Princess Diana. The 84-year-old groom wore a business suit; the bride, 59, was in a navy skirt and a trench coat.\n\nMurdoch's News U.K. confirmed Murdoch and Hall, who announced their engagement in January, had married.\n\nIt is the fourth marriage for Murdoch, who owns Fox News Channel, movie studio Twenty-First Century Fox, publisher HarperCollins and newspapers in Britain and the United States. Murdoch has six children from his three previous marriages.\n\nIt is the first marriage for Texas-born Hall, a former supermodel and long-term partner of Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger. She and Jagger, who have four children together, had an unofficial private Hindu marriage ceremony in Bali, Indonesia, in 1990. During divorce proceedings in 1999 a British court declared the marriage invalid.\n\nMurdoch and Hall are due to hold a celebration ceremony Saturday at St. Bride's, the journalists' church in London's Fleet Street.\n\nBritain's newspapers were based in Fleet Street until Murdoch moved his printing presses to east London in 1986 to escape the grip of the powerful printers' unions. The rest of the print media soon followed, but the area remains the spiritual home of British journalism.
Michael Kors made a name for himself designing clothes for celebrities. But he's made his fortune with clothes that are ready to wear by anyone. He shares his secrets with Rita Braver:\n\nBackstage, the models are frantically prepping to walk the runway. But out in the house where the show will start in just minutes, one man is surprisingly serene:\n\nOver 35 years of putting on fashion shows, and I don't get nervous, said Michael Kors. But I guess I'm kind of like the expectant dad, you know? This thing has been a long time coming and you want to see that gorgeous baby.\n\nAnd indeed, even hardened fashion critics agreed, it was gorgeous! Rufus Wainright sang his heart out, A-Listers like Emily Blunt and Sienna Miller studded the first row, and models of the moment (like Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid) strutted their stuff.\n\nModels walk the runway at the Michael Kors Spring 2017 Show during New York Fashion Week. Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nFifty-seven-year-old Michael Kors took a victory lap, and why not? It's been quite a journey.\n\nHe showed his first season when he was 21 years old, and by the time the clothes arrived in the stores, I was 22, he told Braver. I knew nothing, I have to tell you. I don't know what UPS was. I mean, I didn't know how you actually delivered the clothes to the stores!\n\nBorn on suburban Long Island, he started out as Karl Anderson. But his Mom let him change both his first and last names when she remarried.\n\nAnd that wasn't all: at age 5, she brought him to a fitting for her wedding gown.\n\nAnd I just sat in the corner making a face, he recalled. And my mom said, 'What's wrong?' And I said, 'I don't know, it's just way too busy -- it had a lot of bows.' And I said, 'You know what? I think it would look better without the bows.'\n\nWithin a few years of graduating high school, he was working at a Manhattan shop where the owners gave him a chance to design his own creations.\n\nMichael Kors. CBS News\n\nThe response to the pieces the boutique started having made based on his designs was Amazing, he said. I mean, it was crazy. We'd put it in the window and you know (snaps his fingers) you immediately knew a woman would come in and say, 'Oh, can I try it on?' And you'd say, 'Wait, I'm on to something here; let's do more of that.'\n\nHis fledgling line caught the eye of one of fashion's most powerful prognosticators: Anna Wintour, then at New York Magazine:\n\nI took the collection and I kind of packed it into these big, messy garment bags, and I jumped on the subway, and I went off to see Anna. And I remember it was her fall issue of New York Magazine, and I was her fashion thing to look forward to.\n\nToday, as Editor-in-chief of Vogue, Wintour still cares enough for Kors to step out on the red carpet with him at a fundraiser he's hosting for his favorite charity, God's Love We Deliver, which provides meals to the sick. And yes, she's wearing Michael Kors.\n\nBraver asked, What is about his work that you like? What gets you into a Michael Kors?\n\nI think Michael has always understood the modern American woman, that he is trying to make her look the best that she can, Wintour replied. He's less concerned about clothes wearing a woman. He wants the woman to wear the clothes.\n\nAnd it doesn't hurt that some of those women are celebrities: Michelle Obama (in her first official portrait), Viola Davis (at this year's Golden Globes), and Kate Hudson (on many occasions).\n\nWhen a woman puts something on, and her whole body changes and her energy changes and her confidence changes, he feels like he's succeeded, Hudson said. And he really, really lives and breathes it.\n\nThere are a lot of boldface names in the world of Michael Kors, such as the outfit Blake Lively wore while pregnant: She wore it during the day and threw, like, a grey hoodie over it.\n\nAt his flagship store on Madison Avenue, Kors proudly shows off his couture line: sumptuous fabrics, with prices to match.\n\nThe handwork, all of this, is all done by hand, Kors said.\n\nThis dress must cost thousands of dollars, said Braver.\n\nIt does. It does. But you'll have it forever. And the stretchy fabric will keep fitting.\n\nBut the bulk of his sales -- and most of the almost 800 other Michael Kors stores -- are devoted to his lower-priced lines. He also designs clothes for men. But, Kors says, his clients all have similar aspirations: They want to look fashionable and current. They want to feel powerful but sexy. They want to feel youthful but not ridiculous.\n\nDesigner Michael Kors with correspondent Rita Braver. CBS News\n\nIt seems hard to imagine, but at one time, Kors almost lost it all. In the early 1990s, the chief backer for his lower-priced line suddenly ran out of money.\n\nI remember thinking, 'Well, if this doesn't work, like, will I still be me? Will I still be Michael Kors? What will I do?'\n\nIt must have been so scary for you.\n\nScary. And what I learned from it is, you really have to stick to your guts. You know, you've got to stay focused.\n\nHe rebuilt the brand, and then in 2004 he got a call that would change his life: Certainly, reality television and fashion had not merged, Kors said of Project Runway. And I knew 'Survivor.' And I said, 'Are designers gonna be, you know, eating bugs and killing each other? What are they gonna be doing?' I thought it was insane!\n\nThe show, which judged the work of aspiring designers, took off, in part, because of now-legendary quips by Kors like, It's tablecloth-y to me.\n\nBut after 10 years, Kors left the show to spend more time on his business, and his marriage with Lance LaPere, his one-time intern who is now creative director of the company.\n\nBraver asked LaPere, Do you ever tell him, 'I don't think so, that's not a good idea'?\n\nOh, yeah. All the time, he replied. It's always a back and forth.\n\nAnd these days, with a net worth estimated at $1 billion, life is very bright for Michael Kors:\n\nI am still so curious about what is next, and what's new, he said. I think when you lose that curiosity, you know, quite frankly, then you need to do something else. But I feel more juice today than I did when I was 21.\n\n\n\nGALLERY: Michael Kors' red carpet looks\n\n\n\nFor more info:
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died Saturday from natural causes at the age of 79.\n\nThe reaction on social media was swift -- going from surprised to political within about an hour of Justice Scalia's death.\n\nScalia was one of the most conservative members of the court, nominated in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan. Most of his positions were not favored by the liberal community -- he was pro-life, did not support gay marriage, and most recently came under fire for suggesting some black students would benefit by attending less-advanced schools.\n\nWhile much of the social media chatter on Scalia's death was positive, many on the left took the opportunity to express dislike for Justice Scalia and his positions.\n\nDon't even try to enforce the inapplicable don't-speak-ill-of-the-dead rule for the highly polarizing, deeply consequential Antonin Scalia — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) February 13, 2016\n\nNow Scalia will know what it's like to have the government own his body. — Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) February 13, 2016\n\nJust to make sure I understand your argument: you want me to show respect for the death of a hateful man who disrespected so many lives? — Moshe Kasher (@moshekasher) February 13, 2016\n\nI mean, if you don't want your death politicized, don't lead a repugnant and profoundly influential political life. — Charles Finch (@CharlesFinch) February 13, 2016\n\nWish I could be a fly on the wall for Scalia's chat with the Devil — Silvia Killingsworth (@silviakillings) February 13, 2016\n\nProminent politicians also politicized Scalia's death soon after the news broke.\n\nPresidential candidate Ted Cruz tweeted that Scalia was a hero, but then argued that the next president should nominate his replacement -- not President Obama. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and fellow candidate Marco Rubio echoed his sentiment.\n\nIt's a sign of the times and the velocity by which technology has changed the way we interact, and the way we think, said Stacey Schulman, a media analyst with Katz Television Group.\n\nWe're not waiting to simply mark the man's life and achievements, we've jumped all the way to the consequences of [his death] in an election year.\n\nScalia was also remembered positively by many on the left and right.\n\nJustice Scalia was a brilliant man. We had many differences, but he was a dedicated public servant. — Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) February 13, 2016\n\nI learned so much from Justice Scalia. We all did. Tonight, Janna & I offer our sympathy & prayers to his family. pic.twitter.com/IcBds0iQ1C — Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) February 14, 2016\n\nJustice Scalia was an American hero, one of the greatest Supreme Ct Justices in history. Our thoughts and prayers are with his dear family. — Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) February 13, 2016\n\nOthers called for the public to remember, regardless of their political opinions, that Justice Scalia was a husband, father of nine, and a friend.
There's no stopping Beyonce and Jay Z.\n\nThe couple was spotted in Miami, Florida, riding a golf cart together during rehearsals on Tuesday for Beyonce's first show of her Formation World Tour, in pictures obtained by E! News. The sighting marks the first time they've been seen together since the 34-year-old superstar's Lemonade dropped on Saturday night. Beyonce is set to take the stage at Marlins Park in Miami on Wednesday night, officially launching her feverishly anticipated tour.\n\nJay Z is smiling in the pics, seated next to a glamorous Beyonce, who's rocking a huge black hat and a sparkly bodysuit -- presumably one of the looks from her upcoming show.\n\nThe 46-year-old rapper was also spotted relaxing with a few friends in Miami on Tuesday, puffing on a cigar.\n\nBeyonce's mother, Tina Knowles, is already looking forward to Beyonce's first tour stop.\n\nAt rehearsal!! Soo excited! Going to be an awesome show!!! she Instagrammed on Tuesday.\n\nAt rehearsal!! Soo excited! Going to be an awesome show !!! A photo posted by Tina Knowles (@mstinalawson) on Apr 26, 2016 at 9:56pm PDT\n\n\n\nMy baby, the boss, directing and running the show, she also captioned an Instagram pic last week of what appears to be Beyonce from the back. She never ceases to amaze me. 'She dreams it, she works hard, she grinds 'till she owns it!' Formation Tour work mode!!!!!\n\nMy baby , The boss directing and running the show 😄 She never ceases to amaze me. She dreams it ,She works hard ,She grinds till she owns it!!!! Formation Tour work mode!!!!! A photo posted by Tina Knowles (@mstinalawson) on Apr 20, 2016 at 9:38pm PDT\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jay and Bey's marriage has been under intense scrutiny ever since Beyonce's short film aired on HBO, with clear themes of infidelity. One song in particular, Sorry, had fans buzzing, thanks to the lyrics, He only want me when I'm not there/ He better call Becky with the good hair.\n\nSince then, the Beyhive has attacked designer Rachel Roy on social media after she Instagrammed a now-deleted photo with the caption, Good hair don't care. Speculation about Jay's relationship with Roy began back in May 2014, when it was reported that Beyonce's younger sister, Solange, had a confrontation with the 42-year-old designer prior to her infamous elevator attack on her brother-in-law.\n\nRoy denied she was Beyonce's Becky on Tuesday.\n\nI want to put the speculation and rumors to rest. My Instagram post was meant to be fun and lighthearted, it was misunderstood as something other than that, Roy told ET in a statement. There is no validity to the idea that the song references me personally. There is no truth to the rumors.\n\nFans have also targeted singer Rita Ora, after she was seen wearing lemon-themed lingerie in a Snapchat photo days before the Lemonade special aired on HBO. Ora added more fuel to the fire when she stepped out on Monday wearing the exact same red Gucci outfit Beyonce sported in her music video for her song, Formation.\n\nOra spoke out about all the speculation via Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nI never usually address tabloid gossip but let me be clear, these rumors are false, she tweeted. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Beyonce. Let's continue enjoying Lemonade.\n\nStill, while Lemonade is definitely Beyonce's most personal album yet, it should be noted that she and Jay have seemingly referenced their high-profile romance in both of their songs plenty of times before. Watch the video below for a timeline of their love, as told through their music.
The Vatican decreed Monday that the Catholic Church cannot bless same-sex unions since God cannot bless sin. The Vatican's orthodoxy office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued a formal response Monday to a question about whether Catholic clergy can bless same-sex unions.\n\nThe answer, contained in a two-page explanation published in seven languages and approved by Pope Francis, was negative.\n\nThe decree distinguished between the Church's welcoming and blessing of gay people, which it upheld, but not their unions since any such sacramental recognition could be confused with marriage.\n\nThe Vatican holds that gays must be treated with dignity and respect, but that gay sex is intrinsically disordered. Catholic teaching holds that marriage, a lifelong union between a man and woman, is part of God's plan and is intended for the sake of creating new life.\n\nSince same-sex unions are not intended to be part of that plan, they cannot be blessed by the Church, the document said.\n\nThe presence in such relationships of positive elements, which are in themselves to be valued and appreciated, cannot justify these relationships and render them legitimate objects of an ecclesial blessing, since the positive elements exist within the context of a union not ordered to the Creator's plan, the response said.\n\nGod does not and cannot bless sin: He blesses sinful man, so that he may recognize that he is part of his plan of love and allow himself to be changed by him, it said.\n\nFrancis has endorsed providing gay couples with legal protections in same-sex unions, but that is in reference to the civil sphere, not within the Church. Those comments were made during an interview with a Mexican broadcaster, Televisa, in 2019, but were cut by the Vatican until they appeared in a documentary last year.\n\nIn the new document and an accompanying unsigned article, the Vatican said questions had been raised about blessing same-sex unions in recent years and after Francis had insisted on the need to better welcome and accompany gays in the Church.\n\nIn the article, the Vatican stressed the fundamental and decisive distinction between gay individuals and gay unions, noting that the negative judgment on the blessing of unions of persons of the same sex does not imply a judgment on persons.\n\nBut it explained the rationale for forbidding a blessing of such unions, noting that any union that involves sexual activity outside of marriage cannot be blessed because it is not in a state of grace, or ordered to both receive and express the good that is pronounced and given by the blessing.\n\nAnd it added that blessing a same-sex union could give the impression of a sort of sacramental equivalence to marriage. This would be erroneous and misleading, the article said.
Simon & Schuster\n\nIn Howard Stern Comes Again (to be published May 14 by Simon & Schuster, a division of CBS), SiriusXM satellite radio host Howard Stern writes about his broadcasting career, his roster of notable interviews, and his experience with psychotherapy, which he describes as life-changing.\n\n\n\nIn the excerpt below, Stern explains what it took for him to learn to treat his celebrity guests as collaborators in an interview rather than as foils for his on-air antics.\n\nDon't miss Tracy Smith's in-depth interview with Howard Stern on CBS Sunday Morning May 12!\n\nI'm not proud of my first two books. I don't even have them displayed on my bookshelf at home. I think of them, and of the interviews I did with my guests during those first couple decades of my career, and I cringe. I was an absolute maniac. My narcissism was so strong that I was incapable of appreciating what somebody else might be feeling.\n\nI have so many regrets about guests from that time. I asked Gilda Radner if Gene Wilder had a big penis. Great question. Drove her right out the door. George Michael's band Wham! Everyone I worked with said, Whatever you do, don't ask them if they're gay. Do not ask them if they're gay. Within twenty seconds, I asked them if they were gay. Eminem came on the show once then never again. Same with Will Ferrell.\n\nPossibly my biggest regret was my interview with Robin Williams. When Robin came on the show in the early nineties, I spent the entire time badgering him about how he had divorced his first wife and remarried his son's former nanny. I was attacking the guy, and he was justifiably furious with me. Years later, I realized I finally needed to apologize. I had already done this with some other people. I called them and tried to make amends. Some were gracious. A radio guy I had been awful to said, You know what, man? I'm so glad you called. I actually felt bad for you that you were carrying around so much bitterness and ugliness inside, and I'm happy you don't have that anymore. Others were angry. A famous comedian I had bashed said to me, I appreciate that you called, but I don't know if I could ever forgive you. I had to go through a lot of misery, because your fans were brutal. I didn't know what Robin's reaction would be. He could have hung up on me. He could have cursed me out. I had to do it.\n\nIt took me twenty years to work up the nerve. I was in the midst of tracking down his phone number, and the next day he died. I'm still filled with sadness over his loss and remorse for my failure to reach out sooner.\n\nTelling Carly Simon how hot she was for a half-hour or spewing sex questions to Wilmer Valderrama – this ultimately led to nothing. It wasn't good radio. It was meaningless. It was just me being self-absorbed and compulsive about asking something that would provoke and antagonize. Those weren't really interviews. They were monologues. Instead of a conversation, it was just me blurting out ridiculous things. I had some real issues.\n\nThen I started going to a psychotherapist.\n\nThis was in the late nineties. I had no idea how therapy worked. The only thing I knew about it was what I saw in movies and on television, where people would just sit there and tell stories. So that's what I did. My first session, I sat down in the chair and began telling the therapist anecdotes as if I was on the radio. I hit him with all my favorite routines. I did a thorough and involved set on the Stern family tree, complete with impressions of my family. I put together a few minutes on marriage, then moved into the pressures of the radio business, and closed with the trials and tribulations of raising a family.\n\nAfter I was finished with my stand-up, the therapist instead of applauding said, There's nothing funny going on here. Quite frankly, some of this stuff sounds pretty sad. My first response was to get defensive. Who was he to say that? I could tell that story and laugh. I had done it many times. Gradually, after a few more sessions, I realized he was right. He was the first person who ever said to me, I take you seriously. I had always been hungry for someone to confide in like that, but I had pushed away my hunger. That's often what people who are traumatized do. In order to protect themselves, they act like nobody else matters. They tell themselves they don't need anyone.\n\nThe irony is that I've always had an appreciation for others in my work. Yes, it's called The Howard Stern Show, but I'm at my best when I have a bunch of people around me, when I can call on them and collaborate. Whether it's my co-host, Robin Quivers, or my producer Gary Dell'Abate or our jack-of-all-trades (sound effects, impressions, and so much more) Fred Norris; the staff of incredible writers and brilliant engineers; my front office, including chief operating officer Marci Turk and senior vice president Jeremy Coleman; my agent, Don Buchwald, and my executive assistant, Laura Federici; my bosses and the sales department at SiriusXM – I consider everyone a part of the team. What we do is like music, in a way. It's like a symphony. That is truly how I've always seen myself: as an orchestra conductor.\n\nYet that generosity of spirit didn't extend to my guests. I should have treated them as talented soloists and welcomed them to join in our performance. I was just too afraid that the audience would be bored when they didn't get their fix of outrageousness – as if some quiet notes would have destroyed the concerto. Everything had to be one loud, crashing crescendo.\n\nInitially, I went to therapy twice a week. Then the therapist had me up it to three times. Eventually he recommended I make it four. I thought, Man, I didn't know I was that screwed up. I was reluctant to make such a big commitment, but I did it. I completely gave myself over to the process.\n\nThe more I went, the more that translated into how I interviewed my guests. I found myself changing my approach because I had experienced what it was like to have someone genuinely interested in my life. Therapy opened me up and enabled me to appreciate how fulfilling it was to be truly heard. That led me to the thought: You know, somebody else might actually have something to say. Let's just sit here and listen and not make it all about you.\n\nAt first, not making it about me was difficult. I had to learn to say no to myself. Stop talking. Start listening. Let someone else shine and have a moment. Trust that the audience will remain there.\n\nExcerpt from Howard Stern Comes Again by Howard Stern. Copyright © 2019 by One Twelve, Inc.

While many people are scrambling to find last-minute presents or even a date before Valentine's Day, this Kansas man wants a little something more: A girlfriend. And he's offering $25,000 to anyone who can help him find one.\n\nBachelor Jeff Gebhart told CBS affiliate KCTV that he has grown sick of dating the traditional way and especially abhors online dating. So, he said, he decided to think outside the box.\n\nWell think about it, if you're in a happy marriage, what monetary value could you ever place on meeting the right person ... ever? the 47-year-old told the outlet. My time and frustration and disappointment definitely is worth some sort of dollar figure but that was roughly what I'd spend in dating.\n\nGebhart, an entrepreneur by trade, has been working on the project for about six months. He launched his dating website Sunday night, according to CBS Sacramento.\n\nThe site has all anyone would ever need to know about the eligible bachelor, including a two-minute-long video detailing his quest. Gebhart has never been engaged or married, but has been in several long term relationships, according to his site.\n\nHe doesn't have any kids, but does have a beloved pup named Gunner, and is using his search for love to help out other dogs. In addition to the $25,000 award for the lucky matchmaker, Gebhart said he will also make a $25,000 donation to a no-kill dog shelter or charity.\n\nhttps://datejeffg.com/ If I've ever positively affected your life, please take a second to share my post. Posted by Jeff Gebhart on Sunday, February 9, 2020\n\nFor those looking to get a quick payday, there are some strings attached. A potential match must exclusively date Gebhart for 365 consecutive days, according to his website. The matchmaker only gets cash if the pair makes it to the one year mark — and they don't take it home all at once.\n\nGebhart will pay the fee in five installments of $5,000 over a five year period, unless the couple breaks up in that time. If so, the matchmaker won't receive any more money than what they've already earned.\n\nWomen who are dating him, or those who nominate themselves, are not eligible for payment.\n\nLadies who are interested in dating Gebhart don't get to skip straight to dinner and a movie, either. Women must take a survey to see if they would be a match. The survey is based in science and was developed by a clinical psychiatrist, according to the site.\n\nYou have a big number that apply, you put them through a Willy Wonka machine and the ones that come out are the ones that would be great candidates for me, Gebhart told KCTV. Any one of them and that's without looking at pictures or knowing the chemistry or anything.\n\nWhile it may be an unconventional way to find love, Gebhart hopes it will be just the thing to help him find his sweetheart.\n\nThe main objective of this is to find the right girl for me, wherever she is, Gebhart said.
LOS ANGELES -- Barbara Sinatra, the fourth wife of legendary singer Frank Sinatra and a prominent advocate for abused children, has died of natural causes. She was 90.\n\nJohn Thoresen, director of the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center, says the late philanthropist died Tuesday at her Rancho Mirage, California, home.\n\nA former model and Las Vegas showgirl, Barbara Sinatra was a prominent Palm Springs socialite in her own right before she married Sinatra in 1976. Before that, she was married to Zeppo Marx from 1959 to 1973.\n\nShe wrote about her marriage to Sinatra in her 2011 book, Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank. They remained wed until his death in 1998; their 22-year-long marriage was his longest.\n\nTogether they founded the center that bears her name.\n\nThe nonprofit has provided therapy to more than 20,000 young victims of physical, sexual and emotional abuse since opening in 1986.\n\nThoresen says Sinatra remained active at the center until recently, raising funds and visiting with the children.
New York Times op-ed columnist David Brooks is on a mission to help people live deeper and more joyful lives. In his new book, The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life, Brooks writes that living to satisfy relationships rather than one's own ego fills people's lives with wonder, gratitude and hope.\n\nAppearing on CBS This Morning Monday, Brooks explained that the book grew out of a crisis in his own life. I had led a life really determined by the lies our culture tells us, he said. Our culture tells us if you succeed, you'll be happy, or I can make myself happy. So, I lived that way, and I ended up valuing time over people. I was always busy, I was on the move, nobody confided in me. I had a lot of work friends, weekday friends; I had no weekend friends.\n\nNew York Times columnist David Brooks CBS News\n\nThen, he said, My marriage ended. My kids left for school, college, and I was living in this little apartment. If you went to my drawers, where there should have been forks and knives, there were Post-it notes. Where there should have been plates, there was stationery. I was just living for work. I was lonely. You have this pain in your stomach. This was 2013. And you just feel, 'I'm in the valley.' It was a crisis of disconnection for me, and a lot of people in this country are going through that. There's a lot of loneliness, a lot of solitude. I spent the next five years [going], 'How do I get out of this?'\n\nBrooks writes that life is defined by two mountains: On the first mountain, people tackle personal goals, like becoming successful; and on the second, people learn to look beyond themselves and instead focus on service to others.\n\nBrooks describes the first mountain as about ego. I had a first good mountain. I am New York Times columnist, I get to be on PBS. It was success. You would think from the outside it was success, but it was not feeding my soul. It had turned me into something shallow.\n\nRandom House\n\nI find the people who are most joyous, they go through this process [in which] they first reject the lies of our society that success makes you happy, or I can make myself happy – If I just lose another 15 pounds, I will be happy. Lie! Then they fall into themselves, they fall into their heart and soul. and they go down to the substrate which is the deepest part of themselves.\n\nI had a friend who said when my first daughter was born, 'I realized I loved her more than evolution required.' I always loved that because we have this moment of care, and she got down to that level.\n\nBeing in the valley, he said, requires someone else reaching in to pull you out.\n\nI was invited over to a couple's house in D.C. And they had a kid who was in the D.C. public schools who had a friend whose mom had issues, and so they said, 'Well, James can stay with us.' And James had a friend, and James had a friend. When I went over that house in 2015, there were 40 kids around the table, 15 sleeping in the basement. I walk in, I wanted to shake the kid's hand and the first kid I meet in the doorway named Ed said, 'We don't really shake hands here; we hug here.' I'm not the huggiest guy on the face of the earth. But I go back every Thursday for six years and they demanded complete intimacy from me and they really lifted me up. They showed me a better way to live, which is about relationships, not self.\n\nBrooks said that our lives are defined by our moment of greatest adversity, and how we react to it.\n\nI found that in the valley, the first thing I learned is, freedom sucks, he said. To be unattached, that's bad. Total freedom is overrated.\n\nThe second thing I learned is you can be broken, or you can be broken open. The people who are broken turn angry and resentful. Pain that is not transformed gets transmitted.\n\nAs college graduation (and commencement address) season approaches, Brooks was asked why he disliked the message Do what you love.\n\nBecause it's all on you. They come out of college, what are they going to do with their lives? We say, 'Be free. The future's limitless.' That doesn't help them make the choice. 'Look inside yourself. Follow your passion.' Eighty percent of college students have no passion.\n\nSo, what should they be told?\n\nLive for a relationship. That seems easy. We can all say that. But to see people truly speak from the depths of yourself, not from the surface of yourself, these are daily challenges. And in our society, we just don't treat each other very well.\n\nThe Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life by David Brooks (Random House), in hardcover, eBook and audio formats, available via Amazon.
Willie Nelson showed off a Christmas gift on Facebook that he received from rapper Snoop Dogg.\n\nNelson looked happy as a clam as he wore a Christmas sweater that said, Smoke weed every day, with a cannabis leaf decorated with Christmas lights and topped with a star.\n\nHe wrote, Thank you Snoop Dogg for the Christmas sweater.\n\nThank you Snoop Dogg for the Christmas sweater. Posted by Willie Nelson on Tuesday, January 3, 2017\n\nBoth stars have cashed in on their own marijuana lines -- Leafs by Snoop and Willie's Reserve -- as have Melissa Etheridge and Montel Williams.\n\nSnoop and Nelson worked together on the song My Medicine and in 2015 at South by Southwest, the rapper said it was love at first sight.\n\nSnoop talked about the time the two smoked marijuana together in Amsterdam while collaborating, and then grabbed food.\n\nThey give us the bucket of chicken, we open it up, boom, and me and Willie stuck our hands in at the same time and we grabbed the same piece of chicken, Snoop said to the audience. And I look at Willie, I was like, 'That's you dog, my bad.'\n\nIn Nelson's memoir, It's a Long Story, the singer called his relationship to pot as a love affair that became a long-term marriage and a friend who has never betrayed him.\n\nObviously, the relationship does not preclude a bromance with Snoop Dogg.

SUNDALE, Calif. --The car of a southern California mother missing three years and human bones were found Sunday, reports the Los Angeles Times.\n\nMegan Sue DiPiazza, 33, of La Crescenta reportedly vanished Nov. 11, 2012, after leaving a note in her apartment saying goodbye to her family, police said at the time. She had recently separated from her husband, who told CBS LA at the time that she was upset the last time he saw her because they had argued about their marriage.\n\nInvestigators at the time found the note and her purse at the couple's Sunland home, and said there was no suspicious activity surrounding the disappearance.\n\nSunday, a man hiking on a trial in the Angeles National Forest found the woman's car, as well as her identification card, about 500 feet down a ravine, Glendale police told the paper.\n\nDetectives on Monday reportedly found a photo of DiPiazza and her family and credit cards in the car, which had the key in the ignition.

To the surprise of many, the 22nd season of Arthur just premiered on PBS — yes, that lovable aardvark and his friends are still on the air. But the classic children's show is very much keeping up with the times. The premiere episode revealed Arthur's teacher, Mr. Ratburn, is gay.\n\nIn Mr. Ratburn and the Special Someone, the beloved teacher of Arthur and his friends gets married to a man. It's not the first time the children's show has included LGBTQ storylines although the last one occurred in 2005, TV Line reports. In the episode Postcards from Buster, Arthur's best friend met children with two moms while on a trip to Vermont.\n\nArthur and his friends overhear Mr. Ratburn and an uptight woman, voiced by Jane Lynch, discussing his wedding. They believe the woman is his bride and devise a plan to stop the wedding. PBS/Arthur\n\nThe word lesbian was not used in the episode, nor was the word gay used in the episode about Mr. Ratburn. However, the show received praise for teaching children that men can marry men and women can marry women.\n\nIn the season 22 premiere, the students see Mr. Ratburn speaking to an uptight lady, voiced by guest star Jane Lynch. They fear she is the person Mr. Ratburn is going to marry, and they devise a plan to stop the wedding and prevent a life of misery for their teacher.\n\nArthur and his friends show up to the wedding ready to object to it – only to see Mr. Ratburn walk down the aisle with his groom. PBS/Arthur\n\nBut the kids chicken out when they get to the wedding and don't stand up to object to the marriage. Then, they learn the uptight woman is just Mr. Ratburn's sister, who is officiating the nuptials. When Mr. Ratburn walks down the aisle, he is arm in arm with a man.\n\nThe third-graders are happy for their newlywed teacher, but there's one thing they are mortified by: his dancing.\n\nPeople took to Twitter when they learned about the episode — but many were sharing their disbelief that Arthur was still on the air. Some Twitter users wrote that they hope other TV shows and movies include LGBTQ characters and storylines.\n\nI think the biggest surprise about Mr. Ratburn from Arthur being gay is that I'm just now finding out that Arthur is still coming out with new episodes. — Erica Mendez (@tsunderica) May 14, 2019\n\nMy hand to god, I had no idea Arthur is still being produced, let alone in its 22nd season, and I'm now going to make a donation to @PBS. https://t.co/P8DIxbF5u5 — Charlotte Clymer🏳️‍🌈 (@cmclymer) May 14, 2019\n\n1) Shoutout to Mr. Ratburn! 2) Arthur has been on TV forever. Season 22?? https://t.co/27W8Xo1NhA — philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) May 13, 2019\n\nIn 2015, same-sex marriage became legal across the country. So, regardless of where Arthur's fictional Elwood City actually is, Mr. Ratburn's marriage would be recognized.
From time to time, we like like to catch up with the leaders of some of America's biggest companies. This morning, David Pogue talks shop with the head of a high-tech giant:\n\nMicrosoft has never been what you'd call a subtle company. Almost 23 years ago, to promote its new Windows 95 operating system, the company hired Jay Leno as host, and made an ad starring Jennifer Aniston.\n\nUnder CEO Bill Gates, and his successor, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft dominated the PC market, and became one of the most valuable companies on Earth.\n\nBut by 2014, things had changed. Smartphones had taken over the world, running software from Apple and Google. People wondered if Microsoft's best days were behind it.\n\nIt's nice to have a business that's growing at 20%. The question is, what happens after? said Satya Nadella.\n\nIn 2014, Nadella became the third CEO in Microsoft's history. In his recent book Hit Refresh (HarperBusiness), Nadella writes about his effort to change the company's culture.\n\nHarperBusiness\n\nMy primary instinct was to be able to tell the story of change and transformation while going through it, he said.\n\nOne thing you talk a lot about in the book is empathy and compassion, said Pogue. Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer during their tenures here had terrific strengths as leaders. But I'm not sure, you know, compassion would be the word that jumped out about a young Bill Gates, or Steve. Am I mistaken about that?\n\nIn their own way, I feel that they have a lot of that, you know, very deep in what they did and what they're doing today, Nadella replied. But when I think about empathy, or compassion, I think it's a business essential.\n\nWe are in the business of basically meeting unmet, unarticulated needs of customers, Nadella laughed. And there's no way you're going to be able to get that consistently right if you don't have that deep sense of empathy, or being able to see what others are seeing.\n\nNadella grew up in India; he moved to the U.S. in 1988 to study computer science at college. And then, in 1992, during a visit back home, he ran into Anu Venugopal, an old family friend he'd known since elementary school, and he realized she was The One.\n\nI've known Satya all my life, she told Pogue. So when he asked me to marry him, it felt like I was marrying my best friend.\n\nAnu and Satya Nadella are both American citizens now. But immigration laws at the time forced them to spend the first year-and-a-half of their marriage apart. There were letters, and long phone calls.\n\nI think most of Sataya's paycheck went towards phone calls! said Anu.\n\nThe couple knows all too well the value of empathy. Their son, Zain, who's 21 now, suffers from cerebral palsy: To be able to see the world through his eyes and then recognize my responsibility towards him, that I think has shaped a lot of who I am today.\n\nDavid Pogue interviews Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. CBS News\n\nThe new, more inclusive Microsoft has been opening up its technology to disabled people. Microsoft product manager Angela Mills, who is legally blind, showed Pogue Microsoft's new Seeing AI app. It helps her read text, recognize objects, and even identify people.\n\nBy the way: that Microsoft app is running on an Apple iPhone. That sentence would have been unthinkable before Nadella came along. A bunch of passionate people came together at a hackathon and said, 'What can we do with these amazing breakthroughs we're having in computer vision? What's the app we should build at Microsoft that can uniquely help empower people?' he said.\n\nKinder and gentler seems to be working. Since Nadella became CEO, Microsoft's stock has more than doubled; it's now at an all-time high. And for the first time in a long time, people are calling Microsoft innovative.\n\nThe Microsoft HoloLens is a prime example. It's an augmented reality headset that superimposes graphics on the world around you.\n\nRecently, Microsoft has been in the news for more than its new technologies. Nadella says he's had good conversations with President Trump. But he has forcefully denounced the administration's immigration policies. He's even promised to provide lawyers for any of the so-called Dreamers at Microsoft who are now threatened with deportation.\n\nFor this immigrant and unlikely CEO, that's more than just a business decision -- it's personal.\n\nI always say that I'm a product of two amazingly unique American things, he said. One is American technology reaching me where I was growing up and making it possible for me to dream; and the enlightened American immigration policy allowing me to come and live that dream. And so that's what I think makes America, and American companies, unique.\n\n\n\nFor more info:
As you're about to see, the QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS come thick and fast when actress Sofia Vergara sits down with our Lee Cowan:\n\nSofia Vergara, the star of ABC's Modern Family, doesn't so much butcher the English language as she collides with it, like a Colombian meteorite:\n\nGloria: Do you know how frustrating it is to have to translate everything in my head before I say it? You should try talking in my shoes for one mile.\n\nJay: I think you...\n\nGloria: I know what I meant to mean.\n\nIt's like it comes out completely different than what they just told me to do it! she said.\n\nDoes it sound right in your head? asked Cowan.\n\nNo, I think I understand it, but when it comes out, it comes out however it wants to come out, she laughed. I can't control it. You think I would sound like this after 25 years in this country if I could control it?\n\nYou don't have to understand her to understand her appeal. Last month's cover of Women's Health magazine says it all.\n\nWomen's Health\n\nBut while her beauty may have gotten her in the stage door, it's her sense of humor that's kept her there.\n\nCowan asked, Do you ever get tired of people talking about how unbelievably gorgeous you are?\n\nNo, go on! I know that you know there's much more to me than that -- I mean I'm 45, I've been working for more than 25 years. If it had only been beauty, by now I would have been gone. They're younger and prettier than me now!\n\nAs Gloria Delgado Pritchett on Modern Family, she elevates trophy wife to new, Emmy-nominated heights.\n\nSome people have said that it is a bit of a stereotype of a Latin woman, Cowan said.\n\nWhen I think of Gloria, I think of my aunt and my mom, replied Vergara. They're intense, they're passionate. They dress sexy and colorful. They're loud. So, what is wrong with that stereotype if it's a stereotype?\n\nSo Gloria isn't an exaggeration?\n\nI don't think it is an exaggeration. Of course, it's a comedy!\n\nAnd she's laughing all the way to the bank. Forbes estimates she made $41.5 million last year alone, making her the highest-paid actress on TV.\n\nBut not all of that comes from acting.\n\nShe is business first, lending her name to all manner of products, from perfumes to Pepsi and beyond.\n\nIt has to be something that I believe in, something that I've used my whole life, she said. It has to be something real for me.\n\nPart of her empire includes Latin World Entertainment, which she co-founded with business partner Luis Balaguer. It is now a Hispanic marketing and endorsement powerhouse.\n\nFor the last 15 years, our company has done probably 85% of all endorsement deals done in Spanish in this market, said Balaguer.\n\nIt's all me! Vergara laughed.\n\nIt's all her, she sells everything. She sells everything she likes.\n\nThese days, she's looking for more than just profit; she wants profit with a purpose, which is what slipped her into a new line of underwear. Vergara partnered with fellow Colombian Renata Black.\n\nWe love the underwear. I'm wearing it right now. I mean I would show you, but … Vergara laughed. She's wearing it too, so you show them!\n\nThey call their brand EBY, which stands for Empowered By You, because 10% of the duo's sales will go to a nonprofit that provides micro-loans to women trying to start their own small businesses.\n\nSofia Vergara, left and Renata Black, right, are partners in EBY, an underwear line that is helping fund micro-loans for women to start their own businesses. CBS News\n\nWe are the 1% in the world, said Black. And if it's not us doing something about the world, then who's going to do it?\n\nVergara added, You know, I was a single mother. I divorced when I was very young. So I always had to think about money, always business.\n\nHer marriage to her high school sweetheart lasted only two years. But out of it, came her son. Manolo is now 25 and an actor himself, often appearing in many of his mom's Head and Shoulders commercials.\n\nCowan asked, How does she have time to do it all?\n\nThat's the thing, I never know, Manolo replied. Like, half of the time they're talking about this new venture, and I'm like, What? When did this happen? I'm sorry, what? You own half of what? You're launching what?\n\nIt all started before Manolo was born, when Vergara was a senior at a strict Catholic high school in her home town of Barranquilla, Colombia.\n\nWhen asked if it were true that she was plucked off the beach by someone who saw her, Vergara said, Yeah, I was with my family, like, at the beach and some casting agent saw me and said, 'We're doing this commercial, do you want to do it?' And my mom is like, 'Yes, yes, she wants to do it.' And I'm like, 'No, the nuns are gonna kill me, I can't be in a bathing suit on a commercial!'\n\nThat's what you were worried about, the nuns? Cowan asked.\n\nYeah. They're not gonna let me do it. They're gonna throw me out of school!\n\nThe ad came out after she graduated; the nuns could only pray for her at that point.\n\nShe soon found herself in Miami, where she became a household name on Univision -- and then it was off to Hollywood, with her son right there with her, often helping rehearse her lines for auditions.\n\nIt was a little awkward, because I'm like ten, 11, 12, said Manolo, and they're talking about, like you know, romantic and sex things? I'm like, Mmmm, I think you should get someone else to do this!\n\nShe's been a U.S. citizen now for three years, and in 2015 married actor Joe Manganiello, a Pittsburgh native.\n\nBut none of that has erased her accent -- the one that has both made Sofia Vergara famous, and yet a little self-conscious.\n\nI think it's become more horrible, she laughed.\n\nIt got worse, or thicker?\n\nYes, because I started to learn that it's funnier when I would say ye-aas, like yes, so now, it's like I don't even know what my accent is anymore.\n\n\n\nFor more info:
LOS ANGELES -- Gary Oldman's portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour earned him best actor award at the Oscars Sunday night. His win comes despite 2001 domestic violence allegations that resurfaced since his nomination. His ex-wife, Donya Fiorentino, accused Oldman of choking her and beating her with a telephone in front of their children, an allegation he denies.\n\nOur marriage was a giant car crash in which demented things happened. I lost my self-esteem ... I was broken. I would rather get eaten by a great white shark than go through that marriage again, Fiorentino told the U.K.'s Independent in February.\n\nThe Oscars marked the finale of an award season that started with actors wearing all black, in solidarity of fighting against sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood and beyond. But the academy came under scrutiny on Twitter Sunday evening after rewarding Oldman and former NBA star Kobe Bryant during the ceremony.\n\nWhy don't they ask Gary Oldman about hitting his ex-wife in the face with a telephone? That seems relevant, author Roxane Gay tweeted.\n\nWhy don't they ask Gary Oldman about hitting his ex-wife in the face with a telephone? That seems relevant. — roxane gay (@rgay) March 5, 2018\n\nComedian Jena Friedman wrote: Give it up for Gary Oldman and Kobe Bryant, for proving that men with domestic violence or sexual assault accusations can still accomplish anything.\n\nGive it up for Gary Oldman and Kobe Bryant, for proving that men with domestic violence or sexual assault accusations can still accomplish anything. #Oscars — Jena Friedman (@JenaFriedman) March 5, 2018\n\nOthers, like Vice's Katherine Gillespie, retold Fiorentino's claims:\n\nhappy oscars day! gary oldman's wife has repeatedly stated that he choked her and hit her in the face with a telephone in front of their two children — Katherine Gillespie (@kattgillespie) March 5, 2018\n\nSunday's win is Oldman's first, and only his second nomination, despite a lengthy career of performances. He had been considered the front-runner for the best actor award, having swept awards season.\n\nOldman underwent hours of makeup to portray Churchill in the film, which focuses on a pivotal time in the British leader's career when he rallied his country to fight the Nazis. During his acceptance speech, Oldman thanked Churchill, as well as those who worked with him.\n\nHe also thanked his 99-year-old mother, telling her, thank you for your love and your support. Put the kettle on. I'm bringing Oscar home.
Dick Van Dyke and Carl Reiner were a team made in heaven on The Dick Van Dyke Show. These days, together with their pal Norman Lear, they constitute a team of GOLDEN BOYS -- older, yes, but no less amusing. Tracy Smith reports:\n\nThree legends -- all together in one room, at Carl Reiner's Beverly Hills home. A little intimidating. Still collaborating, and still close.\n\nThese two creative giants have been the biggest influence on my life, said Dick Van Dyke. I mean, Carl found me for the series, which changed my life. And Norman has put me in movies and specials. And these two guys, without them I don't know where I'd be today.\n\nAnd if we didn't find him, Reiner interjected, we wouldn't be talking to you!\n\nNorman Lear will be 95 in July, Carl Reiner is 95, and Dick Van Dyke is 91.\n\nThere's something about 90, hitting 90, said Smith.\n\nNorman Lear. CBS News\n\nI know I can get applause just standing up, said Lear. I can walk across the room, and get a standing ovation!\n\nThey're older, sure. They just don't think old.\n\nThe culture has age all wrong, Lear said. The culture sells age as utterly going down. Well, it's the expression, 'Going downhill.' And he woke up this morning to come here feeling great. I woke up this morning, I couldn't wait to get here to see these guys! It's not 'downhill!'\n\nVan Dyke added, People are more afraid of aging than they are death these days. And we need to tell them there's a lotta good livin' to do!\n\nAnd their new film does just that -- call it a celebration of life after 90.\n\nIt's the documentary film, If You're Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast, debuting tomorrow on HBO.\n\nThat title is based on a joke Reiner told Sunday Morning in 2015: First thing I do in the morning, before I have coffee, I read the obits. If I'm not in it, I'll have breakfast.\n\nSmith asked, If you could boil it down to one thing, to what do you owe your long life?\n\nI think attitude has an awful lot to do with it, Van Dyke said. A lack of stress. And we all have stress in our businesses. But I think, well, most of us are kind of easy-going. We're not uptight people. I think [stress] eats you up, really, your body, and your mind.\n\nCarl Reiner. CBS News\n\nI always say I married the right woman, said Reiner.\n\nHow does that explain me? 'Cause I didn't marry her, Lear said.\n\nBut you married another person …\n\nSeveral!\n\nThey all say laughter is important, and also a little workout.\n\nCarl Reiner likes to walk around the neighborhood, and every morning before his feet touch the floor, he does stretches like a circus performer. I wasn't gonna do 'em today, because I was late. But I said, 'Wait a minute. It only takes ten minutes.' I did my stretching exercise.\n\nNorman Lear also likes a good stretch, as he showed Mo Rocca last year.\n\nAnd as you can see in this recent music video for the band Dustbowl Revival, Dick Van Dyke hasn't lost a step.\n\nI make a list every morning, Van Dyke said. Every morning I'm full of ideas and plans. And then by 10:00 I run out of gas. But I go to the gym, drink a cup of coffee and go, or I'll talk myself out of it. So I just go.\n\nHe also says his wife, Arlene, whom he married in 2012, helps keep his heart in shape.\n\nDick Van Dyke. CBS News\n\nWhen asked to define having a good life, Van Dyke said, I think the bottom line is, you have to have someone to love. I think you really must.\n\nIf you love a person, and love the thing you're doing, that makes a world for you, Reiner said.\n\nI think it helps, too, to love yourself, added Lear. That's the hardest one.\n\nHaving a good marriage, and good children, said Reiner. A good life is what you send out to the world. I have three children, non-toxic children, all have done great things, and are continuing to do great things. And I had a marriage of 65 years. That's the only thing that really defines me.\n\nEstelle Reiner passed away in 2008, at 94. These days, lifelong friend Mel Brooks (who turns 91 this month) keeps Carl company.\n\nYou know, if you have one good friend, you're lucky at this age, Reiner said. Mel comes over every night. And I don't know what I would do if he didn't come over. These guys live too far away. I don't drive anymore. I eat, though!\n\nNorman Lear, Carl Reiner and Dick Van Dyke with correspondent Tracy Smith. CBS News\n\nWhen asked what was the best advice he could give, Dick Van Dyke said, Do something that you love to do. You know, don't be living a life of, what is it, quiet desperation -- people working at jobs that they hate to go to. And that to me ruins a person. Find something you like to do, and please, God, do it!\n\nAnd that's something they all seem to live by. More than five decades after Mary Poppins, Dick Van Dyke will be in the 2018 sequel, Mary Poppins Returns.\n\nBack in 1975, Norman Lear developed the sitcom One Day at a Time for CBS. Now the show's been reimagined for Netflix, with stars like Rita Moreno, and he's an executive producer.\n\nMaking people laugh, it would seem, never gets old.\n\nYou stand behind an audience, Lear said. I've done this thousands of times literally. Standing behind an audience when they belly laugh. And they have a tendency to come out of their seats a little, and come forward, and then go back. And I've never seen anything more spiritual than that -- everybody [laughing] together.\n\nWhat does that do for you when you know that you're the source of that? asked Smith.\n\nI think it added time to my life.\n\nAnd Carl Reiner is probably writing as we speak. His latest title says it all: Too Busy to Die.\n\nSmith asked, You think about the end?\n\nNo, I think about how I'd like to go. I'd like to go in my sleep. What a show this would be if I was talkin' to you …  said Reiner, feigning dropping dead.\n\nKidding aside, if there is any real secret to a long and happy life, it may be to just keep looking ahead.\n\nI think there are two little words we don't think enough about: over, and next, said Lear. When something is over, it's over. We're onto next. I mean, this is the moment.\n\nIf you have something to get up for, you'll get up, Reiner said. You won't die in the middle of the night if you have something in the morning you gotta do!\n\nSo, here's to what's next...\n\nIf You're Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast debuts on HBO on June 5.

Dreams of a Sex and the City 3 movie might be dashed, but fans of can still look forward to another dose of glamour from the series' creator. Following a competitive bidding war, Sex and the City creator Candace Bushnell has found a home for a new follow-up series, Paramount TV announced in a statement. Paramount TV and Anonymous Content acquired the rights to develop the series based on Bushnell's upcoming book, Is There Still Sex in the City?\n\nThe new book follows Bushnell's piercing, sly, and sometimes heartbreaking look at sex, dating, and friendship in New York City after 50, Paramount TV says. The book is due out in August 2019.\n\nThe story is set in the Upper East Side – Carrie Bradshaw's old turf – and a country town. The book looks at love and life from all angles—marriage and children, divorce and bereavement, as well as the very real pressures on women to maintain their youth and have it all, according to the statement.\n\nWhile Sex and the City followed three friends in their 30s and 40s, the new series will be about slightly older women. Sex and the City ended its run on HBO in 2004, and 15 years later, Bushnell's new characters are that much older.\n\nIt didn't used to be this way. At one time, fifty something meant the beginning of retirement — working less, spending more time on your hobbies, with your friends, who like you were sliding into a more leisurely lifestyle, Bushnell said in a statement. In short, retirement age folks weren't meant to do much of anything but get older and a bit heavier ... But this is exactly what the lives of a lot of fifty- and sixty something women look like today and I'm thrilled to be reflecting the rich, complexity of their reality on the page and now on the screen.\n\nBushnell has been commissioned to write the pilot and serve as executive producer for the new series. Liza Chasin from 3dot Productions and Robyn Meisinger from Anonymous Content will also executive produce, Paramount TV said.\n\nIt is no surprise that Candace has written a fantastic, relatable, insightful, funny and deeply honest portrayal of women in their 50's, Chasin and Meisinger said in a statement. We are thrilled to be working with her on turning it into a series.\n\nFor many women, the Sex and the City series and movies were groundbreaking, Nicole Clemens, President of Paramount Television, said. We're thrilled to be able to continue that conversation from the underrepresented point of view of women in their 50s and answer the question with, 'Yes! There is more sex in the city!'\n\nParamount TV did not announce when the new series would go into production or when it would be ready for fans. The original Sex and the City series was based on a 1996 book by Bushnell and ran for six season on HBO.

It was updated on February 22, 2020.]\n\nThe North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled earlier this month on whether a father and daughter convicted of second-degree murder should get a new trial.\n\nIn August 2015, former FBI agent Tom Martens and his daughter Molly Corbett admitted killing her Irish-born husband Jason Corbett, insisting they beat him in self-defense with a brick paver and a baseball bat because Jason was choking Molly and threatening to kill her.\n\nProsecutors said Corbett's death was murder.\n\nNow, Tracey Lynch is trying to set the record straight on her slain brother.\n\nThey claimed it was self-defense, Lynch tells 48 Hours correspondent Maureen Maher in her first American TV interview.\n\nThe Martens didn't just murder Jason, Lynch says. They tried to destroy his character.\n\nJason was an amazing human being, Lynch says.\n\nJason Corbett was a 30-year-old father of two in Ireland, who suddenly found himself a widower when his first wife died of an asthma attack. He then decided he needed help with the children and hired Molly Martens, originally from Knoxville, Tenn. Soon, their relationship turned romantic, and they were married. Shortly after, they moved to the United States.\n\nThat's where the story turns leading up to the fateful night of August 2, 2015.\n\nTom Martens told a 911 dispatcher that his son-in-law got into fight with his daughter and he had to intervene. He's bleeding all over, and I, I may have killed him, he said.\n\nMolly also told police that Jason, then 39, was screaming 'I'm going to kill you.'\n\nI MAY HAVE KILLED HIM\n\n911 DISPATCHER: Davidson County 911… TOM MARTENS: My son in law, uh, got in a fight with my daughter. I intervened and he's in bad shape. We need help. 911 DISPATCHER: OK. What do you mean he's in bad shape? He's hurt? TOM MARTENS: He's bleeding all over and I - I may have killed him. TOM MARTENS: He's covered in blood 911 DISPATCHER: Alright, listen carefully. I'll tell you how to do chest compressions. I'll set a pace for you. … One, two, three, four.\n\nThe call came in the early morning hours of Aug. 2, 2015.\n\nMOLLY CORBETT TO 911 [crying]: I — I'm certified. I just c — can't think. 911 DISPATCHER: OK, you have to stay calm. Let your training take over. We need — we need to try to do this to help him, OK? MOLLY CORBETT: OK.\n\nPolice arrived at the Winston-Salem, North Carolina, home to find Jason Corbett beaten to death and his blood on his wife Molly. They knew who did it: Molly and her father Tom Martens. The question was why?\n\nTOM MARTENS [police interview]: He's got Molly by the throat like this.\n\nJust hours later, Tom Martens, a 30-year FBI veteran, explains that he had been spending the night at his daughter's home. After being awakened by a commotion upstairs, he says he grabbed an aluminum Little League baseball bat he brought as a gift for the kids – and ran to her room.\n\nTOM MARTENS [police interview]: He sees me coming and he goes around her throat like this [demonstrates a choke hold]. And I said, Let her go. He turned and like, you know … Let her go. I'm gonna kill her.\n\nMartens says his protective instincts as a father instantly kicked in:\n\nTOM MARTENS [police interview]: I hit him with the baseball bat. TOM MARTENS [police interview]: He reaches out and he grabs the bat and he's stronger than I am, and he pushes me down and I was scrambling on the floor. My glasses fall off. Now I'm thinking, he's gonna kill me.\n\nMolly Corbett told Davidson County Sheriff's investigators the same story:\n\nMOLLY CORBETT [police interview]: He tried to hit my dad, I think, but he might have missed. And I, um, I hit him on the head.\n\nShe hit Jason with a paving stone that was sitting on her nightstand:\n\nINVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: You have a brick on your nightstand? MOLLY CORBETT: Yeah. INVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: What was that — what was that for? MOLLY CORBETT: Um, the kids and I — we were going to paint — paint these bricks and flowers around the mailbox. TOM MARTENS [police interview]: I get the bat back. … I can't tell you how many times I hit him. … I can't tell you that. I mean, it was battle.\n\nIn Ireland, Jason's sister Tracy Lynch still cannot comprehend that he died this way.\n\nTracey Lynch: I just couldn't process it. It was — you know, he was my best friend. … We were just two of the closest people in the world to each other outside my husband and children.\n\nLynch and Jason were part of a big Irish family in Limerick. She remembers her brother as a kind and caring soul.\n\nTracey Lynch: We would just spend summers in Spanish Point in County Clare … hang out, fish. Just kinda normal traditional Irish upbringing, really.\n\nJason was Wayne Corbett's twin.\n\nWayne Corbett: We looked like each other but we were different in so many ways.\n\nMaureen Maher: Would he have been the quiet one?\n\nWayne Corbett: No, no, no. Jason wouldn't have been quiet. You would hear him before you see him.\n\nJason married his first wife, Mags Fitzpatrick, when he was 27. They had two children, Jack and Sarah.\n\nTracey Lynch: They were just so happy and so excited with life and so enthusiastic about it as well. And — and they had Sarah, and you know, I remember them sayin' that they had, that their family was complete. They had their little prince and princess.\n\nBut in 2006, shortly after having their second child, Jason's storybook life came to an abrupt end, when Mags, a longtime asthmatic, suddenly had an attack.\n\nTracey Lynch: Mags woke Jason to say that she was feeling wheezy. And he sat her up. She started to take her nebulizer. And she started to get progressively worse. … We found out later, they called him in and told him that she had died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.\n\nMaureen Maher: And how old was he?\n\nTracey Lynch: He was 30.\n\nMaureen Maher: So, 30 years old with a 2-year-old son.\n\nTracey Lynch: Yeah, and a 12-week-old daughter.\n\nJason Corbett became a widower with two young children at age 30. Tracey Lynch\n\nWith two very small children still at home, Jason Corbett had no choice but to pick up the pieces and move on after Mags died. A year-and-a-half later, 25-year-old Molly Martens answered an ad for an au pair. She arrived in Limerick in March 2008.\n\nLynn Shanahan: I met Molly the day she arrived in the airport in Shannon.\n\nLynn Shanahan is Jason's longtime friend.\n\nMaureen Maher: And what was your impression of her when you met her?\n\nLynn Shanahan: My first thoughts and the first sentence to my own husband were, This is not what Jason needs right now.\n\nMaureen Maher: Why?\n\nLynn Shanahan: The minute I saw her with the big bouncing curls, she was in her 20s. She had a big bright color coat, fur collar, cowboy boots, was dressed and make-up done like a pageant queen as we would have said. She just seemed not the nannyin' type.\n\nBut Molly's uncle, Mike Earnest, says she was great with kids.\n\nMike Earnest: She grew up babysitting, always loved children.\n\nMolly Corbett\n\nMolly Martens had grown up in Knoxville, Tennessee. She had dropped out of Clemson University and was looking to begin a new chapter in her life.\n\nMike Earnest: I think, you know, she maybe was looking for something different, and that this might get her involved, too, in something that I think she was passionate about, which is children.\n\nIn Limerick, Molly instantly connected with Jason's children, 3-year-old Jack and 1-year-old Sarah.\n\nTracey Lynch: He liked her. She seemed gentle with the kids. … We started to see, you know, a little glimpse of the old Jason comin' back, that he was just, you know, not so sad all the time.\n\nThat's when Jason and Molly's relationship changed from professional to personal.\n\nLynn Shanahan: We went on holiday together. And the two of them looked very happy. The kids were happy.\n\nThey were soon making long-term plans.\n\nIt was at Freddy's Bistro in Limerick on Valentine's Day 2010, nearly two years after Molly Martens arrived to be an au pair, that Jason asked her to be his wife. Molly was over the moon and immediately began planning for a wedding back in the states.\n\nTracey Lynch: They came and — said that they got engaged, and we opened a bottle of champagne and toasted to their future.\n\nMaureen Maher: Was he happy?\n\nTracey Lynch: He was happy, yeah, he was. He was in love. He loved Molly.\n\nBut that happiness wouldn't last for long.\n\nA TROUBLED RELATIONSHIP\n\nMolly Corbett and Tom Martens continue to give Davidson County investigators a blow-by-blow account of what they say happened that night in that bedroom. By now, they've washed off Jason's blood:\n\nTOM MARTENS [police interview]: I tell you that guy was crazy. INVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: So, there's a history of domestic violence at the house? MOLLY CORBETT: Yes. INVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: How long has that been going on? MOLLY CORBETT: Forever. INVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: OK, you know your husband didn't survive his injuries, right? MOLLY CORBETT: I didn't think so.\n\nTom Martens claims that when he arrived earlier that evening to visit Molly and the kids, Jason was drunk. They all went to bed without incident. But hours later, Jason's daughter Sarah woke up from a nightmare.\n\nMOLLY CORBETT [police interview]: She thought the fairies on her sheet were insects and spiders and lizards. … He was angry that he was woken up.\n\nIn the middle of her interview, Molly tells investigators she is in pain from the choke hold Jason had on her. They photograph her – including a red mark on the center of her neck. They also take pictures of Tom.\n\nInvestigators photographed Molly Corbett at the sheriff's office after Jason's murder. The prosecution later used this photo in court to show that Molly did not appear to have any injuries. Davidson County Courthouse\n\nMOLLY CORBETT: Yeah, my throat hurts a lot. INVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: And how did you get that bruise? MOLLY CORBETT: Yeah, it was from the other night. INVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: Another night when? MOLLY CORBETT: Just when he grabbed my arm.\n\nBut as Molly and Tom tell tales about Jason's abuse, Jason's family had a different story. They say Molly was the one who caused problems in the relationship for years.\n\nTracey Lynch: The person in Ireland was very different to the one that we met … in Tennessee.\n\nJason's family supported the marriage. But when they arrived in the states for the wedding, they say they noticed Molly was behaving strangely.\n\nTracey Lynch: She was just very controlling. She was angry, I would say. And for someone who was about to get married, you know, she just wasn't herself. … She stayed in bed curled up in a ball. She didn't come out and socialize with anybody.\n\nAnd that, Lynch says, wasn't the worst of it.\n\nTracey Lynch: What really set alarm bells ringing for me was when one of the bridesmaids told us before the wedding that Molly had told them that she had been friends with Mags, Jack and Sarah's mother, before she died of cancer. Mags didn't die of cancer, she died of an asthma attack.\n\nAnd, of course, Molly never knew Mags. Jason's family was beginning to wonder if he was making a mistake by marrying Molly.\n\nPaul Dillon: I said … you're the most unhappiest man I've ever seen on his wedding day.\n\nJason's best friend and groomsman, Paul Dillon, thought he should walk away.\n\nPaul Dillon: I asked him to just leave her and just get on a plane and go home. And he said he can't. He made the commitment.\n\nOne man believes the Corbetts had a reason to be concerned.\n\nKeith Maginn: My name is Keith Maginn and Molly is my former fiancé.\n\nMolly had been engaged to another man, who says they were still together when she left for Ireland to become Jason's au pair.\n\nKeith Maginn: She had a lot of things going on. She had migraines. She had insomnia. … She basically— she spent a lot of time just soaking in the bathtub sometimes just crying on the bathroom floor.\n\nMaginn claims both he and Molly struggled with mental health issues that he describes in a self-published book written before Jason died. He gave 48 Hours no records to back that up, although Molly's medical records from years after her time with Maginn show that she was diagnosed with depression. Her brother Connor is reluctant to talk about it.\n\nMaureen Maher: Much has been said about Molly's mental health … are you comfortable addressing that?\n\nConnor Martens: I don't want to comment on that.\n\nJason and Molly Corbett, along with Jason's children, on their wedding day\n\nAt the time of the wedding, according to Molly's family, all was well, and she was happy to be walking down the aisle with Jason.\n\nMike Earnest | Molly's uncle: She looked very happy … and she looked like she was very happy to be getting married.\n\nJason was able to get a job transfer with the packaging company he had worked for in Ireland. He and Molly settled into the suburbs of Winston-Salem, where Molly got a job as a part-time swim instructor but spent most of her time with Jack and Sarah.\n\nTracey Lynch: I was concerned for Jason and his children. He had moved lock, stock and barrel from Ireland. Packed up his whole life, sold his house, gave up his job, and was on the cusp of a new life.\n\nMike Earnest: Well, my impression was that things seemed to be OK. I don't know if they seemed to be great. I did see occasions where … there seemed like there were issues coming up.\n\nAfter four years, Molly was closer to the children than ever and considered them her own, but her relationship with Jason was in trouble.\n\nTracey Lynch: Jason started to talk about movin' home. He wasn't happy.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did he say why he wasn't happy?\n\nTracey Lynch: Lot of it was down to the relationship with Molly. She was acting strange. Those things occurring that he wasn't comfortable with. … And he missed Ireland, wanted to move back. … But he knew and said that there would be huge difficulty in him coming back — once Molly found out.\n\nMaureen Maher: And the kids at this point, they call her mom?\n\nTracey Lynch: Yes.\n\nMaureen Maher: She is their mother.\n\nTracey Lynch: Yes.\n\nMolly had always wanted to officially become Jack and Sarah's mother, but Jason would not allow it.\n\nMaureen Maher: He didn't want to take the only mother they'd ever known away from them, but he wouldn't allow her to adopt them?\n\nTracey Lynch: Yes.\n\nMaureen Maher: Why?\n\nTracey Lynch: Because of what she had said about Mags and because of her erratic behavior. … She waited until just before the wedding, and then all these stories came out. So when we spoke, he said, he just couldn't. How could he go ahead and allow Molly to adopt the children when he had all these issues of trust?\n\nNow, with Jason dead, police ask Molly about his family. Jason's decision not to allow her to adopt Jack and Sarah hits hard:\n\nMOLLY CORBETT: — and I'm scared they'll take the kids. INVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: Did you adopt the children? MOLLY CORBETT: No. INVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON: Then that's a real possibility. MOLLY CORBETT [cries]: Oh, God.\n\nThe thought of losing the children is more than Molly can bear. But, investigators offer Molly a light at the end of a dark tunnel:\n\nINVESTIGATOR WANDA THOMPSON [TO MOLLY]: At this point, after talking to your dad and talking to you, it looks like this is going to be self-defense. OK? I don't think there's going to be an issue with that.\n\nSELF-DEFENSE OR MURDER?\n\nTracey Lynch says when she got the horrible news of Jason's death, she knew it could not have been self-defense as Molly and Tom claimed. She says, Jason was a gentle person.\n\nTracey Lynch: I kept ringin' Molly. She wouldn't return my calls. Her parents, you know, no, they just completely stonewalled us. … I got 30 seconds on the phone with Jack … to tell him that I loved him and I was coming over to be with him.\n\nLynch says she was desperate to get to Jason's children as soon as possible.\n\nTracey Lynch: I was terrified.\n\nMaureen Maher: What were you terrified about?\n\nTracey Lynch: I was terrified she would kill them.\n\nMaureen Maher: You thought that Molly might kill the children?\n\nTracey Lynch: Absolutely.\n\nTracy Lynch told 48 Hours she feared Molly would kill Jason's children. CBS News\n\nYears before, Jason had named Lynch legal guardian if he were to die. And Tracey knew Molly would not give up the kids without a fight. Lynch immediately flew to North Carolina and filed for custody. And sure enough, Molly filed a motion for custody as well.\n\nLynn Shanahan: No one knew what scenario was playing in Molly's head, what she thought she needed to do. Or was there a chance that they would be in danger — if she knew they were taking them from her?\n\nDuring the troubled marriage, Molly had asked an attorney what her rights to the children would be in the event of a divorce. She also secretly recorded arguments with Jason:\n\nMOLLY CORBETT: Are you finished with your dinner, hon? JASON CORBETT: I'm talkin' to you! Is this how you treat … you just ignore me? I said, I'd like to have dinner with my family … I'm talkin' to you. I shouldn't have to say it over and over. I shouldn't have to say, Molly —  MOLLY CORBETT [ignoring Jason]: Can you guys get out the stuff for pancakes? JASON CORBETT [yelling]: See! [slamming sound] There you go again. I'm talking to you and you're still going on talking about something else! SARAH CORBETT: Stop fighting!\n\nA friend of Molly's spoke with her about Jason.\n\nMaureen Maher: So, prior to his death, you never talked to her about their relationship?\n\nMolly's friend: No.\n\nMaureen Maher: And after his death, has she talked to you much about Jason and that relationship?\n\nMolly's friend: Yes.\n\n48 Hours agreed not to use the friend's name or show her face. She says she's been threatened by Jason's supporters.\n\nMolly's friend: There were some signs that things weren't right.\n\nMaureen Maher: Like what?\n\nMolly's friend: Just you know controlling behavior. Some of the you know bad language and calling her names. … And then it just progressively got worse. … Forced sex … stuff like that.\n\nMolly never reported any abuse to police.\n\nMaureen Maher: Molly has said that Jason was verbally abusive, had started becoming physically abusive. … Do you think that any of that is possible?\n\nTracey Lynch: I don't believe any of that is true.\n\nFour days after Jason died, both of his children were interviewed by a social worker:\n\nSOCIAL WORKER: Tell me why you're here. JACK: Um, my dad died, and people are trying — my aunt and uncle from my dad's side are trying to take me away. To take me away from my mom.\n\nMolly Corbett, center, with Jack and Sarah\n\nJack and Sarah are asked about the night their father died:\n\nSARAH: My mom didn't want my dad to wake up because that would not have been a good thing. SOCIAL WORKER: Tell me why it's not a good thing. SARAH: Because he just gets really, really angry. He would be like, why are you waking me up?\n\nJack even explains the odd presence of the paving stone in the bedroom:\n\nJACK: It was in my mom's room because it was raining earlier, and we were going to paint it we didn't want it getting it all wet.\n\nWhen a social worker asks the kids about their parents relationship, both seem to support Molly's claims of abuse:\n\nSOCIAL WORKER: Did you see him physically hurt her? JACK: Um, once or twice. SOCIAL WORKER: What did you see? JACK: Um, punching, hitting, pushing. SOCIAL WORKER: Has anybody told you what to say when other people talk to you? SARAH: My mom just said, say the truth, you know. That's all she said.\n\nBut Lynch says that is not the truth.\n\nMaureen Maher: You believe that Molly or someone in the Martens family coached the children?\n\nTracey Lynch: I'm certain of it.\n\nThe children were removed from Molly's care and placed with Lynch, who was staying at a hotel in North Carolina as the custody battle waged on.\n\nTom and Molly were allowed a visit., which was recorded on cellphone video. It would prove to be one of their last:\n\nTom Martens: Lots of people love you. Lots of people love you. Molly Corbett: There's lots and lots and lots of people praying for you. And for us. [Molly starts to cry, and Jack and Sarah hug her] Molly Corbett: I love you so much. Jack Corbett: I love you, too. Molly Corbett: I love you.\n\nSixteen days after Jason was beaten to death, Lynch prevails. Jack and Sarah would be heading back to Ireland with her and away from Molly, the only mother these children have ever really known.\n\nMolly's friend: She was very, very devastated. She could barely function. I mean, she was absolutely distraught.\n\nIn the months following their return to Ireland, Lynch says that Molly repeatedly tried to contact Jack and Sarah, posting numerous messages on social media, hoping that somebody in Limerick would pass them on to the children.\n\nMaureen Maher: Did you feel that Molly had any rights to them at all?\n\nTracey Lynch: No. Molly had murdered their father. And that's what I firmly believed at that point.\n\nLynch had a new battle on her hands: justice for Jason.\n\nTracey Lynch: After the autopsy … I recall the sheriff saying that, It was blunt force trauma.\n\nShe was told that Jason suffered at least a dozen blows to the head.\n\nStruck with the baseball bat and the brick, Jason Corbett suffered at least a dozen blows to the head. Davidson County Courthouse\n\nTracey Lynch: I looked at my brother in the coffin and witnessed just the devastation that one human can inflict on another.\n\nAfter those first interviews, Molly and Tom heard nothing more from authorities. Despite Molly being told that the attack on Jason looked like self-defense, a murder investigation actually kicked into full gear. And in January 2016, five months after Jason died, father and daughter are shocked when they are charged with second-degree murder.\n\nMike Earnest: I mean, of course, they're devastated.\n\nTom Martens, the FBI veteran of 30 years, would now find out what it's like to sit at a criminal defense table.\n\nMaureen Maher: They were both aware of the possibility that they might not walk out of that courtroom?\n\nMike Earnest: Correct.\n\nA DAD & DAUGHTER ON TRIAL\n\nTracey Lynch: We were under a lotta pressure as a family, and you know, we were concerned. Were they going to be charged? So, it was a relief that the charges were brought.\n\nTracey Lynch felt sure from the beginning that Molly and Tom did not kill her brother Jason in self-defense. In fact, she believes she knows the real motive.\n\nTracey Lynch: There isn't a shadow of a doubt in my mind that Jason was beaten to death because he was going to leave with the kids.\n\nMart Molly Corbett and Tom Martens were charged with second-degree murder in the death of Molly's husband, Jason. Davidson County Courthouse\n\nLynch says Jason's plans to move back to Ireland with Jack and Sarah but without Molly had finally come together. And she and Lynn believe Molly found out that night.\n\nLynn Shanahan | Jason's longtime friend: I think Jason became surplus to her requirements. She didn't need him anymore. She just wanted the children.\n\nAfter knowing her for years, Lynn Shanahan thinks Molly had been plotting to get the kids away from Jason for some time.\n\nLynn Shanahan: She was playing the long game that she was tellin' people that he had been abusive. She had her recordings. … She would have a case to get the children from him.\n\nWhile awaiting the trial, Tracey Lynch settled Jack and Sarah into their new home back in Ireland. They had intensive therapy, she says, and adjusted well.\n\nNine months after returning to Limerick, Jack recanted what he'd told social workers after his father was killed:\n\nSOCIAL WORKER [via Skype from N.C.] Is it true that your father was abusive? Or false? JACK: Um, false. SOCIAL WORKER: What did Molly say?\n\nJACK: We were going to get interviewed. … She was saying a lot of stories, making up stories about my dad saying that he was abusive. And she started saying, if you don't lie, I'll never ever see you again.\n\nJack says he only has one motive for telling the truth now:\n\nJACK: I found what happened to my dad and I want justice to be served.\n\nIn 2019, Jack was 14 years old and Sarah was 12. While 48 Hours visited Ireland, the children did not want to be interviewed, but the family did allow video to be taken of them.\n\nMolly Corbett and Tom Martens went on trial together in July 2017. Family and friends of both the Corbetts and the Martens turned out in force.\n\nMaureen Maher: What was it like to be so close, sitting by and — and in the same room with Molly and Tom?\n\nTracey Lynch: It was very — very difficult. … You're sittin' there and lookin' at, you know, two people … that had done something that was so malicious and insidious and ferocious.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin: We thought we had evidence stacked up behind us a mile high.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Alan Martin was confident the state would prove that Molly and Tom murdered Jason with malice.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin: The viciousness and violence and excessiveness of the injuries that Jason suffered was really the cornerstone of our case.\n\nNot only had the autopsy stated Jason suffered at least a dozen blows to the head, the exact number could not be determined, because he'd been struck repeatedly in the same spot.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin: We looked at the damage to his scalp. His scalp was literally ripped from his skull. His skull was crushed.\n\nFor comparison, the jury was shown pictures of the defendants taken that same night.\n\nTracey Lynch: They didn't have a scratch, an abrasion. … Molly had a delicate bracelet on her that — that night that she continued to wear — throughout the trial.\n\nMartin says that makes Molly and Tom's claim of self-defense a tough sell.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin: You cannot be engaged in a donnybrook, like they described, with a man who is bigger than you, stronger than you, taller than you, and not have a mark on you. It's just not possible.\n\nA blood spatter expert bolstered that argument.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin: He can tell by looking at the spatter on the wall that Jason's head was 12 to 18 inches off the floor when some of the blows were struck.\n\nMartin says that meant Tom was standing over Jason, still swinging, after Jason could no longer have been a threat.\n\nMike Earnest: I've known Tom Martins for 50 years. … This is not someone who loses control. This is not someone who is going to kill someone out of malice. … I absolutely do not believe there's any way Tom would hit him while he's down.\n\nThe defense pointed to photos that showed Molly did have that red mark on her neck. And a nurse practitioner testified that at a checkup just two weeks before he died, Jason said he'd been more stressed lately.\n\nMike Earnest: He had complained of getting angry for no apparent reason.\n\nOne strand of long, blonde hair was found in Jason's hand. It was likely Molly's but was never tested. And the autopsy indicated there were defensive wounds to Jason's left arm but not to his right – the one in which he supposedly held Molly.\n\nTom Martens prpeares to walk Molly down the aisle on her wedding day.\n\nStill claiming he did what any father would do to protect his child, the defense's star witness, Tom Martens, takes the stand. No cameras were allowed but there is audio:\n\nTOM MARTENS [testifying]: He said he was going to kill Molly. …I certainly felt he would kill me. I felt both of our lives were in danger. I did the best I could.\n\nMolly did not testify and the defense was not allowed to offer evidence regarding Jason's alleged abuse.\n\nTOM MARTENS [testifying]: I did not like some of Jason's behavior, particularly in regard to my daughter. That does not mean that I demonized the man.\n\nMartens testifies he went only as far as he had to:\n\nTOM MARTENS [testifying]: Once I got control of the bat, I hit him until I considered the threat to be over and when I considered the threat to be over, I quit hitting him. I considered the threat to be over when he went down.\n\nDuring closing arguments, Alan Martin used the bat and paving stone from the Corbett bedroom to hit home his point at the prosecution table:\n\nPROSECUTOR ALAN MARTIN: How much force [hits bat on table] does it take [hits bat on table] to split the flesh [hits bat on table] all the way to the skull? … You know what malice feels like when it comes from the brick that Molly had? It feels like, I hate him. I want those kids [hits table twice with the brick]. That's what malice feels like.\n\nAfter nine days of testimony, arguments and graphic crime scene photos, the jury deliberated for just three hours.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin: If they're coming back this fast with two unanimous verdicts, that's a really good sign.\n\nMolly Corbett and Tom Martens were found guilty of second-degree murder\n\nTracey Lynch: It was just overwhelming relief really.\n\nJason Corbett Tracey Lynch\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin [in tears]: They beat him horribly and viciously. And no human being deserves to leave their marital bedroom with their skull destroyed like what happened to Jason.\n\nMaureen Maher: Had you been thinking that it was possible that a guilty verdict might come back?\n\nConnor Martens: I did not think it was possible that both of them would be convicted of second-degree murder.\n\nMolly and Tom were immediately sentenced to 20-to-25 years in prison. That's when Molly turned around in court and said something to her mother.\n\nMike Earnest: I'm so sorry. I should have just let him kill me.\n\nAs it turns out, this case may be far from over.\n\nTRIAL AND ERROR?\n\nAfter the verdicts, as Tom Martens and Molly Corbett were led off to prison, the jury foreman described his struggle.\n\nJury foreman: You saw tears. There were tears. I even had a few tears there while the verdicts were being ran through.\n\nJury foreman: It wasn't an easy decision. Somebody's life changes.\n\nAnd then, he blurted out something that could potentially put those freshly-minted verdicts in jeopardy.\n\nJury foreman: We didn't discuss the verdict, but in having private conversations, everybody — we could read that everybody was going in the same direction.\n\nDid the foreman just admit the jury discussed the case prior to deliberations? If so, that would be a direct violation of the judge's daily instructions to wait.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin disagrees.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin: It's been pounced upon as to say: aha, these people got together and started deliberating before they were supposed to. … What I hear is: we're a group of people who were sitting together seeing all these events transpire in the courtroom together. … Without talking about it, we can read each other's body language while we're in the courtroom.\n\nBut within days, the defense filed a motion to have the verdict thrown out based on jury misconduct. The trial judge denied that motion, but one year later, the defense went to the appellate court — this time arguing there were numerous errors at trial.\n\nMike Earnest: There's part of me that, you know, kind of maybe has some thankfulness that so many errors were made at trial that leaves room for a proper appellate decision in favor of Tom and Molly.\n\nMarkers indicate blood spatter on Tom Martens' boxer shorts. These spots were never tested, but the prosecution argues the spatter indicates that Tom was standing over Jason as he hit him with the baseball bat. Davidson County Courthouse\n\nFor one thing, there were blood stains on the hem of Tom's boxer shorts that the state said indicated he had been standing over Jason as he swung the bat. Those stains were assumed to be Jason's blood, but they were never tested.\n\nProsecutor Alan Martin: It's not practical, reasonable or feasible to test every single blood spot in every location.\n\nThen there's the matter of the statements from Jack and Sarah. Molly's brother, Connor Martens, is upset that the trial judge did not allow them in.\n\nConnor Martens: The kids' statement say that Jason was an abuser. And those interviews were conducted in professional environments on multiple occasions where Molly was not present.\n\nMaureen Maher: And to the allegation from the Jason side of the family that they were coached by Molly?\n\nConnor Martens: The interviews were conducted by professionals. And that's their job. … Why would the prosecution try so hard to prevent that from coming from trial? It's only evidence for the jury. Let them make that decision.\n\nJack's statement recanting what he'd said after he'd returned to Ireland was also never heard by the jury:\n\nSOCIAL WORKER [via Skype from N.C.]: Is it true that your father was abusive? Or false? JACK: Um, false.\n\nThe Martens family has maintained all along it is that statement that was coached:\n\nJACK [to social worker]: She was saying, making a lot of stories saying that my dad was abusive.\n\nMaureen Maher: Do you think that the recanting should be allowed in too?\n\nConnor Martens: I don't think so under the conditions. But if they can't, then the jury can discern which is truthful.\n\nIn January 2019, the state appeals court makes the rare move to allow oral arguments in Molly and Tom's case. Once again, both families flock to the courthouse with Lynch flying in from Limerick.\n\nTracey Lynch: There is always another step, or there is always something else to face.\n\nNeither Tom nor Molly are present in the courtroom.\n\nMaureen Maher: How does she feel her chances are with the appeal?\n\nMolly's friend: I don't know. I think that she is cautiously optimistic. But I think that there's a lot of hopelessness, too. It's hard to trust the system after what they've gone through.\n\nEach side has just a half hour to make its most important points. The defense goes first:\n\nDEFENSE ATTORNEY: There are a number of statements from the children including, dad got mad for no reason. … It was error to exclude them.\n\nBut the prosecution pushes back:\n\nPROSECUTOR: The fact that somebody makes a statement doesn't mean it is trustworthy. … The children didn't want to go back to Ireland. …They had friends, they had schools. They were used to the USA. They rode horses. They lived in a nice house. They were comfortable.\n\nThe defense makes an impassioned argument about jury misconduct.\n\nDEFENSE ATTORNEY: A juror is confessing on the courthouse steps not even an hour after the verdict that they engaged in private conversations.\n\nMaureen Maher: Are you concerned about this appeal?\n\nLynn Shanahan: Well, I'm not concerned about it. … I think the case was really, really strong.\n\nMike Earnest says it is strength of a different kind that keeps Tom going.\n\nMike Earnest: Tom, I think, even as he sits in this atrocious miscarriage of justice knows that he saved his daughter's life. And, you know, I think he can sleep at night knowing that even if she is in prison, she's not dead.\n\nBack in Ireland, Tracey Lynch waits for the appeals court's decision. She's written a book about this case and Jason.\n\nTracey Lynch: I wrote the book to give him back his character. The Martens, Molly Martens in particular, tried to destroy his character.\n\nTracey Lynch [reading from book]: I smile briefly to myself as I realize that Jason eventually found himself back in the only place on this Earth he ever wanted to be — in the arms of his beloved Mags.\n\nShe finds comfort that her brother is buried in Limerick, next to his first wife and the mother of his children.\n\nJason Corbett is buried in Limerick, Ireland, next to Mags, his first wife and the mother of his children. Their wedding photo is on their shared headstone. CBS News\n\nTracey Lynch [at gravesite]: Jack and Sarah picked out the picture to change on the headstone from Mags to both of them. … I hope they're together somewhere.\n\nTracey Lynch: The memories just float to the surface, and you know, they'll always be part of our lives.\n\nOn February 4, 2020, the North Carolina Court of Appeals reversed Tom and Molly's convictions and ordered a new trial. They remain in prison.\n\nA wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of Jason's children was settled by Tom Martens. There was no admission of wrongdoing by Tom or Molly.\n\nSarah Corbett Lynch, now 13, has written a children's book series on coping with loss.
MacKenzie Bezos will grant Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos three-quarters of the couple's shared stock in the ecommerce giant as part of their divorce.\n\nMrs. Bezos will also relinquish her financial interests in the Washington Post and rocket developer Blue Origin.\n\nHer 4 percent stake in Amazon alone is worth an estimated $36 billion, making her the fourth-richest woman in the world\n\nJeff Bezos and soon-to-be ex-wife MacKenzie took to social media on Thursday to announce the terms of their high-profile divorce. Said the Amazon founder and CEO over Twitter:\n\nI'm so grateful to all my friends and family for reaching out with encouragement and love. It means more than you know. MacKenzie most of all. I'm grateful for her support and for her kindness in this process and am very much looking forward to our new relationship as friends and co-parents.\n\nIn what appears to be her first tweet, MacKenzie said she is happy to be giving her future ex-husband — the richest man in the world — all of her interests in the Washington Post and rocket developer Blue Origin. She is also granting him 75 percent of their shared Amazon stock, including voting control.\n\nExcited about my own plans, she added.\n\nMrs. Bezos's exact net worth is hard to estimate, but her four percent stake in Amazon alone is valued at roughly $36 billion based on Amazon's current share price, making her the fourth richest woman in the world. L'Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers is the richest woman in the world, with a net worth of $49 billion, followed by Alice Walton, daughter of Walmart founder Sam Walton, and Jacqueline Badger Mars of the Mars candy company.\n\nIt's impossible to put a value on the rest of it, said New York matrimonial lawyer Michael Calogero of MacKenzie Bezos's wealth.\n\nJeff Bezos will have a 12 percent stake in Amazon that, as of Thursday, was valued at more than $108 billion.\n\nBecause he retained three-quarters of the couple's Amazon stock, in addition to all of their financial interests in the Washington Post and Blue Origin, she likely retained 100 percent of other assets, including real estate.\n\nIt's not uncommon, when one spouse retains all of a business interest, for the other spouse to be bought out of that in cash or a cash equivalent, Calogero said.\n\nDivorce attorneys aren't surprised the couple appears to have amicably reached an agreement.\n\nThere is more than enough money to go around and it doesn't make sense to fight especially if there are children and everyone walks away with billions of dollars, said New York-based divorce attorney Stuart Slotnick.\n\nThe fact that Mr. Bezos is keeping 75 percent of the stock is also significant, Slotnick said. It is really important, because he keeps controlling interest and no one needs to get nervous about corporate takeovers or board actions.\n\nThe couple in January announced their split after 25 years of marriage. Hours later, the National Enquirer published a story detailing Mr. Bezos' alleged affair with entertainment personality Lauren Sanchez, including the pair's racy photos and text messages.\n\nThe Bezoses met in New York in the early 1990s while working at a hedge fund. Their divorce will be final in roughly 90 days.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Actor-writer-director Ethan Hawke has returned with a new novel, A Bright Ray of Darkness (Knopf), which details the efforts of an actor to try and save himself through art following the failure of his marriage.\n\nKnopf\n\nOur director, J. C. Callahan, stood up in front of us. He was in his early sixties with a shaved, balding head, a bow tie, and a custom-made tweed suit. He was an elegant and powerful man with large, kind, teary blue eyes. His formidable confidence was a mystery. He stood before us, five feet, six inches tall, like an Irish Buddha. Underneath his feet and sprawling out beneath all our tables, chairs, and shoes were reams of tape, probably ten different colors laid out in odd geometric designs of the various floor plans of the set. Red for scene one; yellow for scene two; green marked the battle; et cetera. It looked like a map of our future. Times Square loomed silently, blinking its mad lights through the immaculately clean windows around us.\n\nAll right, here we are, J.C. began, taking an extraordinarily long and uncomfortable pause before he continued. I know what you all are expecting – the generic 'Let's get started' speech. He barely moved as he spoke. But I don't have time to tell you all to take it easy. I don't have time to say, 'Let's get to know each other'; 'Let's get more comfortable.' I simply don't have time. He reminded me of a lion with its eyes fixed, body completely still, but its tail swishing back and forth behind him.\n\nI have six weeks to prepare this play. I don't want you to take it easy. I don't want you to relax. Today we are going to read through the play ... and I know what good directors say: 'Let's familiarize ourselves with the text'; 'If you stumble ... just take it back.' But I am not a 'good' director. I say, Do not stumble. I say you should already be 'familiar with the text.' Six weeks. That is nothing. I want us to begin today by grabbing this play by its very significant balls and squeezing them so tight that the world hears its cry. You understand me? His cadence was unadorned and clear.\n\nThere are only two kinds of Shakespeare productions: ones that change your life, and ones that suck shit. That's it. Because if it doesn't change the audience's life ... the production has failed. He paused for effect, surveying the room. He was not scared, not overconfident, just tremendously alert. I had met him only once before, over coffee to discuss my playing Hotspur. I told him I was a film actor. I couldn't afford to do the play. I lacked the training. I gave him a bunch of excuses. Then he spoke for a half an hour about the value of scaling the great roles, pitching ourselves against the past, measuring our mettle against the generations that came before, inspiring ourselves to be our best, meeting the wall of our talent. Until abruptly I said, I'm in. I shook his hand right then and there.\n\nShakespeare isn't beautiful, he continued. It isn't poetic. Shakespeare is the greatest mind of the theater, ever. Shakespeare is nature, like the Niagara Falls, or the aurora borealis. The Grand Canyon. Shakespeare is life, and life – if it is to be a great life – is not meek. Life is full of blood, piss, sweat, c**, vaginal fluid, tears, and I want to see that all onstage. Some people kind of half-chuckled. Don't laugh. We will do it. I want the audience to smell you. When your friend dies, I want to hear your tears smack the floor. When you fight, I want to feel adrenaline slip through my bloodstream. Violence electrifies a room. I want our fights to be so real that people think about leaving the theater and – he stressed – I want no one to get hurt. That is the razor's edge that we will walk. We can do it because we are serious craftsmen and artists and our life is dedicated to something larger than ourselves.\n\nHe smiled for the first time. The room was dead still.\n\nFor a few short months we will be monks and nuns dedicated in totality to our calling. We will care only about beauty. Beauty defined as complete honesty. We will celebrate what is best in each other; bring it out and plant it onstage; let it grow and then we will die.\n\nHe glanced over at an older actor sitting directly to his right. In the look exchanged between them, it was clear they had known one another for many years. This actor was playing King Henry the Fourth. He'd won a few hundred thousand theater awards. If I looked at him too long I got nervous. He wasn't the biggest star in the company (as mentioned, that slot was reserved for the A-list movie star playing Falstaff), but he was our finest actor.\n\nSome of you may be thinking, Ahhh, he's talking to the folks with the big parts...Let me assure you, I am not. We are a company. Nothing makes me want to slap myself on the head with a concrete block more than a production of the Scottish play where everyone sits around and watches the Thane act. Laughing it up at jokes no one else gets. It makes me physically sick. Our goal is a company goal. To put life onstage. Shakespeare and his poetry will lead us – like an incantation – but we, each one of us, need to be present. If we do not believe that art and beauty are important, who will?\n\nWe sat silent.\n\nThe play is designed for the ear, not the eye. The eye can look ahead; it can look behind. It can be distracted. It can close. But the ear is always only in the present. It hears what is. The actor needs to make our author's intentions 'visible' to the listener. The way to do that is clarity of utterance, and to breathe – at the end – never in middle of each line. Are you listening?\n\nWe were.\n\nWe will become Shakespeare's voice. I have been doing this my whole life. I directed my first production of this play with my youth group in the basement of my Methodist church in Minneapolis when I was fourteen years old. I was born to do this, and I'm telling you: it takes a company. We need to inspire each other. This s*** is not for students. It is for grown-ups. That's why it's always done so badly. And we, with this group of people sitting in this room, have the chance to excel. Like a melting snowball flying through the fires of hell, we have a chance to be part of the solution. We are going to come down on this city like God's f****** fist and do the greatest American Shakespeare ever. That is our goal. And we will begin today. With Act One, scene one.\n\nNothing in the room moved.\n\nThough my whole world was collapsing around me, there was one thing I still possessed. I don't think it's important; I don't think it will get me past St. Peter or through the pearly gates of heaven; most of the time I mock it – but I have always been a good actor. There was always someplace in the world where my body knew what to do. I was good at something and having that place to go had been enough. And now more than ever, I needed my profession. I needed to lean on it, to be held by it. It isn't much and I've often been embarrassed by it (as pretending to be someone else seemed a dubious thing to excel at), but somehow my life as a performer is at the absolute core of my sense of self-worth. And I have never misplaced a gratitude for this love in my life. I've done nothing to deserve it and little to nurture it. It was a gift that had been given to me and, with this in my pocket, I have always thought of myself as lucky. So, this little fighting Irish oddball director didn't need to say all that to rile me up – my pencil had broken in my hand two sentences into his speech. I couldn't wait to act. If I could do it well, I might reach back and drag my pride out of the dark, cavernous well into which it seemed to have fallen. This was going to be the one thing in my life I would not f*** up.\n\nJ.C. sat down, glanced around our sprawling rehearsal room, seemed to look each one of us in the eyes, closed his script, and, as if preparing to submerge himself in a dream, closed his eyes. Virgil Smith fiddled with his big white beard and the wrinkled pages of his manically underlined script. The King opened his notebook and found his place with an absolute minimum of movement. Ezekiel took a sip of coffee and checked out the young redheaded woman playing my wife as she dabbed her lips with gloss. Everyone was still quiet.\n\nDirectly across from me was the actor playing Prince Hal. We had met a thousand times at auditions and openings over the years. We were the same age and physical build. The path of his career had been humble and hardworking; Juilliard, London, Broadway. For casting calls, we were constantly up for the same roles. He had won an Obie and been nominated for two Tonys already, but was still as poor as Job's turkey. I was rich as a ragman and had made an absolute donkey's ass of myself on the global tabloid page.\n\nI smiled at him. He smiled back. The stage manager began.\n\nKing Henry the Fourth, Parts One and Two by William Shakespeare ...\n\nAs the run-through began I discovered that by reciting these lines of this warrior, Hotspur, I could feel a breeze blowing through me ventilating the seething anger that was scalding my organs and literally hurting me. My stomach was twisted in pain all the time but there was a rhythm in the words that soothed. Long speeches fell out of my mouth without thought. The beat of the play sunk into my guts and surged like cool water splashing against my fury, easing the burning of my stomach. When a performance is going well there is no thought, you are not amused at how well you might be acting – there is no you – you don't remember how it went. You have no discerning mind. When my scenes finished, I would sit alert in my chair and listen to the text, watching the other actors – but still there was no thought, no opinion. Then like lucidly stepping into a hallucination I would be inside the play again. Sometimes another actor's nervousness, a glint in their eye, a self-conscious hand gesture, would almost break the spell. Or I would distract myself and remember the director staring at me with his hard, unflinching beam and I would fall out for a second noticing the real world, but quickly the beat of the words would carry me off again. The first two and a half hours of the play went by like a subway train that forgot to stop.\n\nWe arrived at my death scene and I was foaming at the mouth challenging Prince Hal to meet his doom. The heat and energy of Shakespeare's language was filling me with strength. I could feel hate and for the first time in my life understood how an all-encompassing rage could feel good. It was clear and unconflicted. In those moments, I was living deep inside the metaphor of the play, intuiting the text instinctively – for a moment there was no Mercury Hotel, no divorce, no children, no shame; there were only the ideas, the rhythm, the language, and my breath all happening spontaneously.\n\nThe outside world tends to celebrate the most trivial superficial aspects of an actor's life, lifting their personality to a plastic God-like status, but the actual joy of acting lies in the absence of personality. In taking on and inhabiting the accoutrements of another's being – where they are from, their accent, their clothes, their background – you realize that every element of your own personality is malleable. You can do it, you can wear the skin of another human being – and yet still you are you. This, in its own small way, feels profound because it illustrates that none of the things you point to as identity are intrinsic. You are something far more mysterious than a person who is funny, who is angry, who is hurt, who likes Marlboro cigarettes, who is Presbyterian, who is a playboy, who is Nigerian, who is a Real Madrid fan – all of that is dressing. Of course, acting felt good to me, inside the play it felt possible that I was not a person defined by his adultery, or his unloving parents, or his lies, his failure as a father. It is possible that I could be defined by something else.\n\nWhen I was younger and first started performing professionally, all I wanted was to be true and genuine, but now, having passed thirty, I wasn't sure what those words meant. I'd turned down a fantastic role once, because I felt I would be phony if I spoke with an English accent, as if the cadence of my natural voice was not an affectation. As if there was anything at all about me – the casual unbrushed hair, the old blue jeans, the T-shirt worn thin, all deftly presenting the impression of a person who was not concerned with his appearance – that was not affected. And it was real. Affectation is very real. My big break in the movies came with the role of a stuttering seventeen-year-old delinquent in a 1920s juvenile home. Everyone thought that was me. But the real (so to speak) me was obviously an actor who practiced a stutter, stepped into the makeup trailer, and then walked back out again. The real me was kicked out of drama school because he missed too many voice and speech classes. Later, I did a film adaptation of Chekhov's The Seagull. Fans of the film would come up to me and kiss my face – so grateful I did not actually shoot myself. I learned quickly of the power, the absolute nuclear power, of the deceit attached to any kind of storytelling.\n\n\n\nExcerpted from A Bright Ray of Darkness by Ethan Hawke.

Vice President Mike Pence gave the commencement address at Liberty University over the weekend, and he had strong advice for the graduating class of 2019: be ready to be shunned or ridiculed for defending the teachings of the Bible. During his commencement speech, Pence spoke from personal experience, referencing several examples of what he called discrimination against faith-based people.\n\nWe live in a time when it's become acceptable and even fashionable to ridicule and even discriminate people of faith, he said.\n\nHe pointed to a bevy of Hollywood liberals, including filmmakers who vowed to boycott Georgia due to a newly-signed abortion bill. He also spoke about the harsh attacks by the media and the secular left, that he and his wife endured when she decided to teach at a Christian elementary school.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said he and his wife received backlash when she joined a Christian school that discriminates against the LGBTQ community. Ethan Miller / Getty Images\n\nKaren Pence came under fire after accepting a job at the northern Virginia school, where she's taught before. The Immanuel Christian School bars employees from engaging in homosexual sexual activity and does not condone transgender identity, according to its employment application.\n\nA parent agreement says it will not admit students who participate in or condone homosexual activity.\n\nThese attacks on Christian education are un-American, Pence said during his speech, noting that the Trump administration has taken action to protect religious liberty. On our watch, no one is going to prevent you from practicing your faith or preaching what is in your heart, he assured the crowd at the evangelical Christian university.\n\nThe vice president told the crowd of 20,000 liberty-loving champions for Christ that they picked a great time to graduate, because after two years of the leadership of Donald Trump, jobs are coming back and America is back, he said.\n\nWhile the graduates are beginning their careers at a time when the economy is growing and unemployment is low, the students still have something to worry about: tolerance for Christian beliefs.\n\nMike Pence appeared to reference Pete Buttigieg when he old graduates that some of the loudest voices for tolerance today have little tolerance for traditional Christian beliefs. Ethan Miller/Getty Images & Liberty University\n\nThroughout most of American history, it's been pretty easy to call yourself Christian, Pence said Saturday. But things are different now.\n\nSome of the loudest voices for tolerance today have little tolerance for traditional Christian beliefs, Pence told the graduates in Lynchburg, Virginia. As you go about your daily life, just be ready because you're going to be asked not just to tolerate things that violate your faith, you're going to be asked to endorse them. You're going to be asked to bow down to the idols of the popular culture.\n\nPence's Christian beliefs were recently challenged by Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend Indiana. Pence is from Indiana and previously served as a congressman, then governor of the state before becoming vice president.\n\nButtigieg referenced the vice president's intolerance of the LGBTQ community during a speech at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington, D.C. last month. My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man and yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God, Buttigieg said.\n\nThe presidential hopeful doubled down on this statement during an appearance on Ellen.\n\nI don't have a problem with religion, I'm religious too, Buttigieg said. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people.\n\nIn 2015, when both men were serving in Indiana, then-Governor Pence signed a law that critics say unfairly targeted members of the LGBTQ community. Buttigeig, came out just months later.\n\nThe law was eventually rolled back amid a national outcry.

Oprah Winfrey opened up to Vogue about weight struggles, aging, depression and her love life. She explained to the fashion magazine why she never got married to her longtime partner Stedman Graham.\n\nThe media mogul and 60 Minutes contributor said that, for her, it has always been important to live life on your own terms. She said that marriage never came up between her and Graham.\n\nNobody believes it, but it's true, she said. The only time I brought it up was when I said to Stedman, 'What would have happened if we had actually gotten married?' And the answer is: 'We wouldn't be together.' We would not have stayed together, because marriage requires a different way of being in this world. His interpretation of what it means to be a husband and what it would mean for me to be a wife would have been pretty traditional, and I would not have been able to fit into that.\n\nIn 2015, she told Shonda Rhimes on SuperSoul Sunday that Graham did once ask her to get married.\n\nThe moment he asked me to marry him, I was like 'Oh, God! Now I actually have to get married?' she said, adding that they decided to postpone marriage and then never talked about it again. But what I realized is, I don't want to be married.\n\nWinfrey also talked about how she was depressed after her 1998 movie Beloved failed at the box office and said that it took her six years to recover through what she called gratitude practice.\n\nIt's hard to remain sad if you're focused on what you have instead of what you don't have, she said.\n\nWinfrey said that easing into her 60s has helped her become more comfortable with herself.\n\nThere is a deepening and a broadening and quickening of the knowing that happens in your 50s, she said. Maya Angelou used to say to me, 'The 50s are everything you've been meaning to be.' You'd been meaning to be that person. By the time you hit 60, there are just no ... damn ... apologies. And certainly not at 63.
Countless performers call London their home town, among them, Rachel Weisz, who – what else? – now lives in New York, where Tony Dokoupil caught up with her:\n\nI've never been on Facebook. Like, never in my life. I've seen people on the subway doing 'likes' – is 'likes,' is that from Facebook?\n\nRachel Weisz is not exactly what you'd call an over-sharer.\n\nDokoupil asked, With your private life, there is a kind of electric fence put up, and if you get too close, you're zapped.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress and producer talks about her new film, youthful rebellion, and married life. CBS News\n\nWell, my private life is not mysterious to me. I know exactly what it is! she laughed. It's pretty ordinary.\n\nIn fact, while Dokoupil brought plenty of questions for the 48-year-old Academy Award-winning actor, he had to have answers, too.\n\nI think acting is a kind of escapism from who you are, Weisz said. But it's also anthropology. Like, I would love to interview you! I would love to ask you all the questions about your childhood. I have a real curiosity.\n\nBut these days, there's no hiding for this transplanted English rose. Dokoupil said, My other favorite nickname for you, 'the thinking's man crumpet.'\n\nDo you say crumpet in America? she asked.\n\nNo, could you translate?\n\nSure, she's a nice bit of crumpet means, well, a nice bit of ass. But can you say that on television?\n\nI don't think you can say that on 'Sunday Morning,' he laughed.\n\nShe's expecting a child with husband Daniel Craig, a.k.a. James Bond.\n\nAnd she's also the star of an acclaimed new film, Disobedience, about forbidden intimacy between two women in London's Orthodox Jewish community, not far from where Weisz grew up.\n\nRachel Weisz, Rachel McAdams and Alessandro Nivola in Disobedience. Bleecker Street\n\nThey're a very private community, so I never spoke to them, and they wouldn't have been interested in speaking to me, Weisz said. I think there's a great mystery around their world.\n\nYou like mystery, it seems like.\n\nWell, mystery is fabulous, no? Don't you like it?\n\nSpeaking of mysteries, Weisz has one scene in particular with co-star Rachel McAdams unlike any she's ever filmed before.\n\nDokoupil asked, Was it different making a scene with another woman than it would have been with a man?\n\nRachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams in Disobedience. Bleecker Street\n\nIt was much less stubbly with a woman, much softer! That would be the first thing of note, she replied. It was incredibly emotional. It was romantic. It was spiritual. It was passionate. It wasn't just sex. It was something much more powerful.\n\nThe title Disobedience is from the novel that inspired the film, which Weisz also produced. But disobedience might as well be the headline over Weisz's own life, as a self-described outsider who was expelled from her private high school.\n\nMy mother always used to say, 'You were asked to leave,' Weisz said.\n\nHow British! Why were you asked to leave?\n\nI was very disobedient. I had authority issues, I guess you would say. I didn't understand why teachers had the right to discipline me or tell me what to do.\n\nStill, she excelled academically. Landing at Cambridge University, Wiesz skipped the classics and launched an avante-garde performance group instead, called The Talking Tongues. It launched a career that has swung from B-movie glory (The Mummy) to A-list dramas (The Constant Gardener, The Lobster), to the occasional role as the girl who gets the guy (About a Boy).\n\nI never sort of saw myself in that way, Weisz said. To me, that seemed like a really alien concept.\n\nClockwise from top left: Rachel Weisz in The Constant Gardener, The Fountain, The Bourne Legacy, Denial, The Light Between Oceans and The Lobster. Focus Features/Warner Bros./Universal/Bleecker Street/Walt Disney/A24\n\nBut now, she says, marriage suits her. It's home, wherever husband is, it's home, which is a really lovely thing.\n\nDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz attend the Governors Awards In Los Angeles, Nov. 14, 2015, in Los Angeles. Jordan Strauss/AP Photo\n\nNot that Weisz has stopped forging her own path, as when she jaywalked across the street. Actually, jaywalking is not against the law in England, she noted. In fact, the word doesn't even exist\n\nReally? No, you just cross – as long as you feel like you're not gonna die, you cross.\n\nAnd with her film own production company, LC6, she's the one in charge.\n\nI'm CEO of this space, it's really fancy, she said. And I've got a blazer! she laughed.\n\nShe plans to focus on more stories told from a clearly female point of view. I think it's kind of different being a woman. Like, vive la différence.\n\nWhile never giving up on mystery.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Amol Mhatre.
Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, is returning to teaching, taking on a job as an art teacher at a Virginia Christian school, where she has previously taught. The school bans LGBTQ students and employees. The Immanuel Christian School in northern Virginia bars employees from engaging in homosexual sexual activity and does not condone transgender identity, according to its employment application. A parent agreement says it will not admit students who participate in or condone homosexual activity.\n\nI acknowledge the importance of a family culture based on biblical principles and embrace biblical family values such as a healthy marriage between one man and one woman, the parental agreement says. My role as spiritual mentor to my children will be taken seriously.\n\nSuch a requirement is common in Christian schools, and the Immanuel Christian School specifically bans all sexual activity outside of marriage -- premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex, for example -- in addition to homosexual sexual activity. The transgender identity wording focuses on an identity, not an activity.\n\nThe application also asks school staff to sign a pledge to live a personal life of moral purity. Applicants are also asked to explain their view on the creation/evolution debate.\n\nPence previously taught at the school for 12 years, while her husband Mike Pence was in Congress. As Second Lady, Pence has also promoted art. In 2017, she announced a platform called Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART, highlight art therapy as a mental health profession.\n\nMrs. Pence has returned to the school where she previously taught for 12 years. It's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack, her spokeswoman Kara Brooks said.\n\nThe employment rules were first reported by the Huffington Post.

Together, they exposed the dark secrets of their country's doping program and, as you will learn for the first time, damning new details about cheating at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.\n\nVitaly and Yuliya Stepanov now live in this sparse one-bedroom apartment somewhere in the United States, which we will not reveal for their protection. It's far from the cries of traitor and Judas back home. The price for believing in the purity of sport.\n\nVitaly Stepanov: For me, when you have this 100 percent belief that you are doing something right, you must follow this belief and let's see what happens.\n\nYuliya's maiden name was Rusanova and her specialty was the 800 meters. For more than five years, she willingly took anabolic steroids for strength and the blood-boosting substance EPO for endurance. All of it directed by her Russian coaches and medical staff.\n\nArmen Keteyian: Let me read to you some of the drugs that I have read that you have taken: Testosterone.\n\nYuliya Stepanov: Uh-huh. (affirm)\n\nArmen Keteyian: Trenbolone.\n\nYuliya Stepanov: Da. (affirm)\n\nArmen Keteyian: And Parabolan.\n\nYuliya Stepanov: Da. (affirm)\n\nArmen Keteyian: Those are powerful drugs.\n\nYuliya Stepanov: (translator) Yes, these are all steroids.\n\nArmen Keteyian: Did you think anything that you were doing was wrong?\n\nYuliya Stepanov: It's hard to believe you're doing something wrong when everybody around you says it's right, and there's no other way that you're shown. I was an untouchable, a sacred athlete.\n\nUntouchable meant she could take banned substances without the fear of being caught. The performance-enhancing drugs put her on track for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. She met Vitaly Stepanov at -- of all places -- a drug seminar. He had a low-level job at the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, known as RUSADA. He was a true believer.\n\nVitaly Stepanov: I want sports to be fair. If somebody wins, I want him or her to be a real hero, not a fake one.\n\nFifteen minutes into their first date, he got a dose of reality.\n\nVitaly Stepanov: She says, I'm doping. All my teammates are doping as well.\n\nArmen Keteyian: And what do you think?\n\nVitaly Stepanov: I had suspicion but I was hoping that I'm here to fix something. She says that's not what RUSADA does. RUSADA helps Russian athletes to win medals. RUSADA does testing, but fake testing.\n\nI want sports to be fair. If somebody wins, I want him or her to be a real hero, not a fake one.\n\nYet somehow two very different lives equaled a marriage. Vitaly now lived with doping at home and corruption at work.\n\nVitaly Stepanov: There was a situation when I was offered a bribe by the vice president of the federation -- just like that person comes to me and he says, This athlete cannot be tested. How much money do you need? And my answer is this is what I get paid for and I don't need any extra money. So she was selected. She must be tested.\n\nVitaly says he repeatedly informed his bosses about the corruption, only to be told What happens in Russia, stays in Russia. Frustrated, he made a dangerous decision to reach outside Russia, to the World Anti-Doping Agency or WADA. Over the next three years, he sent 200 emails and 50 letters detailing what he had witnessed. But Vitaly says WADA told him it did not have the power to investigate inside Russia. His crusade would eventually cost him his job and drive Yuliya to file for divorce.\n\nYuliya Stepanov: Sometimes I thought he was my enemy. That he wants to interfere. It was not easy.\n\nVitaly Stepanov: I think I'm having this opportunity to become a taxi driver in Moscow. Well, I'll be a divorced taxi driver. So that's...\n\nArmen Keteyian: That's where you were at that point in time?\n\nVitaly Stepanov: Yes, yes.\n\nArmen Keteyian: The fight was over.\n\nVitaly Stepanov: The fight was over. I lost.\n\nThe turning point came right before the London Games when Yuliya was injured. No longer a medal contender, she lost the protection of the system and tested positive for EPO. Facing a two-year ban, she called Vitaly just days before their divorce would be final.\n\nYuliya Stepanov: And he suggested, Let's tell the truth. Let people know the whole truth, the way things happen in Russia. To destroy the system one has to talk about it.\n\nVitaly Stepanov: After I finished talking to her, you know, I think am I going to be able to get another person on my side? After three years of trying maybe I could get my wife on my side? Trying to clean up sports?\n\nNot only did he bring her to his side, he convinced Yuliya to take an extraordinary risk and use her phone to secretly record her coach giving her steroids, her teammates detailing their drug use, and the team medical director who told her how to get back on the drug program.\n\nYuliya Stepanov: It was total craziness. That's how I held the phone. I put the jacket over here and that's how I held the phone this way.\n\nIn this recording, 800-meter runner Mariya Savinova admitted she took performance-enhancing drugs. Savinova won gold in London. She said: My coach helps to cover up the tests. There is no other way to do it. Everyone in Russia is on pharma. The World Anti-Doping Agency steered the Stepanovs to a reporter at the German television network ARD. Their tapes became the centerpiece of this documentary which aired in December 2014 and sent shockwaves through the world of sports.\n\nTravis Tygart: You know, we don't pick who our heroes are. But at the end of the day, they stood up. And they did the right thing to ensure that clean athletes' rights are protected around the globe.\n\nTravis Tygart, the CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, has been advising the Stepanovs since they fled Russia. Tygart has built a reputation taking down some of the world's most notorious dopers including Lance Armstrong.\n\nArmen Keteyian: You have called what the Stepanovs have uncovered a defining moment in the anti-doping movement. Why is that?\n\nTravis Tygart: The evidence confirmed what a lot of people have believed over the years. This is not just a few athletes obtaining performance-enhancing drugs. This was a system orchestrated by the sport leaders to ensure that they won at all costs.\n\n[WADA press conference: We're essentially limited to athletics, and to Russia.]\n\nThe outrage sparked by what the Stepanovs uncovered finally forced WADA to launch an investigation. Its 300-plus page report detailed what WADA called, quote a deeply rooted culture of cheating that reached the highest levels of the Russian government.\n\nArmen Keteyian: So bribes?\n\nTravis Tygart: Bribes.\n\nArmen Keteyian: Covering up tests?\n\nTravis Tygart: Covering up tests.\n\nArmen Keteyian: Fake urine?\n\nTravis Tygart: Fake urine.\n\nArmen Keteyian: You name it.\n\nTravis Tygart: You name it, they attempted to get away with it.\n\nArmen Keteyian: We're talking about, fair to say, the highest levels of the sports ministry in Russia?\n\nTravis Tygart: Listen, they're responsible. The buck stops there. The cabinet-level position funds and oversees all of sport. So they're ultimately responsible.\n\nWhen it came to doping in Russia, nobody was more powerful than Grigory Rodchenkov. He ran its drug-testing lab and had the ability to make positive drug tests disappear. The WADA report called him the heart of Russian doping. In the wake of the scandal, Rodchenkov was fired by the Kremlin and has since taken refuge in the U.S., for fear of his own safety because of how much he knows.\n\nOver the last few months, Rodchenkov has been sharing what he knows with Vitaly Stepanov. What he doesn't know is that Stepanov has recorded 15 hours of their conversations. What Rodchenkov has revealed threatens the credibility of the results at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia.\n\nVitaly Stepanov: He told me what I and Yulia did, we could only see this much. But what was happening with cover-ups, it's like this.\n\nRodchenkov, who ran the drug-testing lab in Sochi, bragged he was in possession of what he called the Sochi list, the Russians who competed dirty at the games. He also said the Russian equivalent of the FBI -- the FSB -- was directly involved.\n\nArmen Keteyian: What did he tell you about the FSB, the Russian intelligence officers and the Sochi Lab?\n\nVitaly Stepanov: That some FSB agents worked as doping control officers during the Sochi games. That FSB tried to control every single step of the anti-doping process in Sochi.\n\nWe have listened to all of the conversations. And the biggest bomb dropped by Rodchenkov was this: at least four Russians won gold medals at the Sochi Olympics while on steroids, and his lab covered it up. A representative for Rodchenkov told us, for now, he was not available for comment.\n\nTravis Tygart: Look, it's a stunning revelation. And if true it's a devastating blow to the Olympic values.\n\nRodchenkov's information is likely to influence the governing body of track and field when it meets next month to decide whether to lift its suspension of the Russian track team and allow it to compete in Rio.\n\nTravis Tygart: It's clearly the final nail in the coffin for Russian track and field.\n\nArmen Keteyian: Are you in favor of Russia competing in the Rio games in track and field?\n\nTravis Tygart: We're not. That can't come at the expense of clean athletes' rights.\n\nOne of those clean athletes is American Alysia Montaño. She's among the world's top 800-meter runners and was a medal favorite at the 2012 London Games.\n\nArmen Keteyian: Savinova. That's gotta be a little tough for you to watch\n\nAlysia Montaño: Yeah.\n\nThis was the first time Montano allowed herself to watch the race she lost to gold medalist Mariya Savinova. You may remember Savinova told Yulia Stepanov everyone in Russia is on pharma.\n\nAlysia Montaño: I just see her blow right past me, and I'm thinking I'm going to go now.\n\nMontano had led the race for about 600 meters before finishing fifth.\n\nArmen Keteyian: I mean, Savinova passed you like you were, with all due respect--\n\nAlysia Montaño: --literally, standing still. And you realize-- at that moment, I realized I'm racing against robots.\n\nArmen Keteyian: Robots?\n\nAlysia Montaño: I'm racing against robots.\n\nArmen Keteyian: People that aren't really human?\n\nAlysia Montaño: They're not really human. You know, they've altered their chemical makeup in a way that I'm not going to be able to do.\n\nMariya Savinova and another Russian who finished third in the race face lifetime bans for doping. Meaning Montaño should have realized her Olympic dream in the form of at least a bronze medal.\n\nArmen Keteyian: Do you spend much time thinking about what could've been?\n\nAlysia Montaño: Yeah. I mean, I think one of the hardest things is it affects me every single day, you know? My family and I, you know, I'm not doing it for the money, but at the end of the day, I deserve what is owed to me. Those times when, you know, sponsors ask you, Are you a medalist? and you have to answer, no, it makes you hang your head in shame.\n\nAt 30, Alysia Montaño is now training to run in Rio. In a twist worthy of a Russian novel she could find herself racing against Yulia Stepanov, who has petitioned to run at the Summer Olympics without a country, but a cause, under an Olympic flag.
Friday, day 2 of the 2021 Sundance Film Festival (presented online for the first time), featured some exceptional documentaries capturing their subjects' aspirations, disappointments and achievements, and the sometimes painful costs of pursuing one's goals.\n\nThe festival runs through February 3. [See below for program and ticket information.]\n\nHighlights for day 2:\n\nA scene from President by Camilla Nielsson. Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nFor nearly 40 years President Robert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe as a dictator, with rigged elections and violence keeping him in the seat of power, until 2017, when a military coup forced him from office. Mugabe was nonetheless succeeded by his own vice president, Emmanuel Mnangagwa, and the stage was set the following year for an election to determine whether Mugabe's ZANU-PF party would maintain control, despite decades of corruption.\n\nDirector Camilla Nielsson's observational documentary follows the course of the 2018 election, when a popular opposition leader died four months before the vote, and the baton is passed to a 40-year-old reformer, Nelson Chamisa, who campaigned on change. But would Zimbabweans experience a free and fair election, even with crowds of international observers and claims of transparency?\n\nNielsson's camera captures the air of paranoia that is (justifiably) felt by Chamisa and his opposition party, as well as the beatings and indiscriminate gunfire laid down by security forces against protesters, and the legal machinations of the ruling party-stacked electoral commission. And there's nothing that gives confidence in open government like a presidential spokesperson telling a gathering of journalists, We will not harm you.\n\nNext showing is on Jan. 31 at 10:00 a.m. ET/8:00 a.m. MT.\n\nA scene from the Maltese drama Luzzu, by Alex Camilleri. Inigo Taylor\n\nToday's economic turmoil is touchingly portrayed in this low-key drama, the first from Malta to compete in an international festival.\n\nJesmark Scicluna plays a fisherman with financial struggles and a child who needs medical attention. While the traditional fishing boat that's sailed in his family for generations is undergoing repairs, further squeezing his income, Jesmark goes to work for the black market, slowly chipping away at whatever ethical standards he possesses, and in the process pushing himself away from the vocation that he inherited from his father and grandfather.\n\nFilmmaker Alex Camilleri uses non-actors as his leads, and their uncertainty and wariness perfectly capture their characters' unsettlement and fear due to their economic instability and the interpersonal frictions of a marriage in jeopardy. Luzzu (which refers to the painted vintage fishing boat Jesmark sails) is a timely story in which those who struggle may find themselves reorienting or giving up their identity because of forces outside of their control. The price paid for that can be heartbreaking.\n\nNext showing is on Jan. 31 at 10:00 a.m. ET/8:00 a.m. MT.\n\nFrom the documentary, Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It, by Mariem Pérez Riera. Courtesy of Sundance Institute\n\nA cherished American treasure, EGOT-winning actress Rita Moreno has been a trailblazer for Latina representation on stage and screen since even before her Academy Award-winning performance in the film West Side Story. This intimate and engrossing biography features heartfelt interviews with the now-89-year-old, who speaks with conviction and humor about her personal life and career, including overcoming sexism and violence.\n\nThe film also mixes decades' worth of clips from the landmark films and TV programs which showcased Moreno's artistry, as a dancer, singer, or (in the case of the children's educational show The Electric Company) possessor of a wonderfully piercing yell.\n\nNext showing is on Jan. 31 at 10:00 a.m. ET/8:00 a.m. MT.\n\nThe Most Beautiful Boy in the World by Kristina Lindström and Kristian Petri. Mario Tursi\n\nAt age 15, Björn Andrésen, a shy Swedish boy with no acting experience, was discovered by Italian director Luchino Visconti. Visconti cast him in his 1971 adaptation of Thomas Mann's tragedy, Death in Venice, as the unattainable object of obsession for the dying composer played by Dirk Bogarde. The film brought unimaginable fame to Andrésen (then hailed as the most beautiful boy in the world), forcing him to deal with the ramifications of becoming a global icon.\n\nBut as if that level of celebrity weren't difficult enough for a child to process, Andrésen also suffered from the disappearance of his mother when he was younger, and the uncertainty about her fate would for years color his life.\n\nThe Most Beautiful Boy in the World catches up with Andrésen today, still haunted by personal tragedy, and still scarred by the film experience that stunted his growth and professional achievements even as it opened the world up to him. That he was abused when showcased on the red carpet is unclear, but his eyes – still as piercing as when they stared at Visconti's lens – present as those of a victim.\n\nNext showing is on Jan. 31 at 10:00 a.m. ET/8:00 a.m. MT.\n\nValerie Taylor in Playing with Sharks by Sally Aitken. Valerie and Ron Taylor\n\nA lifelong fascination with sharks and other sea life propelled Australian underwater photographer Valerie Taylor and her husband, Ron, to international fame, their footage featured in numerous documentaries and in Steven Spielberg's Jaws, in a career that, for her, took no small amount of glass ceiling-breaking. Valerie's transformation from a competitive spear fisher (a predominantly male sport) to a conservationist is fascinating, fueled by her passion for the ocean and her awe at the majesty of sharks, creatures she is sure could be trained (like dogs).\n\nValerie's proclivity to swim with swarms of sharks, even coaxing one to wrap its jaws around her forearm (in order to test new protective diving gear), certainly speaks to her fearlessness. But this documentary – containing stunning footage dating back to the '60s – also notes her ebullient charm, evident in her efforts to preserve sharks and their habitat, which she continues to do into her 80s.\n\nNext showing is on Jan. 31 at 10:00 a.m. ET/8:00 a.m. MT.\n\nA scene from Rebel Hearts by Pedro Kos. Corita Art Center, Immaculate Heart Community, Los Angeles\n\nA rebellion of nuns – that in a nutshell is the story of this remarkable documentary about the sisters of Immaculate Heart College, a women's school in Los Angeles, whose progressive activism in the 1960s drew no small amount of ire from the conservative archbishop of the diocese, at a time when the Catholic Church was already undergoing major reforms under Vatican II.\n\nDirector Pedro Kos traces the evolution of Immaculate Heart and its leading figures (including noted pop artist Sister Corita Kent), and of Catholic education in the post-war years, to detail what was in many ways an experiment in evolving the Church to more modern times – and, ultimately, transforming the Immaculate Heart community into a more secular iteration once the school was forced to close.\n\nNext showing is on Jan. 31 at 10:00 a.m. ET/8:00 a.m. MT.\n\nSee also:\n\nHow to watch\n\nWhile features will be streamed during selected blocks of time (and can only be viewed then), short film programs will be accessible throughout the festival, which culminates in an awards ceremony that will be streamed live on Tuesday, February 2. [Winning films will be available to watch on demand the following day.]\n\nOfferings may be viewed via a web browser, streamed from your computer to your TV (via Chromecast, Airplay or Wi-Fi), or through an HDMI connection. You can also watch via the Sundance Film Festival TV app (available on AppleTV and iOS, FireTV and Android). [Go here for technical instructions on getting set up.]\n\nIn addition to streaming via Sundance's digital portal, films will be presented on satellite screens nationwide, including arthouse cinemas, museums and drive-ins.

LOS ANGELES -- Khloe Kardashian is once again seeking to end her marriage to former NBA player Lamar Odom.\n\nCourt records in Los Angeles show Kardashian filed for divorce Thursday, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe reality TV star and Odom married in September 2009, and she filed to divorce him in December 2013, which she still lists as their date of separation.\n\nThe divorce was never finalized and Kardashian withdrew the petition after Odom was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel last year. She cited Odom's medical condition as one reason to withdraw the divorce.\n\nOdom was hospitalized in critical condition in Las Vegas in October 2015 after he was found unconscious with cocaine and other drugs in his system. After months of recovery, he returned to the public eye in February at a Kanye West fashion show.\n\nThe divorce filing states Kardashian and Odom have a prenuptial agreement. They have no children together.\n\nOdom played most of his NBA career with the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers.\n\nKardashian's Kocktails with Khloe talk show ended last month after 14 episodes. Kim Kardashian-West's younger sister also appears on Keeping Up with the Kardashians and published a book last year called Strong Looks Better Naked.\n\nAlso this week, it was revealed that Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashian clan, is considering changing her name.\n\nAfter building her family's entertainment empire around the name Kardashian, it's understandable that Kris Jenner would be interested in taking it back.\n\nBut daughter Khloe did not think it was such a hot idea.\n\nIn a deleted scene from Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Khloe idly asks her mom how she deals with getting food from their favorite Mexican restaurant.\n\nI call the manager usually and I say, 'Hey! It's Kris Kardashian,' Jenner responds.\n\nYour name isn't Kris Kardashian, Kardashian shoots back, to which Jenner announces, I'm going to change my name back to Kardashian.\n\nHer daughter argues that it might be insulting to her half-sisters, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, but her mom is unfazed: If Bruce [Jenner] can change his name to Caitlyn, I think I'm good.
Princess Diana is being remembered, as Thursday marks 20 years since the popular royal was killed in a car crash in Paris at age 36. Her death shocked the world and triggered a flood of grief and anger. Princess Diana's sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, visited a growing memorial outside her former home, Kensington Palace.\n\n\n\nOutside the palace looks a lot different than it did 20 years ago, when it was the scene of mass mourning and tribute for Diana, reports CBS News correspondent Mark Phillips. It's taken just about that long to try to understand what her life and death have meant.\n\nThe only official recognition of the anniversary of Diana's death was the brief public appearance of her two sons and William's wife, Kate, in the memorial garden dedicated to Diana.\n\nWith the small crowd of well-wishers at the palace gate, it was all but a faint echo of the mass expression of public grief that had followed Diana's shocking death. Back then it became more than a tragedy for two young boys. William was 15 and Harry 12 at the time. It was a national psychodrama that seemed to shake the foundations of the monarchy.\n\n\n\nOf a queen who, it was said, had waited too long before acknowledging the nation's sorrow. Of the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, the villain of the piece, still being blamed for the breakdown of the marriage. And of the people's princess who had seemed to single-handedly drag the stuffy royal family into the modern world and who had more or less become its brand.\n\nThe fractures in the bond between the royals and the people that Diana's death revealed became the story then. In some ways, though, her death is proving more difficult for them to handle than her life was.\n\n\n\nTwenty years later, the flowers are gone and that great flood of shock and grief that had swept Britain has long since receded, leaving a kind of sad nostalgia behind. William, Kate and the kids now live in Kensington Palace, from which Diana had been exiled after the divorce. All those changes to the monarchy, they turned into mostly a question of style.\n\n\n\nIt just goes to show what a massive figure she was and still is, said royal correspondent Roya Nikkah. In terms of press interest, in terms of the way the younger royals go about their job, so she is that lynch pin, she does still hold it together, she is still that focal point.\n\nSomebody who has not been a focal point lately is the next king, Prince Charles, who has chosen – many think wisely – to keep silent.\n\nDiana's sons, William and Harry, have decided that on the anniversary of their mother's death, they'll stay out of public view, as well.
Biography\n\nJulián Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating he and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman.\n\nJulián Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won the mayorship in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro rocketed to fame when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so.\n\nIn 2014, Castro was confirmed as secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the Obama administration. During the 2016 election, Castro was on the shortlist to become Hillary Clinton's vice presidential nominee, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine.\n\nCastro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president on January 12.\n\nCastro and his wife, Erica, have two children.\n\nIssues\n\nIn his video announcing his exploratory committee in December, Castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants.\n\nNo matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs — a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, Castro said.\n\nAs a kid growing up on the west side of San Antonio, I never thought that I'd one day be making this announcement: https://t.co/2NAIFEsCFh I'm exploring a candidacy for President of the United States in 2020 to renew the promise of this country for all. https://t.co/9jOBdjHcLO — Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) December 12, 2018\n\nCastro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues. In his exit memo from the agency, Castro touted how HUD had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. He also discussed how HUD invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects.\n\nViews on LGBT issues and abortion rights\n\nCastro was also a leader on LGBT rights as mayor. He was the first San Antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's Pride Parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the Mayors for the Freedom to Marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012.\n\nCastro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. He spoke at the annual luncheon for Planned Parenthood South Texas in May.\n\nControversy\n\nIn 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. Castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the Hatch Act in his department.\n\nPosition on Trump target list\n\nCastro hasn't become a target for President Trump. Unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, Mr. Trump has never personally disparaged Castro on Twitter.
Oscar-winning actor Tatum O'Neal has battled addiction and tabloid headlines in the past. However, dealing with rheumatoid arthritis is her biggest challenge ever, she tells Tracy Smith in an interview for CBS Sunday Morning, to be broadcast Sunday, February 9.\n\nO'Neal, who was just 10 years old when she won an Academy Award for her work in the 1973 film Paper Moon, said rheumatoid arthritis can make every move a painful struggle.\n\nRyan O'Neal and Tatum O'Neal as a team of con artists in the 1973 comedy-drama Paper Moon. Paramount Pictures\n\nThat means that my hands stopped working. It means that – I can't really tie my shoes, she said. I have to re-learn to write. And definitely need surgery on my left knee and my neck in the next week.\n\nO'Neal told Smith that, through it all, her daughter, actor Emily McEnroe, has been her rock.\n\nMy mom is incredibly loving, McEnroe said. She's childlike and has always been honest, like she said, fun-loving, just bright. My mom lights up every room that she enters. And that's true.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, O'Neal opens up about her acting career; her children; and her relationships with her ex-husband, tennis great John McEnroe, and with her father, actor Ryan O'Neal.\n\nO'Neal, 56, said she and McEnroe are on good terms now, and that their three children may have saved her life.\n\nI was really ready to kind of fall down and, and not get back up. I was not myself, O'Neal said of being a young, married mother of three at the time. I was 22, and then the kids gave me kind of a real reason to keep going and fight. And still the happiest times of my life were the times … that I was married, funny enough. So, the most stable, the most loved, the most …\n\nSo, sometimes we're thinking we made the right decision and maybe we aren't. And I have to live with that, too.\n\nAsked what decision she was referring to, she told Smith she means the decision to leave her marriage. That maybe looking back, it wasn't the right decision? Smith asked.\n\nPerhaps not, O'Neal replied. I was loved. I was cared for. We are very different now. But, I, he's happier, and I'm happy for him. And that makes me happy.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning Sunday Morning is broadcast on CBS Sundays beginning at 9 a.m. ET, and is rebroadcast on Pop TV at 12:30 p.m. ET/9:30 a.m. PT.

CANBERRA, Australia -- Same-sex couples married in midnight ceremonies across Australia on Tuesday after the country's last legal impediment to gay marriage expired.\n\nMarriage equality became law on Dec. 9 with overwhelming support in Parliament, but Australia's requirement that all couples give a month's notice for weddings made Tuesday the first possible date for gay marriages.\n\nAthletes Craig Burns and Luke Sullivan married at a midnight ceremony near the east coast city of Tweed Heads.\n\nIt's another way to show your love and appreciation of your partner in front of the people in your life, said Burns, a 29-year-old sprinter who will compete in the Commonwealth Games in Australia's Gold Coast in April.\n\nIn Newcastle, north of Sydney, Rebecca Hickson, 32, married her partner of nine years, Sarah Turnbull, 34.\n\nHickson described the divisive build-up to a gay marriage ballot preceding Parliament's vote as a horrible time. She said the couple wanted to be part of history by becoming one of the first lesbian couples to marry in Australia.\n\nLainey Carmichael, 51, and Roz Kitschke, 46, married shortly after dawn before 65 guests at their home in the town of Franklin in the island state of Tasmania.\n\nThe early ceremony was mainly to avoid the summer heat, Kitschke said. New day; new era - and we don' like the heat that much, she said.\n\nWedding guest Rodney Croome, a long-time marriage equality advocate and spokesperson for Tasmanians United for Marriage Equality, said: This morning's wedding marked the start of a new chapter in the lives of the two brides but also a new chapter in the life of the nation.\n\nToday we are a more equal and inclusive country that treats all loving, committed couples the same, Croome said in a statement.\n\nLisa Goldsmith and Gillian Brady during the wedding ceremony at The Court on January 9, 2018 in Perth, Australia. Getty\n\nThe Australian Parliament overwhelming voted for same-sex marriage after a nationwide postal survey found that 62 percent of respondents wanted marriage equality.\n\nThe one-month waiting period was waived for some couples who wed in recent weeks. Those exceptional circumstances included a partner's terminal illness and overseas-based relatives booking flights to Australia before the official start date for the new law was known.\n\nCivil celebrant Charles Foley has been campaigning for years to get Australia to drop the one-month waiting period, which he said is among the longest in the world.\n\nThe federal government imposed it at the request of churches decades ago so parishioners would have time to say why they may object to some religious unions, Foley said.\n\nIreland has a waiting period of three months.\n\nAustralia and Ireland are the only countries that have put the question of legalizing gay marriage to a popular vote.\n\nIreland held a legally binding referendum in 2015 to change its constitution. The referendum found 62 percent of respondents wanted marriage equality.\n\nAustralia's conservative government held a non-binding postal survey to avoid dividing its own lawmakers and pledged to vote on the issue if Australians endorsed equality. They did, and lawmakers quickly passed the legislation.\n\nCivil celebrant Judy Ulich married 11 same-sex couples over five days in 2013 in the national capital Canberra before the High Court overturned a local territory law that briefly provided marriage equality. The court unanimously upheld the federal government's urgent case that the territory law was invalid because it was inconsistent with a federal prohibition on same-sex marriage.\n\nUlich said she was looking forward to marrying for a second time several same-sex couples whose brief marriages had been overruled. But none of her 15 gay marriage bookings was for Tuesday. Most same-sex couples preferred to wait for a suitable weekend.\n\nUnless people really wanted to make a statement and marry two minutes after midnight, people generally don't choose Tuesday, which is a working day, she said.\n\nIn most cases, they want to have a celebration. They want people to be able to rejoice with them because they had such a big fight to get the right to marry, she added.
