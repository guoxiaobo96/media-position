when i was younger and first started performing professionally, all i wanted was to be true and genuine, but now, having passed thirty, i wasn't sure what those words meant. i'd turned down a fantastic role once, because i felt i would be phony if i spoke with an english accent, as if the cadence of my natural voice was not an affectation. as if there was anything at all about me – the casual unbrushed hair, the old blue jeans, the t-shirt worn thin, all deftly presenting the impression of a person who was not concerned with his appearance – that was not affected. and it was real. affectation is very real. my big break in the movies came with the role of a stuttering seventeen-year-old delinquent in a 1920s juvenile home. everyone thought that was me. but the real (so to speak) me was obviously an actor who practiced a stutter, stepped into the makeup trailer, and then walked back out again. the real me was kicked out of drama school because he missed too many voice and speech classes. later, i did a film adaptation of chekhov's the seagull. fans of the film would come up to me and kiss my face – so grateful i did not actually shoot myself. i learned quickly of the power, the absolute nuclear power, of the deceit attached to any kind of storytelling.

after longtime new jersey senator frank lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known republican mayor in a special election. in 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the senate. during his years in the senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. booker announced he was running for president on feb. 1, 2019, the first day of black history month. issues he has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the senate. pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the marijuana justice act in the summer of 2017. the bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 controlled substances act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. the junior senator from new jersey is one of the chief architects of the first step act, a landmark bill that president trump signed into law in december after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in congress. the legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in congress, booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.

during his second term, inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, bob ferguson, has challenged some of the trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. in a campaign video focused on climate change, inslee announced his white house bid on march 1. issues inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of mr. trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a chinese hoax. he has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in congress. with most 2020 democrats throwing their support for the audacious green new deal proposal introduced by new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. controversy inslee's tenures in congress and as washington's governor have largely been scandal-free.

only (world premiere) - the dystopian future following a mysterious pathogen that wipes out virtually all human females comes not by a snap but a mournful, months-long passing from life through fear to despair. this sci-fi catastrophe seems decidedly less dystopian than you'd think it would be if suddenly half the human race were eliminated, but freida pinto's performance as a woman fighting for survival as possibly the only woman left on earth, while her partner does everything he can to ensure it, is very effective. a very good scene: pinto communicates with her father via cellphone but can't reveal herself because of fears of government surveillance. also noteworthy: the villains of the story are actually painted with a human touch – people who have had their futures stolen from them and seek answers, if not the possibility for a semblance of humanity. directed and written by takashi doscher (still). screens april 27, 28, may 2, 4. no distributor announced.

a race worth watching on tuesday that was not receiving national attention until recent weeks is the democratic senate primary in kentucky, reports cbs news associate producer eleanor watson. former marine amy mcgrath had been the favorite after receiving support from national democrats and the democratic senatorial campaign committee, but state representative charles booker has surged in recent weeks, collecting high-profile endorsements from senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren while participating in protests across the state. internal polling shared with cbs news by the mcgrath campaign shows mcgrath has about a 10-point lead on booker, but a spokesperson for booker said it's hard to rely on polling when the race is changing everyday as booker becomes more well known. an official on the booker campaign told cbs news their internal polling shows similar margins to mcgrath's campaign's polling with booker only 10 points down, but a few weeks before that, he was 50 points down. the official said the trajectory suggests booker could win but wouldn't be surprised if he didn't. mcgrath has been hit in ads from the left and the right — by booker for not being a real democrat and from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell calling her extreme amy for being too far left. booker and mcgrath are competing to take on mcconnell in november. mcconnell has seven primary challengers on the ballot, but he is the favorite.

the president's comments on saturday night as it related to his order to slow down the testing were certainly not helpful, sisolak told pence. we're doing everything we can in nevada to increase our testing, to increase the availability of the testing and our cases have gone up. it's not solely a result of more testing, it's also a result of people not wearing masks and not following the social protocols. so, if we could all get on the same page and get a commitment that there's not a federal mandate to slow down testing i think it would be extremely helpful.

well, i saw the peace proposal, so-called, as essentially an invitation to the palestinians to accept, ratify their defeat in this long struggle against israel. it dates back really to the foundation of israel in 1948. and over time, the palestinians have been defeated not simply on the battlefield, but through, i think, extraordinary mistakes on their part, that failed at the diplomatic table. so they've turned down many peace offers, offers far better than this one. this really is a rejection of every fundamental demand that they've had. the bet that president trump and jared kushner, his son-in-law, and senior counselors crafted this over three years' making is that the pressure from other arab countries that want to get on with it.
