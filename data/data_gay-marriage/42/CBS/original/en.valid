It was updated on August 10.]\n\nImagine a loved one brutally murdered in a foreign country -- allegedly by another American.\n\nCorrespondent Peter Van Sant and his team have investigated the disturbing 1988 murder of Carolyn Abel, an American teacher in South Korea, and the loophole in U.S. laws at the time that mean the suspected killer may never face trial.\n\nA MYSTERY BEGINS\n\nFor writer and author Nancy Bercaw, flying to South Korea in the winter of 2018 reopened a painful chapter in her life: one of murder, loss and fear.\n\nNancy Bercaw: Not only were we devastated about the loss of Carolyn … We of course wondered, Who's next?\n\nPeter Van Sant: Back in Seoul. Where should be our first stop?\n\nNancy Bercaw: Well, I think we should go to the school, to ELS, where we all taught.\n\nELS is the English Language School, where Bercaw met fellow teacher Carolyn Abel back in 1988.\n\nNancy Bercaw: This is the school. ... And the world was never the same for any of us who were in that building together on December 20th.\n\nThe events of that day have haunted Carolyn Abel's family for more than 30 years.\n\nWanda Abel: And the damage that's been done … was just so devastating.\n\nWanda Abel remembers her younger sister Carolyn as the center or attention from an early age.\n\nThis is our very first passport photo. Carolyn is on the right, said Wanda Abel, who is pictured with her sisters. CBS News/Wanda Abel\n\nWanda Abel: She was the youngest and the cutest and … the baby of the family.\n\nThe youngest daughter of professors Dr. Francis and Evelyn Abel, Carolyn had a love of photography and a wanderlust that took her around the world.\n\nWanda Abel: My mother said in retrospect it was almost like she knew she didn't have a lot of time ... she wanted to do as much as she could in the time she had, and not waste a second.\n\nBy the time she graduated from college, Carolyn had already lived in Pakistan, East Asia, Germany and France.\n\nWanda Abel: She would get restless. She didn't like being just in one place for too long.\n\nThat restlessness compelled Carolyn to join the Peace Corps after college, serving in Nepal where she taught English. In 1987, Carolyn took another teaching job in Japan, where she met Tomoyuki Ayagaki, a customs agent.\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki [translated]: She's always -- cheerful.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did she make you laugh?\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki: Yes, she's funny.\n\nCarolyn and Ayagaki began a relationship that very quickly became serious.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you fall in love with Carolyn?\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki: Oh, yes.\n\nWanda Abel: Tomoyuki did propose to Carolyn.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what was her answer? Do you know?\n\nWanda Abel: Carolyn … was trying to decide whether she would be happy being married and staying in Japan.\n\nWhile contemplating a future life with Ayagaki, Carolyn received an offer for another job 330 miles away and across the Sea of Japan.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, Carolyn set out on her next adventure in life, teaching English in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nCarolyn Abel Wanda Abel\n\nNancy Bercaw: And from the minute she walked into the staff room, she was just a breath of fresh air. …She sort of looked a little bit like Farrah Fawcett.\n\nThat's where Carolyn quickly fell in with Nancy Bercaw and the other American teachers at school. Like Sandra Ames, who requested that we alter her current appearance for this interview.\n\nSandra Ames: She was making her students laugh, and sing, and -- and have fun learning English.\n\nAnd Tamara Doak.\n\nTamara Doak: She made friends with everybody. She was very, very friendly.\n\nCarolyn also hit it off with the head teacher at the school, Kathy Patrick.\n\nSandra Ames: Carolyn and Kathy Patrick were extremely good friends. …They were considered, if I can use a modern term, besties.\n\nThe women taught, traveled and partied together.\n\nNancy Bercaw: Ex-pat life in Seoul in the late '80s was wild and … one place where our worlds collided and that was Itaewon, the red-light district. … So, what we did is we danced and drank like crazy people.\n\nOn the weekend of Dec. 17, 1988, just three days before the murder, Ames, Patrick, Carolyn and some Korean students took a trip into the mountains. Carolyn took pictures.\n\nSandra Ames: We spent the time looking at temples, and hiking and then partying in the evenings.\n\nClasses were winding down for the winter break. Ayagaki was getting ready to fly to Seoul, hoping to get an answer to his marriage proposal. On Tuesday, Dec. 20, Carolyn never made it to work.\n\nNancy Bercaw: And a lot of us … missed work on occasion for various reasons.\n\nSandra Ames: I was not at that point concerned. But … Kathy was concerned about Carolyn because she couldn't get her on the phone.\n\nKathy Patrick was the head teacher at the English Language School in Seoul when Carolyn Abel arrived to teach there Wanda Abel\n\nNancy Bercaw: Kathy was asking all of us -- had any of us heard from Carolyn. … No.\n\nSandra Ames: Kathy was very upset, convinced that something had happened to Carolyn.\n\nTamara Doak: And -- I said, Well … maybe we should go over there.\n\nSandra Aes: At that point, some of our students drove us to Carolyn's apartment. We went into the apartment, and Kathy … discovered the body … She was murdered brutally and horribly and in a way she did not deserve.\n\nTamara Doak: And we were just all in shock. … just trying to figure out … what happened.\n\nNancy Bercaw: I think we all just felt like, What the hell's gonna happen now? Are we in danger? How will Sandra and Kathy ever recover from the shock of seeing their dead friend? Where do we go from here?\n\nWHAT HAPPENED IN CAROLYN'S APARTMENT?\n\nPETER VAN SANT [outside Carolyn's apartment building]: Carolyn's apartment was on the 15th floor. So here we are. PETER VAN SANT [ knocks on door, speaks to man in Carolyn's old apartment]: I'm Peter Van Sant. And I'm a reporter for CBS News and we are working on a story about a woman named Carolyn who used to live in your apartment. … and we came by to ask you … if we may have permission … to come into your apartment to take some video pictures.\n\nEarly in the afternoon on Dec. 20, 1988, colleagues and students of Carolyn Abel's came to her apartment building after she failed to show up for work.\n\nKathy Patrick, Sandra Ames and three Korean men walked down the outdoor hallway. Surprisingly, the door was unlocked and they went inside.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Who was the first person into the apartment?\n\nSandra Ames: Kathy … She went -- did a B-line right to the bedroom. … Kathy came out of the room and said, Carolyn's dead. We need to call an ambulance. No, we need to call the cops. And she didn't want me to go look at the body.\n\nCarolyn Abel put up a fight in her last minutes of life. She had a number of defensive wounds. And she took the brunt of it. More than 30 stab wounds including a cut -- from ear to ear on the-- on the throat. And there was blood everywhere in here. On the walls, on the bed. It was a mess.\n\nKorean police and press swarmed Carolyn's apartment, which had been ransacked. U.S. Army CID\n\nKorean police and press swarmed the apartment, which had been ransacked. Within hours, the murder led the national news in South Korea.\n\nTamara Doak: And I remember watching the news and the cameras panning around the room. And they kept, you know, going in on this teddy bear … And it was really horrible.\n\nNancy Bercaw: The impact of seeing her body wheeled out in a body bag really made it quite real … it wasn't a dream. It became the nightmare that it really still is to this day.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How did you get the news of what had happened to your sister?\n\nWanda Abel: I was at home. … And my mother called me … she told me that Carolyn had been murdered. And I just -- I screamed … We're just -- crying … trying to figure out, I mean, how could this happen? Who would wanna do this to her? Everybody loved Carolyn. Why?\n\nWith the killer still out there, Carolyn's friends wondered … could they be next?\n\nNancy Bercaw: We were all certain that … perhaps a Korean … had probably killed her. … if a Korean hated an American this much, was he coming after the rest of us?\n\nThe shocked friends turned their attention to Kathy Patrick and Sandra Ames, who had discovered Carolyn's body.\n\nTamara Doak: They seemed horrified. … I was so concerned about them.\n\nNancy Bercaw: They were hysterical. … it seemed as if they were having a nervous breakdown.\n\n\n\nDays later, Patrick led a memorial service for Carolyn.\n\nNancy Bercaw [emotional]: And I think it was quite moving.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Even now thinking about it, you tear up a bit.\n\nPatrick also wrote to Carolyn's parents. Wanda Abel still has that letter.\n\nWanda Abel [reading]: Please know that I loved Carolyn as a sister and a dear friend. … My roommate and are I the two people who found Carolyn in her apartment. Let me know if I can tell you anything.\n\nIn Japan, Tomoyuki Ayagaki learned the love of his life with was gone. But he decided to make his trip to South Korea anyway. He stayed with Patrick and Ames.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Even today after all these years, 30 years, this still gets to you, doesn't it?\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki: Yeah [wipes away a tear]. Sorry.\n\nIn Seoul, rumors were swirling and South Korean police cast a wide net.\n\nNancy Bercaw: We were all suspects. … Every single teacher on the staff was interviewed. … And, you know, the Korean police were in our faces just like, Where were you? How did you know Carolyn? What's your story? Why are you here? Why did you come into our country? Are you secretly FBI? … We just kept thinking, Why are you asking me this? Get out there and find the real killer.\n\nThen, Bercaw took a phone call in the teachers' lounge that moved the investigation in a whole new direction.\n\nNancy Bercaw: It sounded like a Korean woman. … And then very quickly, she said, I know who killed Carolyn. I said, What? … She said, An American military officer.\n\nBercaw told the South Korean police, who brought in detectives from the U.S. Army.\n\nNancy Bercaw: And very quickly thereafter John Boatwright walked in.\n\nJohn Boatwright was a legendary chief of detectives for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division in South Korea. He quickly eliminated the U.S. military officer who was pegged as a suspect by his ex-girlfriend.\n\nJohn Boatwright: He did not know Carolyn Abel. … And it appeared that she was just trying to get revenge on him for the bad breakup.\n\nThree weeks after the murder, an autopsy revealed the cause of death: a stab wound to her right lung. The report also confirmed her throat was cut.\n\nJohn Boatwright: In my opinion, her throat was cut after she was deceased.\n\nPeter Van Sant: After? How unusual is that based on your experience?\n\nJohn Boatwright: Very unusual.\n\nJohn Boatwright was a legendary chief of detectives for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division in South Korea. He quickly eliminated the U.S. military officer who was pegged as a suspect by his ex-girlfriend. John Boatwright\n\nSo, what did happen at Carolyn's apartment?\n\nJohn Boatwright: I was convinced that … whoever did this probably knew Carolyn.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Why?\n\nJohn Boatwright: Because there was no signs of forced entry into the apartment. … It appeared that whoever was in that apartment knew her.\n\nPeter Van Sant: There were two coffee cups found in the room. … If there's a break-in, generally, a criminal would not say, Hey, let's -- let's have a cup of coffee before I ransack your place and attack you.\n\nJohn Boatwright: That certainly would not be normal.\n\nLike his South Korean counterparts, Boatwright decided to question Carolyn's colleagues, who told him:\n\nJohn Boatwright: You really should look at the two girls who found the body.\n\nThose two women? Sandra Ames and Kathy Patrick.\n\nNancy Bercaw: We assumed that a Korean had probably killed her. …But little did we know that the enemy was inside that staff room with us.\n\nA SUSPECT COMES INTO FOCUS\n\nJust weeks after Carolyn Abel's murder, the investigation by John Boatwright was focusing on the two friends who had discovered her body: roommates Kathy Patrick and Sandra Ames.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And do you get a chance to question each of them?\n\nJohn Boatwright: No. Kathy Patrick had already gotten on a plane and left Korea.\n\nNancy Bercaw: We had encouraged her to go. She must have lost 15 pounds … She just looked like someone who was about to break.\n\nKathy Patrick, left, and Sandra Ames\n\nPatrick returned home to Washington state, but Ames was still in Seoul.\n\nJohn Boatwright: I took a statement from her … And then, I ask her, Did you kill Carolyn? And … She just, sort of, sat there and stared at me.\n\nPeter Van Sant: She's just staring at you?\n\nJohn Boatwright: That's correct. … After about 30 seconds, she was very quiet, but she said, No. … That was just -- just not normal.\n\nAmes maintains she had nothing to hide. So, two months after the murder, she waived her right to an attorney and agreed to take a lie detector test.\n\nSandra Ames: I remember … being hooked up to all the wires in a darkened room.\n\nJohn Boatwright: He asked her, Do you know where the murder weapon is? And she said, No. And she really peaked out on that … indicating … she was not being truthful.\n\nSandra Ames: I said, I'm not lying. I'm telling the truth. … So we took it again with the same results. And at that point I said, Let me tell you about this picture in my head. … The picture was a dark shape on a bed covered in a quilt that I knew was a body.\n\nAmes described that picture in her head as a fragmented memory of that night. As Boatwright asked her for more details, she told a new story. It was nothing short of a bombshell.\n\nSandra Ames: The story began with being in bed, and having Kathy at the door of my room, and coming in and saying, I think I killed Carolyn. What with? I asked. And she said, A knife. Where is it? I asked. In the kitchen sink.\n\nAmes said she was in disbelief, and asked Patrick to take her to Carolyn's apartment where she saw her friend's brutalized body on the bed, covered in blood.\n\nSandra Ames: To the best of my recollection, we sat in the living room at Carolyn's apartment, and … she convinced me, manipulated me, to help her make it look like a robbery.\n\nThough she didn't mention it when we spoke with her, Boatwright says that during their interview, Sandra made another statement about her own actions that night after she walked in and saw Carolyn's body.\n\nJohn Boatwright: She says, I touched her arm and it was warm. And at that point, I realized that she may be still alive and that she might testify against … Kathy. And so I went to the kitchen, got a knife, and came back, and I cut her throat to make sure she was dead.\n\nRemember, Boatwright believed that wound was inflicted after Carolyn was already dead from the stab wound to the lung.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So what Sandra is telling you is actually forensically matching up w -- what was done to Carolyn's body?\n\nJohn Boatwright: Absolutely.\n\nBut Sandra Ames' story quickly changed. In official statements, Ames wrote that Kathy Patrick had admitted to cutting Carolyn's throat. And today Ames claims that the only reason she made that admission was due to false memories implanted by investigators. But she doesn't deny going to the crime scene or handling the murder weapon.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You did tell authorities at the time that you cleaned a bloody knife.\n\nSandra Ames: I did. I did, and that was because -- I remembered putting the clean knife into the dish rack … Kathy had said that that was the knife she had used to kill Carolyn.\n\nIt may seem far-fetched, but Ames claims those memories had been suppressed deep in her subconscious mind until the interview with Boatwright.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Are you telling me the truth?\n\nSandra Ames: Yes. Yes.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Because some of these lapses in memory are kind of convenient.\n\nSandra Ames: Oh, they're very convenient. … But no, this is the truth as I lived it.\n\nThough Ames' story was bizarre to say the least, investigators believed the core details, which never changed: that Patrick woke her up and confessed to killing Carolyn, and the two of them staged it to look like a robbery. And the evidence they collected, appeared to back that up.\n\nJohn Boatwright: Each time that she was interviewed later, she kept changing the facts to -- to limit her involvement in the murder. But she never denied that Kathy did the murder. And she never denied that she was present just after the murder.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Who do you believe held the knife and murdered Carolyn Abel?\n\nJohn Boatwright: Kathy Patrick.\n\nAfter her confession, Sandra Ames was kept in house arrest in Seoul. Five months later, in July 1989, she pleaded guilty to harboring a criminal and suppressing evidence.\n\nSandra Ames: I was fingerprinted, photographed and put into a holding cell.\n\nBut why would Patrick want Carolyn dead? Investigators uncovered a secret which provided a potential motive.\n\nTamara Doak: Kathy really fell for Carolyn.\n\nTamara Doak was one of the few teachers who knew Kathy was gay.\n\nTamara Doak: And she would confide in me, you know, I really like this woman. … I think she's into me. And I'm like, Kathy, I don't really think she's gay. You should really be careful.\n\nSandra Ames: Kathy told me that she was in love with Carolyn … and that … her feelings were not necessarily returned.\n\nJohn Boatwright: I believe that -- Kathy and Carolyn were alone -- during that initial attack. … The thing that makes the most sense to me is … Kathy tried to kiss Carolyn and Carolyn pushed her away and rejected that kiss. … I think Kathy was so enraged and angry that she lost control.\n\nKathy Patrick was now the prime suspect in Carolyn Abel's murder. A murder warrant for her arrest was issued in South Korea. Back in Japan, Carolyn's boyfriend, Tomoyuki Ayagaki, heard the news.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You stayed with Kathy at her apartment.\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki: Apart-- yes. … [via interpreter] It was a huge shock … if that's true, if I stayed in the home of the -- of the murderer, I -- I feel terrible.\n\nKathy Patrick was now the prime suspect in Carolyn Abel's murder. Tamara Doak\n\nFor her part in the alleged crimes, Sandra Ames was sentenced to one year in prison. Meanwhile, Kathy Patrick was back at home in Washington state. The South Korean government made diplomatic requests to return her to Seoul from the U.S. to face a murder charge, but hit a wall.\n\nJohn Boatwright: There was no extradition treaty with Korea at the time.\n\nTamara Doak: Once she left … they couldn't get her back there.\n\nNancy Bercaw: Why couldn't we see through Kathy and Sandra? It's just – unreal. You know, in one fell swoop, you learn that your friends are involved in this crime … And that the one who might have been the killer is free. … because of this loophole in American law.\n\nIn the States, Carolyn's family pushed for an arrest.\n\nWanda Abel: The U.S. attorney in Washington state said, No, you can't arrest her because she hasn't committed a crime in the United States. …there was no jurisdiction to arrest her for murder … And that's what pushed my family to say, Wait a minute. This isn't right.\n\nBut American authorities weren't finished with Kathy Patrick. And soon, they would come face-to-face with her.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you ask Kathy Patrick flat-out, Did you murder Carolyn Abel?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Yes, I did.\n\nA FAMILY'S FIGHT FOR JUSTICE\n\nIn the days after Carolyn's murder, Wanda Abel worked overtime during the holidays to bring her home.\n\nWanda Abel: We got her back in time to hold the funeral on New Year's Eve.\n\nGone but never forgotten. Wanda Abel and her family were pushing the government to pursue a case against Kathy Patrick, who had left South Korea just weeks after Carolyn's murder.\n\nWanda Abel holds one of the last pictures taken of her sister, Carolyn. CBS News/Wanda Abel\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, do you believe this sudden move from South Korea to the United States was in a way-- an expression of consciousness of guilt?\n\nWanda Abel: Yes. … Kathy knew she did it, so she had to suspect that sooner or later somebody was going to put it together or that Sandra was going to crack and tell on her. … So she spends as little time in South Korea as possible after she killed Carolyn.\n\nWith Kathy Patrick back in Washington State, Carolyn Abel's family was fearful they could be targeted.\n\nWanda Abel: I was worried that Kathy would try to kill us, because Kathy wrote these letters to my parents that she was her great friend and that … she'd love to meet them. … and I was working through my mind, What would I do if I saw this person or if she showed up at my house?\n\nDespite the lack of an extradition treaty, there was still that South Korean arrest warrant for murder for Kathy Patrick. They also asked the U.S. government for help.\n\nSteven Schroeder: My name is Steven Schroeder, I'm a retired Assistant United States Attorney and I worked in Seattle.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did the South Koreans want you to do?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Among other things, they wanted me to take a deposition of Kathy Patrick and ask her some questions about the murder that occurred in Seoul.\n\nIt was 1989 when Steven Schroeder was assigned the case with John Boatwright and FBI agents. Along with her lawyer, Kathy Patrick willingly sat down with them to be questioned.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you ask Kathy Patrick flat-out, Did you murder Carolyn Abel?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Yes, I did.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did she say?\n\nSteven Schroeder: She said she did not.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And did you present her with what her roommate had said?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Yes.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what did she say about that?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Simply, it wasn't true.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And did Kathy try to shift blame at all? Did she point the finger of suspicion at all at Sandra?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Not with me.\n\nPatrick also denied, under oath, that she was in love with Carolyn Abel.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you believe Kathy Patrick lied to you?\n\nSteven Schroeder: There was enough indication of that to justify us doing further investigation, yes. … my strategy at that point was if the Koreans did not prosecute her, then to look whether we could for basically false statements, perjury, obstruction of justice.\n\nEven though lie detector tests are inadmissible in federal court, they are a tool used by investigators to confirm deception. Kathy Patrick willingly agreed to take one and answer questions about Carolyn's murder.\n\nSteven Schroeder: The examiner concluded that she was deceptive.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And deception is –\n\nSteven Schroeder: Lying.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Lying.\n\nAfter the polygraph, Kathy Patrick -- whom South Korea still wanted to arrest for murder -- was free to leave and resume her life in Washington State.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is that frustrating?\n\nSteven Schroeder: It was very frustrating.\n\nCompounding Carolyn's family's grief, Sandra Ames was released from a South Korean prison after serving just six months of her one-year sentence -- and it wasn't because of good behavior.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is it true you got out of prison because someone bribed a judge to get you out?\n\nSandra Ames: Yep. Absolutely.\n\nWanda Abel: We just couldn't believe it. I mean, six months for assisting a murderer and covering up the crime scene and making it look like a burglary and not even telling anybody? Not talking? … I don't understand.\n\nWhen Ames returned to the United States, she was recruited by the FBI to go undercover and secretly record a reunion with Kathy Patrick in hopes of eliciting a confession.\n\nSandra Ames: I didn't even call. I simply went to her house.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what did she say to you? … Sandra, what are you doing here?\n\nSandra Ames: Probably [laughs]. … And I think I said something along the lines of, How could you have done that? How could you have killed Carolyn? … And she said, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nWithout incriminating statements from Patrick, the Feds were not able to press charges for perjury.\n\nPeter Van Sant: As long as she stays within these borders, she's a free woman.\n\nSteven Schroeder: That's -- that's correct, yes.\n\nAnd with no extradition treaty in place, South Korean authorities put the murder case on the shelf.\n\nWanda Abel: I think the South Koreans were taking the attitude that this is a U.S. problem. It's two U.S. citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn's family carried on with their quest for justice.\n\nWanda Abel: My dad … contacting every congressman, every senator … He wrote to news stations – 60 Minutes … 'cause he was hoping that if that happened, then there would be more publicity, more pressure.\n\nWhile Kathy Patrick carried on with her life.\n\nPeter Van Sant If it is true that Kathy Patrick murdered your sister, is she a danger today to the public?\n\nWanda Abel: I think she probably is. … And who knows what would trigger some kind -- that kind of violence again?\n\nPRIME SUSPECT SPEAKS\n\nFor almost three decades, Kathy Patrick has a lived a quiet life in Bellingham, Washington, located north of Seattle, where for the last 18 years, she has worked as a student advisor at Western Washington University.\n\nPatrick turned down 48 Hours' request for an interview, saying Carolyn's murder was too painful to talk about. But on this day, her past was fast approaching.\n\nPeter Van Sant [walking outside]: We're gonna make our move now to Kathy Patrick's office.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Hi, Kathy Patrick?\n\nKathy Patrick: Hi.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Hi. Peter Van Sant, with CBS News. … There are investigators from two countries that … are certain that you murdered Carolyn Abel, what do you have to say?\n\nKathy Patrick: Umm, I have to say that I'm innocent. And that I -- don't know what happened after I found Carolyn's body.\n\nKathy Patrick and 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant CBS News\n\nThese are Kathy Patrick's first public words on the murder of Carolyn Abel in 30 years.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Now your roommate says just the opposite. That you confessed to her, and that the two of you then went back over to Carolyn's apartment and staged the scene as a burglary.\n\nKathy Patrick: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: That never happened?\n\nKathy Patrick: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So she is lying to us when she told us that?\n\nKathy Patrick: I believe she is.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You flunked a polygraph test … how did that happen?\n\nKathy Patrick: I don't know the science of polygraphs, I'm not surprised that I would, um, flunk it in retrospect given how clammy and nervous I am right now and I am even shaking. It was a frightening experience and I absolutely do not know what happened before I went to her apartment and found her body. Please sit.\n\nPeter Van Sant: It has been 30 years since this –\n\nPeter Van Sant: Isn't it time to come clean about this? Investigators are certain that you committed this murder\n\nKathy Patrick: They are wrong.\n\nPeter Van Sant: If you didn't who did?\n\nKathy Patrick: I believe it must have been … Ames.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Sandra Ames? … She says you did it, and you had her go over and help manipulate the room to make it look like a burglary.\n\nKathy Patrick: That's not true.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Another circumstance in all of this is that –\n\nKathy Patrick: Um, can we stop right now?\n\nPeter Van Sant: These are important questions to be asked about this. There were 30 stab wounds on Carolyn's body and friends say that you attacked her after she rejected you –\n\nKathy Patrick [emphatic]: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: -- your romantic advances.\n\nKathy Patrick: No! This has to stop now, please. … You're really sidelining me here, and I am not prepared to answer questions here at my place of work. This happened 30 years ago, I have been available to investigators in Korea and in the U.S.\n\nIn her interviews with South Korean police, a deposition and a polygraph test with American investigators, Kathy Patrick did not point a finger at Sandra Ames. Steven Schroeder had a question about that for Patrick.\n\nSteven Schroeder: Well, why didn't you tell us that 29 years ago?\n\nWhen 48 Hours recently contacted Sandra Ames, she told us she wasn't surprised that Kathy Patrick tried to blame her and denied having participated in Carolyn's murder.\n\nSandra Ames: If it went to trial, I would be willing to testify. I would need to testify.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Where should Kathy Patrick be today, in your opinion?\n\nWanda Abel: She should be in prison. Plain and simple.\n\nThanks to the Abel family's lobbying efforts, in 1994 Congress passed a law that allows for the U.S. prosecution of U.S. nationals who kill other Americans in foreign countries.\n\nSteven Schroeder: And so, today, American families -- if their loved ones are murdered abroad by an American -- will have a very different experience than Carolyn Abel's family did. And I think -- I think we all owe them a debt of gratitude.\n\nBut in Carolyn Abel's case, any trial seems highly unlikely. In South Korea, the statute of limitations for her murder has expired. And the Abel family says investigators told them the physical evidence in the case has been destroyed -- evidence that would've been crucial for a trial in the United States.\n\nWanda Abel: No one should have to go through what my family went through. How … do we live in a world … where a U.S. citizen and go and murder a U.S. citizen, and then come back and live like nothing happened? That's the outrage of this.\n\nIn a case where nothing is simple, the long path to justice may never reach its destination.\n\nWanda Abel: I honestly can't picture her old 'cause she was just always so -- so vibrant and so energetic. And I -- I -- I think she still would be. … you know, I miss her. She was like my best friend.\n\nNancy Bercaw: We've all continued our lives as adventurous people. …But, you know, we kind of … carry the memory of Carolyn … behind us, whatever ground we walk on. It's hard not to remember there's another one of us who could be out there on the same path.\n\nThe law that Carolyn Abel's family helped pass has led to three successful murder prosecutions.
Marc Anthony is one of the music world's biggest stars, but he regrets the time chasing his career took away from being a father, he tells Tracy Smith in an interview for CBS' Sunday Morning.\n\nThe one regret would be that what I chose to do took so much of my time. What I would have done to have been a stay-at-home dad, and, you know, witnessed every second of everything, Anthony told Smith, in an interview to be broadcast on May 1. I would have loved that. Didn't work out that way. So it's the one thing that just tugs at me ... that's the biggest sacrifice. And you sort of start to wonder, was it all worth it? Was it worth it?\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, the Grammy-winner talks about his childhood growing up one of eight kids in New York City's Spanish Harlem. Anthony dreamed of getting out of the neighborhood, but to do so, he says, he had to change who he was.\n\nTo my mom, I was a pain in the ass. To my dad, I was the light of his eyes.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's defiance of federal court rulings on same-sex marriage violated judicial ethics, a disciplinary court ruled on Friday before suspending him for the rest of his term.\n\nThe punishment effectively removes Moore from office without the nine-member Alabama Court of the Judiciary officially ousting him. Given his age, he will not be able to run for chief justice again under state law.\n\nMoore was found to have encouraged probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples six months after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that everyone has a fundamental right to marry in all 50 states.\n\nMoore vehemently denied that his administrative order was an act of defiance and said his personal beliefs had nothing to do with it.\n\nThe same panel removed the outspoken Republican in 2003 because he refused to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building. Voters later re-elected him as chief justice after he lost a race for governor.\n\nThis time, Moore sent an administrative order to the state's 68 probate judges, maintaining that the Alabama Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ban remained in full force and effect despite the ruling from the nation's highest court.\n\nMoore testified that his personal beliefs had nothing to do with it, and that his January order merely provided judges with a status report on a technical aspect of the law.\n\nMoore, 69, had already been suspended from the bench since May, when the state's Judicial Inquiry Commission accused him of violating judicial ethics. By the end of his term in 2019, he'll be beyond the age limit of 70 for judges, unless voters raise the limit in November.\n\nWe are here 13 years later because the Chief Justice learned nothing from his first removal. He continues to defy the law, John Carroll, a lawyer representing the commission, argued Wednesday in Moore's judicial court hearing.\n\nMoore was loudly applauded when he entered the ornate chamber where he usually presides over the state Supreme Court. He told his inquisitors that the ethics charges were ridiculous.\n\nI gave them a status in the case, a status of the facts that these orders exist. That is all I did, Moore testified.\n\nMoore's ethics trial came amid upheaval in all three branches of Alabama's government. The Republican speaker of the state House of Representatives was removed from office this summer for criminal ethics violations. A legislative committee is weighing whether Gov. Robert Bentley should be impeached over a scandal involving a top aide.
Jesse Tyler Ferguson is going to start a modern family of his own. The actor announced on The Late Late Show with James Corden that he and husband Justin Mikita are expecting their first child together.\n\nThe reveal came after host James Corden mentioned fellow guest Charlie Hunnam is hitting a milestone — his 40th birthday. Ferguson, who is 44, chimed in to say turning 40 is when you finally become an adult... like 'I need to start getting serious about things.'\n\nActually, this is something I haven't even mentioned to anyone — if we can keep this between us three and you all, he said gesturing to the audience. I'm actually expecting a baby in July with my husband. The crowd erupted with cheers and Ferguson joked, Let's just keep it between us.\n\nHe didn't reveal if he and Mikita are having a boy or girl, just saying that they're having a human.\n\nActor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, left, and his husband Justin Mikita arrive for the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards in Newark, New Jersey on August 26, 2019. JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Modern Family, the actor plays Michell Pritchett, an uptight lawyer who married his longtime partner, Cameron, and adopted a baby girl named Lily. The sitcom chronicles their journey to fatherhood and raising their daughter.\n\nIt appears life imitates art. In real life, Ferguson is married to a lawyer and now they're about to become dads. The pair wed in 2013.\n\nMikita is also an activist. He and Ferguson started the nonprofit organization Tie the Knot, which raises money and awareness for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights while also providing stylish bowties and other accessories for couples to wear during their nuptials.\n\nThe goal of Tie The Knot is clear: to advocate for LGBTQ civil rights throughout the United States & beyond, and to look damn good while doing it, the organization's website reads.\n\nOn The Late Late Show, Ferguson didn't reveal many details about his and Mikita's future bundle of joy, but he did open up about the end of Modern Family.\n\nIt's incredibly sad. It's something I've been doing for 11 years — that's like first through eleventh grade as a kid. That's a lifetime, he said about the show's upcoming ending. We'll never have a job this good.\n\nI'm big with an 'Irish exit.' I do not like long goodbyes, so maybe that's what I'll do. After my last scene I'll just leave the lot and just drive home, he said, receiving laughs from the audience. I think that's the only way I'll be able to manage this. It's really emotional.\n\nCorden put things in perspective for Ferguson: On your last day of 'Modern Family,' knowing what we know now, you should think I'm leaving 'Modern Family' behind, but come July, you're going to make your new modern family — and it's going to be beautiful.
Franklin Graham, who is the son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and a prominent supporter of President Trump, slammed Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for being gay, Christian and married. In a series of three tweets Wednesday, he assailed Buttigieg for remarks he has made about being a gay Christian.\n\nPresidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right—God doesn't have a political party, Graham wrote. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn't change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever.\n\nThen, Graham added, Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.\n\nGraham, who heads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and the Christian relief group Samaritan's Purse, faced a storm of criticism for the comment. Several expressed outrage over the judgment he pronounced on Buttigieg, in light of his support of Mr. Trump. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough exclaimed, Oh shut up. You are a disgrace, adding, You are a disgrace for normalizing Donald Trump's behavior.\n\nGraham has said of Mr. Trump, I never said he was the best example of the Christian faith. He defends the faith. And I appreciate that very much. And he said that the president has admitted his faults and has apologized to his wife and daughter for things he has done and said. And he has to stand before God for those things.\n\nButtigieg has been feuding with Vice President Mike Pence over his opposition to gay marriage and gay rights. If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, Buttigieg said at an LGBTQ Victory Fund brunch earlier this month. And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand — that if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\n\nHe has also suggested that suffers from his own Christian failings in supporting Mr. Trump. How could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn star presidency? Is it that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump? he said at a CNN town hall in March.\n\nIn 2015, when both Buttigieg and Pence were serving in Indiana, Pence, then the governor, signed a law that critics said unfairly targeted members of the LGBTQ community. Months later, during his mayoral re-election bid, Buttigieg came out as gay. The law was eventually rolled back amid a national outcry.\n\nLast year, Buttigieg married teacher Chasten Glezman, and should he win the presidency, the two would be the first gay first couple in the White House.\n\nButtigieg has not yet responded to Graham's remarks.
Linda Ronstadt quit performing years ago – her Parkinson's disease makes singing impossible. But last fall, she spoke to a sellout crowd at The Theatre at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, who came to see her in person, and listen to her talk about what has been a magical life.\n\nThe great thing about having a hit is that means people like you, Ronstadt told the audience.\n\nBut the bad thing about it is, it means you have to sing that song over and over and over again, night after and night after night, 'til it starts sounding like your washing machine.\n\nLinda Ronstadt, with John Boylan, appeared on stage at A Conversation With Linda Ronstadt in Los Angles last October. CBS News\n\nThe crowd basked in Ronstadt's tales of her life and career, such as when she toured for four months as the opening act of The Doors: It was pretty tough to play with The Doors. It was kinda like a double bill of 'Bambi' and 'Deep Throat'!\n\nCorrespondent Tracy Smith asked Ronstadt, What's it like to get that kind of warmth when you're just talking?\n\nI was just astounded. I mean, it made me feel good, but I was glad they didn't boo, or start yelling for 'Heat Wave'!\n\nAnd you know she's heard that before.\n\nIn case you need a reminder, Ronstadt was a musical force of nature who sold 100 million records, had four consecutive platinum albums, and won an armful of Grammys for songs in wildly different music styles, like country, Latin and pop.\n\nFor much of her career, she practically lived on the road. But these days, her world is a bit smaller:\n\nShe mostly keeps to a San Francisco neighborhood close to the famous bridge, and a house on a quiet street where it seems she has now become the world's most famous couch potato.\n\nThese days she spends much of her time reading. I can't do a lot of things that are active, she said. I can't spend very much time on my feet, or even very much time sitting up. I have to kind of lounge around. But I'm lazy, so it's a good thing that I lounge!\n\nSo, I'm glad to have the leisure time. I have a huge stack of books that I need to read.\n\nSmith asked, When you think about those songs, in your mind, can you still sing?\n\nOh, I can sing in my brain; I sing in my brain all the time. But it's not quite the same as doing it physically. You know, there's a physical feeling in singing that's just like skiing down a hill, except better, 'cause I'm not a very good skier!\n\nBut she was a very good singer:\n\nFor more than four decades it seemed there was nothing Linda Ronstadt couldn't do, until she sensed that her voice was beginning to fail her.\n\nSmith asked, When did you start noticing there was something wrong with your voice?\n\n2000, she replied. I'd start to sing and then it would just clamp up. It was, like, a cramp. My voice would freeze. And I said, 'There's something wrong with my voice.' And people would say, 'Oh, you're just a perfectionist.' I go, 'No, there's really something systemically wrong.'\n\nAnd it's very slow-moving, this disease, so it took a long time to really finally manifest.\n\nShe played her last show in 2009, but it wasn't until 2013 that she revealed she'd been diagnosed with Parkinson's.\n\nShe'd retired before she knew what was happening: Oh yeah. I was just yelling. Instead of singing, I was just kind of yelling. I didn't want to charge people for that.\n\nDo you think other people heard it, too, really? asked Smith.\n\nYeah, yeah. But I mean, it wouldn't have mattered. I could hear it. It wasn't any fun anymore. You know, singing is … there are really a lot of things you can do with your voice; you can slide on all different sorts of textures and things. And if you're not doing that, it's not interesting.\n\nAnd she always tried to keep it interesting. Besides her solo work, she teamed up with some of the greatest voices in the business.\n\nTo watch Linda Ronstadt perform with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris on The Late Show with David Letterman, click on the video player below:\n\nNo record company wanted to touch that, Ronstadt said. Called us the 'Queenston Trio.'\n\nIt's an amazing thing, when you sing with somebody. It's a very intimate relationship. It's almost like sex. It's as intimate as sex, but it's not sex. It's different. It's that intimate. It's like a great love affair.\n\nHer own love affair with music started when she was a kid growing up in Arizona in a musical family, learning to sing and play the guitar.\n\nShe was, and is, an independent spirit, from her career choices to her relationships, like her much-publicized romance with former California Governor Jerry Brown.\n\nShe says she still talks with Brown. Yeah, he was here for Thanksgiving.\n\nIt seems like you've managed to maintain relationships with people who were in your life, Smith said.\n\nI don't know why they're still speaking to me, but they are!\n\nWhy didn't you ever get married?\n\nI was not cut out for marriage, Ronstadt replied. I used to dream that I was gonna get married, and I'd go, 'I'm too young to get married.' And this was when I was, like, 45, you know? And I'd go, 'I can't get married. I'm too young.' So I guess that means I'm just really immature! I'm not good at compromising.\n\nYou know this about yourself?\n\nOh boy, do I ever!\n\nThe Stone Poneys, featuring Linda Ronstadt, performs Different Drum:\n\nBut her refusal to compromise helped her reach the heights of artistic achievement, and take home countless awards, including the National Medal of Arts in 2014, presented by an admittedly smitten president.\n\nSmith said, President Obama confessed, or admitted, to having a crush on you.\n\nOh, he was being nice to a 70-year-old woman in a wheelchair, Ronstadt said.\n\nHow about that medal? Do accolades like that mean something to you?\n\nWell, it's kinda big! I didn't know what to do with that. I put it under the bed. It's under my bed, with my crowbar that I have for in case there's an earthquake and I have to pry the roof off myself. I have a crowbar and medal under the bed!\n\nI mean, it's nice to be acknowledged, nice for your work to be acknowledged. But it's not what you do it for. You do it for the work. And if you're doing it for prizes, you're in big trouble.\n\nAnd who knows, there could be even more awards on the way: Last week she came out with a new live album – her first ever – made from newly-uncovered tapes of a made-for-TV concert in 1980, when she was at the height of her vocal powers.\n\nTo watch Linda Ronstadt perform You're No Good, from her new album, Linda Ronstadt Live in Hollywood, click on the video player:\n\nNow, she says, she can't even sing in the shower.\n\nSmith asked, Do you try?\n\nYeah, but it doesn't, I can't make sound, Ronstadt replied.\n\nThey've talked over the years about various treatments that could make singing come back.\n\nI'm sure they'll find something eventually, you know? They're learning so much more about it every day.\n\nRhino Records\n\nI mean, I'm 72. We're all gonna die. They say people usually die with Parkinson's. They don't always die of it, because it's so slow-moving, so I figure I'll die of something. And I've watched people die, so I'm not as afraid of dying. I'm afraid of suffering, but I'm not afraid of dying.\n\nAnd ever the performer, she says she'd like to go out singing.\n\nThat's the way I'd like to die, is right in the middle of a note! she said.\n\nAs of right now, there are no more Conversations With Linda Ronstadt on the books. But at 72, she's learned never to say never. And at the end of her appearance in L.A., as she started to leave the stage, she hesitated for just a moment. Maybe that's because, like her millions of fans, Linda Ronstadt is not quite ready to say goodbye.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by John D'Amelio.

AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: 2020 is our time to change who makes the rules.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nANNOUNCER: One stage.\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This election is just too important, and we cannot afford to get it wrong.\n\nJOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's no limit to what we could get done in the next four years.\n\nTOM STEYER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Show up in November of 2020 and win.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nANNOUNCER: Seven Democratic candidates.\n\nWARREN: Together, we have built a movement.\n\nSTEYER: We have a fantastically diverse and wonderful party.\n\nBIDEN: We choose hope over fear.\n\nSANDERS: We are going to unite together.\n\nBLOOMBERG: And, together, we are going to get it done.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We will deliver a democracy worthy of the name.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: We are here, and we are strong.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the Gaillard Center in Charleston, South Carolina, this is the CBS News Democratic debate.\n\nHere are the seven candidates for the presidential nomination.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: Good evening, and welcome.\n\nThe Democratic presidential primary here in South Carolina, the first primary in the South, is just four days away.\n\nKING: And Super Tuesday is just a week away. And this is the biggest primary day of the year, as voters in 14 states cast ballots, and many of them tell us they have not actually made up their mind.\n\nSo, this debate, when you think about it tonight, may be the last, best chance for the candidates to make their case to South Carolina and Super Tuesday voters.\n\nO'DONNELL: And CBS News is proud too bring you this debate, along with our co-sponsors.\n\nThey are the Democratic National Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating voters and training political leaders.\n\nKING: And we are partnering tonight also with Twitter.\n\nSo, you at home can participate in this debate. How do you do that? Send us your questions for the candidates using the Twitter hashtag #DemDebate.\n\nO'DONNELL: Now, here are the rules for the next two hours.\n\nWhen you are asked a question, you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer, and 45 seconds for follow-ups.\n\nSo, let's begin.\n\nSenator Sanders, we haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower.\n\nHow will you convince voters that a Democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?\n\nSANDERS: Well, you're right. The economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: In the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth.\n\nBut you know what? For the ordinary American, things are not so good. Last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than 1 percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck; 87 million Americans have no health insurance or are underinsured; 45 million people are struggling with student debt; 500,000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street, including 30,000 veterans.\n\nThat is not an economy that's working for the American people. That's an economy working for the 1 percent.\n\nWe're going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Senator...\n\nO'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg...\n\nBLOOMBERG: Senator...\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBLOOMBERG: Senator...\n\nO'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, I'll let you respond to that.\n\nDo you think Senator Sanders' economy would be better for America than President Trump's?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I -- I think that Donald Trump thinks it would be better if he's president. I do not think so.\n\nVladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States.\n\nAnd that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, Mr. Bloomberg.\n\nLet me tell Mr. Putin, OK, I'm not a good friend of President Xi of China. I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader.\n\nAnd let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, try to bring Americans against Americans, hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not going to interfere in any more American elections.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Warren?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Look, we know what the president -- what Russia wants. It's chaos.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas, even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don't want to say so.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: You know, but Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie.\n\nAnd the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard, and it's going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen.\n\nBernie and I both wanted to help rein in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance. But I dug in. I fought the big banks. I built the coalitions, and I won.\n\nBernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank...\n\nWARREN: I dug in. I did the work. And then Bernie's team trashed me for it.\n\nWe need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done. Progressives have got one shot. And we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done.\n\nKING: Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you in this conversation.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Why would the Russians want to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I will tell you what the Russians want. They don't have a political party. They want chaos.\n\nAnd chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Think about what that will be like for this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: And, meanwhile, folks at home, from South Carolina to South Bend, are trying to figure out what any of this means for us, because it's right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up, and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement.\n\nBut, also, there's a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n\nO'DONNELL: Mr. Steyer.\n\nKING: Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: Bernie Sanders' analysis is right.\n\nThe difference is, I don't like his solutions. I don't believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families.\n\nI think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant, competitive private sector.\n\nBut we all know, unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer is not for the government to take over the private sector, though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n\nKING: Vice President Biden?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTEYER: We need to -- well, let me just finish, because we need to have an alternative to Donald Trump.\n\nI'm talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10 percent for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over 4.5 million good-paying union jobs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTEYER: Donald Trump thinks -- he's incompetent as a steward of the American economy. We have to show that we can create a growing, prosperous economy that works for American working people.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nGayle?\n\nKING: Mr. Steyer, thank you. Your time is up.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: You know, when we talk about progressive, let's talk about being progressive.\n\nWalking distance of here is Mother Emanuel Church, nine people shot dead by a white supremacist.\n\nBernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and wanted a waiting period...\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: No, let me finish.\n\n2010-2015 Josh\n\nA waiting period of 12 hours. I'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared.\n\nIn addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama -- he wanted a primary-- he said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, this is -- let's talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done, and that's what we got done. We got a lot done\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, your response.\n\nSANDERS: You know, Pete mentioned -- I'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSANDERS: I wonder why. And maybe, you know, Pete mentions what the American people want. I will tell you, Pete, what the American people want, and, Joe, what the American people want. They don't want candidates to be running to billionaires for huge amounts of funding.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: All right, let's clear this up once and for all.\n\nSANDERS: Pete has gotten funding from over 50 billionaires.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: You've got people believing something that is false. This needs to be cleared up.\n\nSANDERS: Joe, I think, has gotten a little bit more. What the American people want, by the way, and a lot of the issues we'll be discussing tonight are issues I raised four years ago: raising the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. Making public colleges and universities tuition-free. And finally, doing what every other major country on Earth does, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right through a Medicare for All, single-payer system.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I can't allow -- I can't allow this to stand because it's just not true. Senator Sanders...\n\nKING: We're going to allow everyone an opportunity opportunity to respond.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... has got people believing something that is untrue about my campaign. The idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires...\n\nSANDERS: I didn't say that, Pete.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Fifty people, all right. In Charleston alone, just in Charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. That means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from Charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned. Grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign.\n\nIn fact, I shouldn't miss the opportunity, if you're watching right now and you support my campaign, go to peteforamerica.com, and chip in. And if you are watching right now, and you're a billionaire, I will raise your taxes. But if you'd like to defeat Donald Trump, please go to peteforamerica.com and donate legal maximum of $2,800, if you're a billionaire.\n\nKING: All right, all right, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nVice President Biden, I want to make -- I want to bring us to another topic. We're in South Carolina. It's the first primary with a significant black voting population. Your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters. And I'm wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time.\n\nBIDEN: Well, first of all, the latest poll I saw, my numbers -- I'm still 15 points ahead, the latest poll.\n\nKING: Yes, yes, you're correct. You're correct.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: But look, look...\n\nKING: But Senator Sanders is in striking distance of you. You are within the margin of error in this state.\n\nBIDEN: Well, it depends which -- look, I've earned the vote, I've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African-American community, not just here but across the country. I've been coming here for years and years, creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example, that employs one in 11 people, we put $500 million, in our administration, just into this county. We've created jobs for people.\n\nThe people know me. My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties. I don't expect anything. I plan to earn the vote. I'm here to ask. I'm here to earn it. But, folks, I intend to win in South Carolina, and I will win the African-American vote here in South Carolina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Mr. Biden, will you continue if you do not win South Carolina? You have said that South Carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race. If you don't win South Carolina, will you continue in this race?\n\nBIDEN: I will win South Carolina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, sir.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, I'd like to bring you into this conversation. I want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community. You've apologized for stop and frisk repeatedly. What exactly are you apologizing for?\n\nBLOOMBERG: We let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95 percent. And I've apologized and asked for forgiveness. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time.\n\nBut let me tell you, I have been working very hard. We've improved the school system for black and brown students in New York City. We've increased the jobs that are available to them. We've increased the housing that's available to them. We have programs like the...\n\nKING: But what more can you do about this issue, Mr. Mayor, to put people's fears and skepticism to rest? It continues to follow you.\n\nBLOOMBERG: No -- well, that's because it's in their interest to promote that. But if you talk to the people in New York City, I have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me. A lot of them are in the audience tonight. And I've earned the respect of people in New York City.\n\nI was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the United States for 12 years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. It is safer for everybody. The school system is better. The budget is under control. We've done the things that people need in New York City for all ethnicities.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Mayor Buttigieg, mayor to mayor, mayor to mayor, you've certainly had your issues with the black community as well. Do you think the New York City's implementation of stop and frisk was racist?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Yes, in effect, it was. Because it was about profiling people based on their race. And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. And I'm not here to score points. I come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community.\n\nAnd I come to this with some humility because I'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. None of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin.\n\nNone of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by, of going into a doctor, and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race. Since we don't have the experience, the next best thing we can do...\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mayor.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... is actually listen to those who do.\n\nBLOOMBERG: I know -- wait a second. I know that if I were black, my success would have been a lot harder to achieve. And I know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them. That's just a fact, and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Yes, and I think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. Martin Luther King once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it.\n\nAnd to me that means sentencing reform, like the First Step Act, and extending that to the states with the Second Step Act. It means equal opportunity. Because if we don't pass Representative Clyburn's bill out of South Carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny.\n\nAnd we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. And then, finally, voting. While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls. Georgia kicked 100,000 off. As president, I will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Senator Warren, I'm coming to you. I want to direct this question to you because you -- because Mayor Bloomberg has said he got in this race late because he doesn't believe that any of you on stage can beat Donald Trump. You said Mayor Bloomberg is not the safest candidate, he is the riskiest candidate. What did you mean by that?\n\nWARREN: I mean that Mayor Bloomberg -- let's think of it this way. We're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week is Donald Trump. He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy Senator Lindsey Graham, who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re-election last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nAnd that's not the only right-wing senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded. In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point.\n\nIn 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will. And the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the Democratic Party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, Senator Warren, thank you.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond? Mayor Bloomberg?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I have been training for this job since I stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 9/11. I know what to do. I've shown I know how to run a country. I've run the city which is almost the same size -- bigger than most countries in the world.\n\nI am not the -- I'm the one choice that makes some sense. I have the experience. I have the resources. And I have the record. And all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. When people hired me to run New York City three times, in an overwhelmingly Democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again.\n\nO'DONNELL: Mr. Vice President?\n\nWARREN: I was mentioned in this.\n\nBIDEN: No...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: I'd like to respond.\n\nO'DONNELL: Go ahead, Senator.\n\nWARREN: He called me out by name.\n\nBIDEN: There was a -- I thought...\n\nWARREN: ... and referred to what I talk about as a sideshow. You know, this is personal for me. When I was 21 years old, I got my first job as a special education teacher. I loved that job. And by the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant.\n\nThe principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination, you bet. But I was 21 years old. I didn't have a union to protect me. And I didn't have any federal law on my side. So I packed up my stuff, and I went home. At least I didn't have a boss who said to me, Kill it, the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said...\n\nBLOOMBERG: I never said that. Oh, come on.\n\nWARREN: ... to one of his pregnant employees. People want a chance to hear...\n\n(AUDIENCE BOOS)\n\nPeople want a chance to hear from the women who have worked for...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLOOMBERG: I never said that. And for the record, if she was a teacher in New York City, she would never have had that problem. We treated our teachers the right way, and the unions will tell you exactly that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: Well, Mayor Bloomberg, Senator Warren has raised...\n\nWARREN: Then let us -- let us have -- the women have an opportunity to speak. The Bloomberg corporations and Mayor Bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination. They are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak. If he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: ... so that they can tell their stories the way I can tell my story without having the fear they're going to be sued by a billionaire.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you. Thank you. We have a number of issues to discuss tonight, but I want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond, because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace. At the last debate, you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes. Did these women take your jokes wrong? Or were you wrong to make the jokes?\n\nBLOOMBERG: Probably wrong to make the jokes. I don't remember what they were. So I assume -- if it bothered them, I was wrong, and I apologize. I'm sorry for that.\n\nBut what happened here is we went back 40 years and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable. Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two. And what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. I did that two days later, and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again. The senator has got it. And I don't know what else she wants us to do.\n\nWARREN: Oh, I'll be clear.\n\nBLOOMBERG: We're following exactly what she asked to do.\n\nWARREN: I'll tell you exactly what I want you to do.\n\nBLOOMBERG: And the trouble is with this senator, enough is never enough for what this -- I'm going to start focusing on some of these other things. We just cannot continue to re-litigate this every time. We did what she asked. And, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it. And by my company renouncing using these, we probably changed, hopefully, the corporate landscape all across America.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: If you get nominated, we'll be re-litigating this all year.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: Sorry, Mayor, you did not do what I asked.\n\nKING: Senator Warren, that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor.\n\nWARREN: Yes.\n\nKING: He told a woman to get an abortion. What evidence do you have of that?\n\nWARREN: Her own words.\n\nKING: And, Mayor Bloomberg, could you respond to this?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I never said it, period, end of story. Categorically never said it. When it was accused -- when I was accused of doing it, we couldn't figure out what she was talking about. But right now, I'm sorry if she heard what she thought she heard, or whatever happened. I didn't take any pleasure in that. And we've just got to go on. But I never said it. Come on.\n\nWARREN: What I asked the mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims...\n\nBLOOMBERG: We are doing that, Senator.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: We want to get to the -- we want to get to the issue -- we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the Democratic Party.\n\nWARREN: OK.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, the cost of your agenda. Yesterday, you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals, but not all of your details are clear. You've proposed more than $50 trillion in new spending.\n\nSANDERS: Over a 10-year period.\n\nO'DONNELL: You've said Medicare for all will cost $30 trillion.\n\nSANDERS: Over a 10-year period.\n\nO'DONNELL: But you can only explain how you'll pay for just about half of that. Can you do the math for the rest of us?\n\nSANDERS: How many hours do you have?\n\nKING: Two.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's the problem.\n\nSANDERS: No, it's not the problem. All right, let's talk about Medicare for all. I'm sure you're familiar with the new study that just came out of Yale University, published in Lancet magazine, one of the prestigious medical journals in the world. You know what it said? Medicare for all will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save 68,000 lives of people who otherwise would have died.\n\nWhat we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does: guarantee health care to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer.\n\nOur plan -- we have laid out options all over the place. One of the options is a 7.5 percent payroll tax on employers, which will save them substantial sums of money. Another...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Bernie, let me -- let me respond to this.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: You asked me a question.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, does the math add up?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: No, the math does not add up. In fact, just on 60 Minutes this weekend, he said he wasn't going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes. Well, let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we're talking about: nearly $60 trillion. Do you know how much that is, for all of his programs?\n\nSANDERS: Not true.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: That is three times the American economy -- not the federal government -- the entire American economy. The Medicare for all plan alone on page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. That is true.\n\nAs one prominent Democrat once said, we should pay attention to where the voters of this country are, Bernie. That prominent Democrat was Barack Obama a few months ago. And I think that's what we should do. They are not with you on spending nearly $60 trillion.\n\nSANDERS: First of all...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: What I think we should do is make things more affordable, nonprofit public option, make sure we're paying for long-term care better, take on the pharmaceuticals, like you and I have done together...\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... and do something for the people of America.\n\nKING: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers.\n\nKING: Mr. Steyer -- Mr. Steyer...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I think we're talking about math.\n\nKING: We'll get to you, Mr. Sanders.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about it.\n\nSTEYER: Can I say something?\n\nSANDERS: First of all...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: No, let me go.\n\nSANDERS: No, I think -- Tom, I think she was talking about my plan, not yours.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I think we were talking about math, and it doesn't take two hours to do the math.\n\nSANDERS: No, no, well, let's talk about math.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Because let's talk about what it adds up to.\n\nSANDERS: Let's talk about math.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about math, indeed. OK, so here's the math...\n\nSANDERS: If we do nothing is what...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: No, here's the math.\n\nSANDERS: Excuse me, can I respond to the attack?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: To do nothing is what will happen...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you are allowed a quick response and then we would like to allow the other candidates...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: Listen to the moderator, guys.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: The moderator -- is it my turn?\n\nBIDEN: This helps a lot, doesn't?\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you have been name checked. You are allowed to respond.\n\nSANDERS: OK. What the Health and Human Services have said in analyzing health care costs, what Yale -- recent Yale study has said is that your program would cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period. We would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs. What every study out there -- conservative or progressive -- says, Medicare for all will save money. Ours will cost about $45 billion, not $60 trillion.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Bernie, I was talking about -- I was talking about...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKING: We would like -- Senator Sanders, we would like to bring Mr. Steyer in on this conversation.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: Mr. Steyer, please.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I was talking about all your programs.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: Excuse me, Amy. This conversation shows a huge risk for the Democratic Party. We are looking at a party that has decided that we're either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a Republican.\n\nAnd let me say that I got into this race because I wanted to fight for economic justice, for racial justice, and to make sure we had climate justice for the American people. And I am scared.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIf we cannot pull this party together, if we go to one of those extremes, we take a terrible risk of re-electing Donald Trump.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: And that is something -- I still have some time. And let me say this.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: That is a risk that will hurt the American people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you. Let's keep this topic going. Mayor Pete?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: So let's do this math. Senator Sanders at one point said it was going to be $40 trillion, then it was $30 trillion, then it was $17 trillion. That's an incredible shrinking price tag. At some point, has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be. Now there are new numbers.\n\nI'll tell you exactly what it adds up to.\n\nIt adds to four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, and the inability to get the Senate into Democratic hands.\n\nThe time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters. Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump reelected.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We got a House to worry about. We got a Senate to worry about. And this is -- this is really important.\n\nLook...\n\nBIDEN: Hello?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... if you want to keep the House in Democratic hands, you might want to check with the people who actually turned the House blue, 40 Democrats, who are not running on your platform.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I want to send those Democrats back to the United States House.\n\nKING: Vice President Biden.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Let's listen to them...\n\nKING: Vice President Biden.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... when they say that they don't want to be out there defending Senator Sanders...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKING: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nVice President Biden, please.\n\nBIDEN: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.\n\nI guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBIDEN: Here's the deal. Here's the deal.\n\nLook, a guy who's a friend of mine down here named Fritz Hollings -- he passed away -- he said, you want to know what a woman will do, look what they have done. Look what they have done.\n\nYou talk about -- concerned about race. Well, my good friend on the end of this platform, he, in fact, bought a system that was a private prison system, after, after he knew that, in fact, what happened was, they hog-tied young men in prison here in this state.\n\nThey, in fact, made sure that, in Georgia, they did not have health care for the people who were being held. They, in fact, went on, and he said, after he knew that, he bought it. And then he said he was proud of his accomplishment.\n\nYou talk about what we're talking about with Bernie. Bernie, in fact, hasn't passed much of anything. The fact of the matter is...\n\nSTEYER: OK. But I get to answer.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: No, no, no.\n\nSTEYER: I get to answer that.\n\nBIDEN: The -- look -- look...\n\nSTEYER: No, that...\n\nBIDEN: ... fact is...\n\nSTEYER: You're out of time.\n\nI get to answer...\n\nBIDEN: Here's the deal.\n\nI'm not out of time. You spoke over time, and I'm going to talk.\n\nHere's the deal.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: Here's the deal.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. Look at what's happening here. We have to win the Senate back.\n\nAnd, by the way, I went into all of those races that got 41 new Democrats. The majority of them are supporting me for president and endorsing me.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: And, Mr. Vice President, I have to allow -- yes, Mr. Mayor.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Mr. Mayor, you're allowed to respond.\n\nSTEYER: I bought stock in a prison company thinking they would do a better job. And I investigated. And I sold it.\n\nBLOOMBERG: OK.\n\nBIDEN: But you knew -- you knew when you bought it they'd done that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: I get to answer this question.\n\nAnd, in fact, since then, I have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state, and we have ended it. I have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses, women ownership of businesses, and Latino owners of businesses, because this financial service industry is prejudiced.\n\nI have worked tirelessly on this. And you know I'm right. You wrote the crime bill that you called...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Where we come from, that's called Tommy come lately.\n\nBLOOMBERG: There are other people here.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: ... crime bill that put hundreds of thousands of young black and Latino men in prison.\n\nBIDEN: Not true.\n\nBLOOMBERG: OK. Let me say something.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: There's something going on here. I have worked for racial justice...\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nKING: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: ... completely. And that is an absolute unfair statement.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: All I know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Tommy come lately.\n\nKING: Mayor Bloomberg. Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we're going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart.\n\nBIDEN: Look...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: So, my argument here is that we need to get back to what's happening right now.\n\nWe have a clear choice of who's going to lead this party. And I am the only one in the New Hampshire debate, when asked, if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket, that raised my hand.\n\nI like Bernie. We came in together to the Senate. But I do not think that this is the best person to lead the ticket.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And if you want to talk about getting things done and make a comparison, according to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the U.S. Senate on 15 metrics.\n\nBernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters -- it matters if you can actually get things done.\n\nBLOOMBERG: OK. Gayle...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: It is not just who talks the best, who actually gets things done.\n\nAnd especially with the African-American community, there have been a lot of broken promises.. And I think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for these people matters. And that's why I ask for your support.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKING: Mayor Bloomberg, please.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Let's just go on the record.\n\nThey talk about 40 Democrats; 21 of those were people that I spent $100 million to help elect. All of the new Democrats that came in and put Nancy Pelosi in charge and gave the Congress the ability to control this president...\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBLOOMBERG: ... I -- I got them.\n\nNumber two, when you talk about money, let's put this in perspective. The federal budget is $4.5 trillion a year. We get $3.5 trillion in revenue. We lose $1 trillion a year.\n\nThat's why the federal budget -- deficit is -- right now, the debt is $20 trillion, going up to 21.\n\nWe just cannot afford some of this stuff people talk about. But if you...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLOOMBERG: Let me finish.\n\nIf you keep on going, we will elect Bernie. Bernie will lose to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump and the House and the Senate and some of the statehouses will all go red.\n\nAnd then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges, for the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to live with this catastrophe.\n\nO'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, thank you.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: I will allow Senator Sanders a quick response, and then Senator Warren.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you very much, Norah.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, a quick response, and then Senator Warren.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you very much.\n\nMayor Bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support. The problem is, they're all billionaires.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nSANDERS: Now, if you look -- oh.\n\nOn the other hand, of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally, Mr. Bloomberg, I beat Trump 47 of those 50 times.\n\nIf you look at battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, polling just done this Sunday...\n\nBLOOMBERG: The polls aren't the election.\n\nSANDERS: ... I beat Trump.\n\nAnd if you want to beat Trump, what you're going to need is an unprecedented...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: ... grassroots movement of black and white and Latino, Native American and Asian, people who are standing up and fighting for justice.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nSANDERS: That's what our movement is about.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Can anybody -- can anybody in this room imagine moderate Republicans going over and voting for him?\n\nSANDERS: Absolutely.\n\nBLOOMBERG: And you have to do that, or you can't win.\n\nWARREN: You know, that is...\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nSenator Warren.\n\nWARREN: That is the problem.\n\nAnd that is that a progressive agenda is popular, Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nAnd, for everyone on this stage, we talk about how to build a future. That's what matters.\n\nI talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care. It's why I also have a way to pay for health care that doesn't raise taxes on middle-class families.\n\nBut it's so much more than that. As Democrats, we need to speak to the future we can build together. We need to speak of the prosperity we can build together.\n\nHow about a wealth tax in America? Because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one-tenth of 1 percent, we have a chance to invest in universal child care for every one of our babies, to really level the playing field.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nWARREN: Put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: And start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: We need to talk about our aspirations, our hopes.\n\nThis is a moment...\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator...\n\nWARREN: ... to choose hope over fear.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator, thank you.\n\nWARREN: This is our moment.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator, thank you.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: We have to take a quick break.\n\nWhen we come back, the Democratic presidential debate continues right after this, only on CBS.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: I'm Gayle King with Norah O'Donnell. Joining us now on the question here in Charleston, South Carolina are CBS News colleagues, the A team, Bill Whitaker of 60 MINUTES, chief Washington correspondent, that's Major Garrett, and Margaret Brennan, moderator of FACE THE NATION.\n\nWe're going to begin with you, Vice President Biden, for this part. Just across the street, as you mentioned at the top of the debate, is the theater (sic) where nine people were shot and killed inside the Mother Emanuel Church. We all remember that day back in 2015.\n\nAnd every day in our country, over 100 people die from gun violence. You all have plans, I know, on this stage, to address the gun crisis. But Congress has not been able to pass a major gun legislation in a quarter of a century. And just think about this, in those 25 years we've had Columbine, Newtown, Parkland, Las Vegas. We could go on and on.\n\nVice President Biden, I want to start with you, why should anyone have faith that you're the one who can get this done now?\n\nBIDEN: Because I'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. I beat the NRA twice. I got assault weapons banned. I got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. I got them eliminated. Except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in Florida and it was not reauthorized.\n\nIn addition to, that I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers, absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. We would give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.\n\nCarnage on our streets. And I want to tell you, if I'm elected, NRA, I'm coming for you, and gun manufacturers, I'm going to take you on and I'm going to beat you. I'm the only one who has done it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That's why we have got to change what Washington can deliver.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: So this is about being able to dig in and talk about what really it's going to take to get something done. I've been in the Senate. What I've seen is gun safety legislation introduced, get a majority, and then doesn't pass because of the filibuster. Understand this, the filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry.\n\nIt gives a veto to the oil industry. It's going to give a veto on immigration. Until we're willing to dig in and say that if Mitch McConnell is going to do to the next Democratic president what he did to President Obama, and that is try to block every single thing he does, that we are willing to roll back the filibuster, go with the majority vote, and do what needs to be done for the American people.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKING: We're going to stay on this top and allow Senator...\n\nBIDEN: ... and I can beat Mitch McConnell.\n\nWARREN: Understand this, many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster. Until we're ready to do that, we can't have real change.\n\nO'DONNELL: I want to allow Senator Sanders to respond because you've gone after the insurance industry. You've taken on pharmaceutical companies. And you've taken on big tech. Why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass?\n\nSANDERS: Well, you know, Joe has voted for terrible trade agreements.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nSANDERS: No, no, no, no, no. Joe voted for the war in Iraq. My point was, not to be -- I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes. That was a bad vote. I have today a D-minus voting record from the NRA. Thirty years ago, I likely lost a race for the one seat for Congress in Vermont because 30 years ago, I opposed -- I supported a ban on assault weapons. Thirty years ago.\n\nRight now, my view is we need to expand background checks, end the gun show loophole, and do what the American people want, not what the NRA wants.\n\nBIDEN: OK, but wait a second...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago.\n\nBLOOMBERG: I think she recognized me, thank you. I have a 6 million-person organization around this country. Moms Demand Action and Everytown.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLOOMBERG: We have put background checks -- we have got background checks in 20 states. So you can do it. It's Congress that can't seem to do it. And I don't know why we think they're going to do it. The vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the NRA. And certainly Senator Sanders has supported the NRA.\n\nBut we can do this. We have just got to stop talking about it.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: But the way we do it -- the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes. So I have long supported the assault weapon ban. I am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an AK-47.\n\nBIDEN: I wrote that law.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: That bill, along with -- you didn't write that bill. I wrote that bill.\n\nBIDEN: I wrote the bill, the Violence Against Women Act...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. You did you that.\n\nBIDEN: ... that took out of the hands of people who abused their...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. We'll have a fact check look at this.\n\nBIDEN: Let's look at the fact check...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Oh my goodness.\n\nBIDEN: The only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. I couldn't get that covered. You, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and Mitch McConnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the Violence Against Women Act across the board.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. So, if I could finish. I have the bill. Anyone can check it out, to close the boyfriend loophole. Also to close the Charleston loophole is another bill that is out there. Universal background checks.\n\nBut let me say how we win this. We have got to win in the middle of the country. And while everyone talks about winning rural areas, suburban areas, I'm the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly, while being for the assault weapon ban, won in Republican congressional districts over and over again, including Michele Bachmann's district.\n\nSo having someone that can lead the ticket, that can bring people with her, is the way you get gun safety legislation. I look at these proposals and say, do they hit my uncle Dick in the deer stand? They do not. So coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, thank you.\n\nWe want to allow many people to get in on this topic. Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country. But I want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took, this is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd we're in South Carolina. How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change? We are in this state...\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We are in the state where Strom Thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly. No less a Senate traditional figure than Harry Reid has called for it to go. It has got to go, because otherwise Washington will not deliver. I was in high school when the Columbine shooting happened. And I remember everybody in Washington saying, never again, we'll never let this happen again.\n\nAnd then a second school shooting generation has now been produced. Shame on us if we allow there to be a third. And also...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... in terms of making the case, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate, from the perspective of the a veteran, why the kinds of weaponry, anything remotely like what I trained on in order to go serve in a war zone has no business being sold anywhere near an American school or church or neighbor.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, Senator Sanders, please.\n\nSANDERS: Thirty years ago, I supported a ban on assault weapons. Mike Bloomberg has started a very good organization, Moms Demand Actions. Congratulations.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Thank you.\n\nSANDERS: They have credited me with gun sense, as you know.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Yes, we did.\n\nSANDERS: Furthermore, furthermore, it is my view, the time is now, and Joe made this point, look, at the end of the day we need to rally the American people. Here is the good news. Because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings, the American people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety, not be dictated to by the NRA.\n\nAnd I am proud that I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. If elected president, it will get worse than that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, Mr. Steyer, please? Mr. Steyer?\n\nSTEYER: Look, it isn't a question of the American people deciding that we have too much gun violence. Everyone in America knows we have too much gun violence. The problem we have is that corporations have bought Washington, D.C.\n\nThe gun manufacturers own the Senate of the United States. So even though more than 90 percent of Americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase, we can't get it through the Senate.\n\nSo the question you have to ask yourself is, how do we change the Senate of the United States in a material way? And there are two things. That's why I am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator, to change who's in charge, to get rid of Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut I am also -- Senator Sanders is right. We need to win a huge victory across the board.\n\nKING: All right, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: Democrats need to go to the grassroots. I built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the United States.\n\nKING: Your time's up, sir.\n\nSTEYER: The way to win at the grassroots is, tell the truth and organize.\n\nKING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?\n\nSTEYER: That's what it's going to take in 2020.\n\nKING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?\n\nWHITAKER: Let's talk about education. South Carolina's schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment. Black students here consistently score worse than white students. Mayor Bloomberg, a key element of your response to failing schools in New York City was a dramatic increase in public charter schools. As president, would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I'm not sure they're appropriate every place. I can only tell you, in New York, they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them. We had -- the charter schools are mixed in with the non-charter public schools, because our charter schools are public schools, as well. They've helped each other.\n\nI saw a statistic the other day, when I came into office, zero New York City schools were in the top 25 of the state. When I left, 23 out of 25 were from New York City. We've cut the gap between the rich and the poor. We've made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have.\n\nI raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. I put an extra $5 billion into our school system. I value education. It is the only way to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education. And rather than just talk about it in New York, we actually did it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWHITAKER: Senator Warren?\n\nWARREN: So this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself. And I'm going to start with my secretary of education. My secretary of education will be someone who has taught in public school.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy secretary of education will be someone who believes in public education. And my secretary of education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOne more thing. My secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high-stakes testing. We need to support our children. But, look, we want to build a future in this country? We build a future by investing in our children. I've got a plan to put $800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.\n\nWARREN: Education is not free. We must invest in the future of our children.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWHITAKER: Senator Sanders?\n\nSANDERS: This campaign, our campaign, our campaign is about changing American priorities. Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we're going to have high-quality, universal childcare for every family in this country.\n\nBecause the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development. We are going to triple funding for low-income Title I schools, because kids' education should not depend upon the ZIP Code in which they live. We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on Wall Street speculation. And we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in America earns less than $60,000 a year.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nSANDERS: We want great teachers.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Can I...\n\nWHITAKER: Mayor Buttigieg?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Look, the best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators. I'm a little biased, because I'm married to one. And I get an education about education every day I come home.\n\nI have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms. Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids.\n\nAnd now some politicians, because they aren't willing to face the need for commonsense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom.\n\nWe have to show not only with compensation, but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids. And, yes, that means a secretary of education who will support teachers. It also means investing.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm proposing an education access...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: One way we -- one way we can support our teachers is to cancel student loan debt.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWHITAKER: We're going to pass this on to Major.\n\nGARRETT: Candidates, good evening. Candidates, good evening.\n\nWARREN: People across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. This is an issue we need to talk about.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: And that's what my plan would do, through the education...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGARRETT: As we all know, as we all know, the political conversation in our country is interactive, and because of our partner, Twitter, this debate is no different. So I want to put a question from Twitter to you, Senator Klobuchar. This is from Casey Pennington. How will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you. This is one of the first times we've talked about housing. And I put forward an extensive policy.\n\nI think -- when I've looked at this both in my job in local government and in the Senate, one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live.\n\nSo the way you do that is, first of all, taking care of the Section 8 backlog of applicants. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting. And I have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing.\n\nSecondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it.\n\nAnd I want to make clear, given South Carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. It's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing.\n\nSo for me, it's building a coalition. And I actually like to get these things done and to -- the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done.\n\nWARREN: This is a point...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGARRETT: Senator Warren, hold on one second, because I want to -- I want to...\n\nWARREN: This is a point where we need to talk about race, though.\n\nGARRETT: I understand.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: It is not enough to talk about housing neutrally...\n\nBIDEN: Can we just speak up when we want to? Is that the idea?\n\nWARREN: ... and just be race-blind. It is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against African-Americans having an opportunity to buy homes.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat's red-lining.\n\nGARRETT: Mayor...\n\nWARREN: And while Mayor Bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on African-Americans and on Latinos, in fact, I was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages. We have a -- I have a housing plan, and what it has in it specifically...\n\nGARRETT: Senator Warren, thank you.\n\nWARREN: ... is a piece...\n\nGARRETT: Senator Warren, thank you.\n\nWARREN: ... to deal with the effects of red-lining. We can no longer pretend that everything is race-neutral. We have got to address race consciously, what's happening in this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGARRETT: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. I want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what Senator Warren just said on Twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Yes, she's -- I'm sorry, but, unfortunately, she's misinformed on red-lighting. You can go back and look at the record. I fought against it before '08, the crisis, during '08, and after that. Red-lining is not the problem with the mortgage market, but it was a problem for the communities where it was done, and we stopped that.\n\nLet me also say, because just -- since I have the floor for a second, that I really am surprised that all of these -- my fellow contestants up here, I guess, would be the right word for it...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... given nobody pays attention to the clock -- I'm surprised they show up, because I would have thought after I did such a good job in beating them last week, that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that.\n\n(AUDIENCE BOOS)\n\nBut let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in New York City. And I listened to them. They're in Congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. But if you change something like the president, they would. No, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done.\n\nI did it in New York City. I got the Republican State Senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country. You can work across the aisle. You just have to know how to deal with people.\n\nGARRETT: Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much. Back to you, Bill.\n\nWHITAKER: Vice President Biden, black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men, are about twice as likely to be unemployed, five times more likely to be incarcerated, conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both Democratic and Republican administrations. How do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities?\n\nBIDEN: Two ways. Number one, my entire life I've been involved with the black community. I was a public defender.\n\nI worked in the projects, I came along, and the first thing I did as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, extended the Voting Rights Act eventually for 25 years. And I have been deeply involved. And my first effort I had as a councilman was doing away with red-lining in the county.\n\nThe way we do this, we've got to help them create wealth, and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs, are as successful as any other group of people in the country. We go from 1.5 billion to $3 billion, taking $30 billion off the sidelines. That's how you create wealth.\n\nSecondly, I provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $15,000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. Thirdly, I go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. They're being bought out. You cannot find a place to live.\n\nAnd thirdly, I make sure that with regard to housing, we allow people -- look, right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white, the same exact house. We've got to deal with the institutional racism.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\nBIDEN: I note how you cut me off all the time but I'm not going to be quiet anymore, OK?\n\nWHITAKER: Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: Every single policy area in the United States has a gigantic subtext of race. We're talking about education. We're talking about criminal justice. We're talking about housing. We're talking about loans. I started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry. Basically, to make loans to black-owned, Latino-owned, and women-owned businesses. We've supported over 8,000 affordable housing units.\n\nBut more than that, I believe I'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTEYER: Something happened. We should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400-plus years in America of African-Americans, of systematic legal injustice, discrimination, and cruelty, but also of 400-plus years of contribution in terms of building the United States of America and leading the United States of America from a moral standpoint.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, next question, new topic, new topic. Senator Klobuchar...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... for this whole campaign, I don't know where you got the impression...\n\nBRENNAN: If you could honor the rules of the debate, thank you.\n\nSenator Klobuchar, I'd like to change topics and ask you, rural areas have populations who are older, sicker, and poorer than non-rural communities. And they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. Expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to. So how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: People aren't always aware, I know you are in South Carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. So the answer is one size doesn't fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. And actually, I am leading -- the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered.\n\nThe other issue is we don't have enough personnel. And so that's where we get to this education plan.. And I don't want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard-earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. What I think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy.\n\nWe're going to have a million openings for home health care workers, particularly in rural areas, that we don't know how to fill. We're going to have over 100,000 openings for nursing assistants. We're not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees. We're going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses.\n\nSo putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one- and two-year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas.\n\nFinal thing is comprehensive immigration reform. I have passed...\n\nBRENNAN: Senator, time.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. We need to expand that.\n\nBRENNAN: Mayor Buttigieg, the floor is yours, would you like -- same question.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Yes, so, when I was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city. Now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation, and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like South Carolina. We're seeing hospital closures right and left. And we're seeing them, in particular, in states where Medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression.\n\nSee, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. And that harms everyone.\n\nBRENNAN: You're out of time, sir.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: It's why in my Frederick Douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues, part of the core of it is a 21st Century Voting Rights Act.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: Yes, I'm very proud working with Congressman Jim Clyburn, South Carolina, that we increased funding for the Community Health Center Program by $11 billion as part of the Affordable Care Act, which now provides for 9 million Americans access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs, in that bill.\n\nWe also put $2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors, nurses, dentists, we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country, to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas.\n\nThe advantage of a Medicare for All health care program, because it's not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies, we will have health care for all people in all parts of this country.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: But in order for any of that to happen it has to pass. And we're talking about a plan that...\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you. Next topic. Gayle?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... even goes beyond even what they do...\n\nKING: I'm sorry, we're going to go to Mayor Bloomberg. We're going to change topics.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, as mayor of New York, you declared war on obesity, you banned trans-fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks. So if you become president, will you push those policies on the national level as well?\n\nBLOOMBERG: Well, I think what's right for New York City isn't necessarily right for all the other cities, otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city. So let's get serious here.\n\nBut I do think it's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. The -- we are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that. But just a look what happened with smoking.\n\nWe did ban smoking in New York City in public places, restaurants, offices, and that sort of thing. And it has spread across America, across Europe, across Latin America, even into places in the Middle East and into the Far East. It has saved an enormous number of lives.\n\nSo it just goes to show, if you have good public health, then you can do things. And one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. So there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLOOMBERG: And he has defunded -- he had defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing. As you see, the stock market is falling apart because people are really worried and they should be.\n\nKING: We're going to talk about that.\n\nBLOOMBERG: We don't have anybody to respond. I'm sorry.\n\nKING: We're going to talk about that in our next segment. Before I leave you, are New Yorkers living longer because of your policies?\n\nBLOOMBERG: There's no question about that.\n\nKING: All right.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Before I left, life expectancy in New York City had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that, when I left, it was three years greater than the national average.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right. Vice President Biden, please. Vice President Biden.\n\nBIDEN: Look, one of the things we have to do, we have a thing in the Defense Department called DARPA, a special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal to make us safer. They came up with the internet, I mean, they came up with the internet, they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology.\n\nI'm going to do the same thing at the National Institute of Health. We're going to focus at least $50 billion over the first five years on -- focusing on obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cancer. And we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment.\n\nWe can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. The American people support it. Even Republicans will support it. We have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, Senator (sic) Biden, thank you.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: ... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. As a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, I want to do that, too. And I also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. I think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs.\n\nI think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. And it's not necessarily because of marijuana. It is because of things like opioids and the like. And that's why one of the first plans I put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs.\n\nAnd the way you do that is with drug courts. The way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the White House so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the Justice Department, and while getting their advice.\n\nKING: All right, thank you, Senator Klobuchar.\n\nSANDERS: Norah, can I respond?\n\nKING: Mayor Bloomberg...\n\nBIDEN: Can I respond to that, as well?\n\nSANDERS: Can I respond? I was mentioned...\n\nKING: I'd like to get your thoughts on this, because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that we've never done research on.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Look, the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNumber two, we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it.\n\nBut, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. They say go very slowly. They haven't done enough research. And the evidence so far is worrisome, before we get all our kids, particularly kids in their late teens, boys even more than girls, where this may be damaging their brains.\n\nUntil we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. But the cat's out of the bag. So some states have it, you're not going to take it away. Get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession.\n\nKING: All right, thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you were name checked.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you. All right, look, you're right. We have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken, it is racist, got more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China. And one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs.\n\nSo I do believe that, on day one, we will change the Federal Controlled Substance Act, which, if you can believe it, now equates heroin with marijuana. That's insane. We're going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country.\n\nWhat we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people who were arrested for possession of marijuana.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I'll tell you what else we're going to do. We're going to provide help to the African-American, Latino, Native American community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana, rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market.\n\nKING: All right, Senator Sanders, thank you...\n\nBIDEN: I wrote the drug court bill.\n\nKING: We passed the halfway mark.\n\nBIDEN: Can I respond to this? I wrote the -- I wrote the bill that set up drug courts.\n\nKING: All right. Thank you, Vice President Biden. We will get back to you.\n\nThe CBS News Democratic presidential debate will continue right after the break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Welcome back, the CBS News Democratic debate. Each of you is campaigning for the role as commander-in-chief, where you will command 1.3 million U.S. troops and be responsible for protecting America's national security. There are also 53,000 here in South Carolina.\n\nYou said, Senator Warren, you said you wanted to bring home all troops from the Middle East and then you walked that back to say you want to bring home combat troops.\n\nWARREN: I do.\n\nO'DONNELL: How does that protect America's national security?\n\nWARREN: Look, a president's job, first job, is to keep America safe, and an important part of that is to have a strong military. All three of my brothers served in the military, and I understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line.\n\nThat means that we have a sacred responsibility to them, and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We are not winning in Afghanistan. We are not winning in the Middle East.\n\nWhat we need to do is we need to use all of the tools in our toolbox. We need a strong military. We also need a strong State Department. Those are our eyes and ears on the ground. They are our frontlines in diplomacy.\n\nWe need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy, and we need strong alliances. We need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm. And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators. We need not to cut and run on our allies.\n\nAnd we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators.\n\nWe need not to cut and run on our allies. We need an approach that keeps us safe by using all of the tools in a measured way.\n\nO'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views. Would you pull all combat troops out of the Middle East?\n\nBLOOMBERG: No. You want to cut it back as much as you can, but I think, if we learned something from 9/11, people plan things overseas and execute them here. We have to be able to stop terrorism. And there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible.\n\nWe shouldn't be fighting wars that we can't win. We should go to war only as a last resort. Nobody argues with that.\n\nBut this is a dangerous world. And if we haven't learnt that after 9/11, I don't know what's going to teach us what to. This -- we have to do something, and I think the budget that we -- the things that I've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time, and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last, a common mistake that they're not making now.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nBLOOMBERG: They're doing a good job.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nGayle?\n\nKING: Mayor Buttigieg, I'd like to go to you as the only veteran on stage. Can you weigh in on this?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, the first time I ever set foot in South Carolina, it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near Fort Jackson. And that was to get ready to go to Afghanistan, where I saw that one of the things that kept me safe, just as sure as my body armor, was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word. Our allies and our adversaries knew it.\n\nThe president has torn that to shreds. And so the first thing we've got to do is restore the credibility of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe second thing we've got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities -- and I guess I disagree with the mayor; I don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather, because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world. But we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground.\n\nBut what good is that if you have a president who won't listen to them?\n\nRight now, some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counter-terrorism but issues like global health security and the Coronavirus, that rely on the ability to listen to scientists...\n\nKING: Time, Mr. Mayor.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall.\n\nKING: I know it goes fast...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... but a minute-fifteen is really a long time.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo we'd ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time.\n\nBIDEN: Good idea.\n\nKING: Senator Klobuchar -- good idea, right, Mr. Vice President?\n\nSenator Klobuchar, today -- as we were coming over here today...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI promise, Mr. Vice President, we are going to get to you today. I promise.\n\nBIDEN: You keep promising me that, but you haven't done it yet.\n\nKING: I've never broken a promise.\n\nBIDEN: Well, let's get to it.\n\nKING: Senator Klobuchar...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Why don't you let me answer, OK?\n\nKING: There was breaking news from the CDC about the Coronavirus. And so far there have been 2,700 deaths globally, and so far in this country there have been no deaths. But the CDC says this. It's not a matter of if the virus will spread here but when.\n\nThe question to you is this, would you close the borders to Americans who have been exposed to the Coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those Americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. We don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help.\n\nAnd I would agree, when Mayor Bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget -- he tried to cut back on the CDC; he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world; he hasn't yet really addressed the nation on this topic, I would do all of that.\n\nBut I want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the American people because this is so serious. I'm not going to give my website right now. I'm going to give the CDC's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. Because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here.\n\nAnd I think the answers, as president, what would I do, I would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one.\n\nKING: Thank you, Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I would have better relations with our allies and I would support, because I know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school, in Columbia, South Carolina, or Houston, Texas, and it's investing in education, so we are ready to lead, again, in the world.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator, thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMr. Vice President, we reached a turning point today with the CDC, warning schools that they must prepare that they might have to close, members of the Trump administration saying we don't have enough medical masks if necessary.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nBIDEN: What we did with Ebola -- I was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the United States, saved millions of lives. And what we did, we set up, I helped set up that office in the presidency, in the president's office, on -- on diseases that are pandemic diseases.\n\nWe increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. We should -- and our president today -- and he's wiped all that out. We did it. We stopped it.\n\nAnd the second thing I'd point out to you is that what I would do immediately is restore the funding. He cut the funding for CDC. He tried to cut the funding for NIH. He cut the funding for the entire effort.\n\nAnd here's the deal. I would be on the phone with China and making it clear, we are going to need to be in your country; you have to be open; you have to be clear; we have to know what's going on; we have to be there with you, and insist on it and insist, insist, insist.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nBIDEN: I could get that done. No one up here has ever dealt internationally with any of these world leaders. I'm the only one that has.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: In the White House today -- in the White House today, we have a self-described great genius -- self-described -- and this great genius has told us that this Coronavirus is going to end in two months. April is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined -- I wish I was kidding; that is what he said.\n\nWhat do we have to do? Whether or not the issue is climate change, which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation, or infectious diseases like Coronavirus, requiring international cooperation, we have to work and expand the World Health Organization. Obviously, we have to make sure the CDC, the NIH, our infectious departments, are fully funded.\n\nThis is a global problem.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nSANDERS: We've got to work with countries all the over the world to solve it.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator, we're going to stay on the topic of foreign affairs. Margaret Brennan?\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you, Norah.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, you've said that President Xi Jinping of China is not a dictator and that he is responsive to his constituents, and that the U.S. must cooperate with Beijing.\n\nHow far does that go? Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure?\n\nBLOOMBERG: No, I would not. And I think the Chinese government has not been open. Their press -- the freedom of press does not exist there. They -- their human rights record is abominable, and we should make a fuss, which we have been doing, I suppose.\n\nBut we -- make no mistake about it, we have to deal with China, if we're ever going to solve the climate crisis. We have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked. We would be -- not be able to sell or buy the products that we need.\n\nAnd, in terms of whether he's a dictator, he does serve at the behest of the Politboro, of their group of people, but there's no question he has an enormous amount of power. And he -- but he does play to his constituency. You can negotiate with him. That's exactly what we have to do, make it seem that it's in his interest and in his people's interest to do what we want to do, follow the rules, particularly no stealing of intellectual property; follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions.\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n\nVice President Biden?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nVice President Biden, same question to you. Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure?\n\nBIDEN: No, I would not. And I spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office. This is a guy who is -- doesn't have a democratic, with a small D, bone in his body.\n\nThis is a guy who is a thug, who in fact has a million Uighurs in reconstruction camps, meaning concentration camps. This is a guy who you see what's happening right now in -- in Hong Kong, and this is a guy who I was able to convince should join the international agreement at the Paris agreement because, guess what, they need to be involved.\n\nYou can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are, when in fact they said We're going to set up a no-fly zone, that you can't fly through our zone.\n\nHe said, What do you expect me to do, when I was over there.\n\nI said, We're going to fly right through it. We flew B-1 bombers through it. We've got to make it clear. They must play by the rules...\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\nBIDEN: ... period, period, period.\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Warren, same question. Would you allow Chinese firms to build infrastructure?\n\nWARREN: We -- we have to be able to trust our president, because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can't follow every part of that. And that's one of the reasons that we need to see any candidate's taxes.\n\nWe know that Mayor Bloomberg has been doing business with China for a long time, and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes.\n\nHe plans to release them after Super Tuesday. It is not enough to be able to say, just trust me on this. We have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this.\n\nBRENNAN: Was that a yes or no?\n\nWARREN: No, I would not.\n\nBRENNAN: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago, we have been working on our tax returns, I've said they will be out. We probably have another couple of weeks left to go. We're doing it as fast we can. We've complied with every single requirement for disclosure. And when I was mayor of New York, we had our tax returns out twelve years in a row and we will do that in the White House.\n\nWARREN: No, actually...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: My tax return is online light now.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: I released my tax returns.\n\nWARREN: Yes.\n\nSTEYER: That was easy to do. But I want to say something about foreign policy...\n\nBIDEN: How many years?\n\nSTEYER: Ten years.\n\nI want to say something about foreign policy, which is this, we keep acting as if we're in the 20th Century or the 19th Century. If you look at the biggest threats to the United States, we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the United States. We're talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need U.S. leadership for countries around the world.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Trump's policy of us going it alone, of America first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. The biggest threat to America right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. And it's time for us to deal with it that way. Every single foreign policy issue is about American leadership and coalition.\n\nBRENNAN: New topic. Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: Can I say one word on...\n\nBRENNAN: You praised -- it's in the same theme, sir. You've praised the Chinese Communist Party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country. You also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass?\n\nSANDERS: I have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg just said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have got a real dictatorship there. Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba.\n\nWhat I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. Yes, I think...\n\n(BOOING)\n\nSANDERS: Really? Really? Literacy programs are bad?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Yes, because there's no comparing those two commentaries (ph).\n\nSANDERS: What Barack Obama said is they made great progress on education and health care. That was Barack Obama. Occasionally...\n\nBIDEN: I talked to Barack Obama...\n\nSANDERS: Excuse me, occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran. And when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans do something good, you acknowledge that. But you don't have to trade love letters with them.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: Mr. Vice President.\n\nBIDEN: Barack Obama was abroad, he was in a town meeting, he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the Cuban government. He acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy. But he went on and condemned the dictatorship. He went on and condemned the people who, in fact, had run that committee.\n\nHe also made sure to make it clear -- and by the way, I called to make sure that I was prepared to -- I never say (INAUDIBLE) my private conversations with him, but the fact of the matter is he, in fact, does not, did not, has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: This man said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did.\n\nSANDERS: That is untrue, categorically untrue.\n\nBIDEN: What did you tell them?\n\nSANDERS: I have condemned authoritarianism, whether it is the people in Saudi Arabia that the United States government...\n\nBIDEN: How about Cuba or Nicaragua?\n\nSANDERS: ... has loved for years. Cuba, Nicaragua, authoritarianism of any stripe is bad.\n\nBIDEN: Period.\n\nSANDERS: But that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good. That's what Barack Obama said.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Margaret, Margaret, could I...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: The only way we're going to restore...\n\nBRENNAN: Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... American credibility, the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency. And I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump, with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s, and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. This is about 2020. We are not going to survive or succeed, and we're certainly not going to win by reliving the Cold War. And we're not going to win these critical, critical House and Senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the Democratic Party is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime. We've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Sanders, your response.\n\nSANDERS: Let us be clear, do we think health care for all, Pete, is some kind of radical communist idea?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, you brought this up, let's talk about that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: Do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm happy to respond to the question because this is really important...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: ... do we think building the millions of units of affordable housing that we need...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: If you're going to ask that rhetorical question, let's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: ... do we think raising taxes on billionaires is a radical idea?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about this. Let's talk about what's radical about that plan.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: Do you think criminal justice reform is a radical idea?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: The things you just named are things...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: Do you think immigration reform? The truth is, Pete...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: One at a time.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: ... the American people support my agenda.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: The way you're talking about doing it is radical by...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: That is why I am beating Trump in virtually every poll that is done, and why I will defeat him.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We've got to open this up. Universal health care, for example...\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Donald Trump's worst nightmare is having someone that the people in the middle who are tired of the insults and the extremes in our politics have someone to vote for. And I was going to comment on Cuba policy because I actually lead the bill to lift the embargo. I went with Barack Obama when he went to Cuba. And I've seen firsthand how the Cuban are way in front of our -- their leaders.\n\nThey like America. They want to be entrepreneurs. And the way that we embrace them, and not the socialist regime, is by opening up Cuba and starting to do business with them.\n\nBut to get at what we were just talking about, I just think we have a huge choice. Super Tuesday states, one-third of America will vote. Do you want to have someone...\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you, Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... in charge of this ticket -- could I finish, Margaret?\n\nBRENNAN: Well, you're out of time. Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: You want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward $60 trillion in spending, three times the American economy.\n\nBRENNAN: Bill Whitaker?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I don't think we do. I think that we can get all those bold progressive things done without having someone that is so alienating that we're going to turn off the voters that we need to bring with us.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: You have to allow the senator to respond. Senator Sanders.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I want to respond to the question that Senator Sanders...\n\nSANDERS: Can I respond? Amy used the word alienating. Hey, Amy, my favorability nationally I believe are the highest up here, as a matter of fact.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: All right. But the point is -- the point is the way we are going to beat Trump, which is what everybody up here wants, is we need a campaign of energy and excitement. We need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. We need to bring working people back in to the Democratic Party. We need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before. That is what our campaign is about.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBRENNAN: Bill Whitaker has the floor.\n\nWHITAKER: Vice President Biden.\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nWHITAKER: The bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report concluded Russia interfered in our last presidential election, and the Obama administration failed to respond forcefully. U.S. intelligence says Russia is at it again. If it is proven that Russia has interfered in the 2020 elections, would you, as president, launch a retaliatory cyber attack?\n\nBIDEN: I would make them pay for it, and I would make them pay for it economically. They are engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our elections. They were engaged, and when we -- when, in fact, we were -- the last election in 2016 against Hillary, they were. There's no question.\n\nThis man stood before the whole world, turned to the Russian leader and said, why in God's name would this man ever interfere in our elections? Give me a break. Seventeen intelligence agencies said he did. When we got the information, we went to the committee in the Senate that's responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them.\n\nWe went to Mitch McConnell and said join us and point out what is happening here. He said, no, we want no part of it. And if we had moved -- we didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over. And, so, the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more, theoretically that's true, but the fact of the matter is we didn't have the information until the end. And so, look, we, in fact, should be imposing sanctions on Russia now for their interference.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWHITAKER: Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: Look, 21st Century warfare is cyber warfare. What we're having is an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now. The question you have to ask is, where is the commander-in-chief? And let me say this...\n\nBIDEN: We don't have one.\n\nSTEYER: ... this isn't news, what Vice President Biden said is true, he did stand next to Vladimir Putin. There was a hostile, foreign attack on our election last time and the president sided with the hostile foreign power. That's why I started Need to Impeach.\n\nThat's what we have to do. We have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power that commits cyber warfare against the United States of America. That's where we are. Where are all these patriotic Republicans who wave the flag, but when we're actually under attack, they side with our enemies? It's outrageous.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat's why he should have been impeached. They covered it up. And I was years before these people. There's something wrong here. We're under attack, and they're not doing a darn thing about it.\n\nGARRETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Look, the way to deter a cyber attack...\n\nGARRETT: Senator Sanders -- no, Senator Sanders, I have a question for you, sir. You're the frontrunner in this race. You're on the ballot in South Carolina. Mayor Bloomberg, you'll understand that preamble in just a second.\n\nIf elected, Senator Sanders, you would be America's first Jewish president. You recently called a very prominent, well-known American Israel lobby a platform for, quote, bigotry. What would you say to American Jews who might be concerned you're not, from their perspective, supportive enough of Israel? And specifically, sir, would you move the U.S. embassy back to Tel Aviv?\n\nSANDERS: Let me just -- the answer is, it's something that we would take into consideration.\n\nGARRETT: Which would...\n\nSANDERS: But here -- excuse me. But here is the point. I am very proud of being Jewish. I actually lived in Israel for some months. But what I happen to believe is that,
DENVER -- Christopher Watts, who is charged with killing his family and dumping their bodies at an oil worksite, taped a video presentation six years ago about saving or abandoning relationships. A YouTube video posted in April 2012 shows Watts giving a PowerPoint presentation that he titled, Communication Speech, Relationship Deterioration and Repair.\n\nHe opened the presentation by saying it is for a course he was taking. He then speaks of infidelity — possibly with someone at work — as a reason that relationships fail.\n\nPolice in suburban Denver say Watts was having an affair with a co-worker before he was arrested last week in the slayings of his wife, Shanann Watts, and their two young daughters, Bella, 3, and Celeste, 4. He has not entered a plea to murder and other felony charges.\n\nAccording to court documents, Watts told police in Frederick, a Colorado community in the oil and gas fields north of Denver, that he told his wife on August 13 that he wanted to separate. A police investigation determined that Watts was actively involved in an affair with a co-worker, the documents state.\n\nWatts worked at Anadarko Petroleum and was fired on August 15, the day he was arrested. He told investigators that he killed his wife but claimed that she had strangled their two daughters after he told her he wanted to separate.\n\nIn the 2012 video posted online about six months before the couple wed, Watts said he was in suburban Broomfield, where the Watts family once lived.\n\nSometimes you find your partner no longer attractive physically or in their personality, he said in the presentation. When you are in a relationship you have to show desire, lust toward your partner. Sometimes when you get married that the lust and the desire kind of fall by the wayside a little bit.\n\nAt another point, Watts said: Even at the job, you might meet a new person and (it) could strengthen into something else and could weaken the bond you have with the partner you have.\n\nAnd you feel that you might be better with someone else that you've met, he declared. You think that you can no longer do — that your partner is someone that you can't be with.\n\nKrista Henery, a spokeswoman for the Weld County district attorney's office, declined comment about the video Wednesday. Watts' public defender, James Merson, did not immediately return a phone message.\n\nWatts in the video cites various experts in recommending steps to strengthen and salvage relationships, including listening attentively, thinking before speaking, and openly expressing support and affection.\n\nSometimes when you have children and your relationship starts to deteriorate a child could help repair it, he said.\n\nHe also listed three questions to ask when a relationship is in jeopardy:\n\nDo I have the desire to keep this relationship going? Do I have a moral obligation to stay in this relationship? Or is it a necessity for me to stay in this relationship?\n\nAs Watts ended the presentation, he received a round of applause from two women and two men seated on a sofa across the room. One of the women said, Good job.\n\nShanann Watts is not seen in the video. Under a last name she had from an earlier marriage, Shanann King posted a comment to the video that said: Great job Christopher! Good information!\n\nNorth Carolina court records show she divorced around 2009, several years before she and Christopher Watts married.\n\nWatts was charged this week with first-degree murder and other felony counts. Shanann's body was discovered in a shallow grave about 40 miles from the family's Frederick home, and the two girls' bodies were recovered from nearby oil tanks, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christopher Watts appeared in court for an arraignment. Shanann Watts' father, Frank Rzucek Sr., cried and shook visibly as District Judge Marcelo Kopcow read the formal charges.\n\nShanann's brother, Frank Rzucek Jr., rubbed his father's shoulders and glared unflinchingly at his brother-in-law. A bailiff stood between them.\n\nWatts, handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, didn't show emotion. He said Yes, sir, when the judge asked if he understood the murder and other felony charges against him and the penalties they carry, including the death penalty. Prosecutors have not yet decided whether to seek death.\n\nWatts waived his right to have a preliminary hearing within 35 days. A judge set a status hearing for November 19.
After reportedly being interrupted several times during a campaign stop in Texas, presidential contender Pete Buttigieg got some support from one of his 2020 challengers: Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas Congressman tweeted in support of Buttigieg Friday night after the South Bend, Indiana, mayor was interrupted by protesters during a speech at the Dallas County Democratic Party dinner.\n\nAccording to CNN reporter DJ Judd, one demonstrator yelled, Repent! and another said, Marriage is between a man and a woman!\n\nTexans don't stand for this kind of homophobia and hatred, O'Rourke wrote Friday, tweeting a video of a demonstrator shouting during Buttigieg's event.\n\nMayor Pete, we are grateful you came to Texas and hope to see you and Chasten back again soon, O'Rourke added.\n\nTexans don't stand for this kind of homophobia and hatred. Mayor Pete, we are grateful you came to Texas and hope to see you and Chasten back again soon. https://t.co/IhRDtIBREb — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) May 4, 2019\n\nThe message was retweeted more than 4,000 times and had over 30,000 likes by Saturday morning, with many followers calling O'Rourke classy for reaching out to his competition in a moment of sincerity on the campaign trail.\n\nProtests have become somewhat of a common occurrence at Buttigieg's campaign stops. During a two-day swing through Iowa last month, Buttigieg was interrupted by protesters at two events with Iowa Democrats, with demonstrators questioning the openly-gay mayor's Episcopalian faith.\n\nButtigieg, meanwhile, has not been shy about addressing his sexuality or his devout faith on the campaign trail. The mayor has called marriage equality a moral issue, and said his marriage of two years to his husband Chasten has made him a better human being and moved him closer to God.
South Bend, Indiana Mayor and presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg opens up about his thoughts on the presidency, his marriage and more, in a wide-ranging interview with John Dickerson for CBS Sunday Morning, to be broadcast April 21.\n\nButtigieg, 37, is a veteran of the Afghanistan war and is one of many vying for the Democratic nomination for president. If elected, he would be America's youngest president ever.\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., with CBS News' John Dickerson. CBS News\n\nOne of his missions, he has said, is to improve the symbolism of the office. Because the presidency is also a moral office, Buttigieg tells Dickerson, co-host of CBS This Morning. It calls this nation to its highest values. And it sets the tone for the story that we tell ourselves. Narrative is a very powerful thing, and we need to make sure that everybody in America understands where they fit in this country's story.\n\nIn terms of experience for the job, Buttigieg says one of the toughest decisions he's had to make was a moment in Afghanistan when he needed to make a split-second decision whether to abandon a vehicle that might be ready to explode and risk being killed, or continue on with his mission.\n\nDickerson visits South Bend with Buttigieg to see his home, and the city he runs. Dickerson also talks with Buttigieg's husband, Chasten Buttigieg, a junior-high schoolteacher.\n\nDo you feel your marriage is campaigning as well, because you're doing something that is new in American politics? Dickerson asks Chasten Buttigieg.\n\nI think I'd argue I don't have to answer for it, Chasten replies. I mean, we passed marriage equality. I don't think I have to answer for my marriage anymore. But I do enjoy going out there with Pete and showing people that, you know, gay marriage is just like a straight marriage.\n\nSunday Morning, hosted by Jane Pauley, broadcasts on CBS Sundays beginning at 9 a.m. ET.

Jada Pinkett Smith is revealing secrets from her pre-fame past.\n\nThe Girls Trip star recently visited the Sway in the Morning show on SiriusXM, where she explained the origins of her friendship with late rapper Tupac Shakur.\n\nIt's kind of hard because I haven't really told the whole story, she said. One of the things that's very interesting that I've never really said before is that when I first met Pac, I was a drug dealer.\n\nThat's how we started, she said. Then as I was coming out, something very bad happened to me. As I was coming out of the life, he was coming more into the life.\n\nPinkett Smith also revealed that when Shakus was killed in 1996, they hadn't been speaking because of an argument.\n\nPac and I's relationship was about survival, she said. That's how it started. I know that most people want to always connect it in this romance thing, and that's just because they don't have the story. It was based in survival -- how we held each other down -- and when you have somebody that has your back when you feel like you're nothing, that's everything. There's a lot of components to our story that we've never shared for a very specific reason. I just decided that this one little piece was important to share finally because it gives more insight to who we were. It was about survival and it's always been about survival between us.\n\nLast month, Smith took to Twitter to express her frustrations about the Shakur biopic, All Eyez on Me.\n\nForgive me... my relationship to Pac is too precious to me for the scenes in All Eyez On Me to stand as truth. — Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017\n\nPac never read me that poem. I didn't know that poem existed until it was printed in his book. — Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017\n\nPac never said goodbye to me before leaving for LA. He had to leave abruptly and it wasn't to pursue his career. — Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017\n\nI've never been to any of Pac's shows by his request. We never had an argument backstage. — Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017
Pete Buttigieg likes to start off his stump speech by asking the crowd to envision the day when the sun comes up and Donald Trump is no longer president. The first potentially concrete development on this front takes place in two weeks, when Iowans go to caucus in the first Democratic voting contest on February 3.\n\nHe has been hitting the trail hard, reminding Iowa caucus goers that it is decision time.\n\nFour presidential contenders — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet — will be off the trail for most days over at least the next two weeks because they're sitting senators who are required to be present for President Trump's Senate impeachment trial. Though the trial has not yet begun, their obligations in Washington have already meant that Buttigieg has had Iowa to himself for a couple of days after the presidential debate last week.\n\nIn that time, he's been giving some thought to his closing argument, about why I'll be the right nominee to take on and defeat Donald Trump. He's leaning into moderation, presenting himself as an alternative to progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are both polling strongly in Iowa. Where they focus on ideological purity, he's explaining why I'm focused on bringing together, not just our party but our country when the time comes.\n\nHis stump speech revolves largely around faith, freedom and democracy. He's also consistent about stressing that his campaign aims to build a sense of belonging, and he has a collection of anecdotes about how his campaign has emphasized that idea to its supporters.\n\nA campaign aide told CBS News that the former South Bend mayor will continue to emphasize his belief in the importance of building a broad coalition. He often mentions his campaign is reaching out to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, moderates and future former Republicans.\n\nThe latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed that Buttigieg is third among likely Democratic caucus goers behind Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The poll showed that 40% of Democrats in Iowa have decided who they will support, compared to 45% who said they can be persuaded to support another candidate.\n\nAt multiple campaign stops in Iowa, Buttigieg has acknowledged Iowa has a thumb on the scale in selecting the party's nominee — its winner has been the Democratic nominee 7 out of 10 times — but he also talks about how Iowa has been a leader in political and social issues that are personal to him.\n\nIowa has a way of surprising America and leading it forward — 2008, Iowa made it possible for a candidate whose very name made his campaign extremely improbable to arrive on the scene as a front running presidential candidate and eventually president of the United States, Buttigieg said at a town hall in Mason City, of Barack Obama.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Iowa led the way in making it possible for a marriage like mine to exist, he noted. Iowa has recognized same-sex marriages since 2009.\n\nMaryland Congressman Anthony Brown, who is a national campaign co-chair and the first Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) member to endorse Buttigieg, told CBS News in an interview that Buttigieg needs to convey his practical solutions to governing, his mayoral record, his military service and his faith in the final weeks to the caucus to convince undecided caucus goers.\n\nI think sharing his experiences, framing it in the values that we all share, demonstrating a strategic approach to our issues — I think that will set him apart from the other candidates, Brown added.\n\nBut some undecided voters who attended his events his past week still harbor misgivings about the 38-year-old candidate's experience.\n\nI think he needs to prove, other than say that 'it doesn't matter,' that he has the experience to lead, said Runal A. Patel, a 20-year-old college student who also volunteered for New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign. I really hate that whenever he gets asked that question, he sort of just deflects and says, 'Well, you know the last president didn't have any experience.' I always think well, look how that presidency is going. You know, I don't think that that's a good answer.\n\nClaire Schaefer, a 21-year-old college student whose first choice is Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, also seems dubious that he has the experience to lead — or at least remains unconvinced by the argument he sometimes makes that experience doesn't matter so much. On the debate stage, he has argued that the decades of experience of his competitors have led the country nowhere.\n\nI guess in some ways his inexperience like makes me a little doubtful, and that's probably the only thing —and maybe his performance with voters of color, Schaefer said.\n\nOn the ground, national caucus director Travis Brock is planning to stay in Iowa until Caucus Day. While he usually splits his time between Nevada, which also holds a caucus, and Iowa, Brock recently embarked on a 19-stop tour around the state training volunteers and precinct captains across Iowa.\n\nWhile Buttigieg held five events last Thursday, Brock spent nearly two hours training over 250 people in Polk County, the largest in the state. It's part of a broader effort to teach volunteers and caucus goers the delegate math and persuasion methods in order to convince undecided caucus goers.\n\nButtigieg is keenly aware that he'll need a strong finish in Iowa in order to build momentum heading into the other nominating contests.\n\nIt continues to be the case that Iowa is very important because it's our opportunity to demonstrate our strength for a lot of voters who I think are very pragmatic in places like South Carolina and Nevada, who above all, want to see a candidate who can win, Buttigieg told reporters at a campaign stop in Nevada on January 11.
Actress Meagan Good met her filmmaker husband, DeVon Franklin, on set filming for the movie, Jumping the Broom.\n\nThe couple is out with a new book called, The Wait: A Powerful Practice for Finding Love of Your Life and the Life You Love, which explains why saving sex for marriage is the key to success. The couple committed to celibacy until they tied the knot in 2012.\n\nFranklin, who is also a preacher, said his decision to remain celibate starting ten years before marriage was inspired by his spiritual practice.\n\nI didn't want to live two lives. At the time I wasn't practicing celibacy, but I was still talking about it, and I said, 'You know, I have to be the man that God called me to be,' and part of that was taking this vow and waiting until marriage and when I stared doing that it gave me discipline that helped me in every other area of my life, Franklin told CBS This Morning Monday.\n\nThe couple said the wait was important because sex can cloud people's judgment when dating.\n\nWhen you take that out of the equation, you actually get to know the person across the board in every other way except the physical which, which comes later, Good said.\n\nGood said she decided to take the vow of celibacy after filming Jumping the Broom because she felt that she had hit rock bottom emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIt was in that prayer time that I came to the conclusion that I needed to be celibate, I needed to do something different than what I had been doing all the years before, Good said. I decided this is what I need to do for me, because I need to heal and I need to focus on myself and I need to advance myself in every area of my life without the distraction of feeling... that I need this man.\n\nThe couple also drew a distinction between abstinence, and celibacy.\n\nAbstinence is just, 'Hey I'm not doing it.' And we say, well, sometimes you can be abstinent because you don't have options, Good said. But we define celibacy as abstaining from sex because there's a higher purpose and a higher calling and we believe that it is specifically related to marriage.
Jason Lee is no longer a practicing Scientologist.\n\nThe 46-year-old actor and his family moved to Denton, Texas, last year, and he recently quietly shared the news with local outlet, The Dentonite. When asked what businesses he owns in Denton, Lee took the opportunity to clear up rumors about himself.\n\nIf [my wife] Ceren and I had an idea for a business, it certainly wouldn't happen at the cost of someone else's, Lee said. And being that we don't practice Scientology, and that we aren't particularly interested in opening religious centers in general, we have no plans to open a Scientology center.\n\nQuite a few rumors about me/us floating around but none of it's true, he continued. We're not here to buy up or change or take over Denton, put some kind of personal stamp on it. We're just here like anyone else who wants to be a part of Denton's very cool creative community, and to be involved and perhaps help where we can.\n\nLee and wife Ceren Alkac married in 2008 and have two children together -- 9-year-old Casper and 4-year-old Sonny. Lee also has a son with his ex, Beth Riesgraf, 12-year-old Pilot Inspektor.\n\nThe former My Name Is Earl actor had been practicing Scientology since the '90s. Last June, Lee's ex-wife, Carmen Llywelyn, wrote an essay for the now defunct Gawker blaming the controversial religion for their split. Lee and Llywelyn married in 1995, and divorced in 2001.\n\nWhen I think back, I believe a part of me knew if I didn't accept Scientology the marriage would be over before it even started, Llywelyn wrote. That may sound somewhat superficial and at that age, maybe it was. But in truth, regardless of how different I feel about Jason and Scientology today, I was very much in love with the guy and wanted our marriage to work. I did what I thought was right.\n\nLee isn't the only celeb who has parted ways with the Church of Scientology. Lisa Marie Presley left the religion in 2012, as did Crash director Paul Haggis, in 2009.\n\nActress Leah Remini, who left the Church in 2013 after being a member for 36 years, has been the most openly critical of the religion, penning her book,Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology, last November. In June, Tony Ortega, who worked on the HBO documentary Going Clear, told ET the former King of Queens star is working on a new show spotlighting Scientology and its effects on family life.\n\nThe Church has previously denied all of Remini's allegations and released a statement claiming that bitterness and anger are common threads in her life.\n\nLeah Remini knows the truth she conveniently rewrites in her revisionist history, the statement reads in part. The real story is that she desperately tried to remain a Scientologist in 2013, knowing full well she was on the verge of being expelled for refusing to abide by the high level of ethics and decency Scientologists are expected to maintain.
Los Angeles -- A federal judge in California ruled Thursday that a twin son of a gay married couple has been an American citizen since birth, handing a defeat to the U.S. government, which had only granted the status to his brother. The State Department was wrong to deny citizenship to 2-year-old Ethan Dvash-Banks because U.S. law does not require a child to show a biological relationship with their parents if their parents were married at the time of their birth, District Judge John F. Walter found.\n\nA lawsuit filed by the boys' parents, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, sought the same rights for Ethan that his brother, Aiden, has as a citizen.\n\nEach boy was conceived with donor eggs and the sperm from a different father — one an American, the other an Israeli citizen — but born by the same surrogate mother minutes apart.\n\nElad Dvash-Banks, left, and his partner, Andrew, pose for photos with their twin sons, Ethan, center right, and Aiden in their apartment Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2018, in Los Angeles. AP\n\nThe government had only granted citizenship to Aiden, who DNA tests showed was the biological son of Andrew, a U.S. citizen. Ethan was conceived from the sperm of Elad Dvash-Banks, an Israeli citizen.\n\nThe suit was one of two filed last year by an LGBTQ immigrant rights group that said the State Department is discriminating against same-sex binational couples by denying their children citizenship at birth. The cases filed in Los Angeles and Washington by Immigration Equality said the children of a U.S. citizen who marries abroad are entitled to U.S. citizenship at birth no matter where they are born, even if the other parent is a foreigner. Only the Los Angeles case was decided Thursday.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling. Previously the department pointed to guidance on its website that said there must be a biological connection to a U.S. citizen to become a citizen at birth.\n\nThis family was shocked and appalled and angry when they were told their family wasn't legal, said Aaron Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality. They wanted their twin boys to be treated exactly the same.\n\nMorris said the government wrongly applied a policy for children born out of wedlock to married same-sex couples.\n\nWalter agreed, writing that the State Department statute does not contain language requiring a 'blood relationship between the person and the father' in order for citizenship to be acquired at birth.\n\nThis is justice! We are hopeful that no other family will ever have to go through this again. It's like a giant rock has been removed from our hearts, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks said in a statement provided by Immigration Equality.\n\nAndrew Dvash-Banks was studying in Israel when he met his future husband, Elad, an Israeli citizen. Because they couldn't marry at the time in the U.S. or in Israel, they moved to Canada, where they wed in 2010. The children were born by a surrogate in September 2016.\n\nEverything seemed fine until the couple brought their cranky infants to the American consulate in Toronto a few months later to apply for citizenship and the woman at the counter began asking probing questions they found shocking and humiliating.\n\nThe consular official told them she had discretion to require a DNA test to show who the biological father was of each boy and without those tests neither son would get citizenship. The men knew that Andrew was Aiden's biological father and Elad was Ethan's but they had kept it a secret and hadn't planned on telling anyone.\n\nAfter submitting the DNA test results that proved who fathered each boy, the couple received a large and small envelope from the U.S. on March 2. The big one included Aiden's passport. The other was a letter notifying Andrew that Ethan's application had been denied.\n\nThe family has since moved to Los Angeles to be closer to Andrew Dvash-Banks' family.\n\nThe other case involves two women, one from the U.S., and one from Italy, who met in New York, wed in London and each gave birth to a son. The State Department didn't recognize the couple's marriage, the lawsuit said, and only granted citizenship to the boy whose biological mother was born and raised in the U.S.
ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers backed a bill on Tuesday preventing businesses from discriminating based on race, nationality, religion or sex, after Republicans rejected Democrats' efforts to add gay and transgender people to those protected by the measure.\n\nThe change would catch Georgia up to federal standards set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Georgia is one of five states without a so-called public accommodation law.\n\nRep. Taylor Bennett, a Brookhaven Democrat, tried to amend the bill to also prevent discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, veteran status or disability. But his proposal was altered by Rep. Beth Beskin, an Atlanta Republican, who eliminated all of Bennett's additions except gender.\n\nAfter Democrats on the committee questioned Beskin about whether she intended to excuse discrimination against other groups, Beskin said local governments can decide to provide protections beyond the proposed bill. Some municipalities, including the city of Atlanta, already have such laws.\n\nIt was what I could do, she said. And I'm certainly not intending to enlarge any discriminatory actions or rights (of) employers.\n\nA number have states have gone beyond the federal law, preventing discrimination based on marital status, sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodation laws.\n\nBennett said he was disappointed that the bill is headed toward a floor vote without protecting more people from discrimination but still called it a significant step.\n\nThis is something that should have been done a long time ago, he said.\n\nThe committee also passed a bill known as the Pastor Protection Act, stating that religious officials aren't required to perform same-sex marriages. Nothing in state or federal law would require them to perform the ceremonies, but lawmakers said the bill would reassure officials concerned by the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nHouse Speaker David Ralston, the chamber's top Republican, supports the Pastor Protection Act.\n\nGeorgia lawmakers have filed at least eight bills to grant a variety of legal exemptions to religious opponents of same-sex marriage. The push has gay-rights advocates in Georgia on guard; around 200 people held a rally opposing the measures Tuesday outside the state Capitol.\n\nBoth bills approved Tuesday now go to the House Rules committee, which determines the daily schedule of bills receiving a full vote on the floor. The bills could receive a vote as soon as Thursday.\n\nJeff Graham, executive director of the gay-rights advocacy group Georgia Equality, said adding more protected groups to the civil rights bill would solve the broader disagreement between those seeking religious exemptions and the LGBT community.\n\nWe can solve this problem this year for everyone, Graham said. It's an opportunity for the legislature as a whole to be on the right side of history.
In this episode of Intelligence Matters, host Michael Morell speaks with Judd Devermont, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior analyst in the intelligence community. Devermont discusses areas of instability on the continent and the areas where the U.S. has an opportunity to pursue national interests. He reviews areas of progress and setbacks in governance and security, and explains why he believes there has been a 'democratization of leadership' in Africa. Devermont also reviews Chinese and Russian investments and operations on the continent, and explains why they each have significant long-term implications for U.S. security.\n\n\n\nDownload, rate and subscribe here: iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher.\n\nINTELLIGENCE MATTERS - JUDD DEVERMONT\n\nCORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL\n\nPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nJudd, welcome to the show. It's great to have you on Intelligence Matters.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo maybe the place to start is a little bit about your career. And I'd be interested in a couple things. One is, your interest in Africa, where did that come from? And then, your interest in C.I.A. and where did that come from and how did you end up there?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYou mean why did someone who grew up in Southern California end up spending a career working in Africa?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n(LAUGH) Exactly, exactly.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nI love history and in high school, all you can take is U.S. and European. And when I got to college, I just went all over the world: Latin America and Southeast Asia, East Asia. But I took a class on the Arab Revolt, actually, and this seminar class was so incredible, the way in which they talked about how Arab nationalism and agency mixed with geo politics.\n\nAnd so, I kind of knew that's what I wanted, but I still didn't know what the region was. I didn't really want to go in the Middle East. And one day, I didn't go to class, I never miss class, but one day I decided with a friend, we walked around campus and we got in front of a study abroad kiosk.\n\nAnd only two pamphlets jumped at me: Ghana and South Africa. And I don't know, Michael, it was this moment where I could see my entire future. I knew all of those things that I liked in that Arab Spring course or Arab Revolt course were going to be in Africa. I moved to South Africa, I did a year there and I never looked back.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd what was that year in South Africa like?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nIt was incredible. I studied at the University of Cape Town. I traveled all over Southern Africa. I lived in the dorms and have great South African friends. And I just found on the continent, history, I had a professor who said, History lies heavy on the continent's present and future. And so, it was everything that I wanted and it's been incredibly fulfilling, 20 years now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, for those listeners who haven't been to Cape Town, I've been there twice, you are just absolutely surrounded by history.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, it's gorgeous.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt is amazing. And then the C.I.A., how did you end up at the C.I.A.?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThis is kind of a funny story. It actually has a lot to do with a Tom Clancy novel, but not because I related to Jack Ryan. I mean, yeah, he's an analyst, but the guy is on operation almost immediately, right?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nI mean, he's never at his desk. And so, I wanted, as I said, a job, I love history, I wanted a job that had a lot to do with history. And in this one Jack Ryan novel, he's not even in the agency anymore, he's like the national security advisor. And he calls up the Department of State to talk to their senior desk officer for Japan.\n\nAnd the way I remembered this passage, I tried to find it recently and I can't, the senior desk officer in Japan knows everything about history, politics, culture, economics. And I said, I'm going to be a desk officer. That's my goal. Applied for the State Department as an intern, I got in. I was going to be in the Bureau of West African Affairs and just before I left for Washington, my father grabs the intern guide book that I had and says, C.I.A. You should apply to C.I.A. I said, listen, Pops--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhy did he say that?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nI think he loves the operation. He continues to tell me he could be a great operational officer. He's 77 years old. But he was really fascinated with the lifestyle and he encouraged me to apply. I said, I'm going to be a desk officer, I don't need this. He said, You should apply. So I did. I get to Washington. First day at the Department of State, it's like two hours of paperwork, they say, Come back tomorrow for your first full day. It's September 11th, 2011.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWow.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThat was my first day working for the U.S. Government.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWow.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nAnd I know where you were and I know you were briefing the President and I was just an intern in West Africa, but I felt a sense of privilege that I was there. It was a great experience. And a couple of weeks later the C.I.A. calls and said, We'd like to offer you a grad fellowship.\n\nSo now I'm at a place where C.I.A. seems really interesting, my fantasy desk officer job seems really interesting, I'm very lucky to sort of go to Cote d'Ivoire, work in our embassy for a longer internship and I meet an analyst from INR, State Department's Analytic Wing. She's retired now, but she was phenomenal.\n\nI mean, she wasn't even the senior analyst for this country and she had everyone in the palm of her hands. And that was the moment that I said, I know exactly where I want to go. It's going to\n\nbe an analyst.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So in laymen's terms, can you tell folks what it's like to be an analyst at C.I.A.?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. You know, there wasn't a day that I didn't have a smile on my face walking in that door. I came in on the weekends and not because I had a task there, but because I had a paper that I really wanted to write, research. But every day you are immersed in all this information about the country or issue that you work.\n\nYou have these great colleagues that you are engaging with. Every morning, there's a 9:00 morning meeting and you sort of report up what's interesting, what's happened, what should we be writing about, what do senior policy makers need to know. And then, you spend your day writing those papers or going to briefings or spending time around a table and trying to figure out what's going to happen next and why does it matter.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo you become the National Intelligence Officer for Africa, what does that mean? What does a National Intelligence Officer do?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nIt's the best job I've ever had, Michael. It really has three functions. You are the U.S. Government's senior analyst on a country or an issue. You represent all the 17 intelligence agencies, in all policy meetings. C.I.A. might have a seat at the table, but I represented the DNI. And I would do the briefing that usually kicked off these policy meetings. So that was sort of one of the responsibilities.\n\nThe second is that I oversaw all of the strategic analysis that the intelligence community had, national intelligence estimates, et cetera. C.I.A. might have their view, DIA may have their view, but what was written under my auspices was a community view.\n\nAnd sometimes the community may disagree and we would represent that, as well. And then the third part of the job which I really loved which is I felt responsible for helping to develop our analytic cadre. I would host conferences, I would bring people together, I used to have a product of the month that I would send out, so people could see analytic excellence.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThat's great.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nIt was a fantastic job. Three years, great.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd you also served on the NSC staff on Africa.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nTalk about that.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nI worked in the Obama Administration, I was the Director for Nigeria, Somalia, the Sahel and the African Union. These countries aren't next to each other, but my boss just said, All of your\n\nexperiences, we're just going to put them into one account.\n\nAnd my job was to coordinate U.S. policy. It was a pretty interesting time. We ended up recognizing the Government of Somalia for the first time since 1991. I contributed to the Obama strategy towards Africa. And my job was really to make sure that we were all marching in the same direction. I wrote all the papers for the deputy's committees and other senior meetings so that we could figure out where we're going to go.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo how many countries are in sub Saharan Africa?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\n49.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo how is it possible to keep up with what's going on in 49 countries?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYou know, when I was telling you the story about why I joined, what I wanted to be, it was to be an expert. And I think it's taken me to this point in my career to realize I may never be an expert on 49 countries. So you do a lot of triaging, you work with a lot of smart people. But I find each and every one of them fascinating.\n\nAnd I've had the fortune of working first in West African issues and then I moved to East African and Central African, so I've sort of moved around enough, and then my academic work was on southern. But you have to go into these meetings and present to policy makers real insights into these countries that they may have worked and traveled to together. So it's a lifelong challenge.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd this is a big place, right?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe continent is huge.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, I have a map next to me right now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nBecause I have to reference it.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd just the Congo itself is roughly the size of half the United States, right?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes, right, yeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt's a massive continent.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nMassive continent.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo this great job that you had in the intelligence community you left in 2018?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhy?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nWell, I always think it's important to say it has nothing to do with politics. I spent 18 months as the National Intelligence Officer under President Obama and then 18 months under President Trump, and I actually really liked working and trying to support this administration. It forced me to challenge my assumptions.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo you were the National Intelligence Officer during the Trump [administration]?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes, for 18 months.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nAnd I had to meet them where they were, which they didn't have the kind of depth that President Obama and his team had on Africa and they had different views and I really enjoyed trying to find ways to communicate the continent's significance and why it matters.\n\nBut the NIO job was the pinnacle for me. That's the best job you can have in my career of service. I thought maybe in 30 years I would be able to get to that point, and I was about halfway through in my career and I didn't see a job in the community that would sort of push me forward. I wanted a new challenge.\n\nAnd quite honestly, I wanted to do policy again. I really liked being at the NSC, and I wanted to think about what our policy should be. And you know, one of the things you can't do as an analyst is give policy prescriptive.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nSo it just seemed like a time to leave at a high point at this incredible position to engage with new people and think about where we should go next.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd as CSIS, you are able to do both the analysis and policies, right?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. It's actually a lot like my old job. I read a lot, I write a lot, but then I have recommendations on what I think we should do. Plus, I get to do things, like I have a podcast, that's fun. I talk to journalists.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nPodcasts are the best. (LAUGH)\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nPodcasts are the best. You know, I travel a lot. I meet with African and European and other government officials and get to interact with them in a different way, speaking for myself, not for my government.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Intelligence Matters has now been around for a couple of years, we have never had anybody on talking about Africa. So I think the key question is: How does Africa matter to our national security? And how much does it matter?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nHow do you answer that question?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThis is a difficult question because as we've just talked about, there are 49 countries in sub Saharan Africa, 54, if you include the North African countries. 55 if you're the African Union because you include Western Sahara. And as our interests evolved, the way we look at Africa changes. And if you would just allow me a quick tangent, because this is very nerdy, but if it's going to be successful, it's going to be successful on Intelligence Matters.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWell, you're talking to a nerd, so we're in good shape here.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes. I teach a class at George Washington University on the History of U.S. Intelligence Analysis in Africa, and I found this piece, a National Intelligence Estimate from 1971 in East Africa, and there's a line in it, maybe you've seen this before, I've never seen it before, the analyst said, The significance for the United States of developments in East Africa depends on what the U.S. says is important.\n\nRight? It sounds circular, but it's true. And then, the analysts go further than that, right? They say if you're going to look at this in a narrow perspective, we don't have many interests, 1971 in East Africa. There's not a product that we get there, we don't have economic investment.\n\nBut if you step back, and I'm paraphrasing here, if you step back, these are countries that could be models, open societies. These leaders have influence, both in Africa and globally. And if they should go south, if there should be instability, it would affect our interests.\n\nAnd I like to use that story because it tells me don't undersell and don't oversell. Look at all the angles and present all the arguments. So the way that I think about Africa right now is in three ways: First, the future is African, demographically. The continent will double in size. It will go from 1.2 billion people to 2.4 billion people by 2050. That means a quarter of the world's population will be Africa. Nigeria is going to be larger than the United States.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo fastest growth by any continent?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, fastest growth, youngest continent. Nigeria is going to be the third-largest country in the world, it's going to surpass us. And so, every global problem is going to have an African dimension to it. What is going to be the norms around Internet privacy? How are we going to deal with climate change?\n\nThere's going to be an African component to that and we need to be mindful of that. Two, and this has been something that I've learned in my career, Africa's problems and opportunities don't stop at the water's edge. What happens in Africa changes the way the world works. African migration crisis changed European politics. The Ebola crisis changes the way we think about global health security. You may remember the piracy off the coast of the Horn of Africa, it changed actually how maritime commerce worked in the shipping industry.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nSo I think that it's really important to be mindful of these events in these different countries because they do change the way people and systems work. And then finally, our allies and adversaries understand those first two points really well and I think they understand it probably better than we do.\n\nWe are seeing this dramatic increase in engagement by allies and adversaries. Between 2010 and 2015, 150 foreign embassies were built in sub Saharan Africa. Trade is up for most countries, 65 countries have increased their trade. And military bases all across Africa. Indian Ocean, the Horn of Africa and Western Saharan, I'm sorry, Western Africa.\n\nSo I think that we have to recognize that if we are not there to shape what is happening on the continent, to referee, to make sure that we are not blocked out by opportunities, it is going to affect our national interests.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo talk a little bit about kind of the state of Africa today. You know, what's going on there? What are the challenges these countries face? And what are some of the positive things that are happening?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nChinua Achebe, the author of Things Fall Apart, said when talking about Nigeria, The problem with Nigeria is leadership. And I think for many of these countries, leadership and governance and sort of the economic problems that flow from that are still probably the biggest challenges these countries face. There is instability.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt's true. It's true of a lot of countries.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nIt's true of a lot of the countries, right? But you know, instability in the Sahel, challenges in Eastern Congo with Ebola, we have been talking for so many years about urbanization and greater connectivity and youth bulge and climate change. And I would argue right now, those things are really coming together.\n\nGovernance has been hard in Africa, but it's become really complex. And I think some governments are failing in the way they respond to that. And I think it's making conflicts more protracted, more deadly, and I think it is denying people the ability to live their lives. And these all, as we have said, have all these effects for us.\n\nBut there's some good news stories. And I always like the opportunity to talk about good news because the U.S. media on Africa, it's all negative. I mean, it's disproportionately negative. And\n\nAfrica is doing some things that are really interesting.\n\nThey're going in a different direction than the rest of the world in some cases. So while there's this global recession in democracy, there are people who have less confidence in it. Africans really strongly believe in democracy. 68% of Africans support democratic principles.\n\nIn some countries, it's like in the 80s. There's been 28 transfers of power since 2015, peaceful, more than half. That's historic. While the rest of the world has become protectionist and imposing tariffs, Africans have created a new continental trade arrangements.\n\nIt's the largest trading block since the W2O was founded. And finally, while the rest of the world or at least the United States are thinking about pulling out, the Africans are stepping up and they're working together to deal with trans-national threats. So I think those are really good stories.\n\nAnd just the last thing that I think maybe your audience hasn't thought about that is really exciting to me is African soft power. Africa, Africans are changing our global entertainment and cultural trends in ways that I think are unprecedented. Our music, our films, our sports, Africans are shaping it at the lead.\n\nAnd I'd love to see African governments take advantage of their soft power and I'd like to think of ways that our government could be more effective in navigating it.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo find this, you know, cutting against the trend on democracy and trade to be fascinating.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhy is that happening?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nWell, let me start with trade first. For the Africans, their economies are too fractured, fragmented. No one's going to invest in the small little Gambia, which just covers the river within Senegal. Inter trade within Africa has been historically low.\n\nAnd the Africans under the leadership of Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, realized that if they are going to increase inter-African trade, if they were going to become a better investment destination, they had to remove some of these barriers.\n\nSo I think that's what explains the integration, economic integration. On the democracy side, I think it's a number of trend lines that are coming together. First, as I said, still strong support for democracy, but I think there are new ways in which people can organize and mobilize that has changed politics in Africa. As it's become more urban, you've been able to communicate with each other in new ways through telephones and mobile phones.\n\nWe're seeing more protests on the streets. We're seeing more people push for change. And so, whether it's the uprising in Sudan that ended President Al Bashir's rule or it is the remarkable changes in Ethiopia or just increasingly cyclical transfers of power, I think a number of things are happening that really cut against the grain in both the global trends, as you've talked about, but even the way people think about sub Saharan Africa.\n\nBecause you can always pull out the autocracy or the democracy that is in recession or is regressing. But if you step back and look at the picture, it's actually very exciting. And what I tell people is, let's not look at this about democracy as up or down, let's look at the forces that have sort of created a status quo around governance are changing. And I expect a lot of volatility.\n\nWe'll come to you and have these really big surprises and we'll have these setbacks. But I think that people, the governed and the governing, are working on the new rules of the game. And so, it's a really interesting time right now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAre there countries, and I'm thinking of South Africa, I'm thinking of Nigeria, I'm thinking of Kenya, are there countries that kind of lead the continent? Or is that not a right way of thinking about it?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nU.S. policy has always thought about sort of anchor states: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia. They have outsized military forces, they are loud and vocal globally and on the continent. I don't think that is as true as much anymore. Nigeria has been dealing with its own internal security problems.\n\nTheir President isn't the most dynamic. Ethiopia is in the middle of a transition; South Africa is way down by economic problems. And so, what I think you've seen is a democratization of leadership in Africa. Different countries step up at different times.\n\nSo there's not one single voice. You can't as you did under the Bush Administration or under the Obama Administration say, Well, Nigeria is going to carry our water in West Africa. It just doesn't happen anymore. You've got to, I think, build these coalitions with the Senegals and the Ghanas in some regions and still rely on South Africa and Kenya for other things.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYou, Judd, you mentioned earlier that other countries are paying attention to what's going on in Africa.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd seeing some of the opportunities that you talked about. So can you talk a little about what third party actors, namely China and Russia, are doing on the continent? And if there are others, to, that are interesting, please mention those.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. Let me start with China. I think it's really important to say that China poses some threats to the U.S. in what it's doing. But I've been really disappointed with our policy, because we haven't been precise about what we're trying to counter when it comes to China.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWith China?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nWith China. We seem to want to focus on blocking them at every turn in sub Saharan Africa. And I don't know, it's like mad libs right now. It's we are worried about activity, fill in the blank, in country, fill in the blank, because of China. And I don't even think we have articulated at least publicly what is the end state that we are looking for.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd it's that because of China that is the driver, right?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, it's the because of China. And I think that if we are going to be effective at managing what China is doing in sub Saharan Africa, we need to be specific about what the threats are. So I would say, first of all, it's Chinese investment in critical infrastructure. Ports. We just did a paper at CSIS, 46 ports the Chinese are invested in, operating or building in Africa.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd that's a risk because--?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThat's a risk because it can limit our mobility, our access to these countries, our ability for our military, our ability for our private sector to get involved.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd the Chinese port could eventually become a Chinese military base?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nAbsolutely. That's what we saw in Djibouti.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nSo I worry about ports. I worry about cyber and telecoms. The Chinese have built about 70% of Africa's 4G, it will be 100% of their 5G. Even satellites, Africa is starting to launch more and more satellites and the Chinese are behind it. So we should focus on that.\n\nWe should focus on the people-to-people investment that China is doing. They're actually focusing on winning hearts and minds. More African students study in China than they do in the United States. China has a program now where they're trying to provide satellite television to 10,000 villages.\n\nI think that's decadal, the impacts of that. But the thing about China that gets the most oxygen in Washington is economics. And here is where I think we need to be a lot more nuanced. China is addressing the needs of Africans. This is a region that has the lowest railroad density in the world.\n\nThey need between $130 billion and $170 billion of infrastructure investments per year, according to the African Development Bank, and China is doing a lot of that stuff. So what we need to do with China in my view is we can't tell Africans not to take the money, because our private sector is not providing that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nChina does $200 billion a year and we do $40 billion. But we can help them to make sure the deals are better, that they don't discriminate against the U.S. private sector, that they have the environmental regulations. So that's how I think about China.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Russia.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, Russia is an easier conversation that China, right? I don't need much nuance. There is very few upsides to what Russia is doing. Essentially, President Putin needs permissive environments for his companies to invest in after the sanctions were imposed on his government and he's looking to score points.\n\nAfrica is a place where he can work asymmetrically. They don't do much that helps African economies. They sell arms. They're the largest exporter of arms to Africa in the world. They are involved in oil and gas industries, in energy. But often, that comes with a side of corruption. What they're really doing is being fairly disruptive to politics.\n\nIf they have an opportunity to side with an autocrat to provide technical expertise to help Al Bashir stay in power, that's what they'll do. So they are looking to sell themselves as returning to the glory days of the Soviet Union in Africa.\n\nAnd I think one of the things that we need to be careful about is not call them a great power. They're not. And I think when we call them a great power in Africa, we do Putin's bidding. They're a minnow. At least compared to us, the Chinese and Europe.\n\nSo I think that we need to do a better job at isolating and not elevating Russia. We need to close some of the loops that make it permissive for their companies to work in this area. And we need to be better about gauging Africans to inoculate them from these kinds of intrusions.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAre there big European players?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, France is still very involved. And in fact, President Macron just recently had a summit where he talked about what his government is doing on the Sahel. The U.K., the week of this recording, just had its first U.K. Africa Investment Summit. Malta, I don't know why I'm sharing this, but Malta just came out with their own Africa strategy, just to give you a sense of the diversity here.\n\nThe other region that I should spend just a second talking about is the Gulf. The Gulf is very active in Africa and Turkey is very active in Africa. In some cases, that's not bad, they're doing some of the investments. DP Ports is investing in lots of places all over the continent.\n\nBut what they've done that has been really negative is they have exported their political riffs to the region and it's been problematic for Somalia and countries that don't want to choose between the UAE on one side and Qatar on the other side. Turkey has also been involved on the commerce commercial side. They are doing some security assistance. As I said, it's a crowded space.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo extremist, Jihadist extremism, seems to be to be a growing problem on the continent.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIs that right? And if so, why is it happening and how much of a threat is it to Europe, to us?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. We have to remember that Al-Qaeda's major attack was in Africa, right, against our embassies in Tanzania, in Kenya. But in the last couple decades, I think the problem has become more diverse, more geographically dispersed and more deadly.\n\nThere are Al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates in West and East Africa and Southern Africa. We are seeing unaligned extremist groups like Boko Haram. The number of attacks that they are doing are increasing and I think the lethality of them are increasing.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nPrimarily against local targets?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nPrimarily against local targets. So in Nigeria, for example, according to a Council on Foreign Relations Database, 35,000 have died from Boko Haram in ISIS West Africa attacks or in conflict between those groups and the Nigerian military. In the Sahel, there's been a fivefold increase in deaths since 2016, 4,000 people.\n\nSo it's primarily African targets. But I just testified in front of the House, and what I said is that it's probably a low probability that they are going to attack the U.S. directly, but I think it has some significant impacts for us. First of all, it endangers our citizens that live in Africa and our economic investments. There was an attack by Al-Shabaab earlier this year, where they hit a Kenya military base, where the U.S. trains Kenyans and an American service person died and two contractors.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThey tried to attack our base in Somalia, as well. And Americans have been caught up in the hotel attacks and the mall attacks. There is a group affiliated with ISIS right near a huge L&G find in Mozambique. So it does threaten our interests about the people who live in Africa, our facilities and our economic investments.\n\nIt also, as it continues to fester, entangles us in very expensive peace keeping and humanitarian operations. So I think we need to be proactive when we think about that there is the secondary effects. And the last one is the more that extremist deepens and we are seen as less responsive, I think we lose the trust of our partners.\n\nI mean, Macron made a very clear pitch that he felt like the U.S. wasn't there helping. Our African partners have said the same. And Russia, particularly, has rushed in to kind of find an opportunity here. So it's not a direct threat to the homeland, but a huge amount of sort of impacts downstream.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhat's behind the expansion of extremism on the continent?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, I think partly it's a matter of governance and poor governance. And I think the affiliates, Al-Qaeda and ISIS have been sort of shopping for partners. I try to be very careful about talking about ISIS and AQ as if they're drivers because we don't want to lose the local elements. It's just as helpful for the local extremist group to work with Al-Qaeda and ISIS as it is vice versa.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo in a lot of cases, these groups existed already with local grievances and then they took on the name?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes, yes, yeah. They take on the name and there is a back and forth between the network and the local group and the network doesn't always get what it wants. But I think that those relationships have improved recruitment, have improved some of the tactical and strategic efforts maybe even to help them, like, IEDs and other things.\n\nSo I think poor governance, the attraction of networking with these groups and then the most important part is government mistakes. There is a study by UNDP that looked at sort of extremists in Africa and 71% of militants, former militants, said they joined an extremist group because a family member or friend was abused, detained by the security forces.\n\nSo many of these African militaries make the wrong moves that push people further into the arms of the extremists. So those are a couple of the things that I would highlight is why we keep seeing this proliferation of these groups.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYou talked earlier about the expansion of democracy. You talked earlier about poor governance, extremism now being a consequence of that poor governance. Is there a correlation or causation between a state being more democratic and the quality of its governance in Africa?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. Oh, sorry, I thought you were going to go in a different direction. I thought you were going to as whether or not correlation between democracy and extremist activity, which there is actually some good evidence. On the democracy and the governance, I don't have the numbers. But my experience says that it depends, right? I mean, if you are a democratic state and you are being responsive to your citizens, then in theory, the governance will improve over time.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right, right.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nBut in some cases, what happens is because the democracy, people are elected through (UNINTEL) networks, that you can actually use corruption to sort of focus on your own personal constituents, as opposed to the betterment of your total population. So you really have to go case by case to talk about, you know, where are all people benefiting versus people who are sort of in the circle of the President and the ruling party?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Judd, I think this is a good place to switch to U.S. policy and maybe we'll finish up on this. U.S. policy toward the region. How would you characterize it? What's working? What's not? If\n\nyou could advise the President, what would you tell him?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. You know, I think that our policy makers on Africa are stuck with the challenge of being asked to do less with less. And it's taken them a while to I think figure out how they are going to push policy. And I want to give them some credit because it's taken a little while, but I've been happy with some of the results, but just to kind of go back a little bit.\n\nLike in many other parts of the world, we didn't have policy makers on Africa for a long time in Washington or in the field. And so, there was this period where it was really this unhappy marriage between Obama policies they weren't sure they were going to dismantle and Trump policies that hadn't been constructed yet. And so, you've got a lot of contractions. And then you had Tweets and other sorts of, you know, travel bans that made things worse.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right, right.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nAnd then President Trump's national security advisor, John Bolton, unveils the strategy, and this doesn't go off very well either because it's almost entirely about Russia and China. The Africans felt like they were not part of the strategy.\n\nBut in the last year, I've been pleased with the bureaucracy finding a way. They launched an economic initiative called Prosper Africa, it's a lot to go still, but it's a good step, right? It's addressing some of the challenges that the U.S. private sectors had in investing in Africa. They've kind of found their footing on democracy and governance, which isn't really in any of the strategy documents or speeches.\n\nBut sanctions now on election spoilers in Nigeria, on corrupt officials in Kenya, on people who are stopping the peace process in South Sudan. So those are positive. The big question in year four is: Where is the DOD going? And you may know there is a proposal in front of Secretary of Defense Esper about withdrawing maybe even completely our troops in Africa, about 6,000 people. They already had reduced West African forces about 10%. I think this is a really dangerous policy. I think it's reckless.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd they are there supporting local forces who are fighting extremists?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nLocal forces, yeah. And it's not just sort of the CT side of the house, they're building capacity for Africans to deal with security challenges and they're there at the request of African governments. And we are there in partnership with our European friends.\n\nAnd this has caused great anxiety amongst the global community that we may walk away from the continent. We have done this before and it wasn't very good. So you may know, Michael, that in the '90s, we dramatically reduced our presence in Africa. And then after 9/11 and the growing CT threat, we realized, actually, we need to be back. So reset those relationships.\n\nRebuild capacity. Reinvest in infrastructure. A lack of DOD presence is going to not only, you know, make us seem less committed to these challenges, but there are the other effects. Our\n\ndiplomats and our development officers depend on the military to get out to these hard-to-reach places.\n\nI think our analysts are going to have a harder time understanding dynamics in Africa if there is less U.S. presence in these places. So I'm really concerned. I'm elated that the Hill has stepped up. Senator Graham, Senator Coons, a number of people on the House side have said this is a bad idea. And hopefully, Secretary Esper will decide not to do this.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. And if we're not there, who fills the vacuum?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nRight, exactly. Our adversaries.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nJudd, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nMy pleasure. Thank you.\n\n* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *
Produced by Chuck Stevenson, Lucy Scott and Asena Basak\n\n[This story originally aired on Feb. 7, 2015. It was updated on April 2, 2016.]\n\nIt's just about a 45-minute drive from the refineries of the Texas coast to the high rises of downtown Houston. And in 2000, 20-year-old Michelle Warner moved to the big city. She was a new mom looking to make a fresh start.\n\nMichelle did have the small-town girl in her, but Michelle always desired to go to the big city, Michelle's mom, Donna Malone, said. She loved to talk to people... she never met a stranger.\n\nWe were really, really close when we were young kids, I mean really close, her brother, David Chaffin added. From the time we were born we did pretty much everything together ... from the time I was born I was her child, not theirs.\n\nMichelle Warner Donna Malone\n\n\n\n\n\nShe just grew into this beautiful swan ... she had the long pretty hair and a beautiful smile, Malone continued. ...she started going to college ... and started studying criminal justice.\n\nBut things didn't exactly work out. Michelle may have been a saint, but she was also a sinner.\n\nShe married right after high school and, in 2001, and had a daughter, Hayley.\n\nWhen that marriage went south in 2003, little Hayley went to live with the ex-husband and Michelle was on her own.\n\nMichelle was a great mom, Malone explained, but she ran into some tough times in her life.\n\nShe fell in with a bad crowd and she even disappeared a couple of times. And she was arrested for possession of cocaine.\n\nBut that was eight years ago. Her family says Michelle's dark days were behind her.\n\nShe was finally turning around ... She was no longer on any kind of drugs, Malone said. She was going to work every day.\n\nIn 2008, she also began a relationship with a man she met at work -- a man named Mark Castellano.\n\nMy impression of Mark from the very beginning was, 'what an odd duck, what a strange little man,' said Malone.\n\nMichelle Warner and Mark Castellano Donna Malone\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Castellano and Michelle Warner had met on the job. She was a secretary at a medical firm; he was the IT guy -- the person who fixed computers.\n\nI absolutely do not know what Michelle saw in Mark, said Malone.\n\nHe's always been a little off, said Chaffin.\n\nIn 2009, Michelle and Mark had a son, Cayden.\n\nMichelle was very excited when Cayden was born, Malone said. I did have some reservations about Cayden's dad. ...Not so sure about Mark at all, no.\n\nMalone says Castellano wasn't much of a dad.\n\nCayden was about 2 months old and Mark just went away. Just, ' Ugh, I can't handle this; it's too stressful for me.' Everything was always about me - me, me, me, me, me.\n\nIn those early days, life was tough for Michelle as a single mom bouncing from job to job.\n\nNo child support, he did not pay any child support. Michelle was doing it on her own -- struggling to do it on her own. It was very difficult for her, said Malone.\n\nThen, in the summer of 2012, Michelle got a break -- a new job at a law firm in Houston. All she needed was a place for her and Cayden, now 3 years old, to stay. She reached out to the one person she knew there: Mark Castellano.\n\nHe agreed to let them stay at his Houston apartment, but Michelle set down some rules.\n\nWhen Michelle moved back in with Mark ... the agreement between them was that they would live together, raise the child together, but not as a romantically involved couple, said Malone.\n\nBut just three months after moving in with Castellano -- on Saturday, Sept 22, 2012 --Michelle was gone.\n\nWhen Chaffin couldn't get a hold of his sister, he called Castellano and confronted him.\n\nDo you have any idea where she may be? I've exhausted every lead that I have about Michelle and I can't find a f-----g thing, anybody who knows anything about where she might be. And you're the last person I know of that's seen her, Chaffin asked Castellano.\n\nYeah, yeah, I am, I am. But like I said, I don't know where the hell she went, Castellano replied.\n\nCastellano told Chaffin that he and Michelle had had a fight. She'd walked out and left her car and her toddler behind.\n\nChaffin was surprised to learn that on the night his sister disappeared, Castellano took Michelle's car and drove Cayden more than 500 miles -- over eight hours -- to his parent's house in West Texas.\n\nMark's story did not make any sense, said Malone.\n\nHouston Police Department\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost immediately, Michelle's family filed a missing persons report. They heard nothing. Five days later, veteran Houston homicide Detective Fil Waters and Sergeant Brian Harris got the case.\n\nWhen you first came here, you went in and what'd you do? 48 Hours correspondent Tracy Smith asked the investigators of the apartment where Castellano and Michelle lived together.\n\nWent to the apartment, the family was there, Det. Waters said. Actually, it was interesting that Mark's story was what happened, you know, I mean in terms of the story that he was telling everyone.\n\nCastellano had told Chaffin in that phone call that he and Michelle had been arguing over Cayden when she walked out.\n\nAll of the events leading up to it, the fight, all the stuff that happened here, Smith noted.\n\nAccurate, at least what he is telling us Waters said. The only people in the scenario who were casting any kind of suspicion on Mark are Michelle's family, that's where all that's coming from. And they're not saying things like, 'You know what? Michelle told me yesterday that if anything ever happened to me it's Mark.'\n\nWe were getting, 'We don't like Mark ... Marks a bad guy,' Waters continued. It's more personality dislikes about Mark.\n\nBut back at the apartment, cops did find something strange.\n\nWe knew that Mark was an IT guy. He's a techie nerd, Waters said. So then, what becomes noticeable in the apartment ... there are computers ... but all the hard drives are gone.\n\nThe homicide detectives wanted to talk with Castellano, so they called him at his parent's house in West Texas. It turns out Castellano had an unusual question for them.\n\nHe said, 'Can I ask you a question, though? I need some advice.' And I said, 'Sure.' And he said, 'Do you think I ought to let Dr Phil interview me?' said Waters.\n\nWhat'd you say? Smith asked.\n\nWell, I was a little stunned - I said, 'Dr. Phil?' Waters said of the host of the top-rated daytime talk show. And I said, 'Absolutely, let Dr. Phil interview you.'\n\nAs the week passed, the search for Michelle Warner expanded quickly from Houston, to west Texas and all the way to Los Angeles and the Dr. Phil show.\n\nDr. Phil: Today we will take you inside a national news story as it unfolded in front of our cameras in real time.\n\nIt was Dr. Phil McGraw -- not the police - who would first interrogate Castellano about Michelle's mysterious disappearance:\n\nDr. Phil: Let's talk about the night she disappeared. You had a fight? Was this a physical fight? Or an argument? Or both? Mark Castellano: Basically, I come home. Umm, she's in her room. First thing she does is start yelling at me. Cayden has made a big mess ... and we start fighting ... she walks up to me and gives me this kind of sucker punch while I'm on the floor. I mean she hits me all the time and I don't retaliate. She hit me and said, and clean it up right expletive, expletive, and she goes in and slams her door.\n\nWhat was your first impression of him? Smith asked.\n\nThat he was a game player, my first impression of him was that he thought he was the smartest guy in the room and he wanted everybody to know it, McGraw replied.\n\nDr. Phil: So you say she goes in, slams the door ... but you go back in to resume the argument, frankly. Mark Castellano: Right, yes. Dr. Phil: And... Mark Castellano: She's gone Dr. Phil: She's gone.\n\nI would take her pictures out and say out loud, 'Michelle where are you? You know just call me, text me please,' said Malone.\n\nCRACKING CASTELLANO\n\nFrom the very beginning, Dr. Phil McGraw felt there was something suspicious about Mark Castellano.\n\nWhy do you think Mark Castellano wanted to come on your show? Tracy Smith asked McGraw, whose show is distributed by CBS Television Distribution.\n\nI think this guy is a narcissist. I mean I really do, he replied.\n\nMark Castellano to Dr. Phil: She basically owns me in a lot of way and I admit that. I caved to Michelle nine-tenths of the time.\n\nCastellano was on the defensive.\n\nHe said to you, 'She could have just disappeared again,' Smith commented to McGraw. That was a possibility.\n\nRight, McGraw replied. He says it was a possibility ... she could have gone in the bedroom, locked the door, gone out the door and left. But, her car's still there.\n\nAnd her son is still there, Smith noted.\n\nHer son is still there, her car is still there, but she's gone off the grid, said McGraw.\n\nMeantime, in Houston -- 500 miles to the east -- the cops were searching the grid trying to find Michelle.\n\nWe do something called a psychological autopsy. We start breaking down a person's life, and so that's what we were having to do with Michelle, Sgt. Harris explained.\n\nBack in West Texas, McGraw continued his interview with Castellano. He had a hunch that those missing hard drives might be connected to Michelle's disappearance, so he grilled Mark:\n\nDr. Phil: You said you would show 'em to me. Do you have 'em here? Can we look at 'em? Mark Castellano[gets up from his seat]: Yeah I'll bring 'em to you, one second. Oh, no I don't have 'em -- he's still copying 'em. Dr. Phil: OK. You can come back. Mark Castellano: Sorry, I thought he brought them back but he didn't. Dr. Phil: You said you were gonna show those to us and you got up and walked to the door -- and then said, Oh, that's right, they're not here. But not 15 minutes before we got here, you told my producer they weren't here. You already knew they weren't here when you got up to get 'em. Mark Castellano: My mind is scatterbrained right now. I mean I forgot.\n\nI forgot? said Smith.\n\nBells are going off right now. I'm talking to him and watching ... the theatre of what's going on, McGraw said. He's playing games here. To him, it's a manipulation ... and I'm wondering why he's not putting all of his effort, all of his emphasis, on finding Michelle?\n\nMy dad used to say for every rat you see there's 50 you don't. When he tells you that lie, there's 50 more, McGraw continued.\n\nMcGraw relentlessly peeled back Castellano's story.\n\nHe also admits throwing her cat down the hallway, throwing her cat into a wall. And that is very troubling to me, said McGraw.\n\nEach revelation led him closer to the conclusion that Castellano killed Michelle:\n\nDr. Phil: Was there violence at this point? Mark Castellano: There was violence ... She and I would wrestle ... push each other around. There was one time I choked her.\n\nHe admits to being violent with her, said Smith.\n\nHe admits to being violent with her to the point of choking her. Now think about this: if he, in fact, is culpable in her disappearance, why in the world would he admit that? said McGraw.\n\nMark Castellano during his interview on Dr. Phil\n\nSo let's look at the moment when you asked him the big question, Smith said as she and McGraw watched more of the TV interview:\n\nDr. Phil: It's really odd for a mother to just not check on, find out anything about a child. If you think something has happened to her, why aren't you looking for her? Mark Castellano: I mean, as far as everybody has exhausted the leads that I have. I don't know where else to go. The police are looking for her. They're professionals. Dr. Phil: Did you do anything to her that would be considered foul play or criminal? Mark Castellano: No, no. Dr. Phil: Did you kill her? Mark Castellano: No, sir.\n\nSo as you left, where did you stand with Mark Castellano? What did you think? Smith asked McGraw.\n\nIt is clear in my mind that I'm not believing a word he is saying, he replied. When I walked out the door ... I said, 'He killed her, no doubt about it.'\n\nYou said it then? Smith asked.\n\nHe killed her, said McGraw.\n\nBut Castellano hadn't confessed to anything. After McGraw returned to Los Angeles to get his show ready for broadcast, detectives brought Castellano in and turned up the heat.\n\nIt all happened in an interview room at the Houston homicide division. There was no tough guy posturing, no rolled up shirtsleeves or guns on the hip, and no raised voices -- it was pure psychology.\n\nI was like, Fil, when you go in there, it's like walking into a minefield, because one, you don't wanna upset him and make him angry where all of sudden he says the L word - lawyer, or he says, I wanna leave, said Sgt. Harris.\n\nDetective Fil Waters takes the lead:\n\nDet. Waters: OK, so the first thing, you're not under arrest. Mark Castellano: Right. Det. Waters: Again, I told ya I certainly appreciate you coming here and talking to us, spending a lot of time here. Mark Castellano: Well I want Michelle to be found.\n\nI want Michelle to be found. That's what Castellano just said. That's his story and he's sticking to it:\n\nDet. Waters: Have you tried to call her? Mark Castellano: At this point? No, I don't want to call her.\n\nThis was it. This was it, Waters told Smith. We had no evidence, we had nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Detective Waters started looking for motive. If Castellano was a killer, did something push him over the edge?\n\nDet. Waters: Pressure's building? Mark Castellano: The pressure's building on me, yes. When she gets mad, she's violent. She'll hit you, she thinks she has the right to ... you know, the man has to take up crap. She's a pretty girl and she gets everything she wants. She has that princess attitude.\n\nThat princess attitude phrase was a flag for detectives -- an insight into how Castellano viewed the relationship:\n\nDet. Waters: We kind of get a flavor of your relationship. And this is my impression -- is that when it's good, it's like intensely good. But when it is bad, it is intensely bad. Mark Castellano: Right.\n\nDetective Waters' approach? No tough questions - yet. He is trying to get Castellano to trust him:\n\nDet. Waters: Let's get to last Saturday, the 22nd. Mark Castellano: OK, she walks out and slams the door to her room ... and about, 10, 15 minutes later I open the door to say, Well, you know what and she's gone.\n\nShe's gone.\n\nOnce that narrative was complete, and he felt like he had told his story, it was at that point that - I'm now gonna confront you, Waters told Smith.\n\nThis is a dance, Waters continued. And I'm letting Mark play the music. And then at one point, another song comes on and it's mine, and now the dance changes.\n\nWaters tells Castellano: I need you to explain to me what happened. ... We both know, we both know, Michelle did not walk out of that apartment.\n\nTHE CONFESSION\n\nDetective Fil Waters sat for hours talking to Mark Castellano, gaining his trust:\n\nMark Castellano: I don't love her. I'm not in love her. I don't want anything to happen to her. I wish Michelle would pop up right now. When she gets mad she's violent I don't care what anybody she says, she is. I said something about you take too many pills, you can't watch Cayden or something. She's like, I can't tolerate Cayden. She's like, I need help with him. She's like, he's driving me nuts.\n\nWaters finally discovered a way to bring out the truth about what happened that night: he brought up Cayden.\n\nDet. Waters: So your concern for Cayden is mainly centered on when Michelle is the primary - caregiver. Mark Castellano: Right.\n\nCayden was the most important part of his life, Waters told Smith, so I knew that I was going to have to frame whatever he did in that apartment in that context.\n\nThat context -- getting Castellano to admit his actions that night were to protect Cayden:\n\nDet. Waters: It wasn't about hurting Michelle. It was about the love and the strength of that love that you have for Cayden and protecting him from anybody that would threaten to hurt him. And that's what you're gonna have to explain now.\n\nThe strategy worked.\n\nDet. Waters: So I want you to be honest with me and tell me what happened.\n\nWhen he took off his glasses, I went -- here it comes, Waters told Smith. I just knew it.\n\nMark Castellano: She's getting dressed. And she's finishing up and she's still yelling and Cayden's hiding. I grabbed her and I broke her neck.\n\nBoom. There he comes with it, Waters told Smith.\n\nMark Castellano [in tears]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. F-----g give me the death penalty, that's fine. I deserve it. Det. Waters: Mark, Mark look, I'm proud of you. Mark Castellano: My life's over with anyway. Det. Waters: Your life's not over with, Mark.\n\nSergeant Harris came into the room and Castellano physically demonstrated how he killed Michelle:\n\nMark Castellano: Then I grab her, and then at about that I'm facing the bed and then I fall on top of her and crush her windpipe.\n\nCastellano demonstrated several times how he strangled Michelle Warner, even pushing Sgt. Harris onto the tabletop to show how he spent one-and-a-half to two minutes choking her.\n\nMark Castellano demonstrates what happened the night Michelle Warner died. Houston Police Department\n\n\n\n\n\nCastellano claimed Michelle's erratic and abusive behavior pushed him over the edge.\n\nMark Castellano: She'll hit you; she thinks she has the right to.\n\nHe painted this picture of Michelle as an abusive woman, Smith said. When you talk to other people did they say that she was volatile? She had a temper? She was abusive?\n\nEveryone we talked to, not just family members, described her as a loving mother, said Harris.\n\nWas there any evidence that Michelle was abusive to Mark?\n\nNot anything that was documented ... other than Marks story, Waters replied.\n\nAfter his confession, Castellano is left alone with his phone. Instead of calling a lawyer, he called his parents: Hey Mom. Well, I confessed. I did it.\n\nHe called his brother: I'm sorry for all he façade I put up for a week, but I can't take the guilt anymore.\n\nHe called a friend: And I wanted you to know that she's dead.\n\nHe even talked with Dr. Phil's producer: It was a moment of rage, I just - I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nMark Castellano to Det. Waters: I pretty much confessed to everybody I could think of.\n\nCastellano had also told Detective Waters what happened moments after he killed Michelle -- as he stood over her body, lying on the bed.\n\nHe said that Cayden walked in and said, 'What's wrong with Mommy?' Waters said. And he turned around and his response was, 'Mommy's taking a nap.'\n\nCastellano put Cayden in a bath, and then dragged Michelle's body into the closet.\n\nSoon after, he loaded Cayden into Michelle's car and drove through the night, over 500 miles, to West Texas.\n\nHe left Cayden with his parents, turned around and drove all the way back to Houston -- back to the apartment where he had left Michelle.\n\nHow did he get her out of the building? Smith asked Waters.\n\nHe packaged her up in a large container, plastic container, and duct taped her hands and feet, put a bag over her head, he replied. He explained he put a bag over her head 'cause he was tired of looking at her.\n\nWith the container loaded in the backseat of Michelle's car, Castellano once again made that long drive back to West Texas. Outside of Midland, he buried Michelle in a shallow grave.\n\nIt turned out Michelle's body was somewhere out in the endless West Texas oil fields. Castellano had drawn a map and given police a rough idea of where the grave was. But it wasn't a good enough description. The key to finding Michelle's body was as close as an iPhone.\n\nHarris and Walters stayed in Houston with Castellano, while local police and FBI agents tried to locate Michelle's body with the map. But it only got them in the general vicinity.\n\nSo they called us in the interview room and we decided to try the FaceTime, said Harris.\n\nFaceTime is the Apple iPhone's video phone app. You can see and hear whatever the person on the other end of the line wants to show you.\n\nMark was actually speaking to the detectives and they were holding their phone out, Harris explained via FaceTime. They tried to follow it like a treasure map.\n\nJust walking around aiming it, said Smith.\n\nCorrect. And so they panned the area and then he told them to stop and he directed 'em towards - it was like more of a big scrub brush, Harris said. When they got closer, that's when the FBI agent -- we could hear her say, 'I found her, I found her.'\n\nWith the discovery of Michelle's body, Castellano was finally arrested and charged with murder eight days after she went missing.\n\nDr. Phil McGraw's show went on TV a few days later.\n\nUntil Castellano's confession, Cayden had been staying with his relatives. But now, authorities moved him in with Michelle's family.\n\nWhen 48 Hours caught up with Castellano behind bars, there were a few other things he wanted us to know, including a brand new version of what happened that night -- a 180-degree turnaround.\n\nCASTELLANO'S OTHER STORY\n\nFrom the start, Mark Castellano had told everyone lies. So 48 Hours' Correspondent Tracy Smith wanted to set the ground rules before their interview.\n\nSo here's the thing Mark. You lied to the cops, you lied to Dr. Phil, you lied to your parents ... why should we believe you now? Smith asked.\n\nWhat's the -- there's no point to lie about anything, Castellano replied. I don't like lying. I don't like lying at all. It's not me. I'd rather just go ahead and tell the truth and get it over with.\n\nAre you telling me the truth now? Smith asked.\n\nYes. Of course I'm telling you the truth, he said.\n\nThe first thing Castellano wanted to tell 48 Hours was that he was not a murderer.\n\nWe got into a fight it just - it just happened all wrong, he told Smith. It wasn't, you know, not my finest hour.\n\nNot your finest hour?\n\nNo, said Castellano.\n\nWhy do you say that? Smith asked.\n\nWell, I mean the whole thing wasn't my finest hour, Castellano replied.\n\nHe says yes, it was true -- the couple had a fight that night, but he was the victim.\n\nAsked if it got violent, Castellano said, Oh yeah, they always get violent. She beats the hell out of me. ...I've been beaten by this woman for a long time.\n\nBut this time Castellano says he'd had enough. Remember - there's never been an official report of abuse in this case.\n\nSo, did you just snap? Smith asked.\n\n...to, to retaliate back from her swinging at me? Yeah, he replied. I snapped or hit her back ... this time I was tired of being hit ... and yeah, then I was gonna defend myself this time around.\n\nSo you threw stuff back and forth and then you grabbed her, said Smith.\n\nI didn't grab her yet. She threw another punch at me, Castellano said. That's when I grabbed her and lunged forward.\n\nThis is where Castellano's story changes from his confession to police:\n\nMark Castellano to Det. Waters: I grabbed her and I broke her neck.\n\nSo I want to go back to this confession. What actually happened that night? Smith asked.\n\nThat's what we're not going to talk about, Castellano's lawyer interrupted, telling him not to reveal all of what happened that night.\n\nStill, he did tell 48 Hours a few details. Castellano now says it was all an accident. In the struggle, he says, Michelle died when he ended up falling on top of her neck.\n\nMichelle's death was my fault because ... I'm the one that fell on her, said Castellano.\n\nThat fell on her, Smith repeated.\n\nYes, I did fall on her. I mean, she just, like that, I mean she was just lifeless, Castellano said, snapping his head back. And all of a sudden you know, her body let go ... and it was an accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle's mother, Donna Malone, can barely contain her disgust.\n\nFirst of all, I will never believe it was just an accident, she said. You just don't on accident murder someone and feel nothing.\n\nWhen you drive a car and you hit somebody, did you want to hit them, no. You're like, 'It was an accident. ...' You might be at someone's house and they just had brand new carpet put in and you're eating velvet cake and you dropped in on the floor. Did you want to do it, no. Do you feel bad about it, yes. But still, accidents are still accidents, they are not planned. That's why they're called accidents, Castellano went on, shedding a tear.\n\nThat tear was the only time during the interview that Castellano showed any emotion.\n\nHe's a liar, Malone said. Comparing it to spilling cake on someone's floor? To murder someone, that's a violent act.\n\nDid you choke her? Smith asked Castellano.\n\nNo, I didn't choke her, he replied.\n\nBut you said you were angry.\n\nOh, I was very angry.\n\nYou said you snapped, Smith continued.\n\nYeah, and to go ahead and actually raise my hands against her, Castellano said. I had a gun. I've always had a 9mm. If I really wanted to kill Michelle, I would have shot her. ...I would have taken my gun and shot her.\n\nThat he could just have shot her if he wanted to kill her, that's just nonsense talk. It's nonsense, said Malone.\n\nWhat did you do with Michelle's body, Smith asked.\n\nUmmm, it stayed, it stayed, ummm, it stayed in the closet. You know ... I looked at her and it was just like 'Oh, my god.' So that's when I put the bag over her head and I put her in the closet.\n\nWhy the bag over her head? Smith asked.\n\nBecause, just her face -- the way it was frozen, Castellano told Smith. I knew I messed up.\n\nDid it occur to you as you were handling her body that this was the woman that you loved? That this was the mother of your child? Smith pressed.\n\nI did I did. And I also know I couldn't bring her back, he said.\n\nThree days later, Castellano would dump Michelle's lifeless body in that shallow grave.\n\nAsked how he feels about misleading people for so long, Castellano told Smith, Well, it was a tough call. ...It was a very tough call. ...I didn't plan on getting away with this. If I had planned on getting away with this, I would have gotten away with it.\n\nI feel very angry about the fact that Mark lied to all of us. He could have just told the truth from the beginning. It was obvious that everyone was onto him -- family, law enforcement. Why not just tell the truth, get it over with, said Malone.\n\nShe did attack me first, Castellano told Smith.\n\nThe more Mark Castellano talked, the more it seemed he was angry with women.\n\nI mean that's just a fact. Women are now -- y'all are replacing men in a lot of aspects. Ya'll are becoming big time aggressors, he said. Women are now the new aggressors.\n\nShe was beautiful, and you're a beautiful woman yourself. Life's a little easier for women like you, because people can't put bad things with pretty people, Castellano continued.\n\nIt sounds like you resent that a little bit, Mark, Smith commented.\n\nWell, when you sit there and have been told that when you're are not a pretty person, that, ya know, life's gonna suck for you... he replied.\n\nMark Castellano's bizarre answers during 48 Hours' jailhouse interview raised more questions about what makes him tick. So we wanted to talk more about it with Dr. Phil McGraw.\n\nMark Castellano to Tracy Smith: I gotta say I really screwed myself over the way I confessed everything. And because, first of all, I didn't really describe everything accurately, and second of all, I didn't really think every word was going to be used completely out of context, which it was in a lot of ways.\n\nHe's criticizing the process. Things were taken out of context. Here's the context: did you kill her? Or did you not? I think this guy has such an inferiority complex and that's one of the things about narcissism. There's a false sense of superiority, but it's a false sense of superiority, McGraw said as he and Smith watched the interview.\n\nThe truth is, they really feel inferior, said Smith.\n\nThey really feel very inferior, very put upon. And he felt very much that he had reached above his level with Michelle, said McGraw.\n\nThat she was out of his league, so to speak, Smith noted.\n\nOut of his league. She was way over his head. In this instance, she did not reject him. He had the ultimate rejection of her, said McGraw.\n\nWhat do you think his motive was? Smith asked.\n\nI think this guy is very hedonistic, McGraw replied. I think this relationship was on the down slope. I think it was falling apart. And I think he felt her slipping away. ...I think it was one of those situations where, 'If I can't have you, nobody will.'\n\n\n\n\n\nAt his trial, Castellano's attorneys will present his new version of what he says is the truth. Will the jury buy it?\n\nFACING A JURY\n\nIt was very hard to wait on the trial. We wanted some form of justice for Michelle, Donna Malone, said. We felt that we were building up to this pinnacle ... that would bring us some sort of peace.\n\nMay 27, 2014. Mark Castellano is on trial for the murder of Michelle Warner, the mother of their son, Cayden.\n\nThis is a case about obsession, rage, and this defendant's calculated attempts to get away with murder, Assistant District Attorney Jamie Reyna told the court in her opening. He became so upset with Michelle, that he grabbed her by the neck ... that he started to choke her, he started to squeeze her neck. You'll hear him tell those officers he choked her for one-and-a-half to two minutes.\n\nAt the center of the prosecution's case - Castellano's own words -- that videotaped confession to Detective Waters:\n\nDet. Waters[interrogation]: We both know Michelle didn't walk out of that apartment. So I want you to be honest with me, and tell me what happened... Mark Castellano: I grabbed her and I broke her neck.\n\nThe state medical examiner testifies Michelle was strangled. Her hyoid bone, just beneath her jaw, was broken.\n\nMark Castellano does not take the stand. Instead, his lawyer presents that very different story: Michelle's death was an accident.\n\n...she comes at him, he grabs her, he's controlling her and he falls down with his weight on hers and hears a pop. When he reached out to defend himself to protect himself. He didn't anticipate that she would fall down and break her neck, defense attorney Eric Davis told jurors.\n\nAn expert for the defense, a forensic engineer, testifies Castellano's accident story was a possibility.\n\nI didn't find any real evidence that the throat was disturbed, John Charles Laughlin testified. There's no physical evidence that shows any type of squeezing or sideways forces. All of the physical evidence shows is forces applied from the front.\n\nSo what's the detectives' reaction to Castellano's defense?\n\nIs that possible that he fell on her and that's how her neck snapped? Smith asked Sgt. Brian Harris.\n\nNo, he replied.\n\nThe problem is that you cannot accidentally strangle someone for a minute-and-a half to two minutes, said Det. Fil Waters.\n\nShow me what you think he did, what he told you he did to Michelle. What did he do? Smith asked Harris.\n\nHe's so mad he follows her in the bedroom and he goes and whatever takes place, he reaches out and he's just grabbing her, for a minute-and-a-half or two. He's grabbing her, grabbing her, and she has nowhere to go, said Harris.\n\nIf Castellano thought the jury might take pity on him, prosecutors would present more evidence that shows the actions of a cold, callous killer.\n\nWeeks after Castellano's confession, detectives discovered a chilling piece of surveillance video taken by a camera on a building located across from his apartment.\n\nThe video showed a shadowy view of the back stairs of Castellano's apartment.\n\nSo he drags her body in a bin down the stairs, Smith said of the video, which shows a figure dragging something.\n\nYou see him stop. He has worn himself out, Waters explained. He even says when he's on the phone with people he's confessing to, 'You know, Michelle had gained a lot of weight.' So it was really an exercise to bring her down the steps and put her in the car.\n\nAs for those hard drives that seemed to be so important in the early days of the investigation? It turns out they weren't relevant to the case.\n\nAfter more than a week of testimony, 19 witnesses and six hours of deliberations, there's a verdict, ending an anxious wait for Michelle's family.\n\nMark Castellano is found guilty in the strangling death of Michelle Warner.\n\nI was very pleased with the fact that he was declared guilty, Malone said. I said, 'OK, good. They did this quickly... so I believe that this is in the hands of a good, solid jury and they'll do the right thing.'\n\nThe next day, Michelle's loved ones are back in court for Castellano's sentencing. Ironically, it's also Michelle's birthday. She would have turned 33.\n\nMark Castellano's attorney begs for mercy and argues his client's much-talked-about confession was a show of remorse.\n\nThe crime was solved because of a man's conscious. ...In fact, if Mr. Castellano had kept his mouth shut, we wouldn't be here ... But he did what most criminals don't do. He told on himself, Davis told the court. No matter what you do, he is going to the penitentiary. The question is how long?\n\nMichelle's family wants to see Castellano receive the harshest penalty: life in prison.\n\nI do not think that he has any sense of remorse. None, Malone said. I hear nothing but excuses that it was Michelle's fault that he did what he did and we all have free choice and he chose to kill her.\n\nThe jurors spend four hours debating his fate. Finally, a decision: Castellano is sentenced to 27 years.\n\nWhile Castellano mouths thank you to the jury, the sentence feels like a slap in the face for Michelle's family.\n\nOne word went through my mind when I heard 27 years -- seriously? Malone said following the decision.\n\nAfter several months, it is still impossible for the family to understand the jury's decision.\n\nI don't know what happened in the room while the deliberation was going on, because I've not -- had not one juror come forward and speak to me, Malone said. I do not feel that I got closure for my daughter's death, and neither does any of the rest of her family. None of us do.\n\nNow it is up to Michelle's family to explain to two kids -- a daughter living with her ex-husband and little Cayden -- why their mother is gone.\n\nIt's like taking your entire world and flipping it over, David Chaffin said of his sister's murder. You don't expect anything like that to ever hit that close to home for you ... and it's turmoil.\n\nMichelle Warner and her mother, Donna Malone Donna Malone\n\n\n\n\n\nI miss the laughter that I shared with her. ...And I just miss the conversation. I can't have that any more, Malone said. And that's very sad. It's very lonely. ... It makes me feel lonely. So it's an empty hole that will always be there, for the rest of my life. And that's a hard thing to swallow.\n\nMark Castellano will be eligible for parole in 2026, He will be 51 years old.
Produced by Josh Yager\n\n[This story first aired on March 30. It was updated on Aug. 17.]\n\nIn July 2008, Colonel Michael Stahlman was about to come home from Iraq for R&R with his family when the military lawyer and former flight officer was found in his quarters with a gunshot wound to the head. He died about two months later.\n\nAuthorities called it a suicide. But Stahlman's wife Kim and daughter MacKenna say the man they loved would never have killed himself.\n\nMy dad … devoted his life to his country. He was a patriot, said MacKenna.\n\nSomeone shot him, Kim told 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant.\n\nAre you certain of that? Van Sant asked.\n\nI have no doubt, she replied.\n\nKim Stahlman says her husband was right-handed, but his wound was on the left side -- and his job helping rebuild Iraq's legal system could easily have made him enemies.\n\nI just feel like it was somebody Mike knew, she said.\n\nAt the heart of the mystery: an email that was sent just hours before the gunshot:\n\nKim, sorry about what you are about the [sic] find out. I love you and always will. You and the girls are the best thing that ever happened to me. Love, Mike.\n\nBut was it really a suicide note?\n\nThe evidence shows there's no way he could have done what they said he did, Kim told Van Sant.\n\nAsked if she's in denial, Kim told Van Sant, No, no.\n\nKim started pushing the investigating agency, NCIS, for more information. And she soon enlisted some important allies: Cilla McCain, is an author and advocate for bereaved military families.\n\nI just do not believe that he pulled that trigger, said McCain.\n\nAnd Michael Maloney, is a forensic consultant who had once worked for NCIS.\n\nThis is a homicide. There was someone else in that room, he said.\n\nMaloney had left NCIS before the Stahlman incident, but NCIS hired blood stain expert Mark Reynolds.\n\nI see no evidence of homicide in the materials provided to me whatsoever, he told Van Sant.\n\nReynolds says Michael Maloney is guessing, or just plain wrong.\n\nThere's no evidence to support anything other than a suicide, Reynolds said.\n\nTwo experts, two very different views.\n\nIf this was a suicide, I would have to accept it Kim said. But it's hard when you know that that's not what it was. … the truth needs to come out.\n\nFIGHTING FOR THE TRUTH\n\nKim Stahlman: You have to be strong as a military wife.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Kim Stahlman has been at war. With a small group of allies, she is targeting the toughest hill in Washington D.C.—Capitol Hill\n\nKim Stahlman: All I've ever done is tell them that I want the truth.\n\nShe says she's trying to honor the legacy of her husband, Col. Michael Stahlman, one of the highest-ranking American fatalities in the Iraq War.\n\nKim Stahlman: This is a guy that gave his all.\n\nColonel Stahlman was a decorated Marine; a flight officer and a military lawyer. In July 2008, just weeks from going home for R&R, he was found with a gunshot wound to the head on a Ramadi military base. The Armed Forces Medical Examiner ruled it a suicide, but Kim has never believed her husband shot himself.\n\nKim Stahlman: It was not self-inflicted. Absolutely not. Someone shot him.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Someone shot him?\n\nKim Stahlman [affirms]: Mm-hmm.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Are you certain of that?\n\nKim Stahlman: I have no doubt.\n\nKim says her ultimate goal is to get that manner of death changed on the death certificate.\n\nKim Stahlman It's important to have the truth on that document … because of the man that Mike was.\n\nSuzanna Andrews | Reporter: He was just this all-American guy. … very confident, very decent.\n\nSuzanna Andrews and Mike Stahlman lived on the same block in Chevy Chase, Maryland, as teenagers.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: My mother still remembers him as the most polite child any of us ever brought home.\n\nDecades later, she wrote about his death as a contributing editor for More magazine.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: I started out wanting to know what had really happened.\n\nMike Stahlman, son of a U.S. diplomat, had lived in India, Jordan and Panama as a boy before returning home to become one of a few good men.\n\nMichael Stahlman, a decorated Marine, a flight officer and a military lawyer, was described as an All-American guy and poster boy for the Marines Kim Stahlman\n\nPeter Van Sant: Was there a pride there and a sense of I really wanna serve my country?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh yeah. … I mean, he's the one that elected to go to a Marine … military academy in the 9th grade.\n\nAs a cadet, Stahlman was a Marine recruiter's dream. He appeared in a promotional video.\n\nBy April of 1987, Michael Stahlman was in flight school in Pensacola, Florida, when he landed in a bar in Florence, South Carolina, and boldly approached a striking woman across the room.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what did you think when you looked at this guy?\n\nKim Stahlman: To be honest with you? … I didn't think anything, you know?\n\nBut she admits something about the swashbuckling young flight officer struck a chord - especially after they ran into each other again the next day at an air show.\n\nKim Stahlman: He came up to me, he said, You remember me? And I'm like ah, Yeah.\n\nStahlman offered to show her around, but she says he was quickly distracted by the triplet baby boys of someone she knew.\n\nKim Stahlman: And he stopped, and he got down on his knee and he was talking to the -- these triplets … And I thought, Oh, my God. That's someone special right there. And that's when I knew. I knew!\n\nIn less than three weeks, Kim and Mike's relationship took off.\n\nThis was my soulmate, Kim Stahlman said of her husband Michael. He'd done so much. He was worldly. He was kind. Kim Stahlman\n\nKim Stahlman: He rode his motorcycle up and that's when he proposed to me.\n\nPeter Van Sant: The guy has Hollywood good looks. He's a pilot. And he's riding a motorcycle. This is like Top Gun.\n\nKim Stahlman: He sold his motorcycle for my -- first ring, too. He was a gem.\n\nThey married six months later. Two daughters followed: MacKenna in 1997, and Piper in 2004.\n\nMacKenna is 21 now and still remembers her father's kind heart.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: During Christmas it was his duty -- was the cameraman. … We'd wake up and we're, like, Don't go in the room until Dad has the camera ready. And -- that was probably one of the earliest memories I have.\n\nLike many military families, the Stahlmans moved around the world: South Carolina, California, and Japan, where Kim says she co-founded a counseling program on the base.\n\nKim Stahlman: We worked specifically with rape victims and spousal abuse victims.\n\nMike's career was on the move, too. By the early 1990s, he'd traded in his wings for a law degree. Kim says all the work and travel took a toll.\n\nKim Stahlman: We moved every two -- sometimes every year.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is it fair to say there was some trouble in the marriage?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh, yeah. We have ups and downs like everybody else.\n\nAfter about 20 years of high-stress military life, Mike Stahlman had risen through the ranks to become a full colonel.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: He was about to retire.\n\nBut there still was one thing Col. Stahlman wanted to do. He'd never been deployed to a combat zone.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: He volunteered.\n\nKim Stahlman: This is his last hurrah, you know. He wants to do this.\n\nAbout three months after he arrived in Iraq, something happened to Michael Stahlman – something that even a Marine's family could never have expected.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: My mom … sat me down. And she was, like, Something's happened to your father.\n\nA CRYPTIC EMAIL\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: We would receive incoming every now and then. There'd be shots fired.\n\nIn July 2008, Gary Morrell was a Marine gunnery sergeant in Iraq when he picked Col. Michael Stahlman up at the airport.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Good guy?\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Good -- oh, awesome, outstanding.\n\nColonel Stahlman would be stationed at Camp Ramadi. The area had seen some of the fiercest fighting earlier in the war.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: The front gate is still getting shot at, vehicles getting hit … it's still a rough area.\n\nDay-to-day life was tough. But Morell says Col. Stahlman, who was working to help rebuild Iraq's legal system, stood strong.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you ever sense that he was depressed?\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Oh, never.\n\nA triathlete, Stahlman was known to work out every morning.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: He was always such a happy man. I don't ever recall him being upset or sad. I don't remember him crying, ever.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did Mike have any history of depression?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\nCol. Michael Stahlman Kim Stahlman\n\nBy the summer of 2008, Kim says Mike was looking forward to coming home for R&R to spend time with her and the girls.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: We were so close. I mean it was the home stretch.\n\nIn June, he emailed: …just 2 more months until I come home. Missing you terribly!!! and in late July, the day before the shooting: …everything is great!\n\nSgt. Morell saw Stahlman the night before the shooting.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: He was anxious to go home, he was ready.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: In the morning he wakes up. He goes running, we believe.\n\nDave Fuentes: I was … talking to some of the other medics, when the call came in.\n\nArmy Medic Dave Fuentes says he was just coming off shift at about 8 a.m., when he responded to a shooting scene.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What condition was Colonel Stahlman in when you first laid eyes on him?\n\nDave Fuentes: He was in very rough shape.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Critical condition?\n\nDave Fuentes: Absolutely 100 percent critical.\n\nIt was still the previous night back in Connecticut, where Kim and the kids were visiting her parents. At about 11 p.m., she says she found a cryptic email in her inbox – apparently from her husband. The email became central to this case.\n\nKim Stahlman [reading email]: Kim, sorry about … what you are about to find out. I love you and always will. You and the girls are the best thing that ever happened to me. Love Mike.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did you think?\n\nKim Stahlman: Honestly, I immediately thought one of our close friends had been killed.\n\nThe next morning, Kim got a devastating phone call.\n\nKim Stahlman: They said -- We're calling … to inform you that your husband, Colonel Michael Ross Stahlman, was found this morning … with a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his left temple.\n\nHer husband was still alive, but unconscious.\n\nKim Stahlman: It was like they took my past, my present and my future from me in that one phone call.\n\nKim says she was in shock. To some, that last email to her read like a suicide note. Kim had the email examined by a linguist.\n\nKim Stahlman: She said, This is not a suicide note.\n\nSgt. Morell says he doesn't see it as a suicide note, either. He says Marines are trained to avoid divulging too much information when writing home from war zones.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You gotta talk in code … This is something that I could see me sending my wife and I felt I've sent her that letter before.\n\nHe says the email could have been a reference to any number of things, including a dangerous or classified military operation or personal finances.\n\nKim Stahlman: All I could think of, his eyes. His beautiful eyes.\n\nA few days later, Kim and her daughters arrived at Mike's bedside at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, where he'd been flown for treatment.\n\nKim Stahlman: And I walked in the room and it didn't even look like him. His face was so swollen.\n\nDays turned into weeks with no improvement. Slowly Michael Stahlman was slipping away.\n\nAfter Mike had been in the hospital about two months, Kim decided to sit 11-year-old MacKenna down to say her father would be taken off life support.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: And she was like … we're not detecting any more brain waves … and that's when I had to lay in bed with him and say goodbye for the last time. … I just remember, like, the lights being dimmed, and I can still smell the hospital room [cries].\n\nThe Stahlman family Kim Stahlman\n\nColonel Michael Stahlman died on Oct. 5, 2008, the day before his 21st wedding anniversary and the month before his 46th birthday.\n\nKim Stahlman: I've never seen anyone die before. … I literally saw his spirit leave his body.\n\nHis funeral was at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: It was a closed casket. I just was hysterical pretty much the whole day.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Kim says she was still troubled by the information authorities had given her -- beginning with the detail that Mike, a righty, had been shot on the left side of his head.\n\nKim Stahlman: Mike did nothing with his left hand.\n\nAs time went on, her skepticism turned to anger and determination to find the truth.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You became an investigator.\n\nKim Stahlman: Yeah.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Kim said right away, I wanna do my own investigation.\n\nWriter Suzanna Andrews says Col. Stahlman's job easily could have made him a murder target.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Mike was in Iraq at a time when we were trying to sort of put the country back on its feet after the war.\n\nColonel Stahlman's work notes suggest he was aware of local officials on the take. He wrote: We want to stop IP's [Iraqi Police] from taking bribes. And Andrews says some U.S. contractors were corrupt.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: I think it would be really … hard to … have not stumbled across some kind of corruption there.\n\nSgt. Morell says Marines were vulnerable everywhere -- even on base.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You know, our perimeter was very open.\n\nHe says the security fences were a joke.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You could get on and get off.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, somebody from the outside could just come onto base.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Correct.\n\nKim says it's also possible Col. Stahlman had enemies closer than he thought.\n\nPeter Van Sant: If Mike did not take his own life, who did?\n\nKim Stahlman: Gut instinct is … it was somebody Mike knew and close in rank.\n\nPeter Van Sant: If you believe it's a homicide … somebody had to pull that trigger.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Right.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Give me a sense of the banter that was going' around.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: That it was somebody inside. You know, strictly all rumors.\n\nMedic Dave Fuentes says he remembers hearing rumors, too, about a crime at a nearby facility – a crime he heard Michael Stahlman may have been investigating.\n\nDave Fuentes: A couple other high-ranking personnel … had been relieved of duty due to -- stealing fuel from post and selling it to the locals.\n\nBy a year after the shooting, Kim Stahlman had decided to go on the offensive. And before long, she had some very influential allies.\n\nMike Maloney | Former NCIS: All of the evidence that I have, and all of the reconstruction I've done, point to this being a homicide, and absolutely not to being a suicide.\n\nA QUEST BEGINS\n\nAfter her husband's death, Kim Stahlman was paralyzed by grief.\n\nKim Stahlman: It's like a punch in the stomach…\n\nKim Stahlman: … he loved his girls. He wouldn't have left 'em\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: She was basically a recluse. She never left the house. And it was really rough seeing her like that.\n\nKim emerged from her fog of grief and began a quest for the facts about her husband's death. In October 2008, she filed a Freedom of Information request with NCIS, which had arrived at the scene some hours after Stahlman was found. Kim says she received about 1,500 documents and a small batch of photos.\n\nThe military says that my husband committed suicide, but I know it was murder, Kim Stahlman told 48 Hours. CBS News\n\nKim Stahlman: They didn't really show you anything. You know? And they were copies of copies. Like the photocopies.\n\nScouring the reports, Kim says she learned her husband had been found in bed, lying on his back, next to a bloodstained nightstand. A bloodied sheet was hanging from the top bunk obscuring his body. A Bible and family photo lay next to him. Stahlman's 9 mm Beretta was on the bed, too. One first responder noted the gun appeared wedged between him and the mattress.\n\nInvestigators took photos of Michael Stahlman's quarters in Ramadi, Iraq, after he was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Responders found Stahlman in his bed [bottom bunk] with a sheet hanging down from the top bunk, obscuring him from view. Evidence photo\n\nSuzanna Andrews: The gun is half under him around his waist but pointed down.\n\nAccording to NCIS documents, a bullet from his gun traveled through his head, then through a wall and came to rest on the floor of a storage locker in the housing unit next door. An earwitness had reported hearing a loud noise around sunrise. The information did not satisfy Kim.\n\nKim Stahlman: There were little flags, things that jumped out at me.\n\nBelieving the suicide determination had been made in haste, Kim says she wanted a closer investigation of the case. In the coming years, she would contact the military, members of Congress, and even the White House.\n\nKim Stahlman: I was looking … for anything any – any help I could get.\n\nSince the shooting, Kim had been fighting her war alone. But in 2009, she met an important ally: author Cilla McCain.\n\nCilla McCain: She was grieving, totally grief stricken, but fighting.\n\nMcCain has a special interest in mysterious military deaths. She supports the families with a website and advocates for them with lawmakers.\n\nCilla McCain: I know of 166 families who believe that their loved one was murdered and it has been labeled a suicide.\n\nTogether, Kim and McCain say they took on the U.S. military.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Here was this duo, these Southern women … up against this brass wall. You know, all these officers and soldiers and institutions who just didn't take them seriously at all.\n\nBefore long, word of their war would win them another important ally. This one had a worldwide reputation investigating cases at, of all places, NCIS itself.\n\nMike Maloney | Former NCIS: If it bled, if it blew up, if it caught fire … generally, we were involved in handling the forensic issues of that.\n\nOver a long career at NCIS, Michael Maloney investigated some of their highest-profile cases. He'd left NCIS and was teaching forensics when a student told him about the Stahlman case. He offered to take an initial look pro bono, but gave Kim a warning.\n\nMichael Maloney: Almost 100 percent of the time the death is exactly what it's reported to be.\n\nMaloney wanted better quality photos and thought authorities might have them. So, he helped Kim file another Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nKim Stahlman: There were almost 200 photos on that disc. If I hadn't asked for those, they woulda never volunteered 'em.\n\nMaloney says those photos led to a breakthrough.\n\nMichael Maloney: It changed the whole game.\n\nPoring over the new photos, Maloney reached a startling conclusion.\n\nMichael Maloney: This is a homicide … There was someone else in that room.\n\nHe believes an assailant probably fired two shots: one missed and the other went through Stahlman's head. He also believes the scene then could have been made to look like Stahlman had been alone and shot himself with his own gun.\n\nKim Stahlman: All I remember is him sayin', We've got a problem. This was staged.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And when you heard those words?\n\nKim Stahlman: It was like, Oh, holy Jesus. I'm right.\n\nMaloney set up a simulation for 48 Hours to help illustrate his theory: the trajectory of the bullet authorities recovered in the locker does not account for Col. Stahlman's injury.\n\nWhy is the trajectory of the bullet way up here and his injury is here? Michael Maloney asked, pointing to a diagram. They should overlap each other. Because the bullet has to cause the injury. CBS News\n\nMichael Maloney [pointing to top of a graph]: Why is the trajectory of the bullet way up here and his injury is here? [pointing to bottom area of graph]. They should overlap each other. Because the bullet has to cause the injury.\n\nIn his theory, Maloney says the bullet hole in the wall likely came from the assailant's first shot -- a shot that Maloney believes missed Col. Stahlman. Evidence photo\n\nMaloney says the bullet hole in the wall, as seen in the investigator's photo, likely came from the assailant's first shot.\n\nMichael Maloney: For the first shot, he's going to fire and he's going to miss. That explains the hole in the wall.\n\nHe says what he sees around that hole is a telltale sign that the bullet never went through Stahlman's head.\n\nMichael Maloney: It has the appearance of gunshot residue.\n\nPeter Van Sant: All these little dots\n\nMichael Maloney: All those little dots --\n\nPeter Van Sant: This could be gunshot residue –\n\nMichael Maloney: Burned … and unburned particles of gunpowder coming out of the muzzle of the weapon.\n\nMichael Maloney points to what he believe is gunshot residue in a photo taken by investigators CBS News\n\nIn his interpretation, those particles would be unlikely to have hit that area of the wall, if Col. Stahlman's head had been in the way of the bullet.\n\nMichael Maloney: This is when I began to believe that, perhaps, this wasn't the shot. This wasn't the fatal shot.\n\nThe fatal shot, says Maloney, would have been the second one.\n\nMichael Maloney: And as he [Stahlman] starts to move, the shooter is going to rock up as well and right in here, the shooter can fire as well.\n\nHe believes the bullet may have come to rest in the mattress, though that alleged second bullet has never been found. Maloney thinks he knows why.\n\nPeter Van Sant: All of this was destroyed, correct?\n\nMichael Maloney: All of this was burned as a biohazard, yes.\n\nMichael Maloney: Now let's look at that nightstand.\n\nThe bloody nightstand, says Maloney, supports his theory, too, because he says the stains only cover certain areas --\n\nMichael Maloney [pointing to evidence photo]: But we have none in this area or this area.\n\n-- leaving unstained sections called voids.\n\nMichael Maloney: There was something blocking the blood from hitting this surface of the nightstand.\n\nThat something, he says, could have been the assailant's body.\n\nMichael Maloney: Someone sitting on the nightstand, facing his bed.\n\nAnd Maloney says there's more evidence Stahlman may not have been alone. He says it looks to him like a woman could have been in the room.\n\nMichael Maloney: Well, there was a … tampon found on the floor.\n\nThere also was a dirty strip of fabric nearby.\n\nMichael Maloney: It … certainly would have the appearance of a sheer bathrobe tie or something like that.\n\nPeter Van Sant: There has been speculation that … Mike Stahlman perhaps had a girlfriend there.\n\nMichael Maloney: Well … what you propose is well within the realm of possibility.\n\nKim Stahlman [negates]: No. Uh-uh.\n\nPeter Van Sant: A one-night stand with someone?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. I would have known, I think.\n\nBut either way, Maloney says the strongest evidence supporting his theory of homicide is that sheet hanging over Stahlman's bed. It had blood on both sides. But, he says, what's most important is a particular type of stain called misting.\n\nMichael Maloney [looking at a photo of the bloody sheet ]: Look at this misting … The problem is, this on the outside of the sheet. … this tells me that this side of the sheet had to be facing or oriented towards his injuries at the time they occurred.\n\nHe says if the sheet was hanging down during the shooting, as it was found by first responders, the misting stains would have been on the inside. Maloney demonstrated for 48 Hours.\n\nMichael Maloney: A lot of times when you are over there, you do drop a sheet … It blocks the light coming in from the windows. But, if you want to talk to someone, you can just pull the sheet back, and tuck it up.\n\nMaloney demonstrated by tucking the sheet into the springs of the overhead bunk.\n\nThe bloodstains at the scene, he says, strongly suggest the sheet was tucked up, out of the way, when the fatal shot was fired.\n\nMichael Maloney [demonstrating in simulation]: …and it causes the bloodstain up here, the bloodstain pattern here, the misting stain, and the rest of the bloodstain from the exit wound goes down into the pillow and into the mattress.\n\nRemember, the mattress was destroyed.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How about the sheets and the blood?\n\nKim Stahlman: Burnt. Everything.\n\nKim Stahlman filed a lawsuit in 2013, alleging authorities conducted little or no investigation into various aspects of the scene.\n\nCilla McCain: They did not follow their own protocols, and that's why this has happened.\n\nA federal judge dismissed the case saying the court had no jurisdiction. So, Kim filed again with a military review board. Her lawyer says the board offered no assistance either.\n\nMichael Maloney: This required a thorough investigation. It didn't get one.\n\nMichael Maloney says he sent his 2011 report to his old employer, NCIS, and says they refused to meet with him about his findings. They declined to give 48 Hours an on-camera interview.\n\nBut there is another side to this story.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Kim, it turns out that NCIS did do a forensic investigation … We have some clips … that we would like you to listen to.\n\nTWO EXPERTS, TWO CONCLUSIONS\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you believe that NCIS ever did a proper forensic examination of the shooting scene?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. No.\n\n48 Hours submitted its own Freedom of Information Act request, and we discovered it's not quite that simple.\n\nMark Reynolds: My name is Dr. Mark Reynolds. I'm a forensic consultant and I investigated the, ah, death of Colonel Stahlman.\n\nDr. Mark Reynolds was brought on by NCIS in 2012 to review the case more than three years after the shooting, including Michael Maloney's report.\n\nNCIS gave the veteran homicide investigator and bloodstain pattern expert permission to speak with 48 Hours.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you have everything you needed?\n\nMark Reynolds: I -- the short answer is no. … I was quite critical of the response by NCIS in my report about the scene.\n\nReynolds told 48 Hours he concurs with Michael Maloney that the shooting scene should have been handled differently.\n\nMark Reynolds: A better documentation of the scene and better exhibit collection would've been helpful … and it wasn't done.\n\nHe says that's partly because Col. Stahlman was still alive when he was found. So, first responders rightly were focused more on stabilizing him than preserving evidence. But Reynolds disagrees with Maloney on just about everything else.\n\nMark Reynolds: All the scene indicators that Mr. Maloney has raised -- are either equivocal or wrong.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Mike Maloney has a great reputation. … So, we're supposed to believe, in this particular case, the man doesn't know what he's talking about?\n\nMark Reynolds: In this particular case, believe the science. And the science is there.\n\nReynolds says Maloney based many of his conclusions on speculation. He says his own analysis of photos of the bloodstains, the nightstand, the sheet, the bullet hole and the trajectory, yielded no evidence anyone else was involved in Stahlman's death. Reynolds says the unstained area on the nightstand is too narrow to be meaningful.\n\nMark Reynolds [looking at a photo of the nightstand]: If Mr. Maloney is suggesting that that … might've been the leg of the attacker … it's three inches … That's a fairly thin leg.\n\nAnd what about that sheet hanging from the bunk above Stahlman's bed, the one that Michael Maloney claims has bloodstain misting on the wrong side?\n\nMark Reynolds: Transfer bloodstains look like spatter even under the microscope.\n\nReynolds says the bloodstains could have been transferred there by first responders.\n\nPeter Van Sant: In your opinion, there's nothing conclusive about this blood issue on the sheet?\n\nMark Reynolds: No.\n\nAnd he says the same is true of the gray spots near the bullet hole, which Maloney suspects are gunshot residue.\n\nMark Reynolds: It was never determined. There was no sampling ever done. To go from a grayish particulate matter on a wall … to extrapolate that as being gunshot residue I think is very dangerous leap. It could've been anything on that wall.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You don't even go to this potential two-shot scenario?\n\nMark Reynolds: There's no scientific evidence to say two shots were fired.\n\nDocuments indicate authorities did check the mattress for a bullet and didn't find one. And Mark Reynolds says Michael Maloney made miscalculations in analyzing photos of the scene. He says when those errors are corrected, the path of the bullet that went through the wall does line up with Col. Stahlman's head wound.\n\nMark Reynolds believes Michael Maloney made miscalculations in analyzing photos of the scene. Reynolds says when those errors are corrected, the path of the bullet that went through the wall does line up with Col. Stahlman's head wound.\n\nMark Reynolds [showing the diagram]: Did you get that?\n\nPeter Van Sant: That matches.\n\nMark Reynolds: That matches.\n\nBut what about the curious items on the floor? Like that piece of fabric that Maloney feels could have belonged to a woman?\n\nMark Reynolds: Pure speculation.\n\nAnd that tampon?\n\nMark Reynolds: Many soldiers around the world carry tampons in case they get shot because they put the tampon in the bullet hole and it stems the flow of blood.\n\nReynold's conclusion?\n\nMark Reynolds: There is no obvious scientific evidence to indicate that it was a homicide.\n\n48 Hours informed Michael Maloney about Mark Reynolds' findings. Maloney insists Reynolds is wrong.\n\nMichael Maloney: I stand by my assertion that the best explanation given the evidence that I've examined, does not indicate suicide.\n\nTwo experts, two very different conclusions.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Have you ever heard of a man by the name of Mark Reynolds?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Never?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\n48 Hours wanted to see what Kim Stahlman thought of Mark Reynolds' findings.\n\nPeter Van Sant [with Kim]: We have some clips from the interview that we did with Mark Reynolds that we would like you to listen to.\n\n48 Hours showed Kim Van Sant's interviews with Reynolds on an iPad:\n\nPETER VAN SANT [looking at a photo of Col. Stahlman's bunk]: Mike Maloney says at best, this is an ambiguous death scene. MARK REYNOLDS: My interpretation of this is there's strong contextual and scientific support for it being self-inflicted. There is no contextual or scientific support in my opinion for it being a homicide.\n\nPETER VAN SANT: And the fact that it's on the outside of the sheet, when the shooting occurred on the inside ... is an indication that someone pulled the sheet down. MARK REYNOLDS: I think he doesn't understand how difficult it is to classify bloodstains on fabrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Stahlman [reacting to the video]: Yeah, I mean, I guess he's got his opinion. I don't know what to say.\n\nKim says she brought the case to other experts who supported Maloney's findings, and she still stands by Maloney.\n\nKim Stahlman: I know that Maloney broke down the room pixel by pixel -- that's all I know.\n\nAnd Kim is furious. She says authorities should have showed her the Reynolds report years ago.\n\nKim Stahlman [emotional]: Why didn't they show me that? Or tell me so that I could at least know. I don't understand why NCIS did not bring that to my attention, ever.\n\nKim says she has never felt authorities have respected her. In fact, in 2012, she says she discovered an email showing someone at NCIS appears to have blamed her for her husband's death.\n\nPeter Van Sant [reading the email]: It was a tragic suicide contributed by the pressures he was under to include stress piled on by his wife, who now believes/pretends it was a storybook marriage …\n\nKim Stahlman: I never said it was a storybook marriage. Never. … I have said it was a marriage with ups and downs.\n\nAs 48 Hours discovered in his emails, Col. Michael Stahlman may have been battling an enemy within.\n\nWHAT IS THE TRUTH?\n\nKim Stahlman has always accused NCIS of not conducting a thorough investigation.\n\nKim Stahlman: I think … they thought they could get away with their mistakes.\n\nBut NCIS documents suggest otherwise -- that evidence was collected, people were questioned, and many of Kim's concerns were answered.\n\nThey also provided her with all those photos and thousands of documents, many of which were passed on to 48 Hours. Among them, emails between Kim and Mike in the final months of his life. Some are loving and upbeat. But there are others that raise troubling questions about Mike and the marriage, like one from Kim sent about two weeks before the shooting:\n\nI just can't keep putting myself on a guilt trip anymore and blame myself for our problems.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What problems are you talking about in this?\n\nKim Stahlman: We had gotten to the point where we really didn't communicate. … and so we were talking about seeing a counselor for that.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You went on to say, after that, I can't make any promises because at this point, I feel it is about life and death for me. I can't stay in an unhealthy relationship.\n\nKim Stahlman: Right.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Here's the next quote: I know I've done some terrible, hurtful things to you and vica versa. … What's the terrible thing?\n\nKim Stahlman: Well to me -- I can't think of a specific thing, but ...\n\nPeter Van Sant: It sounds like your relationship is almost at the end of the line here.\n\nKim Stahlman: I'm a bit of a drama queen. … But it didn't -- that's not where it ended. And it doesn't show the conversations we had on the phone.\n\nIt's that last email Mike Stahlman apparently wrote to his wife not long before the shooting that strikes some as the strongest proof of suicide.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is this in your opinion a suicide note?\n\nStuart Bowen: No. Clearly not.\n\nStuart Bowen may be Kim Stahlman's best hope of getting authorities to listen. Bowen was the George W. Bush administration's Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Kim first contacted him in 2011. He says he reviewed her legal filings and Michael Maloney's report and discussed the report with Maloney extensively.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What have you concluded?\n\nStuart Bowen: It was not a suicide. I believe that he was murdered.\n\nBowen says authorities may have cut corners early on.\n\nStuart Bowen: It might be the case that the rush to judgment … led to practices that departed from best practices.\n\nThough in 2017 Bowen resigned from a government job in Texas amid unrelated ethics allegations which he denies, he has become one of Kim's most important supporters.\n\nStuart Bowen: She's committed to the truth about what happened.\n\nBowen and Kim have helped Cilla McCain and others push Congress for a bill of rights for bereaved families. McCain says many have nowhere else to turn.\n\nKim Stahman and supporters for a bill of rights for bereaved families take on Capitol Hill CBS News\n\nCilla McCain: There's no court in which they can say, Hey … let's hear this fairly with unbiased eyes and ears. It doesn't exist for military families.\n\nRecently, another significant step forward. Bowen says he convinced the military's new chief medical examiner to take another look at the official findings in the case.\n\nStuart Bowen: He assured me that he's going to review it closely and discuss it widely.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is that a big deal?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh, God. Yeah.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Because what can that medical examiner do?\n\nKim Stahlman: Change … the death certificate.\n\nAfter spending about 10 years looking into this case, Cilla McCain is writing a book about it with Kim.\n\nCilla McCain: I have pored over thousands -- thousands of documents. I have talked to anybody that I could find.\n\nMcCain says in her experience, authorities rarely change their findings. And last summer, NCIS sent 48 Hours a statement saying:\n\nNCIS has thoroughly investigated this case and we continue to stand by our investigative findings.\n\nNCIS's independent expert Mark Reynolds insists the science strongly suggests how Col. Stahlman sustained his fatal wound. But Reynolds also surprised 48 Hours.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you feel 100-percent certain that this is a suicide?\n\nMark Reynolds: No. I think that -- if it was a hidden ... homicide, it was sophisticated and ... it won't be determined forensically. It'll be determined investigatively.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Would you be professionally troubled … if this this case was changed to undetermined?\n\nMark Reynolds: Would I be professionally troubled? No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Can you live with undetermined?\n\nKim Stahlman: That's like saying, Eh, it can be this, it can be that. No. I may have to live with it, however I don't want to. I don't think it's fair to my children.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You've been described as a woman in denial about all of this.\n\nKim Stahlman [affirms]: Mm-hmm.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You're not in denial?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. No.\n\nFar from it, she insists.\n\nKim Stahlman: It would have been easier for me if it had been a suicide. At least I could move on with my freakin' life.\n\nKim recently visited her husband's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. She's now thinking of moving his remains closer to home.\n\nKim Stahlman: A man gave his entire life to his country, and for what? They didn't support him in the end.\n\nAs for the man they loved, Col. Stahlman's family knows they may never prove how he died, but they will always be proud of how he lived.\n\nIt's my duty to carry on his legacy, MacKenna Stahlman, now 21, said. My father … was probably the best man that I have ever met and might ever will meet. Kim Stahlman\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: It's my duty to carry on his legacy and do great things so he'll be proud of me in whatever I end up doing in my life. ... My father … was probably the best man that I have ever met and might ever will meet.\n\nHe's a man she still sometimes meets when she closes her eyes at night.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: … all of a sudden there's like, a knock on the door, and the door opens and it's Dad. … And then … I wake up and I'm, like, Nope, that was just a dream.\n\nKim Stahlman: There's no other man I've ever loved...\n\nKim Stahlman: I know I'll never meet another Mike Stahlman.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church said Tuesday it will sever all ties with the Boy Scouts of America at the end of next year and place its remaining 425,000 boys into a gospel-focused youth program it is developing. The move ends a nearly century-old relationship that was based on their shared values.\n\nThe announcement by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Boy Scouts didn't come as a complete surprise after the religion last year removed 185,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 18, signaling that an end to the long-time alliance was near.\n\nJoining the Boy Scouts is practically automatic among Mormon boys, and the religion has long been the biggest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States. The Mormon boys who will be leaving represent about 18.5 percent of the 2.3 million youths in the organization.\n\nThe Mormon church said in a statement that the move is about creating its own youth program that it can use for its increasingly global membership, but the two organizations' values clearly have been diverging in recent years.\n\nThe Boy Scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. Last week, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to Scouts BSA to account for the inclusion of girls.\n\nLike other conservative faiths, the Mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. The church initially said it was deeply troubled by the Boy Scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nThe religion has also traditionally used separate youth programs for boys and girls.\n\nThe Mormon church said in a statement the new program that will start in 2020 will help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of God.\n\nThe still to be developed program will likely include outdoor activities and character building similar to Boy Scouts, but it won't be modeled after Boy Scouts or use ranks. The 14-to-18-year-old boys that left the Boy Scouts already focus on church-related activities and community service.\n\nMore than half of the church's 16 million members live outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America in a statement thanked the thousands of Mormons who have served as scout leaders and wished the religion well on its new program. The organization said individual Mormons who wish to stay in Boy Scouts would be integrated into other troops.\n\nThe Boy Scouts' move to allow girls, announced last October, marked the organization's latest momentous policy shift.\n\nThe organization already has started allowing girls into the Cub Scouts. So far, nearly 4,000 girls have joined roughly 170 Cub Scout packs participating in the first phase of the new policy, and the pace is expected to intensify this summer under a nationwide multimedia recruitment campaign titled Scout Me In.\n\nThough the flagship program's name is changing, the parent organization will remain the Boy Scouts of America, and the Cub Scouts - its program serving children from kindergarten through fifth grade - will keep its title, as well.\n\nThe Boy Scout movement had been entrenched in Mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nIn 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its alliance with the Boy Scouts.\n\nA Boy Scout training complex in West Virginia is named after former Mormon church President Thomas S. Monson, a longtime member of the Boy Scouts' executive board and a major supporter who died earlier this year.
KNOX COUNTY, Indiana -- We came to Indiana looking for one of life's most elusive secrets.\n\nWe'd heard that deep within Knox County, Indiana -- back among cornfields -- there was a cluster of people who had all unlocked the mystery of a long and happy marriage.\n\nBut here's what's even more remarkable: they're all related.\n\nTogether, the eight Clinkenbeard siblings have amassed nearly half a millennia of marriage -- 449 years in total. So I figured if anyone had the secret to wedded bliss, it would have to be these couples.\n\nThe Clinkenbeards and their spouses CBS News\n\nI gathered them for a series of interviews, and here's what I learned: If you want to stay married forever, women, you need to speak your minds.\n\nI could tell when she was ticked, said Jim Clinkenbeard.\n\nOr not.\n\nI usually keep my mouth shut, said Barbara Kirk.\n\nAnd men, you need to be deferential.\n\nYou treat a lady like a lady, said Bruce Clinkenbeard.\n\nOr not.\n\nI said, 'I love to fish and I'm not going to change that,' said Paul Clinkenbeard.\n\nUnfortunately, almost everything I got was a contradiction.\n\nDorothy Clinkenbeard, right Clinkenbeard family\n\nReally, the only thing the Clinkenbeards could agree on was what their mother Dorothy taught them and told them repeatedly -- that, except in very rare circumstances, divorce should not be an option.\n\nShe instilled that in us kids, you know, Bruce said.\n\nMy mom was pretty stickler about that, said Bill Clinkenbeard.\n\nWhen we said 'I do,' to me that meant however long we lived, said Dan Yagle.\n\nIt meant suffering through some bumpy times, but the oldest brother John says it's well worth it in the end.\n\nWe've been married 65 years, he said.\n\nJohn Clinkenbeard, holding a picture of him and his wife Lillian CBS News\n\nJohn sat on the couch alone because his wife, Lillian, is in the hospital.\n\nI don't know how I'd get along without her.\n\nI never got my easy answer to what makes a happy marriage.\n\nWe love one another, Paul said.\n\nBut I did get eight solid reasons -- to never give up looking.\n\nAs Ed Kirk put it, I couldn't imagine life without her.\n\nTo contact On the Road, or to send us a story idea, email us: OnTheRoad@cbsnews.com
Love and marriage may go together like a horse and carriage, but personal finances can often un-hitch a couple.\n\nValentine's Day may be a celebration of romance, but it's also a day when would-be Romeos and Juliets get tripped up by financial pitfalls, such as misjudging how much to spend on that candle-lit dinner. But it also underscores a deeper problem that many encounter in their relationships -- when partners have different approaches to handling their money.\n\nFinancial stress is a leading source of relationship trouble, often coming when one partner is a saver and the other is a spender. Yet more than half of Americans say they don't consider whether their potential partner is good at handling their money before they jump into an exclusive relationship, according to a new study from lender Affirm. That could spell problems later on.\n\nMost Americans in committed relationships say financial mistakes made by their partners as a result of bad money management are what upsets them most, said Elizabeth Allin, vice president of communications at Affirm. There's a disconnect between what we're prioritizing when we date someone versus the expectations we have once we're committed.\n\nOne place to start: your potential partner's credit score. Americans with higher credit scores are 14 percent more likely to find love within the next year compared with singles who have scores 100 points lower, the Federal Reserve found in a 2015 study.\n\nPerhaps more important for long-lasting love, couples with similar credit scores are more likely to stick together, the Fed found. That could reflect a shared outlook about financial management and obligations.\n\nBut many Americans aren't honest with their partners about their financial details, a trait that can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. Men are more secretive, with only about half telling their partners how much they earn, according to a survey from financial firm Aspiration. About sixty percent of women spill the beans about their finances to their partners, it found.\n\nIt's better to be upfront with your partner, said Affirm's Allin.\n\nAccording to our research, talking about financial goals and habits transparently can be a factor in a long partnership -- only 4 percent of couples who have been married for over 20 years say it's hard to discuss finances, she noted.\n\nHere are five money mistakes that could doom your romance.\n\nSpending too much on a first date. On Valentine's Day, it might be better to ease up on lavish spending, at least if it's a first date. Only one out of 10 women surveyed by Affirm said it was reasonable for their date to spend more than $100, although one-quarter of men said they thought it was the right amount to spend. Women tend to be more aware of expenses and concerned about unnecessary spending than men, despite the assumption by some men that they must spend a lot to impress right out of the gate, Allin said.\n\nIncurring bank fees -- and library fines. Bank fees such as overdraft charges are considered turnoffs by potential partners, Affirm found. That's because these fees can signal a lack of financial control and result in charges that could have typically been avoided. But respondents said other types of avoidable fees were also red flags -- including parking tickets, credit card late fees and even library fines.\n\nWhen it comes to small mistakes, men and women agreed they would be most upset about a bank account overdraft fee, but nearly half of women ranked this as No. 1 compared to 37 percent of men, Allin said.\n\nNot being financially transparent. Most Americans want to know the nitty-gritty of their partner's financial situation before they tie the knot, including sharing their credit scores and how much they spend on bills. Almost one-third of married millennials said they later regretted not finding out more about their partner's finances before getting hitched, compared with 14 percent of boomers.\n\nHaving a lousy credit score. Men and women agree that a low credit score is a turnoff, according to Affirm. A majority of those with scores above 750 -- considered to be a good score -- take responsibility for paying bills, compared with only 37 percent of those in the subprime range.\n\nHiding credit cards or assets from your partner. It's not uncommon for Americans to hide assets, credit cards or bank accounts from their significant others, an action that can lead to relationship stress. About 15 million U.S. adults who are currently in live-in relationship say they're guilty of such financial infidelity, according to CreditCards.com. Such secrecy can add stress to a relationship -- as well as emotional devastation if the partner discovers the hidden financial activity.
Target's (TGT) policy of letting transgender customers and employees use the bathroom of their choice is now drawing fire from Texas officials. The state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, wants the retailer to spell out how it will protect customers who he suggested could be endangered by the policy.\n\nRegardless of whether Texas legislates on this topic, it is possible that allowing men in women's restrooms could lead to criminal and otherwise unwanted activity, he said in a May 3 letter to Target CEO Brian Cornell. As chief lawyer and law enforcement officer for the State of Texas, I ask that you provide the full text of Target's safety policies regarding the protection of women and children from those who would use the cover of Target's restroom policy for nefarious purposes.\n\nThe move by Texas to pressure Target comes as North Carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding for passing related legislation that the Justice Department says violates civil rights law.\n\nAfter states including North Carolina and Mississippi recently enacted anti-gay laws, Target last month reaffirmed its commitment to protecting gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. The retailer's public stance drew a boycott effort by a conservative Christian group, along with a rebuke from an Alabama city that is home to a Target.\n\nThe national debate over LGBT rights is unlikely to abate anytime soon, but experts say the Target brand is unlikely to face any long-term damage.\n\nTarget's policy is consistent with the message and core values that it's been projecting for years, Melissa Arnoff, senior vice president at Levick, a communications firm specializing in crisis and issues management, said, noting the company's past support of same-sex marriage and parenting, and its decision last year to stop labeling toy aisles by gender.\n\nTarget is doing the right thing to what it has been as a brand, Arnoff said. I'm sure they are looking at the data and sales. As a smart company they will pay more attention to that kind of data than the number of names on a petition.\n\nThe move by Texas to pressure Target comes as North Carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding for passing related legislation that the Justice Department says violates civil rights law.\n\nThis topic is not going away, added Ted Marzilli, chief executive officer at YouGov BrandIndex, which conducts daily surveys to monitor public views of 1,500 brands.\n\nTarget has been pretty balanced in terms of how they've been communicating with the media, he said. They are not being combative, they are just saying look, this is our policy, I don't think they are stirring up the pot, or trying to pick a bigger fight.\n\nStill, while consumers' perception of Target fell to an eight-month low after the retailer found itself in the headlines, it's doubtful the company will remain a focus of the story, Marzilli said. Any negative impact is likely to pale in comparison to the retailer's effort to regain consumers' trust after a security breach compromised customer information in late 2013. That was a much, much bigger deal, he said.\n\nTarget spokeswoman Molly Snyder acknowledged getting the Texas attorney general's request to spell out its safety practices. The company has robust procedures, policies and training in place to ensure that our stores are safe places to work and shop, she said, declining further comment.\n\nMarc Rylander, Paxton's communications director, said Target had not yet responded to the attorney general's request. We asked them for safety policies, and we hope to hear from them.\n\nPaxton on Monday voiced support for North Carolina in its legal fight with the U.S. Department of Justice, saying in a statement that he backs the principle that persons should use restrooms and other intimate facilities that correspond with their biological sex.\n\nThe Equal Opportunity Employment Commission last year called equal access to restrooms a significant, basic condition of employment and said that denying access to transgender individuals was discriminatory.\n\nThe federal government and North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory sued each other on Monday, the deadline McCory had been given to confirm his state would not implement the law he signed in March.\n\nNorth Carolina stands to pass up $4.8 billion in funds, mostly educational grants, if it refuses to reverse course, according to an analysis by lawyers at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School, who estimated 37,800 transgender people live in the state.\n\nAs for the financial hit Target may or may not take as a result of its policy, Marzilli said he thinks it's likely the retailer would suffer a one-to-two month impact on its bottom line, and quickly recover.\n\nWhile there a lot of people who are very vocal saying they won't shop at Target, some may shop more at Target, he said. A year from now, Target may be remembered for being one of the first to step up to the plate, which history might prove was the right stance to take.
Kelly Clarkson is officially a mother-of-two!\n\nThe 33-year-old singer gave birth to her second child, a boy, on Tuesday, April 12, confirming the news herself later in the week.\n\nOur little baby boy has arrived!! Remington Alexander Blackstock was born 4/12/16 & he is healthy & we couldn't be happier or more in love! Clarkson tweeted on Thursday morning.\n\nThis is Clarkson's second child with her husband, talent manager Brandon Blackstock. Clarkson is already a mother to her 1-year-old daughter River Rose, and is a stepmom to Blackstock's two children from a previous marriage.\n\nMerry Christmas from the Blackstock clan! @gameofthrones #gameofthrones #winteriscoming #riverisnotworried A photo posted by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson) on Dec 8, 2015 at 2:28pm PST\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say the American Idol champ has been eager to give birth leading up to the big day. Responding to a Trisha Yearwood tweet earlier this month of a coffee mug reading, I can't even, Clarkson wrote, Girl, this describes my day. I feel like Rachel on Friends w/this baby #getoutgetoutgetout hahaha.\n\nShe's also made it no secret that she's had extremely difficult pregnancieswith both River and her newborn son.\n\nHonestly, the first one was really rough, and I was like, 'Oh, it can't happen again,' and no it happened, like, way worse this time, Clarkson shared in a radio interview with Australia's KIIS FM last month, explaining that her ailment is 100 times worse than morning sickness. I just get hospitalized, and I have to get fluids. It's just, like, my body was not made to be pregnant.\n\nI wish I was like the girl that ... it's beautiful, but it's not, she added.\n\nAnd if all goes according to plan, this will be her last pregnancy.\n\nOh, no, we are done, she laughed. Oh good Lord, yes, I can't be pregnant again. This will be our number four total, so we're good.\n\nOne thing she can definitely count on is her husband of two years being a great father to their kids.\n\nWatching my husband love on his daughter all the time, you know, go to her events and just be there and, like, be present is, like, hard to watch but beautiful to watch, Clarkson told Ryan Seacrest during a radio interview in February, fighting back tears. But it's awesome because I know that my kids are going to have that.\n\nI cannot imagine not seeing this kid to his or her full potential and just seeing what she's going to do, what she's going to be like, she continued.
During the 2016 presidential race, Donald Trump famously said I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters.\n\nAnd if he fired that shot in an evangelical church, he could probably get the pastor to help steady his aim.\n\nDespite the titillating details from Stormy Daniels on 60 Minutes this week and the mounting evidence of his infidelity to third wife, Melania, the GOP's so-called values voters—people who loudly condemned Bill Clinton for his infidelity—are standing by President Trump. As one-time Clinton critic Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council said regarding Trump's Stormy sexual misbehavior: We gave him a mulligan.\n\nAs a graduate of Oral Roberts University myself, I don't recall exactly which book of the Bible mentions the mulligan (Proverbs, maybe? It has a Solomonic sound). But the need for forgiveness is certainly a Biblical principle, and the willingness of Christians to forgive human failings is nothing new. Nor is it a symptom of hypocrisy.\n\nBut to receive forgiveness, one must confess the sin first. And President Trump has yet to admit his relationship with Ms. Daniels, much less ask forgiveness for it.\n\nAnd it appears he doesn't need to. After a short-lived 14-point dip in net approval among social conservatives after the Stormy Daniels story broke, President Trump's support among these voters is back around 80 percent, according to Morning Consult. Evangelicals are so willing to support President Trump, they've abandoned their principles on character and morality in order to make room for him.\n\nConsider these numbers:\n\nIn 2011, just 30 percent of evangelical voters believed that an elected official who committed an immoral act in their personal life had the ethical character to hold public office. By October 2016—on the eve of their massive turnout on behalf of p***y-grabbing Donald Trump, that number was up to 72 percent, according to a survey conducted by PRRI and the Brookings Institution.\n\nPerhaps most astonishing, a recent YouGov poll found only half of Trump voters said Trump cheating on his wife with Stormy Daniels would be immoral, even if it did happen. After everything they've learned about him, 56 percent of Trump supporters believe the phrase moral leader describes the president either very well or extremely well.\n\nHow did the same Americans who clamored for Bill Clinton to be impeached for lying about his affairs turn into voters who aren't even sure cheating is immoral at all? It's that magic word:\n\nClinton.\n\nEvangelicals remember how feminists and liberals who claimed to care deeply about the treatment of women in the workplace rallied around Bill Clinton, despite his behavior with a White House intern. Bring up Stormy Daniels to politically active social conservatives and they're likely to bring up Nina Burleigh, the former Time reporter who said during the Clinton scandal that she would be willing to engage in the same activity as Monica Lewinsky to thank him for keeping abortion legal.\n\nAs conservative Townhall.com columnist and Trump supporter Kurt Schlichter puts it: I see no reason not to play by [Democrats'] rules…not allowing the other side to gain an advantage by weaponizing morality against us.\n\nTrump's affairs are a side show, Schlichter tweeted.\n\nI see no reason not to play by the new rules. I don't have to like them, but I refused to unilaterally disarm. If that makes me a terrible person, so be it, and I'll be a terrible person not under a liberal fascist dictatorship. — Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) March 26, 2018\n\nThen there's the other Clinton argument Christians use: Hillary.\n\nEvangelical voters felt under siege during the Obama years, from nuns hit with government mandates regarding birth control to Christian business owners forced to participate in same-sex marriage ceremonies. Many believed a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring even more government assaults against people of faith.\n\nThey note that during a 2015 speech addressing the issue of abortion, for example, candidate Hillary Clinton said deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.\n\nPeople of faith were looking for a politician who would champion their religious faith, not change it.And while an exceptionally profane, likely unfaithful, thrice-married braggart who once publicly supported abortion (as Mark Hemingway calls him in the conservative Weekly Standard magazine this week) doesn't seem like the obvious candidate, Trump got the job.\n\nAs Tony Perkins told Politico.com, the relationship between evangelicals and Trump is transactional. They give the president their loyalty, and he gives them political support.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, he has delivered more than any other president in my lifetime.\n\nIs the transaction worth it? In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus asks For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\n\nThen again, Jesus never voted in a Republican primary.

All the Democratic candidates who ran for president in 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind Joe Biden's search for a running mate 02:04 More Democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than America has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020.\n\nEric Swalwell Biography Although he was born in Iowa in 1980, Swalwell moved with his family to attend middle school and high school in California. He was recruited to play soccer for North Carolina's Campbell University. After suffering an injury, however, he transferred to the University of Maryland. After completing his undergraduate studies, Swalwell earned his J.D. from the University of Maryland and was a congressional intern for former California Rep. Ellen Tauscher. In 2012, while a council member in Dublin City, in California's Alameda County, Swalwell mounted a primary challenge against fellow Democrat and 20-term incumbent Pete Stark in the state's 15th Congressional District, located in the outer suburbs of San Francisco. Although Stark bested him in the primary election, Swalwell beat the incumbent in the general election, which he qualified for because of California's top two primary system. Swalwell says he's running for president 01:40 Since he was sworn-in in 2013, Swalwell has won reelection three times. Although he has been a rank-and-file member of the House Democratic caucus during his congressional tenure, he has raised his profile during the Trump administration as a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, frequently rebuking the president in cable news appearances. On the Intelligence Committee, Swalwell has also strongly defended special counsel Robert Mueller's now-concluded investigation and voiced his concerns about the Trump campaign's contacts with people affiliated with the Russian government, including the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton during the summer of 2016. Issues Swalwell will look to make gun safety reform an integral part of his presidential campaign. He has been strongly critical of the National Rifle Association's (NRA) sway in Congress and has repeatedly lambasted Republicans for not supporting gun control measures. He is hosting a town hall on gun control in Florida Tuesday alongside survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, in which 17 students and staff members were killed by a gunman. Last week, the California Democrat shared a voicemail his office received in which an individual is heard making a death threat against him because of his stance on gun rights. We're going to war. And you're going to be the first motherf***ing casualty, the person in the voicemail posted by Swalwell on Twitter is heard saying. In his post, Swalwell wrote, I'm not afraid of this guy. I'm not afraid of the NRA. I'm not afraid. No fear. #EndGunViolence. Controversy While Swalwell has not been embroiled in any major scandal or controversy during his tenure in Congress, the California Democrat will surely face criticism from Mr. Trump and Republicans on the campaign trail, especially if he secures the party's nomination, because of his staunch defense of the Mueller probe. What Trump says The president has yet to tweet about Swalwell, but his 2020 campaign has strongly criticized the congressman since the release of the Justice Department's summary of the Mueller report. In a memorandum, Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications of the president's campaign, urged television news outlets to challenge Swalwell and other prominent Democrats who said there was evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\n\nTim Ryan Biography Ryan was born and raised in northeastern Ohio in 1973. He played football in high school and was recruited to play for Youngstown State University. Because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to Bowling Green State University, near Toledo. After graduating from college, Ryan earned a J.D. from the University of New Hampshire and worked in the office of longtime Ohio Congressman James Traficant, who was expelled from the House after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. At age 26, Ryan was elected to Ohio's state senate. When his old boss Tradicant became embroiled in scandal, Ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. At 29, he was the youngest member of Congress when he was sworn in 2003. Although he has served eight terms in the House, Ryan gained notoriety following Mr. Trump's unexpected election in November 2016. Citing Democrats' loss of Midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- Ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy Pelosi, then House Minority Leader. After Democrats retook control of the House during the 2018 November midterm elections, the Ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace Pelosi. Ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel. Rep. Tim Ryan announces 2020 run 03:08 Issues Ryan has not staked out a clear ideological agenda during his 15 years in Congress. He is not a member of any of the major Democratic caucuses in the House, like the pro-business New Democrat Coalition or the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He once earned an A rating from the National Rife Association (NRA) and has broken with his party to support fracking measures favored by Republicans. But Ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like Medicare for all. Controversy Ryan's tenure in Congress has largely been scandal-free, but his repeated challenges to Pelosi's leadership are likely to alienate some Democratic primary voters. What Trump says Although Ryan has been a fierce critic of the president, Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about the Ohio congressman.\n\nWayne Messam Screenshot from Wayne Messam's 2020 campaign video Wayne for America Biography Born in Pahokee, Florida and raised in South Bay, Mayor Wayne Messam became the first African American mayor of the city of Miramar after unseating a 16-year incumbent in 2015. Messam's parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica. His father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. Messam earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship Team under legendary coach Bobby Bowden. He would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. Wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, Angela, more than 20 years ago. They have three children, Wayne II, and twin daughters, Kayla and Kyla. Issues While lacking name recognition outside Florida, Messam told CNN that under his leadership, the city of Miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from Hurricane Irma. He has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities. These are issues that have national implications and I'm looking forward to be that agent of change for the American people and I'm so excited to launch my candidacy to be the president of the United States, he said. In his campaign announcement video, the Democrat claimed that Washington is broken, listing problems like rising prescription drug prices, the effects of climate change and crippling student debt. What Trump says Messam has not yet been a target for President Trump.\n\nBeto O'Rourke Beto O'Rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 Biography O'Rourke was born and raised in the Texas border city of El Paso. Although his legal first name is Robert, he has been known as Beto, the nickname Spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like Roberto and Alberto, since childhood. He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities. He managed to topple eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the primary and defeated his Republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. While in Congress, the Texas Democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees. On immigration, O'Rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. In 2014, he called President Obama's executive action creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed Congress. He also backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's leadership challenge against then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016. O'Rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust Cruz in 2018. His robust Senate bid in Texas -- along with his Obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas -- including the state's large and growing Latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. No Democrat had come that close to winning a Senate race in Texas since 1988. Despite the loss, O'Rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. Although he told 60 Minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, O'Rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. Issues In his six years in Congress, O'Rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, LGBT rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights. He often called for improvements to the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. During and after his senate campaign, O'Rourke made immigration a central issue. He has routinely denounced the White House for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the U.S.-Mexico border. He also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship. During a fiery speech in El Paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, O'Rourke condemned Mr. Turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. We know that walls do not save lives. Walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of Mr. Trump's nearby rallies. In the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. Controversy In addition to the scrutiny O'Rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a Senate race, the Texas Democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in Congress and personal life. Although he had a generally liberal voting record in Congress, O'Rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left. In the House, he was a member of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the Democratic Party to support more audacious efforts, like the Green New Deal, to mitigate climate change. During his Senate campaign, O'Rourke refused to back Medicare for all, a proposal many 2020 Democrats have vouched their support for. Medicare for All emerges as first litmus test for 2020 Democratic contenders\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduces 2020 policy test with Green New Deal Some candidness may also follow the lead of O'Rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. In 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a DWI program the following year. O'Rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the Houston Chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. What Trump says Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an O'Rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the Texas Democrat's unsuccessful Senate bid. I thought you were supposed to win before you run for president, Mr. Trump told reporters in December. When the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed O'Rourke's great defeat in November.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper John Hickenlooper joins crowded 2020 race 04:09 Biography Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper grew up outside of Philadelphia, the youngest of four children. He attended Wesleyan University and received a bachelor's in English and a master's degree in Geology. Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery with 15 brewpubs and restaurants, was a success, and it made him a millionaire. In 2003, Hickenlooper ran for Mayor of Denver, in his first ever campaign. Considered a bit of a dark horse candidate who never ran a negative ad, he shocked many and won in a landslide. In 2010, Hickenlooper became the first Denver Mayor elected Governor in 120 years. He was re-elected in 2014, running on another entirely positive campaign Hickenlooper is the second governor or former governor to announce a Democratic presidential bid this cycle, following Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Issues Finishing his second term in the statehouse, Hickenlooper was a popular, pro-business governor. He left Colorado with a strong economy and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building. It's that record that he touted in h is campaign video. I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington but we also need to get things done, Hickenlooper says in the video. I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver. As governor, Hickenlooper also signed an expansion of Medicaid in 2013. He has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. Hickenlooper has opposed a number of Trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. Over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Hickenlooper so far.\n\nJay Inslee Jay Inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 Biography Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1973 and a J.D. from Willamette University College of Law in Oregon three years later. After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values. During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free. However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward, Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure\n\nBernie Sanders Bernie Sanders on 2020: We're going to win 04:49 Biography Although he has spent most of his adult life in Vermont, Bernie Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant Jewish family. He attended one year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating in 1964. At the University of Chicago, Sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He moved to Vermont in 1968. Sanders ran for governor of Vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent Liberty Union Party. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. He was elected to the House of Representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 2006. Although technically still an independent, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. However, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign. His campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Since the 2016 campaign, some of Sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, such as his Medicare-for-All proposal. Issues Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. Sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. Sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the Medicare-for-All bill with 15 other senators in 2017. He also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they American worker. He opposed NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, trade deals which President Trump renegotiated or withdrew from. Sanders opposed the U.S. war in Iraq, and remains a critic of American military interventionism. Controversy More than two dozen of Sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of December seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. A New York Times story in early January reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which Sanders apologized. Politico also reported in early January that his former Iowa campaign manager, Robert Becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees. Sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with Becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. What Trump says President Trump has alternated between praising Sanders and insulting him as crazy. As some of Mr. Trump and Sanders' populist ideas overlap, Mr. Trump often said during the 2016 campaign that Sanders voters would defect to him over Hillary Clinton in the general election. Mr. Trump also accused Clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from Sanders, and criticized Sanders for eventually endorsing Clinton. While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, Mr. Trump tweeted in July 2016. Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary, he wrote in another July tweet. In several subsequent tweets, Mr. Trump has called Sanders Crazy Bernie. He has often referred to the 2016 Democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.\n\nAmy Klobuchar Klobuchar announces 2020 presidential bid 25:20 Biography Amy Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis. Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an F rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light. I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.\n\nCory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,' Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration. After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system. Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his Spartacus moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has no chance in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: Because I know him. He has no chance. In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker ran Newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself, Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year.\n\nPete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg explores presidential bid 06:09 Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing. The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different. Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.\n\nKamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 run 05:19 Biography Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat. In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail. Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does. Harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nElizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 202... 02:18 Biography Warren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office. Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice. During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. The problem is Washington works great for those with influence. Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. We make our campaigns work through the people. Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn't work out too well, Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her. Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her. Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate. Issues Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the Don't ask, don't tell policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 Minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate. The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct. She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors, including billionaire George Soros, have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken. She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017, she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public. What Trump says President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! Mr. Trump tweeted. Critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office, Gillibrand wrote on Twitter in response.\n\nJulián Castro Julián Castro launches 2020 campaign 08:32 Biography Julián Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating him and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman. Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues. In his exit memo from the agency, Castro said that HUD had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. Under the Obama administration, he wrote, HUD invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects. Views on LGBT issues and abortion rights He supports LGBT rights and was the first San Antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's Pride Parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the Mayors for the Freedom to Marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012. Castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. He spoke at the annual luncheon for Planned Parenthood South Texas in May. Controversy In 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. Castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the Hatch Act in his department. What Trump says Castro has not yet been a target for President Trump. Unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, Mr. Trump has never personally disparaged Castro on Twitter. Issues In his video announcing his exploratory committee in December, Castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants. No matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, Castro said.\n\nTulsi Gabbard Rep. Tulsi Gabbard launches 2020 campaign 05:28 Biography Tulsi Gabbard was born in American Samoa in 1981, and her family moved to Hawaii when she was 2 years old. Her mother, Carol, is a practicing Hindu, a religion Gabbard adopted. Her father, Mike, is a member of the Hawaii state Senate. After growing up in a politically active family, Gabbard became a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. While serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. She deployed in Iraq and returned in 2006. After returning from her second deployment in 2009, Gabbard ran for Honolulu City Council. She served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first practicing Hindu in Congress. Issues Gabbard is very progressive, and one of the few members of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. She resigned her position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse him. Gabbard is a supporter of a woman's right to an abortion and received a 100 percent rating from NARAL. She has emphasized environmental and economic issues during her tenure, and supports a $15 minimum wage. She also supports Medicare for All. Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians. In November, she said in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What Trump says Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Gabbard. The two met briefly shortly after Mr. Trump was elected.
I Do … Until I Don't is very personal for Lake Bell, who wrote, directed and produced the romantic comedy.\n\nBell started working on the screenplay nine years ago. The plot revolves around three couples who are taking part in a documentary about marriage, directed by an eccentric and cynical filmmaker who believes marriage should be a renewable seven-year contract. Bell stars as Alice, a woman who runs a blinds store with her husband, Noah, played by Ed Helms, in Vero Beach, Florida, where Bell spent part of her childhood.\n\nBell told CBS News when she started writing the film, she had a therapeutic need to investigate the institution of marriage.\n\nI really felt that marriage was archaic, she said. I did share the ideology and theories that the documentarian, Vivian, depicted in the movie. I was sort of more of a Vivian to start with, and during the writing of this film I met my husband, Scott Campbell, so it was kind of a beautiful lesson and continues to be.\n\nBell said her cynicism of stems from the fact that she was one and a half when her parents divorced.\n\nI was part of a pretty difficult divorce and I grew up with other family members and friends who were all kind of getting divorced, so it just felt like a doomed concept, and when I was starting to write the movie, I believed 'if it ain't broke, why fix it?' she said. So if you're with someone you love, why not just be with them, which is the Fanny and Xander ideology. Every character in this movie does feel deeply personal in my unpacking of the subject matter. Fanny and Xander, played by Amber Heard and Wyatt Cenac, respectively, play a carefree hippie couple in an open relationship.\n\nWyatt Cenac and Amber Heard play a couple in an open relationship in I Do ... Until I Don't. The Film Arcade\n\nBut Bell said in the process of the film, she started to change her mind about marriage.\n\nI fell madly in love with my husband and even though he's covered head to toe in tattoos, he's more traditional -- he's from the south -- and I remember being really afraid to take on this thing that I had never really understood, she explained. I did tell him, 'Well, I am afraid, but I can't think of anyone else I'd rather be afraid with.'\n\nBell and Campbell have been married for four years and together for seven, and she said what she appreciates about marriage is how much she has evolved.\n\nIt's harder to grow if you're living in a single vortex, where no one is calling you out on your [expletive] and when the going gets tough, you don't fail, but when you're in a committed relationship, you're constantly looking in the mirror and at your flaws by way of your partner and vice versa, said Bell. And we love therapy. You don't have to be a raging lunatic to go to therapy to improve. It's just self-love, and taking care of thyself is what really inspires you to take care of each other.\n\nBell said that to write the script, she envisioned herself as each character, but she was especially excited to play Alice.\n\nIt's really fun to take on characters who are not an obvious casting choice for me, she said. Alice sort of apologizes for the space she takes up in the world and she's extremely low-status and she's repressed and that's just something I haven't gotten to do in my career.\n\nBell admitted she has an agenda in making this film.\n\nIt has a happy ending and it's built that way and I always wanted it that way, she said. I really wanted this story and investigation to end with hope, because I think ultimately as a previous unromantic, I was hoping deep down to be proven wrong.
BALTIMORE -- The Maryland parents behind a controversial YouTube channel featuring videos of them playing pranks on their children were sentenced to five years of supervised probation, CBS station WJZ-TV reports.\n\nHeather and Mike Martin each entered Alford pleas to two counts of child neglect of their two youngest kids. Their pleas mean they did not admit to any abuse but acknowledged prosecutors had enough evidence to prove it.\n\nProsecutors say a psychologist determined the kids were traumatized by these pranks. The judge didn't think they were funny either.\n\nThis was far beyond corporal punishment, Frederick County State's Attorney Charlie Smith said. This was egregious, abusive conduct, and I didn't think it was funny from the beginning, and, obviously, the judge didn't either.\n\nHundreds of videos on the couple's DaddyOFive YouTube channel showed everything from smashing electronics to a fake robbery and other elaborate pranks where they appear to terrify their five children. The Martins quickly reached 800,000 followers after launching the channel.\n\nWe were just messing around one day, having fun, joking around, and we ended up doing the prank, and we put it on YouTube, and it blew up, Mike Martin told WJZ in the spring.\n\nBut one video in particular, posted in April, changed everything for the family. It showed their son sobbing as they were screaming at him for spilling ink, which they actually did for the prank.\n\nThe video went viral, and outraged fans went on the attack, accusing the couple of exploiting their children. It triggered an international firestorm and an investigation by Child Protective Services. Eventually, they were charged.\n\nAfter the controversy began, the couple removed most of their videos from the DaddyOFive channel. One of only two videos remaining is a public apology, which they posted on April 22.\n\nWe have made some terrible parenting decisions, Heather Martin said in the video.\n\nMike Martin is the biological father of the two children at the center of the charges, and Heather Martin is their stepmother. The other three children in the videos are from Heather Martin's previous marriage.\n\nThe couple is not allowed to contact the two allegedly neglected children in any way without a judge's approval. They're back with their biological mother.\n\nThe couple claimed they made the videos to help provide a better life for their kids. They had hundreds of thousands of followers and made hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe couple has launched two new YouTube channels since the controversy began, called MommyOFive and DaddyOFive Gaming.
On this Valentine's Day, new research shows a revolution is in the works when it comes to finding love that lasts. The concept is called slow love. Marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship. Now it's the finale, biological anthropologist Helen Fisher said Thursday on CBS This Morning.\n\nIn her annual study with Match.com, Fisher saw signs of a new approach to the courtship process. From a national sample of more than 35,000 single adults, 66 percent said they've had one-night stands, 54 percent have had uncommitted friends-with-benefits relationships, and 56 percent said they've lived together with a partner before marriage.\n\nWhat's really happening is we're seeing an extension of the pre-commitment stage of love, Fisher said. And Americans seem to think that this is reckless, and it began to occur to me it's caution. These people want to know every single thing about a person before they tie the knot.\n\nOne of the main strategies is they first start out with just friends. And then they move into friends with benefits. Don't tell anybody. Secretive. Non-committal. And then have the official first date, she added.\n\nFisher said singles today are terrified of divorce and want to make a solid partnership.\n\nSo I began to think, with this long pre-commitment stage, maybe you're learning a lot, you're getting rid of what you don't want, so that by the time you walk down the aisle, you got what you want. You can keep what you want, she said.\n\nFisher has also done research with people who have been married for an average of 21 years. She said through brain scans, she was able to see three parts of the brain that become active in a long-term and happy marriage: [A] brain region linked with empathy, a brain region linked with controlling your own stress and your own emotions, and a brain region linked with overlooking the negative and focusing on the positive. What we call the positive illusions.
Adele confirmed her marriage to partner Simon Konecki at the Grammys on Sunday.\n\nThe singer, who picked up five awards at the Grammys, said during her acceptance speech for Album of the Year, My husband and my son -- you're the only reason I do it.\n\nAdele and Konecki have been in a long-term relationship; Konecki is the father of Adele's 4-year-old son, Angelo.\n\nBritish tabloids reported rumors that the two married over Christmas, but Adele never confirmed the marriage until Grammys night. Her rep did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday.\n\nAdele had an eventful night on Sunday, winning trophies for Album, Song and Record of the Year, beating out Beyonce.\n\nShe also said as she accepted Album of the Year: Winning this, it really feels full circle but I can't possilby accept this award. My life is Beyonce and the 'Lemonade' album, Beyonce was so monumental and so well thought-out and beautiful and soul-baring ... the way you made me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering.\n\nThe Hello singer also had a flub on Grammys night during a surprise tribute to George Michael. A few seconds into the song she stopped and said, I'm sorry for swearing and I'm sorry for starting again … I can't mess this up for him and started from the top. Adele finished the song without a hitch; she faced the crowd with tears in her eyes and received a standing ovation.
For 32 years, movie star Annette Bening has always stood out, in films such as Valmont, Bugsy, The American President, The Women and 20th Century Women, earning four Oscar nominations along the way (for her performances in The Grifters, American Beauty, Being Julia and The Kids Are All Right).\n\nI've been asked to do really interesting characters in the midst of great stories with great writing, Bening said. And great writing usually involves flaws. It's not about playing people who are strong. It's about trying to find the humanity in people.\n\nAnd she's at it again, this time on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's All My Sons. For Bening, being on stage has been a kind of homecoming. My family's from the Midwest. I was born in Kansas. So, many of my relatives in Iowa had this very backyard, she said of the play's setting.\n\nActress Annette Bening with correspondent Serena Altschul on the stage for All My Sons. CBS News\n\nBoth she and the production have been nominated for Tonys this year.\n\nSet in 1947, All My Sons centers on the Keller family, whose two sons were in World War II. After one, a pilot, was reported missing, their mom, Kate, can't accept even the possibility he could be dead.\n\nCorrespondent Serena Altschul asked, How do you feel about Kate?\n\nI love her, Bening replied. That's the pleasure we have as actors. We get to love the characters because we don't have to judge them.\n\nAnnette Bening and Tracy Letts in the Broadway revival of All My Sons. CBS News\n\nBening said it's a role she always wanted to play, in part because the story mirrors events in her own history: My mom's family had two sons that went to the war, my Uncle Russell and my Uncle Roy. They both enlisted after Pearl Harbor. They were both in their late twenties.\n\nRoy became a Marine, Russell a pilot. His plane crashed from mechanical failure. The body of his copilot was found, but my Uncle Russell's body was never found. So, there's a lot of personal connection in my family to the world that Arthur Miller was writing about.\n\nThe actress, a Tony nominee for the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's classic drama, has an emotional connection to its story of a family's loss during World War II. CBS News\n\nAnd, she says, she draws on that connection each night.\n\nAltschul asked, Do you get a certain catharsis when you relive what Kate goes through every night? Are you working through that loss, in a way?\n\nI have a theory that maybe if you're working in the right way, it is a cathartic experience. So afterwards, you feel unburdened, she replied.\n\nHer first and only other time on Broadway was in 1987's Coastal Disturbances. She earned a Tony nomination then, too, and soon Hollywood beckoned.\n\nI was lucky, she said of the great opportunities in her film career. And I also didn't start doing movies 'til I was almost 30. I wasn't a kid.\n\nIn 1990, she met actor and heartthrob Warren Beatty on the set of the film Bugsy. They married in 1992.\n\nAltschul asked, How does one make a marriage work for 27 years?\n\nWell, I think mutual respect, and that we very much want the same things, Bening replied. So, he's very tolerant of living with me!\n\nAnd you of him, right?\n\nYes. I would say yes, she laughed.\n\nThere were skeptics in the beginning; what do you say to them?\n\nWhat can I say? I don't know, we've been married 27 years. We have four children. I think that sorta says it all, doesn't it? Bening laughed.\n\nAnnette Bening and Warren Beatty arrive at the Academy Awards in this 2011 file photo. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nAnd, she says, together they created the life she dreamed of. I always wanted children, from when I was really little, like a little girl, seven or eight years old. And my children, who are now adults, they're in the stage of their lives where they're getting their education and they're working and falling in love. And it's also a very cool stage of parenting that I'm really enjoying.\n\nBening prefers to let her kids speak for themselves. For instance, her oldest, Stephen, is outspoken as an advocate in the transgender community.\n\nAltschul asked, What can you say to other moms wanting to help their children find themselves and be exactly what they feel they are?\n\nBening replied, Well, it's what we all want to do as parents. And I think that the tricky part is, that your kids have to go through difficulties and pain. And I didn't even know it, but there was a part of me that thought, if I got it right, I could maybe parent my kids in such a way that they wouldn't have to experience pain, she laughed. Which is, of course, ridiculous! You want to shield them.\n\nBut what you learn is how powerless you are. You have a lot that you can do to help and love your kids. And of course, you do anything you can to support them and love them. But they go through what they're gonna go through. And they have a right to do that. And there's a dignity to that.\n\nAs her children move on, she says, for Beatty and herself it seems like old times. My husband and I now, we have more time just for each other, and for work. And I can come and do this play in New York.\n\nHas he come yet?\n\nYes. An dhe's been incredibly supportive and enthusiastic.\n\nAnd he's not the only one. Critics, audiences and, of course, the Tony Awards nominating committee are raving about Bening's performance.\n\nBut, Bening said, We don't talk about it.\n\nYou don't? No, we don't talk about it. We just focus on the work.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nArthur Miller's All My Sons at the American Airlines Theatre (through June 30) | Ticket Info\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mary Raffalli.\n\n\n\nSee also:
Whatever happened to Grammy's Best New Artists?\n\n\n\n\n\nGABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/Getty Images Esperanza Spalding poses with her award for Best New Artist at the 53nd annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Over the past half-century many of the performers honored in the Best New Artist category have gone on to stellar careers. Others failed to match their early success; groups disbanded; and some left the recording industry entirely. There were also tragic stories of bankruptcy, jail and lives cut short. Click through our gallery to see every winner of Best New Artist since 1959, and how they followed their Grammy victories. By CBS News.com senior editors Lauren Moraski and David Morgan\n\n1959: Bobby Darin CBS News Nominees: Edd Byrnes, Mark Murphy, Johnny Restivo and Mavis Rivers In 1958-59 pop singer/crooner Bobby Darin had six singles on the U.S. charts, including Splish Splash, Early in the Morning, Dream Lover and Mack the Knife. Over the next decade-and-a-half, Darin recorded 32 albums; started a label (Direction Records) to release folk music and protest songs; and acted in films such as State Fair, Captain Newman, M.D., and Hell Is for Heroes. Darin died in 1973 at the age of 37, after surgery to correct a heart problem failed.\n\n1960: Bob Newhart Warner Records Nominees: The Brothers Four, Miriam Makeba, Leontyne Price and Joanie Sommers With The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart - the first comedy album to hit Number 1 on the Billboard chart - the comedian became the first artist to win Grammys in both the Album of the Year and Best New Artist categories. [Only three others have achieved that feat: Christopher Cross, Lauryn Hill and Norah Jones.] Newhart would release several more albums, and would star in a variety show and three sit-coms (including the classics The Bob Newhart Show and Newhart). He also made appearances in films such as Catch-22, Cold Turkey, In & Out and Elf.\n\n1961: Peter Nero CBS News Nominees: Ann-Margret, Dick Gregory, The Lettermen and Timi Yuro The pianist released his first easy-listening album, Piano Forte (RCA), in 1961. Nearly 70 more Peter Nero albums would follow, in a career that has spanned classical, jazz and American standards. Nero also help found the Philly Pops Orchestra.\n\n1962: Robert Goulet Columbia Records Nominees: The Four Seasons, Vaughn Meader, The New Christy Minstrels, Peter, Paul and Mary, and Allan Sherman Born in Massachusetts, Robert Goulet spent his adolescence in Canada, and eventually studied at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. In 1960 he debuted on Broadway as Lancelot in the Lerner & Loewe musical Camelot, and quickly built a music, TV and film career. His biggest recordings included If Ever I Would Leave You, My Love, Forgive Me, and Come Back To Me, My Love. Suffering from lung disease, Goulet died on October 20, 2007 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\n1963: The Swingle Singers CBS News Nominees: Vikki Carr, John Gary, The J's with Jamie, and Trini Lopez Formed by Ward Swingle in Paris, the Swingle Singers was comprised of French session artists who joined to perform jazz vocals. Their renditions of J.S. Bach fugues and The Well-Tempered Clavier as vocals, Jazz Sébastien Bach (released in the U.S. as Bach's Greatest Hits), won a Grammy for Best Performance by a Chorus, and also won the group Best New Artist. In the early 1970s the singers disbanded, but Ward Swingle re-formed the group in England with a new cast. Over the past half-century the Swingles' various iterations have released more than 50 recordings, won five Grammys, and had their music used in such disparate programs as Wedding Crashers and Sex and the City. The group also curates the London A Cappella Festival. Ward Swingle died on Jan. 19, 2015, in Eastbourne, England. He was 87.\n\n1964: The Beatles Capitol Records The world knows what became of John, Paul, George and Ringo - probably the easiest choice for Best New Artist the Grammy membership ever had to make. So what happened to their fellow nominees? Petula Clark, whose hits included Downtown and Don't Sleep in the Subway, also starred in the musical films Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Finian's Rainbow, and on Broadway in Blood Brothers, with David and Shaun Cassidy. Brazilian Astrud Gilberto, best known for The Girl from Ipanema, has recorded 16 albums, and performed with such artists as João Gilberto, Stan Getz and George Michael. Bossa nova musician and composer Antonio Carlos Jobim won the 1995 Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Performance for Antonio Brasileiro. Jobim died in 1994. Singer Morgana King's four-octave range graced cabarets and concert hall for more than three decades. She released 30 albums, but probably received the most exposure from her debut film role, as Carmela Corleone, wife of Don Corleone, in The Godfather. King sang Luna Mezz'o Mare during the wedding reception scene.\n\n1965: Tom Jones CBS News Nominees: The Byrds, Herman's Hermits, Horst Jankowski, Marilyn Maye, Sonny & Cher and Glenn Yarbrough The son of a Welsh coal miner, Tom Jones avoided a life destined in the mines thanks to a case of tuberculosis when he was 12. Instead, he trained his voice, played the pubs, and cut a demo record that launched an international career singing blues, pop, country and gospel music. His first album, Along Came Jones (a.k.a. It's Not Unusual), hit No. 11 on the U.S. charts. More records followed, with such hits as What's New Pussycat, Delilah, Green, Green Grass of Home, She's a Lady, Kiss and Sex Bomb, as well as a TV series (This Is Tom Jones), and even a self-parodying film appearance (Mars Attacks!).\n\n1967: Bobbie Gentry Capitol Records Nominees: Lana Cantrell, The 5th Dimension, Harpers Bizarre and Jefferson Airplane After skipping a year, the Grammy's Best New Artist Award went to one of the first female country artists to write and produce her own material. Bobbie Gentry became a star with her ballad, Ode to Billie Joe (which had actually been the B-side of her debut single, Mississippi Delta). It spent four weeks at Number 1 on the Billboard charts in 1967. In addition to Best New Artist, Gentry won Grammys for Best Vocal Performance (Female) and Best Contemporary Group Performance (Vocal or Instrumental) for Ode to Billie Joe. Her follow-up recordings include the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song I'll Never Fall in Love Again, Let It Be Me and All I Have to Do Is Dream (both with Glen Campbell), Fancy, and But I Can't Get Back. In the '70s Gentry retired from performing.\n\n1968: José Feliciano RCA Records Nominees: Cream, Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, Jeannie C. Riley and O. C. Smith The Puerto Rican guitarist and singer's 1968 album Feliciano!, an Album of the Year nominee that reached Number 2 on the Billboard charts, featured his seminal cover of The Doors' Light My Fire. Feliciano, who was born blind, mixes various musical styles - flamenco, Latin pop, jazz, bolero - in recordings that have earned him 19 Grammy nominations and nine awards, including the Latin Recording Academy's Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\n1969: Crosby, Stills & Nash Atlantic Records Nominees: Chicago, Led Zeppelin, The Neon Philharmonic and Oliver Call it one of the first super groups. David Crosby (The Byrds), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield) and Graham Nash (The Hollies) were all part of popular bands before teaming to create the harmonies that make up CS&N. The trio's self-titled debut album, released in 1969, featured the songs Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Marrakesh Express. A spot at Woodstock that year helped cement their place in history -- leading to the subsequent Best New Artist Grammy win. The trio would go on to perform with Neil Young as CSN&Y, and each member ended up pursuing solo careers over the years. Crosby, Stills & Nash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. You can still catch these guys on the road, as they tour fairly regularly.\n\n1970: The Carpenters A&M Records Nominees: Elton John, Melba Moore, Anne Murray and The Partridge Family After a disappointing debut with the 1969 album Ticket to Ride, keyboardist Richard Carpenter and his sister, drummer Karen Carpenter, hit the big time with their second album, Close to You. Karen's mellow voice and Richard's arrangements produced such hits as the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song (They Long to Be) Close to You, We've Only Just Begun, and I'll Never Fall in Love Again. The Carpenters were nominated for eight Grammys in 1970 and won two (for Best New Artist and Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus). Eight more albums followed, before Karen's tragic death in 1983, from complications arising from anorexia nervosa. Richard Carpenter continued as a solo artist, with the 1987 album, Time, and 1998's Pianist - Arranger - Composer - Conductor.\n\n1971: Carly Simon Elektra Records Nominees: Chase, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds, and Bill Withers Carly Simon's 1971 self-titled debut featured the hit recording That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be, which earned her a Best Pop Female Vocalist Grammy nomination as well as the Best New Artist award. She recorded 24 more albums, and her repertoire included such classics as Anticipation, You Belong to Me, Coming Around Again, Jesse, Mockingbird (with James Taylor), You're So Vain, and Nobody Does It Better (from the James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me). Simon also won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Let the River Run from the Mike Nichols comedy, Working Girl.\n\n1972: America Warner Brothers Nominees: Harry Chapin, the Eagles, Loggins and Messina, and John Prine Dewey Bunnell, Dan Peek and Gerry Beckley are the voices behind America and the 1971 smash hit Horse With No Name. The track appeared on America's self-titled debut, and marked the first of a few hits for the trio. Later on came Ventura Highway and I Need You, followed by a return to the charts in the early '80s with You Can Do Magic. America continues to tour and release albums. In 2007 a host of musicians, who cite America as a big influence, recorded a tribute album to the group, Here & Now.\n\n1973: Bette Midler Atlantic Records Nominees: Eumir Deodato, Maureen McGovern, Marie Osmond and Barry White Born in Honolulu, Midler's stage career included the Broadway run of Fiddler on the Roof. But it was her performances in cabarets and gay bathhouses in the early 1970s, as well as in The Who's Tommy, that rocketed her to stardom as The Divine Miss M. Her hits included Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, From a Distance, The Rose, and Wind Beneath My Wings (the latter two of which won her Grammys). Midler also starred in such films as The Rose, Outrageous Fortune, Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Beaches, Ruthless People, For the Boys, and The First Wives Club. In 2013 she returned to Broadway in the one-woman play, I'll Eat You Last: A Chat with Sue Mengers, and won a Tony for Best Actress in a Musical for the 2017 revival of Hello, Dolly!\n\n1974: Marvin Hamlisch CBS News Nominees: Bad Company, Johnny Bristol, David Essex, Graham Central Station and Phoebe Snow Composer and arranger Marvin Hamlisch began his career as a rehearsal pianist for Barbra Streisand for the Broadway musical Funny Girl. In 1974 he won three Academy Awards, for The Way We Were (Best Original Song and Best Original Dramatic Score) and The Sting (Best Adaptation, for translating Scott Joplin's ragtime music). It wasn't long before he had even greater success, with the 1975 Broadway production A Chorus Line. Hamlisch's other music for film includes The Spy Who Loved Me, Ice Castles, Sophie's Choice, and The Mirror Has Two Faces. His Broadways scores include They're Playing Our Song, Smile and The Goodbye Girl. Hamlisch died in Los Angeles on August 6, 2012. He was 68.\n\n1975: Natalie Cole Capitol Records Nominees: Morris Albert, Amazing Rhythm Aces, Brecker Brothers, and KC and the Sunshine Band The daughter of singer Nat King Cole and Maria Hawkins Ellington (who had sung with the Duke Ellington Orchestra), Natalie's Cole's debut album, Inseparable, introduced her Top 10 hit, This Will Be, for which she won a Grammy for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, as well as Best New Artist. Cole was later nominated for another 19 Grammy Awards, and won seven, for her recordings of Sophisticated Lady, Unforgettable... with Love (in which she dueted with her late father), Take a Look, When I Fall in Love (also with Nat King Cole), and Still Unforgettable.\n\n1976: Starland Vocal Band Windsong/RCA Nominees: Boston, Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, The Brothers Johnson and Wild Cherry Starland Vocal Band (from left: Jon Carroll, Margot Chapman, Taffy Danoff and Bill Danoff) copped two Grammys in 1976, for Best New Artist and for Best Arrangement for Voices (Duo, Group Or Chorus) for their Afternoon Delight. It was the first song the group had ever recorded, and it hit Number One. The band starred in a 1977 summer replacement series on CBS, The Starland Vocal Band Show, a variety series whose cast included David Letterman (Yes, I can hear sets being clicked off all over this great land of ours!). The band dis-banded in 1981 and went on to solo careers.\n\n1977: Debby Boone Warner Brothers Nominees: Stephen Bishop, Shaun Cassidy, Foreigner and Andy Gibb Debby Boone's pop single You Light Up My Life, was perched at Number 1 on the Billboard charts for 10 weeks in 1977. Having won Best New Artist, her recording career would encompass country and inspirational, winning Grammys for With My Song and Keep The Flame Burning (with Phil Driscoll). After bowing out of recording to raise her family, Boone returned with 2005's Reflections if Rosemary, a tribute album dedicated to her mother-in-law, singer Rosemary Clooney, who'd died in 2002. In 2011 Boone recorded an album of standards, Swing This!\n\n1978: A Taste of Honey Capitol Records Nominees: The Cars, Elvis Costello, Chris Rea and Toto It would be several years before Janice M. Johnson, Perry Kibble, Donald R. Johnson and Hazel Payne (who had first played together in 1971) would find success with Capitol Records and their disco hit, Boogie Oogie Oogie. Renamed A Taste of Honey, the band sold two million copies of their debut album, which hit Number 1 on the charts. With new members the band failed to score another big hit with their follow-up albums, Another Taste and Twice As Sweet, and within two years, only vocalists Janice Johnson and Hazel Payne remained. In 1984 Johnson released a solo album, One Taste of Honey, and a second in 2000, Hiatus of the Heart. Hazel Payne left the group to pursue an acting career, but performed with Janice Johnson on two PBS reunion specials. Drummer/vocalist Donald Ray Johnson continues to perform blues in Calgary, Canada, and has toured with such artists as Teddy Pendergrass, Smokey Wilson and The Isley Brothers. Perry Kibble, who became a music producer in Canada, died of congestive heart failure in 1999 at age 49.\n\n1979: Rickie Lee Jones Warner Brothers Nominees: The Blues Brothers, Dire Straits, The Knack and Robin Williams Chuck E's In Love was just one of the songs on Rickie Lee Jones' debut album, a captivating blend of folk, R&B and jazz. The 21-year-old singer-songwriter, hailing from a long line of performers, was joined on her album by Dr. John, Michael McDonald and Randy Newman. An appearance on Saturday Night Live and an article in Time Magazine that labeled her The Duchess of Coolsville burnished her reputation. Nominated for five Grammys (including Record of the Year and Song of the Year), Jones won Best New Artist. Jones would record 20 more studio and live albums, her most recent being the 2012 folk rock album, The Devil You Know. In 1989 Jones shared a second Grammy with Dr. John for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group, for Makin' Whoopee. She has a new album due out in Spring 2015.\n\n1980: Christopher Cross Warner Brothers Nominees: Irene Cara, Robbie Dupree, Amy Holland and The Pretenders The singer-songwriter from San Antonio, Texas, whose eponymous 1979 album featured such classics as Ride Like the Wind and Sailing, is the only artist ever to sweep the Big Four Grammy categories (Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist) in a single year. His follow-ups included the chart-topping theme song from the Dudley Moore comedy, Arthur, and the 1983 album, Another Page.\n\n1981: Sheena Easton MGM/UA Nominees: Adam and the Ants, The Go-Go's, James Ingram and Luther Vandross The Scottish singer made a splash with her hit singles Modern Girl and 9 to 5 (released in the U.S. as Morning Train). With the 1981 James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only, Easton became the first singer to appear on screen performing the title song amid Maurice Binder's evocative visuals. Easton later shared the 1984 Best Mexican-American Performance Grammy for her duet with Luis Miguel, Me Gustas Tal Como Eres.\n\n1982: Men At Work Columbia Records Nominees: Asia, Jennifer Holliday, The Human League and Stray Cats Australian pop-rock group Men At Work, fronted by Colin Hay (with Russell Deppeler, Greg Ham, John Rees, Jerry Speiser, Ron Strykert), was formed in 1978, but it wasn't until 1982 that their first album reached the United States, featuring the hits Down Under and Who Could It Be Now? Two more albums followed, yet by 1986 Hay decided to call it quits and record a solo album. They reformed 10 years later -- only to disband again in 2002.\n\n1983: Culture Club Virgin Records Nominees: Big Country, Eurythmics, Men Without Hats and Musical Youth This English act made a big impact in the early '80s with the international hit Do You Really Want to Hurt Me. Led by singer Boy George, Culture Club (also featuring Michael Craig, Roy Hay and Jon Moss) released its debut album, Kissing to Be Clever, in 1982, and didn't waste much time with the next effort: 1983's Colour By Numbers, which featured the single Karma Chameleon. It was all enough to snag Culture Club the Best New Artist win in 1983. The band went on to release three more albums throughout the '80s and '90s. During that time, though, George's drug addiction and relationship with Culture Club drummer Moss took a toll on the band. Throughout the years Culture Club has broken up, staged reunions and found themselves on hiatus once again. A 2014 reunion tour -- with the original lineup -- was scrapped after George came down with a serious throat condition.\n\n1984: Cyndi Lauper Portrait Records; Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Nominees: Sheila E., Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Corey Hart, and The Judds Cyndi Lauper got her start performing in cover bands before branching out in 1983 with her debut solo effort, She's So Unusual, which featured the hits Girls Just Want to Have Fun, Time After Time, She Bop, and All Through the Night. The success catapulted the Queens, N.Y., native to fame and earned her the Best New Artist award at the 27th Grammys. She's since gone on to win a Tony and an Emmy -- now all Lauper needs is an Oscar to join the exclusive EGOT Club. Lauper has continued to experiment with her sound; her most recent studio set, 2010's Memphis Blues, was nominated for a Best Traditional Blues Album Grammy, and her 2012 Broadway musical, Kinky Boots, earned her a Best Musical Theater Album Grammy (left).\n\n1985: Sade Epic Records Nominees: a-ha, Freddie Jackson, Katrina and the Waves, and Julian Lennon As Best New Artist, the Nigerian-born British singer Sade Adu actually shared her Best New Artist Grammy with the fellow members of her band, also called Sade - Paul S. Denman, Andrew Hale and Stuart Matthewman. Their 1985 album Promise(their second released in the U.S.), featured such smooth tunes as The Sweetest Taboo, Is It a Crime, and Never As Good As the First Time. Sade later received three more Grammys - for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal (No Ordinary Love, 1993; and Soldier of Love, 2010), and Best Pop Vocal Album (Lovers Rock, 2010).\n\n1986: Bruce Hornsby & the Range RCA Records Nominees: Glass Tiger, Nu Shooz, Simply Red and Timbuk3 Prior to launching his solo career, singer-pianist Bruce Hornsby played clubs and bars, served as a session musician, and toured with Sheena Easton's band. In 1986 he released The Way It Is, the debut album from Bruce Hornsby & the Range (the Range included David Mansfield, George Marinelli, John Molo, Joe Puerta). The album's title track, with its references to the civil rights movement, hit the top of the charts and has since been sampled by various hip-hop artists. The success of the album, which also featured singles Mandolin Rain and Every Little Kiss, landed them the Best New Artist Grammy. Since then, Hornsby has put out albums with and without the Range; toured with the Grateful Dead; and formed the band, the Noisemakers. The Virginia native received another Grammy in 1990 for his reworking of The Valley Road with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and his track (Song H) was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental at the 2007 Grammy Awards.\n\n1987: Jody Watley MCA Records Nominees: Breakfast Club, Cutting Crew, Terence Trent D'Arby and Swing Out Sister A dance music pioneer, Jody Watley began her professional career as a teenager on the TV show Soul Train, and became a member of the group Shalamar. Among their albums was Uptown Festival, Big Fun, Three For Love, Friends, and The Look. Watley then signed a solo contract with MCA, which released Jody Watley in 1987. Among its hits were Looking for a New Love, Still a Thrill and Don't You Want Me. Her 2006 album, The Makeover, paid tribute to the styles of Karen Carpenter, Chic and Diana Ross. Watley received the Billboard Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.\n\n1988: Tracy Chapman Elektra Records Nominees: Rick Astley, Toni Childs, Take 6 and Vanessa L. Williams The singer-songwriter best known for the songs Talkin' 'bout a Revolution and Fast Car won three Grammys for her 1988 eponymous acoustic album, including Best New Artist. Tracy Chapman sold six million copies on the U.S., and hit Number One on the Billboard charts. Chapman has released seven more albums, most recently 2008's Our Bright Future (a Grammy nominee for Best Contemporary Folk Album).\n\n1989: Milli Vanilli Arista Records Nominees: Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Soul II Soul and Tone Lōc Milli Vanilli rose to fame in the late '80s and early '90s following the release of the hit album, Girl You Know It's True. Rob Morvan and Rob Pilatus served as the faces of the popular German duo, though the world would soon learn that they did not provide vocals on any of their recordings -- but not before Milli Vanilli swooped up the Best New Artist honor at the Grammys. The award was later revoked -- the only time a Grammy win has ever been vacated -- and several lawsuits followed. Morvan and Pilatus attempted to make music on their own, under a different group name, but it failed to gain any traction. Years later, in 1998, Milli Vanilli started prepping a comeback album, called Back and In Attack, but the set never saw the light of day. Pilatus died on April 2, 1998 at the age of 32 of a suspected alcohol and prescription pill overdose -- right before the launch of a promotional tour for the LP.\n\n1990: Mariah Carey Columbia Records Nominees: The Black Crowes, The Kentucky Headhunters, Wilson Phillips and Lisa Stansfield Mariah Carey's killer voice (with a five-octave vocal range) burst onto the music scene in 1990 with her self-titled debut album. The Long Island native would soon become a major force on radio, scoring four No. 1 hits off her first effort, including Vision of Love and I Don't Wanna Cry. Carey ended up winning Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for Vision of Love, along with the Best New Artist honor. She would win three more Grammys, out of 29 nominations. She's also dabbled in acting (in the ill-fated Glitter in 2001), and sat at the judges' table on Fox's American Idol. In May 2015, she set up shop in Las Vegas for a residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.\n\n1991: Marc Cohn Atlantic Records Nominees: Boyz II Men, C+C Music Factory, Color Me Badd and Seal Folk-rock singer-songwriter Marc Cohn is best known for Walking in Memphis, the single off his 1991 self-titled debut album. The Cleveland, Ohio-born singer has said the track, which helped land him the Best New Artist Grammy, was mostly autobiographical. Walking in Memphis also received nominations for Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance at the 34th annual Grammy Awards. Cohn has continually released albums and toured over the years, but has yet to score another radio hit like he did with Walking in Memphis.\n\n1992: Arrested Development Chrysalis Records/EMI Nominees: Billy Ray Cyrus, Sophie B. Hawkins, Kris Kross and Jon Secada Before Arrested Development became the name of a cult TV show, it was actually the name of an alternative hip-hop group formed in Atlanta in 1988. Arrested Development won two Grammy Awards in 1993 for Best New Artist and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Rolling Stone also named Arrested Development Band of the Year in 1993, thanks to the group's debut album, 3 Years, 5 Months & 2 Days in the Life Of..., which spawned the catchy singles Tennessee, People Everyday and Mr. Wendel. The band is still together and has consistently released albums over the years, but none as successful as that first one.\n\n1993: Toni Braxton LaFace Nominees: Belly, Blind Melon, Digable Planets and SWV Toni Braxton and her sisters (Tamar, Towanda, Traci and Trina) were signed to Arista in the late 1980s as The Braxtons. That led to Toni recording two songs for the soundtrack of the Eddie Murphy comedy Boomerang, including a duet with Kenneth Babyface Edmonds, Give U My Heart. Toni Braxton, the R&B singer-songwriter's first album (which included the hits Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again), hit Number 1 on the Billboard chart, and sold 10 million copies worldwide. Seven more albums followed, including Secrets (15 million copies sold). Her Number 1 hit singles include You're Making Me High, Let It Flow and Un-Break My Heart. In addition to her two 1993 Grammys, Braxton would win four more awards in the category of Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (Breathe Again, You're Makin' Me High,  Un-Break My Heart and He Wasn't Man Enough), and one for Best R&B Album, for Love, Marriage & Divorce (with Babyface). Financial difficulties led to her declaring bankruptcy in 1996, but she rebounded. Outside of recording, Braxton appeared on Broadway in Beauty and the Beast, competed in season seven of Dancing With the Stars, and starred in the reality TV series, Braxton Family Values. Her memoir, Unbreak My Heart, was published in 2014. Braxton earned three more Grammy nominations in 2018, for Long As I Live and the album, Sex & Cigarettes.\n\n1994: Sheryl Crow DAN GROSHONG/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: Ace of Base, Blind Melon, Digable Planets and SWV Sheryl Crow sang backing vocals for some high-profile singers (Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Don Henley) before launching a solo career and releasing her debut album Tuesday Night Music Club in 1993, with the hits All I Wanna Do and Strong Enough. The single Leaving Las Vegas also found some chart success. It was all enough to earn Crow the Best New Artist win shortly after coming on the scene. That wouldn't be her last Grammy win. At the same Grammy ceremony she also nabbed Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year for All I Wanna Do. In total, she's received nine Grammys. Crow went on to release eight more albums and nab a big radio hit with Kid Rock on Picture. She's currently working on a new release for 2015.\n\n1995: Hootie & the Blowfish Atlantic Records Nominees: Brandy, Alanis Morissette, Joan Osborne and Shania Twain Formed in 1986 at the University of South Caroline, Hootie & the Blowfish came on the scene in 1994 with its debut album, Cracked Rear View -- still one of the Top 20 best-selling albums of all time. With radio hits Hold My Hand, Let Her Cry and Only Wanna Be with You, it was difficult to avoid this band in the mid-'90s.

Correspondent Erin Moriarty investigates the disappearance of Jennifer Dulos, a Connecticut mother of five, and the case against Fotis Dulos and Michelle Troconis in What Does The Other Woman Know? The Disappearance of Jennifer Dulos airing Saturday, February 13 at 10/9c on CBS.\n\nWhat does 46-year-old Michelle Troconis know? Does she know what happened to Jennifer Dulos, the Connecticut mother who vanished without a trace from her home on May 24, 2019? And if Jennifer Dulos was murdered, does Troconis know how and where Dulos' killer put her body? Connecticut authorities believe Troconis may hold the key to the mystery of the missing mom and can lead them to Jennifer Dulos' remains. They have charged her with conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with evidence in the case.\n\nIn newly released portions of interrogation videos, Troconis, the former girlfriend of Jennifer's estranged husband, is seen answering questions, at times pleading with investigators. Her attorney says he has seen no evidence that Troconis knows what happened to Jennifer and says she is simply a victim of overzealous investigators desperate to solve the case.\n\nMichelle Troconis and Fotis Dulos Sotiria Kontouli\n\nMichelle Troconis has a lot in common with the woman she is accused of helping to kill: tall, willowy, and talented, both women fell hard for the same man, Fotis Dulos, a handsome, charismatic home developer and daring athlete. By the time Troconis met Fotis Dulos in 2016, his 12-year marriage to Jennifer had run out of steam. They were essentially living separate lives in a huge home Fotis had built in Farmington, Connecticut. Fotis Dulos thrived on excitement and athletic competition while Jennifer mainly focused her energies into the day-to-day caring of five young children. Once a playwright and co-founder of a theatre troupe, Jennifer put her passions into loving and writing about her children, all under the age of 13.\n\nFotis, a waterskiing champion, hoped the same for his children and traveled with them to competitions. During his travels, he met and fell for Troconis, who was also a talented athlete. He met her in Miami and it was serious, says his sister, Rena Dulos Kyrimi. He was very much in love. The problem was Fotis Dulos was still very much married and living with Jennifer.\n\nTroconis never intended to become the other woman says her family. She thought the couple was already divorcing and didn't know the truth, they say, until long after she uprooted her life and moved with her daughter to Connecticut.\n\nJennifer Dulos Carrie Luft\n\nAfter Jennifer Dulos learned of her husband's affair in early 2017, she left him and moved their children into a rented home 70 miles away in New Canaan, Connecticut. The once-happy union became a bitter, contentious divorce and custody battle that drained Fotis Dulos of much of what mattered to him: money, work and, when he defied a court order and allowed his girlfriend to have contact with his children, he also lost shared physical custody.\n\nOn Friday morning, May 24, 2019, Jennifer, 50, vanished after taking her children to school. Her Suburban SUV was later found abandoned a little over three miles from her home. Soon after police found evidence of blood inside Jennifer's garage, the missing person case became a homicide investigation. What investigators discovered next put Jennifer's estranged 51-year-old husband on the top of the list of suspects. That's when his girlfriend Michelle Troconis became a person of interest as well.\n\nAfter Fotis Dulos gave investigators his cellphone, they discovered that he had been on Albany Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut, the night that Jennifer went missing. As they collected surveillance footage of the area, they saw a man who looked like Fotis Dulos dropping off black bags in trash cans on the street. And a woman seen leaning out of his truck appeared to be Michelle Troconis. What investigators later found in those bags convinced them they had Jennifer's killer: zip ties coated with human blood and Jennifer Dulos' DNA, two ponchos covered with copious amounts of blood and more DNA belonging to Jennifer Dulos. As lead investigator Sergeant Ken Ventresca of the Connecticut State police later said, It's not every day someone throws out bloody evidence, bloody clothes, you know, cut up. I mean who does that?\n\nThe next day, both Fotis Dulos and Michelle Troconis were arrested and charged with tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. Seven months later, in January 2020, when investigators still could not locate Jennifer Dulos, they charged her husband with murder and upgraded Troconis' charges to conspiracy to commit murder. Kent Mawhinney, a friend and sometime lawyer for Fotis Dulos, was also charged with conspiracy to commit murder. All three pleaded not guilty. Just weeks later, Fotis Dulos was dead after taking his own life.\n\nThe death of Fotis Dulos left Michelle Troconis in a precarious legal position, says her attorney, Jon Schoenhorn. I think the right expression here is, 'she's left holding the bag.' Authorities still plan on pursuing charges including conspiracy to commit murder against Troconis, leaving her facing the possibility of years in prison for the death of a woman she never met and whose body has never been found.\n\nLate last year, Michelle Troconis, two of her sisters and her father met with 48 Hours in Connecticut. Troconis is very thin, with the weight of the past year etched in her eyes and face. Although she declined to answer questions, her attorney and family answered an array of questions ranging from why Troconis moved to Connecticut in the first place to what she knew about Jennifer Dulos' disappearance.\n\nThey say that when Michelle Troconis moved with her young daughter to Connecticut, she knew nothing about the difficulties in the Dulos marriage. Attorney Schoenhorn says Fotis lied to Michelle, telling her that the couple was amicably divorcing.\n\nWell, hindsight, of course, is 20/20, right? Schoenhorn said. ...Had she even known about how contentious the relationship became between Jennifer and Fotis, she never would have moved up here. And Fotis Dulos didn't just lie to Michelle, says her family. He lied to all of them as well.\n\nMichelle's youngest sister, Claudia, insists Michelle had no involvement in Jennifer Dulos' disappearance. She's never been a violent person, Claudia says. She's never been revengeful, you know. ... She's a mother herself.\n\nBut what about the surveillance footage that appears to show Michelle inside Fotis Dulos' truck as he is discarding that incriminating trash on Albany Avenue in Hartford? Schoenhorn says he knows of no evidence that Michelle knew Jennifer Dulos was missing at that point or that she had any idea what was inside the black bags.\n\nSchoenhorn says no physical evidence ties Michelle to any of the evidence recovered from that night and points to those police videos that, he says, show Michelle cooperating with police. She not only did not know what was in those bags, says Schoenhorn, ...she told police this multiple times, she had no idea what he was actually doing.\n\nBut Connecticut investigators say Michelle Troconis changed her stories over the course of three interviews and they believe she knows more than what she is saying.\n\nDoes Michelle Troconis know what happened to Jennifer Dulos? If she doesn't, it's just possible that Fotis Dulos took that secret to his grave, leaving his own children a terrible legacy of loss.
President Trump and Vice President Pence met with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House Thursday during Varadkar's annual trip ahead of St. Patrick's Day. Varadkar brought a very special guest to breakfast at Pence's residence at the Naval Observatory — his partner, Dr. Matthew Barrett.\n\nLast year you and Karen said that my partner, Matthew, would be welcome to join us, and we're both really honored to accept the invitation this year, Varadkar said during the Friends of Ireland breakfast.\n\nVice President Mike Pence invited me and Matt to his home at the Naval Observatory this morning.

In 2015, Ireland's citizens voted in a landslide to legalize same-sex marriage — the first country to do so in a national popular vote.\n\nI lived in a country where, if I'd tried to be myself at the time, it would have ended up breaking laws, the Irish prime minister said Thursday. But today, that is all changed. I stand here, leader of my country, flawed and human, but judged by my political actions, and not by my sexual orientation, my skin tone, gender or religious beliefs.\n\nThanks to the Vice President and his sister for a lovely morning at his home. What a great way to start this St Patrick's weekend pic.twitter.com/2tzLEOTTpt — Leo Varadkar (@campaignforleo) March 14, 2019\n\nPence, a conservative Christian, has opposed same-sex marriage throughout his career, as well as the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy. He's received harsh criticism from social activists for pursuing anti-LGBTQ policies during his time as governor of Indiana. In January, his wife, Karen Pence, faced criticism for taking a teaching job at a Christian school that bans LGBTQ students and faculty. She did not attend the breakfast Thursday.\n\nPence called Varadkar's remarks at the breakfast inspiring. We're also really honored to be joined by your partner, Dr. Matthew Barrett. He does great work at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the vice president said.
GOLDEN, Colo. - A Colorado man being re-tried in his wife's murder denies any involvement in her death or their daughter's disappearance.\n\nMichael Blagg took the stand Tuesday, something he didn't do during his first trial, CBS Denver reports.\n\nHe told jurors in Golden that he came home from work in November 2001, and was very distressed that something horrible had happened when he found a blood-soaked mattress in the couple's bedroom.\n\nThere were no signs of his wife, Jennifer Blagg, or their 6-year-old daughter, Abby.\n\nBlagg said he called 911 to report Jennifer and Abby missing, but said on cross-examination that he didn't search for them in the house first.\n\nSeveral months later, Jennifer Blagg's body was found in a landfill near refuse from the company where Michael Blagg worked. Abby was never found.\n\nBlagg testified that he had attempted suicide a few months after his wife and daughter disappeared, because he was told there was no hope of finding them alive, and because he was being targeted by investigators.\n\nBlagg also said that he and his wife had arguments over their use of pornography to aid their sex life-- but that there was no reason for the marriage to end, reports CBS Denver.\n\nOn Monday, Blagg's defense team said hairs were found in the couple's bed that did not belong to either Michael or Jennifer.\n\nBlagg was found guilty of murder in 2004 in Mesa County but his conviction was later overturned because a juror concealed her experience with domestic violence.
MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A publishing house has canceled plans to publish a book by a Tennessee pastor who has been accused of sexual assault. The Commercial Appeal and The New York Times report Christian publisher Bethany House announced Monday that it canceled publication of The Ridiculously Good Marriage by Andy Savage. The publisher said the book may remain on retail websites for a short time until those are updated.\n\nThe move comes after allegations by a woman who said Savage sexually assaulted her while she was a 17-year-old high school senior in Texas in 1998.\n\nSavage made a confession this past Sunday at Highpoint Church in Memphis, Tennessee, CBS News' Jericka Duncan reported.\n\nAs a college student on staff at a church in Texas more than 20 years ago, I regretfully had a sexual incident with a female high school senior in the church, he said.\n\nHis request for forgiveness got a standing ovation from the congregation.\n\nJules Woodson was 17 years old when she says she was sexually assaulted by Savage during a ride home from church. At the time, Savage was a 22-year-old youth minister at a Houston church. Woodson recently went public about her story on a Christian blog.\n\nI did it because I was scared and I was in shock and I didn't understand what was happening, Woodson said.\n\nShe said she notified a different pastor, who told her to keep quiet. She said Savage left the church weeks later.\n\nIn the wake of the Me Too movement, Woodson felt the need to speak up. She sent Savage an email last month. He didn't respond until Monday, and she said he apologized.
Queen Elizabeth's eldest grandson Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn Phillips have decided to divorce, according to a statement issued on their behalf. Phillips — the son of Princess Anne and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips — and his wife are ending their marriage after nearly 12 years.\n\nThe couple married in 2008 at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, the same castle where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed 10 years later. Phillips met his wife, who then went by Autumn Kelly, a Canadian, at Canada's Grand Prix in Montreal in 2003, according to the BBC.\n\nAccording to their statement, the couple first notified the royal family of their split last year.\n\nPeter Phillips and Autumn Phillips attend Royal Ascot at Ascot Racecourse on June 22, 2019 in Ascot, England. Getty Images\n\nAfter informing HM The Queen and members of both families last year, Peter and Autumn jointly agreed to separate, reads the statement.\n\nPhillips, 42, is a member of the royal family, but does not have an official title and is not a working royal, the BBC reports. His mother, Princess Anne, rejected the queen's offer of royal titles for her two children, Peter and Zara Phillips.\n\nThe couple's statement says they reached the conclusion that divorce was the best course of action for their two children and ongoing friendship.\n\nThe couple has two young daughters, Savannah, 9, and Isla, 7, whom they raised in Gloucestershire, England.\n\nThe decision to divorce and share custody came about after many months of discussions and although sad, is an amicable one, reads the statement. The couple's first priority will remain the continued well being and upbringing of their wonderful daughters.\n\nBoth families were naturally sad at the announcement, but fully supportive of Peter and Autumn in the joint decision to co parent their children, according to the statement.\n\nThe royal family has had a tumultuous start to the year, beginning with the announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, would step back from their senior royal roles, and no longer be official working members of the royal family.\n\nHarry and Meghan have said they plan to split their time between the United Kingdom and North America. Since their announcement, the couple has been spotted in Vancouver, Canada, where Meghan previously lived.
First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a whole bunch of made-for-reality TV drama, and then comes a baby in a baby carriage.\n\n\n\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna may not be doing it in that exact order, but TMZ reports that the 29-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and his fiancée of one month are expecting their first child together.\n\nThe couple seemingly confirmed the news themselves when they Instagrammed a pregnant avatar of Chyna and tagged each other over her belly.\n\n👶🏽🎉 A photo posted by www.Lashedbar.co (@blacchyna) on May 6, 2016 at 11:14am PDT\n\n\n\nThis will be Rob's first child and the 27-year-old model's second -- as you surely already know, she has a 3-year-old song, King, with Tyga. As you surely also know, Tyga is now dating Rob's younger sister, Kylie Jenner. Which makes the family tree very ... complicated.\n\nWhile Rob's sisters previously called their engagement f**ked up, it seems the family has since come around to the new couple.\n\nKylie is over the relationship, a source previously told ET. It was tough for her in the beginning. But she sees how happy he is and all she wants is for him to be happy. The general consensus in the house is 'Praise Chyna! Don't go!' They finally got the brother they always knew back.\n\nFind out more in the video below.

And while his work may deal with grief, injustice and loss, for the most part Marshall focuses on everyday life: picnics and street scenes, daily rituals, and quiet moments -- a window into a world rarely represented in fine art.\n\nWe're used to hearing narratives of trauma, tragedy, disenfranchisement, pain, suffering, Marshall told correspondent Alex Wagner. Few of the stories that normalize the everyday life of people who are not always experiencing trauma 24/7. And I think those things need to be represented as well as anything else that we read about in the newspaper or we see on the news.\n\nGALLERY: The art of Kerry James Marshall\n\nFor more info:\n\nJayne Houdyshell and Laurie Metcalf in A Doll's House, Part 2.

The smartest advice I've gotten about betting on the Oscars is: Don't put your money on what you like best. You're just begging to lose.\n\nKEEP SCORE: Download our Academy Awards nominations ballot for your office pool or Oscar party (pdf)\n\nThe trick is to project yourself into the head of the average Academy voter, who – wanting you to keep buying tickets – is trying to project him- or herself into your (the average moviegoer's) head. So, it's a nutty feedback loop.\n\nSome people have said, Why would they nominate junk like 'Joker'? No one has a clue, especially me! But I do know Joker won't win Best Picture, which is fine. I thought it was one unpleasant note hit harder and harder. But Joaquin Phoenix will take Best Actor, because he's the best unhinged movie actor in the world, and he's never had a part with fewer hinges.\n\nCementing the idea that borderline personalities are in is the lock for Renée Zellweger in Judy. She nails Judy Garland who in the end was torn between sashaying onstage or jumping out the nearest window.\n\nThe best supporting turn was by Joe Pesci in The Irishman in a non-Joe Pesci role – conflict-averse. But I'll still be thrilled when Brad Pitt wins for Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.\n\nLaura Dern has won every other award as a calculating divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. But the twice-nominated Scarlett Johannsen could sneak in as the classiest character in the slapstick Nazi weeper Jo Jo Rabbit, a hodgepodge that's well-liked in Hollywood.\n\nBest Director? I predict Bong Joon-Ho for Parasite, with its surreal metaphor for income inequality – beautiful people on top, underclass below – and underclass under the underclass waiting to pop out and say Boo!\n\nBut Best Picture? 1917, the kind of movie Hollywood adores: state-of-the-art, wedded to old-fashioned, lump-in-the-throat anti-war melodrama. New and old … that's what they like. That's what they think you'll like.\n\nI'll be watching for the edgier stuff – the complaints about lack of diversity, Netflix, the president (don't forget him!), and also to see how presenters address the legacy of Kirk Douglas.\n\nYou will see a longing for change, side-by-side with a dread of change. Bet on it!\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Robbyn McFadden.
Hilary Duff's divorce from her ex, retired NHL star Mike Comrie, has been finalized.\n\nThe Younger actress, who filed for divorce in February 2015 citing irreconcilable differences, will have to pay her ex $2,408,786.40. This specific number equals 50 percent of the value of the couple's Beverly Hills mansion, which Duff will keep.\n\nOn top of the money, Comrie will also get to keep a number of the couple's valuable vehicles, including a 2014 Bentley and a 2013 Mercedes SUV, as well as some jewelry and several joint possessions.\n\nThe couple signed an enforceable prenuptial agreement before tying the knot, meaning they share no community property. Anything either of them earned before, during, or after their marriage remains theirs. Additionally, neither Duff, 28, nor Comrie, 35, are on the hook for spousal support.\n\nAccording to legal documents obtained by ET, the couple have also been awarded joint custody of their 3-year-old son, Luca Cruz Comrie, even though Duff initially asked for primary custody in her February 2015 divorce filing. They will also evenly split all child-rearing expenses.\n\nDuff and Comrie began dating in 2007, got engaged in February 2010 and tied the knot later that year, in August, during a ceremony in Santa Barbara. The couple welcomed Luca, their only child, in March 2012.\n\nThe couple announced their amicable separation in January 2014, more than a year before Duff would officially file for divorce. The actress opened up about the split in Cosmopolitan last March.\n\nIt wasn't working well enough to stay together, but there was still a lot of love involved, she said. It was just a slow set-in of us not being the match that we used to be. I'm lucky for the person he is and I am, and how we decided to handle this.
Starbucks has crafted a brand focused not only on coffee, but also on living up to progressive ideals. Now, that brand image is taking a hit following a racial bias incident at one of its stores.\n\nFewer consumers say they're as likely to buy food or drinks at Starbucks (SBUX) following the incident, according to new data from YouGov BrandIndex, a service that tracks brand perception. Last week, a Philadelphia store manager had two black men arrested when they refused to leave after using the store's restroom without making a purchase.\n\nThe backlash from the incident -- which has sparked protests and apologies from its CEO -- caused the company's consumer perception to drop to its lowest since November 2015, when the chain got criticized for replacing a symbol-filled holiday cup with a simple red design. About 25 percent of consumers surveyed said they would consider making a purchase at Starbucks on Tuesday, compared with 28 percent on Friday.\n\nBuzz about Starbucks has also dropped into negative territory, YouGov found. Its Buzz score, which is based on whether consumers say they've heard anything positive or negative about a brand, fell from 13 to -8 on Tuesday.\n\nThere might be some people who are passing by a Starbucks and might keep going, whereas before they might have stopped in, said Ted Marzilli, chief executive officer of data products at YouGov.\n\nIt's possible the impact will be short-lived, especially if no other incidents occur that mirror the racial bias of the Philadelphia arrest. However, another alleged incident of racial bias emerged in Los Angeles, when a black man claimed he was denied access to a bathroom at a Los Angeles store in January, even though a white man was given the entry code. Neither were paying customers.\n\nIt's interesting and ironic this is happening at Starbucks, because it's been at the forefront of progressive causes, Marzilli noted. It was very same-sex-marriage friendly, and its customers tend to say they believe society is much better when people of different races live in the same neighborhood or community.\n\nBy hitching itself to a progressive image, Starbucks may cause consumers to be more critical of it because they're likely to expect actions that match its rhetoric. There's some sense of betrayal, Marzilli said.\n\nStarbucks said it will close all of its stores on May 29 for racial bias training, which could cost the company about $7 million in lost sales.\n\nThe onus is on Starbucks to follow through with things its CEO talked about, Marzilli said. The store closing is a manifestation of that, but the downside is the end of May is a long way away. That's a lot of time for people to fill out that space with another narrative before Starbucks can implement that day of training.
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel may have been feeling groovy when they sang The 59th Street Bridge Song all those years ago, but they've had many a rough moment since. This morning, on Garfunkel's 76th birthday, Rita Braver talks with a rock music legend (This story was originally broadcast on November 5, 2017):\n\nCan you believe I'm still doing this?\n\nRandom House\n\nYes he is! More than 50 years after Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel first hit the pop charts, at 76 Art Garfunkel is touring solo.\n\nBraver asked, Do you ever get tired of singing these songs, the ones that everybody wants to hear?\n\nNot really, he replied. I wouldn't do them if I didn't love them. I don't need to do this job. I do it only for love now.\n\nGarfunkel grew up in Queens, N.Y., his dad a salesman, his mom a homemaker.\n\nYou had two brothers, Braver said. Must have been pretty rambunctious in there.\n\nYeah, we fought all the time. That's what you do. What else do brothers do? They put a pillow over each other's heads, then they pound the pillow!\n\nBut Garfunkel was the one with the special gift.\n\nI would sing what I heard on the radio -- 'They try to tell us we're too young,' Nat King Cole. And I observed about age five or six, I can sing. This is nice.\n\nDid you dream of becoming a professional singer? Braver asked.\n\nPaul Simon and Art Garfunkel as Tom & Jerry, 1957. Publicity Photo\n\nNot at all, he said. I never actually thought that way until I met Paul Simon, when we were 11 and we met each other and practiced.\n\nThat grade school friendship would lead to one of the most popular duos in American musical history, and one of the most complicated, then and now.\n\nGarfunkel was often the lead singer, as well as arranger. But it was Simon who wrote the songs that have become classics. And so, Art Garfunkel says, he had a purpose in writing his recent memoir, What Is It All but Luminous (Knopf).\n\nI suppose, if I examine my inner mind, I would say, 'Time to come out of the shadow of Paul Simon and establish yourself as a thinking artist who can sing.' I know myself to be a creative guy, and I think my profile out in show business is 'the guy over Paul Simon's right shoulder.'\n\nWEB EXTRA: Read an excerpt from What It Is All but Luminous\n\nIn high school, they performed as Tom and Jerry, but split during college, only to reunite in 1963 as Simon & Garfunkel.\n\nTwo years later they had a number one hit, The Sounds of Silence:\n\nThe hit songs and albums would keep on coming.\n\nTheir music was even used in the groundbreaking 1967 Mike Nichols film, The Graduate.\n\nAnd then, Nichols offered Garfunkel a role in another film. He knew I wasn't an actor, but he was clever, Garfunkel said. He drove by in his limo to my house on 68th Street, rolls down the window and hands me a script: 'Catch 22.' 'Read this, Artie, I see a part for you. Look at Nately, Captain Nately.'\n\nHe followed it up playing Jack Nicholson's best friend in Carnal Knowledge.\n\nLeft: Art Garfunkel, Alan Arkin and Martin Sheen in Catch-22. Right: Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel in Carnal Knowledge. Paramount/Avco Embassy\n\nBut as for Simon & Garfunkel? They would release their fifth and final album in 1970. As Garfunkel put it in his book, The end of S&G slipped in on me. There never was an ending.\n\nBraver asked, Do you have a better analysis now that you look back on it? Or do you just like to think of it that way?\n\nI think the laughs were used up, he replied. We were tired of each other. All that studio togetherness, and when you finish, you have to go on tour together. When do I get a break from my funny friend? The jokes are not happening now.\n\nGarfunkel would weather some tough times. He stopped performing for a while after a brief, unhappy marriage. And later, he lost a long-time girlfriend to a drug overdose. But taking long walks helped.\n\nSo did reading. I go from book to book, he said. I do about two books a month.\n\nHe's up to 1,160 books, all carefully arranged in his New York study. I told you, I'm a nutcase.\n\nArt Garfunkel with correspondent Rita Braver in the singer's library. CBS News\n\nThe study also holds photos of his family -- his two sons with second wife, Kathryn, an actress and singer. They have been married since 1988.\n\nBraver asked, How did meeting her change your life?\n\nI got comfortable with life, he laughed.\n\nBy then, he was also comfortable with his music again … and his old pal, Paul Simon. At their legendary 1981 concert in Central Park, half a million people cheered.\n\nTo watch Art Garfunkel perform Bridge Over Troubled Water in The Concert in Central Park click on the video player below:\n\nBut Garfunkel, who can be fussy, saw it differently. In his book, the workaholic voted himself a C+, because I didn't get it as right as I wanted to get it.\n\nHe would have plenty of chances to get it right … two more tours with Simon, and solo gigs, too.\n\nAnd then in February of 2010, he lost his voice.\n\nYeah, I finished touring with Paul, I came home, and a month later I lost my voice, he said. My speech was very erratic. My singing was just not there.\n\nIt would take four long, hard years to get it back. And today Art Garfunkel is savoring every moment.\n\nBut what about his relationship with his old friend? He says they are at one of their low points.\n\nYou think it'll get better? Braver asked.\n\nIs he watching this show? Garfunkel said. Paul, turn off the TV! Yeah, it might. I think so. It might. We never know the future. I believe life is a surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Kay Lim.
LONDON -- A treasure trove of history goes up for auction on Wednesday -- newly discovered letters to and from a former first lady.\n\nAn old, battered briefcase containing the secrets of two battered lives. A case full of letters between a former British ambassador to Washington and a widowed woman he knew well. A woman named Jackie Kennedy.\n\nThe minute we cracked open the boxes, I saw her loopy handwriting and her loopy Js and I immediately knew it was Jackie Kennedy, said Matthew Haley, Head of Books and Manuscripts, for Bonhams auction house in the U.K., where the items will hit the block.\n\nHaley found the letters locked away in a British country home when the house contents were put up for sale.\n\nTo understand them, you have to roll back the clock to the Camelot years when David Ormsby-Gore, an old friend of JFK's, was British ambassador to Washington and the Kennedys and the Ormsby-Gores were great friends.\n\nThen fate took over, a few years after JFK was killed, Ormsby-Gore's wife Sylvia died, too, in a car crash.\n\nMaybe it was their common tragedies -- or their friendship -- or mutual affection, but in the following years Jackie and David became an item -- vacationing together, including in Cambodia.\n\nJackie Kennedy and former British ambassador to Washington, David Ormsby-Gore, on vacation in Cambodia. CBS News\n\nThe salutations on the letters are Dear David, dear dear David, dearest David ... were these love letters going back and forth?\n\nI think they are. She -- particularly the way she signs off you know she says 'with all my love,' Haley said. I think this is a real warmth there.\n\nThe letters contain no marriage proposal, but there's a clear sign one was made -- and rejected.\n\nWhen Jackie decided to marry Aristotle Onassis instead, Ormsby-Gore writes as a bitter, heartbroken man.\n\nLetters between Jackie Kennedy and David Ormsby-Gore. CBS News\n\nAs for your photograph, I weep when I look at it, Ormsby-Gore wrote.\n\nHer last letter to him has a touch of finality and -- it must be said -- cruelty.\n\nShe's writing from Aristotle Onassis' yacht, Haley says. With a Greek stamp and the stationary of his yacht, the Christina.\n\nAnd that was that. Or was it?\n\nWhen David Ormsby-Gore died 17 years later -- also in a car crash -- Jackie went to his funeral.
President Trump's first wife, Ivana, called his third wife, Melania Trump family, in an interview that aired Tuesday.\n\nI sent Melania the text, that the last thing I would like to do is say something bad about you, you know because you are family. And I don't say anything bad or do anything back to the family member, she said in an interview on Fox News' Fox and Friends.\n\nAsked if she thinks she should be first lady, Ivana said, Not at all because she said, Washington is tough, tough town. I was asked to be American ambassador to Czech Republic. I told him, I said, you know, if he would ask me 10, 15 years ago I would do it.\n\nIvana said, I think Donald is a good man, and he is trying to do the best he can and he's going to run the country as his business. He will negotiate.\n\nDescribing what it was like to raise their children, Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr., she said that Mr. Trump was always on the phone and wasn't a classic father who would take them on walks through Central Park.\n\nI would take the kids to Europe for two months -- June and July -- and they would fly economy, and I would fly first class, you know? and Ivanka said, 'Can i be upgraded?' I said, 'When you can afford it, you get upgraded.'\n\nThe Fox News interview with Ivana Trump was recorded before an interview that aired over the weekend on CBS Sunday Morning interview, in which she said she gets along with Melania Trump. One is nobody. And the other one is first lady, she said, referring to but not naming Marla Maples, the model who broke up his marriage to Ivana Trump. On Monday, Ivana said in another interview that she is first lady.\n\nI don't really want to call him there because Melania is there, and I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, Ivana said on ABC's Good Morning America. Because I'm basically first Trump wife, okay? I'm first lady, okay?\n\nFirst lady spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, dismissed Ivana Trump's remark as having no substance.\n\nMrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, DC and is honored by her role as First Lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books, Grisham said.\n\nCBS News' Emily Tillett contributed to this report.
LOS ANGELES -- Meryl Streep will star in the second season of Big Little Lies, HBO said Wednesday, adding yet another high-profile lead to the Nicole Kidman-Reese Witherspoon drama. In a statement Wednesday, HBO said Streep will play Mary Louise Wright, the mother-in-law of Kidman's character, Celeste.\n\nMary Louise comes seeking answers about last season's violent death of her son, Perry, played by Alexander Skarsgard.\n\nKidman and Witherspoon star in and produce the series, which reaped Emmy, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards as best series. Kidman, Skarsgard and Laura Dern also collected multiple trophies.\n\nStreep, the most-nominated actor in Oscar history, picked up her 21st nod for this year's awards for her role in the newspaper drama The Post.\n\nStreep snagged an Emmy statue for her leading role in HBO's Angels in America. Her move to Big Little Lies will be her next big TV gig since then.\n\nHBO says season two will focus on the the malignancy of lies, the durability of friendships, the fragility of marriage ... and, of course, the vicious ferocity of sound parenting.\n\nMajor film stars have been lured to TV by the cable and programming boon, but Streep is the biggest catch yet -- especially at a time in which the industry has been forced to pay heed to its treatment of women by the sexual misconduct scandal and pay parity criticism.\n\nNo air date has been set.
