NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Former Attorney General Kathleen Kane was sentenced Monday to 10 to 23 months in jail for illegally disclosing details from a grand jury investigation to embarrass a rival and lying about it under oath.\n\nKane was also sentenced to eight years of probation by a Montgomery County judge who said Kane's ego drove her to take down enemies and break the law.\n\nJudge Wendy Demchick-Alloy said Kane assumed an off with your heads mentality as she ran the state's top law enforcement agency. The judge called Kane a political neophyte who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office.\n\nThis case is about ego – the ego of a politician consumed with her image from Day One, Demchick-Alloy said. This case is about retaliation and revenge against perceived enemies who this defendant … felt had embarrassed her in the press.\n\nKane, the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state's top prosecutor, was handcuffed in court and led out a side door. She will remain in custody until she posts $75,000 cash bail, higher than she had previously posted.\n\nAfter she posts bond, she will remain free while she appeals her conviction.\n\nShe had been a stay-at-home mother, and former assistant county prosecutor, before using her husband's trucking fortune to run for statewide office in 2012. She quickly became a rising star in the state Democratic Party before her office devolved into turmoil as career prosecutors came and went.\n\nKane and her husband are now estranged and share custody of their teenage boys.\n\nYour children are the ultimate … collateral damages. They are casualties of your actions, the judge said. But you did that, not this court. \n\nEarlier Monday, Kane's 15-year-old son, Chris, pleaded for leniency while her former deputies described an office demoralized by her leadership and terrorized by Nixonian espionage.\n\nKane, 50, had argued that the loss of her career, law license and reputation was punishment enough. She had asked the judge to sentence her to probation or house arrest so she could be home to raise her sons.\n\nI really don't care what happens to me, Kane said during before leaning toward the defense table to grab tissues. There is no more torture in the world than to watch your children suffer and know you had something to do with it.\n\nThe one-term attorney general said her younger son, 14-year-old Zachary, did not attend Monday's sentencing because he couldn't even bear it.\n\nKane's family declined to comment after the sentencing.\n\nProsecutors called her crimes egregious and pushed for jail time. They said a paranoid Kane ruined morale in the 800-person office and the wider law enforcement community through a calculated scheme to embarrass rival prosecutors who had left the office.\n\nKane didn't testify at her trial. She was convicted in August of two felony counts of perjury and seven misdemeanor charges, and she resigned the next day.\n\nOn Monday, former deputy Clarke Madden said in court that a dark cloud permeated every corner of the attorney general's office and victims, witnesses and other law enforcement agencies feared working with them.\n\nThrough a pattern of systemic firings and Nixonian espionage, she created a terror zone in this office, said Erik Olsen, a career prosecutor who is now the chief deputy attorney general.\n\nKane enjoyed mostly good press early on as she supported gay marriage, ramped up a child predator unit run by her twin sister and questioned her predecessor's handling of the Penn State sex assault case.\n\nBut turmoil inside the office became apparent as top deputies and career prosecutors headed for the doors. Kane's feud with one of them, Frank Fina, who had helped run the Penn State probe and other sensitive investigations, led to the leak.\n\nKane, taking aim at him, had a campaign consultant pass confidential files to a reporter about a corruption case Fina had declined to charge before he left the office. She then tried to frame someone else for the leak, aides testified at the perjury and obstruction trial.\n\nAside from the conviction, Kane's political career will be remembered for her investigation of pornography that she said was being traded on state computers by judges, lawyers and other public employees. Two state Supreme Court justices resigned amid the fallout.
President Donald Trump announced late Tuesday night that he had pardoned and commuted the sentences of 143 people in the final hours of his presidency.\n\nThe president issued 73 pardons and 70 commutations.\n\nThe list included pop culture figures including rapper Lil Wayne, who was pardoned, and Kodak Black, whose sentence was commuted.\n\nThe president also pardoned several Republicans, including former Deputy National Finance Chair of the Republican National Committee Elliott Broidy, former Rep. Duke Cunningham of California, and former Rep. Rick Renzi of Arizona.\n\nHe also issued a pardon for his former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was charged with fraud for his work on the We Build the Wall crowdfunding campaign fueled by Trump supporters to build a wall on the Southern border.\n\nTrump also commuted the sentence of wealthy Democrat donor Dr. Salomon Melgen, who was convicted on 67 felony counts of Medicaid fraud in April 2017. The White House cited support for the pardon by Sen. Bob Menendez and Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart. Melgen was sentenced to 17 years in prison in 2018.\n\nThe president also commuted the sentence of former Mayor of Detroit Kwame Malik Kilpatrick, a Democrat, citing strong support by members of the Detroit Community as well as Alveda King, Alice Johnson, and Diamond and Silk. Kilpatrick served seven years of a 28-year sentence for his role in a major corruption scandal, convicted of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud, and other charges.\n\nTrump also issued a full pardon to former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, sentenced to 18 months in prison in August 2020 for stealing a trade secret from Google related to self-driving cars before changing jobs to work at Uber.\n\nThe president also commuted the prison sentence of William Walters, a professional gambler who was convicted in 2017 for insider trading and sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nTrump's list also included many nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to prison.\n\nThe long-awaited final list of pardons and commutations in Trump's presidency was released early Wednesday morning just hours before he planned to leave the White House to his post-presidency home in Florida.\n\nThe president did not pardon Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, two whistleblowers who illegally shared America's intelligence and national security secrets. The two individuals enjoyed bipartisan support for a pardon as their supporters had hoped that the president would ignore the intelligence community elites and prominent members of Congress in Washington who were deeply opposed to a pardon.\n\nTrump also did not issue preemptive pardons for himself, members of his family, or even some of his staff for future crimes if they face persecution as a result of their connection to the Trump administration. He also did not issue a preemptive pardon for his personal lawyer and ally former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nRead the full list below:\n\nTodd Boulanger – President Trump granted a full pardon to Todd Boulanger.

Notably, there was no evidence that any of the individuals were motivated by greed. And in fact, the sentencing judge called the likelihood that there was any personal financial motivation infinitesimal. The judge imposed a range of sentences from probation to 3 years' imprisonment, reflecting the conduct as an aberration from these individuals' otherwise law-abiding lives. Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay are described as devoted to their family and their communities, and have weathered their convictions without complaint.\n\nDavid Rowland – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Rowland.

A group supportive of Russian president Vladimir Putin have announced their intention to hold a Gays for Putin rally ahead of March's presidential election, despite the country's stringent laws on homosexuality.\n\nThe Moscow Times reports that the group, which calls itself Gays for Putin!' has asked authorities in St. Petersburg for permission to hold a rally with around 600 supporters.\n\nWe decided to express the impetus of the gay community by openly supporting Vladimir Putin as a presidential candidate, the group, led by organizers Vyacheslav Vereshchagin and Alexei Nazarov, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThey continued:\n\nPeople often say that activists are cut off from the people. In Russia, there are millions of homosexuals, and almost none of them participate in [anti-Putin] demonstrations. Therefore, homosexuals support President Putin's towards LGBT people. Putin signs laws that serve the strengthen the moral and spiritual foundations of Russian society. Notable homosexuals are awarded with orders and medals. Many gay people in our country say, Putin is our President. Gays are for Putin!\n\nAfter submitting their request to local authorities, the group reportedly congregated at a local church service to pray for the success of the good endeavor.\n\nPlans for the rally come days after a homophobic campaign video supporting Putin appeared on social media, warning that his opponents will take the country into a nightmare future where people are forced to cohabitate with gays and lesbians.\n\nThe video, which has already attracted over three million views on Facebook alone, shows the thoughts of a middle-aged man imagining a Russia without Putin, where a man can be seen in his kitchen and suggestively eating a banana and filing his nails.\n\nThe advert is intended as a contrast to Putin's opponent Ksenia Sobchak, who has called for the legalization of same-sex marriage and seeks to move the country in a less socially conservative direction.\n\nPresenting LGBT people as a threat in a homophobic country is no joke, she wrote in an Instagram post, while also condemning the video as vile.\n\nSobchak has faced widespread claims that she is actually part of a controlled opposition designed to give the impression that the election will be free and fair.\n\nOther opposition leaders, such as anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, claim that the election will be rigged in Putin's favor after being barred from running, meaning that he is extremely likely to win another six-year term.\n\nSince returning to the presidency in 2012, Putin has backed laws restricting the rights of LGBT people, which include a ban on loosely-defined homosexual propaganda in a bid to uphold Russia's traditional conservative values.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
The loose confederation of churches affiliated with the worldwide Anglican communion is experiencing growing tensions over the issue of homosexuality, with the U.S. Episcopalian church tugging toward the liberal embrace of all things LGBT and the African churches struggling to maintain a more Biblically based sexual morality.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Nigeria has announced it will boycott the next international meeting of Church leaders over the matter, and is now requesting special status in the worldwide church to allow it to faithfully preserve its position on homosexuality.\n\nIn a forceful statement, the Nigerian Anglican primate, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, said that the Anglican communion seems to be tilting toward a non-biblical understanding of homosexuality, marginalizing those with an orthodox, biblical view of human sexuality.\n\nTraditional Anglicans like the Nigerian Church, he said, are walking into a well-rehearsed scheme to gradually apply persuasion, subtle blackmail, coercion on any group still standing with the Scriptural Provision as we know it, to join the straight jacket of the revisionists and be politically correct.\n\nArchbishop Okoh said his province will shun next month's Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Lusaka, Zambia over the way the worldwide church has handled the wayward Episcopal Church in America, which he described as a toxic relationship.\n\nAt a meeting of Anglican Primates in January of this year, it was decided that for a period of three years The Episcopal Church (TEC) should not be appointed or elected to an internal standing committee and will not take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or policy. The measure was intended as a sanction over TEC's approval of gay marriage and consecration of openly gay bishops.\n\nThose sanctions proved to be hollow, Okoh said, and disapproval shifted toward those still embracing traditional beliefs regarding sexuality. Okoh said that during the Canterbury meeting, those who hold the orthodox view of human sexuality and marriage were denounced as 'homophobic,' underscoring that we were in the wrong place, he said.\n\nOkoh's impression was that the Anglican authorities thought they were exercising patience in order to gradually persuade the scripture-believers to embrace homosexual doctrine, something he says they will never do.\n\nIn his statement, Okoh reminds readers that Nigeria was one of the provinces that protested against the consecration of the gay American bishop Gene Robinson, that boycotted the 2008 Lambeth Conference and helped set up the conservative Global Anglican Future Conference in Jerusalem that same year.\n\nAs a result, Okoh has requested special status for the Provinces who will never embrace the sexual culture being promoted by some Provinces of the Church over and against the Bible.\n\nHe compared the idea of special status to the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, where total union is impossible, but some degree of cooperation is deemed useful.\n\nThe Anglican church claims some 85 million members worldwide and is divided into 38 provinces. Only eight of these are favorable to changing doctrine on marriage to allow for same-sex unions, namely, the U.S., Canada, Scotland, Wales, New Zealand, South India, South Africa and Brazil.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

She goes by the name Sa'a because — even three years after jumping from a moving truck to escape the Boko Haram terrorists that had kidnapped her and 275 other mostly Christian schoolgirls in Chibok, Nigeria — she fears for her safety and that of the rest of her family.\n\nMy message to everyone is that it's been three years now, Sa'a told Breitbart News three years to the day of her abduction.\n\nNot three days, or three months, but three years, Sa'a, who now lives in the United States, said at an event at the Newseum's Religious Freedom Center in Washington D.C. to mark the anniversary of the event. Every individual that has power to do something that would bring those girls back should just do something.\n\nSince that fateful day, 57 girls, including Sa'a, escaped from the radical Islamic terrorists. Last October, the Nigerian government worked out a deal with Boko Haram to return 21 more of the girls, many of whom has been raped, some returning with children in tow.\n\nThat leaves 195 girls who are still missing.\n\nIt is fitting that this happened on Good Friday, said Emmanuel Ogebe, a Nigerian human rights attorney based in Washington D.C. who has sponsored 15 young women survivors from Nigeria, including Sa'a, to come and study in the United States.\n\nWhen Jesus died the sun hid its face in shame because of what happened, Ogebe said. Now the world should hide its face in shame because it has forgotten the 195 girls that are still missing.\n\nOgebe, who has traveled to Nigeria on many occasions to help survivors and to lobby the Nigerian government to do more to secure the release of the remaining victims, said he knows that some of the girls have died. One girl, he said, was stoned to death when she refused to convert to Islam.\n\nThis is way beyond just hashtags, Ogebe said of the social media #bringbackourgirls movement that happened after one of the largest mass abductions in modern history.\n\nThere are practical things that can be done, Ogebe said, adding that keeping the story in the public consciousness is one of those things.\n\nAnd, Ogebe said, Boko Haram continues to abduct Nigerian girls and uses them for the unspeakable practice of suicide bombing.\n\nThis week, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) confirmed that fact.\n\nUNICEF emphasized Wednesday that beyond the high-profile Chibok abductions, the practice of kidnapping children and forcing them to associate with the armed group has been prevalent, the Associated Press reported.\n\nYoung girls are spotted in the markets, and nighttime raids drag them from their beds, UNICEF reported. In some cases, parents are killed in front of the girls during the process.\n\nThis is typically followed by an extended journey to a Boko Haram base in the forest where the girls are forced into early marriage and sexual slavery, UNICEF reported.\n\nOgebe said that the Nigerian government is not transparent about its dealings with Boko Haram or about the girls who were released in October. All remain in the custody of the government and have not been reunited with their families.\n\nWe don't think the Nigerian government is doing anything much about rescuing the girls, Seshugh Akume of the Bring Back Our Girls organization, told USA Today on Thursday. We are disappointed.\n\nThe general attitude is they wish everybody to keep quiet about it and move on because they get angry whenever the missing Chibok girls are mentioned, Akume said.\n\nBut Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari marked the anniversary by calling it one of the worst crimes committed against his country.\n\nI wish to reassure the parents of the Chibok girls, all well-meaning Nigerians, organizations and the international community, that as a government, we are unrelenting on the issue of the safe return of our children, said Buhari, who campaigned for office by promising to recover the victims.\n\nIf I stop telling my story people will forget my classmates, Sa'a said.
Nearly 1,200 forced marriage cases were logged by the government's Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) last year, new data shows, with the body saying the number may not reflect the full scale of the abuse.\n\nOf the 1,196 cases flagged 2017, more than one in four victims were younger than 18-years-old, and one in five were males, the FMU said in a report.\n\nThe document reveals that that, since 2012, the unit has logged between 1,200 and 1,400 cases each year, involving more than 90 foreign countries. In 2016, the FMU recorded over 1,400 victims, up from 1,200 in 2015, as reported by Breitbart London.\n\nA massive 439 of the marriages in 2017 either took place or were due to take place in Pakistan, followed by Bangladesh with 129 reports, and 91 in Somalia. The list continues with India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Romania, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nDespite the vast majority forced marriages taking part in Islamic states or predominantly Muslim countries, the report does not provide a breakdown of reported cases to the FMU by religion, claiming that, no major faith in the UK advocates forced marriage.\n\nIn 2017, there were 355 cases involved victims under 18-years-old, 353 victims aged between 18 and 25, and 186 cases when the victim involved was just 15 or younger.\n\nBombshell: UK Govt Review into Sharia Admits Systemic Discrimination Against Women, Unknown Number of 'Councils', Forced Marriage Victim Made to Appear with Abusers https://t.co/2D4ljDKNbn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2018\n\nIn a statement, the FMU told the Guardian: Forced marriage is a hidden crime, and these figures may not reflect the full scale of the abuse.\n\nA spokesman for the children's charity the NSPCC told the paper the figures corroborate reports to their phone help service Childline, which revealed levels of force marriage had hit record levels in August last year.\n\nThe said that children as young as 13 [are] contacting us worried about being forced into marriage yet fearing they will be cut out of their community if they refuse.\n\nThe charity also said the practice was a form of abuse and explained the true scale of the problem was hard to grasp because of a culture of secrecy, shame, and threats.\n\nThe worry and fears children face in this situation can also lead them to self-harm, to run away from home putting them at risk of further abuse, or even to contemplate taking their own lives, the spokesman added.
The once wholesome Miley Cyrus has partnered with feminist artist Marilyn Minter to raise funds for Planned Parenthood, the abortion business announced Thursday in New York.\n\nMinter photographed Cyrus, now 23, as if she was behind a steamy shower door. Only 50 of the limited edition prints are being sold at Artsy for $5,500 each, with 100 percent of the proceeds supporting Planned Parenthood. For those with a smaller piggy bank, Marc Jacobs will sell t-shirts featuring other more sexually provocative images from Minter's session with Cyrus, including Miley Hearts Planned Parenthood, and Pro Choice Miley. The cost of the t-shirts is $60 each and will be available at Marc Jacobs shops on May 16.\n\nSoon 2 be Unveiled pic.twitter.com/pvr70lJPnQ — Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) April 13, 2016\n\nAs Artsy reports, Minter – now in her 60s – has been known for her depictions of women in the throes of sexual pleasure or adorned with dirt and diamonds since the 1970s. A supporter of both the LGBT agenda and abortion rights, she joined forces with Planned Parenthood last year for its most lucrative benefit auction, which raised $2.3 million for the abortion business from the sale of works by various artists.\n\nAs Artnet reports, Minter earned Planned Parenthood's Woman of Valor award.\n\nThis is a really vital time, I think, the artist said during her acceptance speech. I want Planned Parenthood to start coming out of the closet, and I want to take our cues and inspiration from the marriage-equality movement.\n\nMinter, who designed Planned Parenthood pins that say, Don't F**K With Me, Don't F**K Without Us, says she chose to photograph Cyrus because she's an activist and she has 40.5 million Instagram followers.\n\nShe's been famous since she was 11 and she's a great artist, so she doesn't care about making money—she wants to give back, she continued. She founded the Happy Hippie Foundation, which supports LGBTQ youth. She flies commercial because she's conscious of her carbon footprint. Now she's going to help us with Planned Parenthood.\n\nAsked by Artsy about why she chose Planned Parenthood as her charity, Minter replied:\n\nThat was 2014, and laws were being passed that were shaving women's right to make their own choices with their bodies. We hadn't had to worry about that kind of thing since Bill Clinton was elected—we thought that war was over. Laurie, Cindy, and I—and so many others—worked so hard for abortion rights in the '70s and '80s, and all of a sudden that work started to unravel. Planned Parenthood has been attacked more in the last 2 years than in the last 20.\n\nIn addition to states passing more laws banning abortion after the fifth month of pregnancy, requiring higher levels of safety in abortion clinics, and eliminating taxpayer funding from the abortion group, Planned Parenthood is still reeling from a series of videos exposing its apparent practices of selling the body parts of babies aborted in its clinics and altering the positions of babies during abortion in order to be able to harvest the most intact organs.\n\nThough Planned Parenthood has denied any wrongdoing in its sale of body parts, the abortion business also released a statement in October announcing it will no longer accept payments for aborted fetal tissue. The organization and its leftwing media supporters continue to insist the videos, produced by the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), were deceptively edited.\n\nHowever, a Democrat opposition research firm named Fusion – hired by Planned Parenthood itself to review the videos — said while their analysts observed the videos had been edited, The analysis did not reveal widespread evidence of substantive video manipulation.\n\nAdditionally, Fusion noted, [A]nalysts found no evidence that CMP inserted dialogue not spoken by Planned Parenthood staff.\n\nAn analysis by Coalfire, a third-party forensics company hired by Alliance Defending Freedom, found that the videos were not manipulated and that they are authentic.\n\nThe great @mintermarilyn being honored by Planned Parenthood for her important advocacy for the… https://t.co/JP652iYVh5 — Nancy Spector (@nespector) April 15, 2016\n\nLooking back on the feminist influences in her life, Minter said she has been an activist since high school, when she was always getting kicked out of class and in the dean's office.\n\nThen it was Civil Rights, and later it was the Vietnam War, she recalled. I was there when they shut down the Pentagon; I've been going on protest marches my whole life … And now, this fight against controlling and policing women's bodies feels like a war.\n\nMinter, who said she was on cloud nine when Obama was elected president, explained she was incensed when she heard on the radio that some Planned Parenthood clinics were closing down due to their failure to meet the new safety laws some states have passed.\n\nBut soon after, people—and public figures—started getting behind Planned Parenthood publicly, she said. Lena Dunham was one of the first, and all the women who contributed to her PSA, and then Miley [Cyrus], and now Marc [Jacobs]. Maybe he'll convince other companies to support, too.\n\nMost young women – and the general population of the United States – are no longer as supportive of abortion as were the old guard feminists in the 60s and 70s.\n\nA recent Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll found a full 81 percent of Americans favor some restrictions on abortion — including limiting the procedure after the first three months — and a continued ban on public funding of abortion.\n\nIn the survey of 1,700 Americans, even 66 percent of respondents who identify themselves as pro-choice say, Abortion should be allowed, at most, in the first trimester, in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother, or never permitted.\n\nMinter said she will likely do a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Clinton has already been endorsed in the primary by Planned Parenthood and much of the abortion industry.
The New York Times editorial board says the Trump administration is quietly advancing an anti-science agenda by supporting teen pregnancy prevention programs that encourage young people to refrain from sex to avoid pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STD).\n\nIn an editorial Sunday, the board condemns the promotion of abstinence among teens by the current Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The reproach is delivered without one word about the scientific fact that the only certain way young teens can avoid having to deal with the unfortunate situations of an unplanned pregnancy or being infected with an STD is to not have sex.\n\nThe administration is promoting a 'just say no' approach and is 'poised to shift Title X family planning dollars … toward programs that advocate abstinence outside of marriage, says the editorial board, sure that only horrific outcomes will ensue from encouraging young people to delay sex until they are older, have completed school, and have met someone special.\n\nThe administration's approach defies all common sense, the editors write, claiming there is no evidence that teaching young people to make healthy decisions about sex will reduce teen pregnancies or STDs.\n\nThe Times continues that comprehensive sex education (CSE) programs of the sort promoted by the Obama administration are the reason why teen pregnancy has declined in the United States in recent years.\n\nA senior HHS official, however, recently told Breitbart News that this narrative is not supported by research data from the federal government itself.\n\nA 2016 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows nearly 60 percent of high school students today have never had sex, an increase of 28 percent since 1991. This data complements research that also shows a historic drop in teen pregnancy rates since 1991.\n\nYet, despite this scientific data that was produced during his own tenure, in his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2017, former President Barack Obama eliminated funding in his administration's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program (TPP) for sex education programs that focus on reinforcing the healthy decision to delay sex made by many adolescents. His administration proposed only funding CSE programs, which assume all middle school children need to know where to get the morning-after pill and how to use a condom.\n\nThe previous administration tried an approach that just didn't work, the HHS official said. And our commitment requires that we change that approach.\n\nAn HHS document points to 37 evaluations of TPP programs performed for grant applications to fund the programs.\n\nOverall, of the 37 funded and evaluated projects, 73% either had no impact or had a negative impact on teen behavior, with some teens more likely to begin having sex, to engage in unprotected sex, or to become pregnant, HHS explained. Very few positive results were sustained over time.\n\nAdditionally, as CDC has also observed, while teen sex and pregnancy rates are at record lows, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are at record highs. HHS said sex education, therefore, should be centered on science in the promotion of optimal health outcomes.\n\nIf we know that more teens are waiting to have sex today than 25 years ago, then shouldn't we be reinforcing those healthy decisions and building upon that? HHS asked. Similarly, we know that teen pregnancy rates have decreased and yet sexually transmitted diseases and infection have increased to record levels. There's something going on there, and we need to learn what it is and to make sure we make some amendments to the messages we're communicating, because we can't be satisfied with those numbers.\n\nThe Times editors, however, are more concerned about keeping up appearances at places like the U.N., where, they gasp, Trump administration officials have been heard referring to the United States as a pro-life nation.\n\nThe editorial board further condemns what it calls Trump officials engaging in savvy rebranding of teen sex ed programs by using innocuous sounding terms like 'sexual risk avoidance' and 'healthy relationships.' The editors do not apparently take offense, however, at the abortion industry's attempt to smooth over the elective ending of an unborn child's life by defining the procedure as women's health care.\n\nMany parents throughout the United States say they have had enough, in fact, of the pornographic and gender-bending sex education curricula taught by organizations like Planned Parenthood – which profits from abortion and also boasts that it educates students about how to have LGBT-inclusive sex:\n\nWe are disgusted that our taxpayer money is going to teach children how to question their gender, perform anal and oral sex, and masturbate, said Elizabeth Johnston, the Activist Mommy, who led an international Sex Ed Sit Out in April.\n\nPlanned Parenthood's ideas about sex education have been exposed on other occasions.\n\nPro-life organization Live Action produced a video in 2014 that highlighted the abortion vendor's normalization of Bondage, Discipline, Sadism, Masochism (BDSM) for young people.\n\nMore recently, Planned Parenthood itself released a video titled How to Tell Someone You Have an STD, in which the group minimizes the significance of sexually transmitted disease.\n\nSo, you've got an STD, the video's narrator nods casually. Guess what? So do lots of other people. Half of all people will get an STD at some point in their life. Seriously. Not kidding – half. It's OK.\n\nFor the New York Times editors, however, teaching young people to delay sex until they are older and might have better judgment about relationships is anti-science and more.\n\nSuch education keeps all people who are subjected to it in the dark about critical aspects of their health, and treats a normal part of life — sexuality, and women's sexuality in particular — as aberrant and shameful, they say.\n\nScience, however, is not pro-sex or pro-abortion. And encouraging young teens to respect themselves and their bodies – and to view their sexuality as a special part of who they are – does not equate to teaching sex is abnormal, aberrant, or shameful.
Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is outspoken about his Christian beliefs, but now some critics are attacking him for racy photos posted to social media by his pop singer wife, Ciara.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ciara posted a series of photos to her Instagram account depicting her in some rather intimate situations and scantily clad in some shots.\n\nThe 32-year-old singer was seen wearing nothing but a white button-down shirt arranged to show off parts of her highly toned body, according to Christian Post.\n\nAlso, the photos were apparently taken by her NFL player husband.\n\nThe photos elicited a variety of reactions some praising them, others reportedly lusting after the NFL player's wife. But soon the pair came under fire for seeming to violate their Christian beliefs by posting such intimate images.\n\nOne reply, for instance, jabbed the two saying, These pictures should be seen only by your husband, not on public display. Are you not a Christian family?\n\nAnother post criticized Ciara for perpetuating sex stereotypes.\n\n@Ciara, I adore you and @dangerusswilson, and you have nothing to prove; y'all are the bomb. However, posting semi-naked pics only perpetuates the myth that women are merely sexual objects for all to see, the commenter wrote.\n\nThe NFL player was famous for advocating abstinence before marriage. Before they wed, for instance, Wilson told the audience at a San Diego church event that he and Ciara were doing it the Jesus way and refusing to engage in sexual relations until they took their vows.\n\nWilson did admit that refraining from sex wasn't an easy decision, especially with such a beautiful woman as Ciara. I ain't gonna lie to y'all now, I need y'all to pray for us. I know y'all seen her on the screen, he said.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.
Thursday on MSNBC's All In, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee to replace Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy would be someone who will criminalize abortion and try to punish women.\n\nWarren said, Let's talk about what we know for sure is at stake and some of the questions that the nominee is going to face. Donald Trump has already said that he's going to pick somebody who has been prescreened off a list that that was put together by a group whose number one job—an extremist group—is to make sure that Roe versus Wade gets overturned.\n\nShe added, This means that he's looking for a nominee who will criminalize abortion and try to punish women. That's what's at stake in this one. And then from there, so much more. This is about health care cases that are percolating up through the courts, including the one we know about right now about pre-existing conditions. This is about the swing vote in our environmental protections, whether or not giant corporations are going to have the right to poison the water and foul the air. This is about workers' rights and whether or not the Supreme Court is going to stay on the path of trying to bust unions. This is about voting rights, whether or not democracy fundamentally works in this country. This is one of those moments where Justice Kennedy has been the swing vote. Look, I'll be blunt, he swung a lot of times in a direction I don't like, but he's been a swing vote. He was the one who helped stand up for equal marriage. All of that is now at risk—whether he, Donald Trump, gets to replace the swing vote with somebody off a pre-approved extremist list.\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
Presidential candidate and billionaire Mike Bloomberg released his vision for putting in place a comprehensive policy to ensure LGBTQ+ equality on Tuesday.\n\nThe vision includes transgenders' rights to free sex surgery and hormone treatment, rights to shelter based on gender identity, and forcing law enforcement and health care providers to undergo cultural competency and implicit bias training.\n\nBloomberg said in a statement on his campaign website:\n\nI have been honored to stand with the LGBTQ+ community in the fight for equality and justice, from New York, where we won marriage equality in 2011, to states across the country. That fight – true to our nation's highest ideals – has achieved historic progress, but we still have a long way to go. As president, I will work to protect every member of the LGBTQ+ community from hatred, violence, and discrimination. We will close disparities in health care access and quality, stop violence against transgender people, and advocate for equal rights across the world. We cannot settle for anything less – and I won't.\n\nBloomberg's radical transgender agenda included supporting the Do No Harm Act that would gut the Religious Freedom Restoration Act's provision to protect Americans right to live and act according to their religious convictions.\n\nMike will … end the Trump administration's practice of granting federally funded organizations a license to discriminate against people based on their religious beliefs, sexual orientation or gender identity, the website stated.\n\nBloomberg also supports passage of the Equality Act, which would bar governments and sports organizations from recognizing the biological/physiological difference between men and women and replace it with gender identity.\n\nThe website stated:\n\nMike will also protect and expand ACA enrollment efforts and restrict the sale of plans that don't meet ACA standards, ensuring coverage for medically-necessary gender-affirming care (e.g., gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy).\n\nBloomberg vowed to restore and enforce the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Equal Access Rule to ensure that transgender people are able to stay in shelters that match their gender identity.\n\nThis housing agenda would allow transgender women to stay in homeless and domestic violence shelters based on gender identity.\n\nBloomberg also would prioritize transgender rights in federal law enforcement:\n\nAs president, Mike will establish a comprehensive approach to addressing violence against LGBTQ+ people, especially transgender women of color. Mike will make hate and bias crimes a top federal priority, directing the FBI to take the lead on bias crime investigations, training local authorities to identify hate and pressing states to report all hate crimes to the federal government, and improving data collection on violent deaths of LGBTQ+ people.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Bloomberg and the left are embracing the transgender ideology despite scientific facts:\n\nAttorney and writer Jane Robbins observed at the Witherspoon Institute's Public Discourse:\n\nThe concept of changing one's biological sex is, of course, nonsense, as sex is determined by unalterable chromosomes. An individual can change his hormone levels and undergo surgery to better imitate the opposite sex, but a male on the day of his conception will remain a male on the day of his death. And as discussed below, the idea that there is a real personal trait called gender that challenges or invalidates the identity significance of biological sex is equally fallacious. But the absence of genuine evidence is simply ignored, and faux evidence is created to validate the mania. Physicians who have embraced transgender ideology are enthusiastically treating gender dysphoria with expensive and life-altering medical interventions and surgeries. Transgender treatment for those with gender dysphoria has grown into an elaborate industry. The cost of top surgery, for example, is over $10,000.\n\nBloomberg also said he would restore U.S. leadership on LGBTQ+ rights at home and around the world, even if the Trump administration launched a global effort to decriminalize homosexuality.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has introduced a series of sweeping foreign policy bills, including one that would let Congress limit the president's power to place international sanctions and declare national emergencies.\n\nOmar describes the legislative package, titled Pathway to PEACE (Progressive, Equitable, and Constructive Engagement), as a bold progressive vision to rethink the country's approach to foreign policy by centering human rights, justice and peace as the pillars of America's engagement in the world, and making military action a last resort in a press release. I believe in a world where there are no young girls living through war, and no nations that are being destroyed, she declared in the statement.\n\nEndless war is not making our country safer. It is costing lives, destroying futures, and damaging our reputation in the world. Today, I'm introducing the #PathwaytoPeace, a new vision for American foreign policy based on peace and diplomacy. https://t.co/TpG8oqk1X7 — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 12, 2020\n\nShe spoke about the bills at a panel discussion on Capitol Hill Wednesday, framing them as a globalized approach to U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThese sets of bills are not about a single country or singling out one particular country, said Omar, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It's about setting a common set of standards for the world.\n\nOne of the bills, the Congressional Oversight of Sanctions Act, would give Congress power to limit the executive branch's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare national emergencies and place economic sanctions.\n\nWe need to restore congressional oversight, Omar said. She explained that the bill requires an explanation for what foreign policy goal is supposed to be achieved with the given sanction and what the process for delisting an individual, entity or country should be.\n\nOmar has telegraphed her practical aims for this particular policy. In the past year, the freshman congresswoman has bucked bipartisan majorities to call for the end of sanctions on despotic regimes such as Iran and Venezuela. Last April, she accused President Trump of declaring a fake emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border, which allowed him to direct funding towards the construction of physical barriers.\n\nThis is a fake emergency! Donald Trump is lying about the border in order to build his monument to racism. https://t.co/hVOVzLYDHw — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) April 3, 2019\n\nOne of the first bills in the package similarly appears to have a singular target: the nation of Israel. The Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act would set up red lines for foreign nations based on international humanitarian law, and any violation would automatically [trigger] a prohibition on security aid of any kind, arms sales including those controlled by the Commerce Dept. (tear gas, etc.). While Israel itself is not mentioned in the bill, Omar's overwhelming discussion of international human rights has focused on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Last year, when she was denied entry to the Jewish nation, she suggested that the U.S. should leverage its annual $3 billion in aid to Israel to ensure full rights for Palestinians.\n\nAnother bill redirects defense spending – something Omar refers to as military intimidation and coercion – and gives it to the State Department.\n\n[The] Global Peace Building Act… would authorize a one-time transfer of $5 billion dollars from the Pentagon's Overseas Contingency Operation budget to the State Department to create a new multi-lateral peacebuilding fund, she said.\n\nHer press release does not specify this entity's relationship to the United States Institute of Peace, created in 1984 and funded annually by Congress. The institute describes its work as  a vital investment in reducing violent international conflicts that threaten U.S. national security in its latest budget justification letter sent to Congress.\n\nTwo more bills would require the United States to cede authority and sovereignty to global institutions.\n\nOmar called it an international embarrassment that the United States has not signed onto the controversial United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nHowever, that agreement would severely undermine U.S. sovereignty, as explained in a legal white paper from Americans United for Life in 2010:\n\nUnder Article VI of the United States Constitution, all treaties made shall be the supreme Law of the Land. Therefore, ratification of the UNCRC will make the document binding under American law and it would supersede any relevant, existing federal or state laws. This will also ultimately limit United States sovereignty by placing American family law and parental rights under international regulation and scrutiny.\n\nOmar also called on the United States to join the International Criminal Court, a global entity that President Donald Trump blocked from launching an investigation into alleged atrocities committing during the war between 2003 and 2004, including by U.S. troops, Afghan forces, and the Taliban.\n\nTrump has denounced the ICC, the world's only permanent war crimes court, for its 'broad, unaccountable, prosecutorial powers,' Reuters reported. Washington revoked travel visas for ICC personnel in response to its work on Afghanistan.\n\nOmar's press release touts support for the bills from left-wing heavyweights like Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor to Barack Obama.\n\nCongresswoman Omar is putting forward an ambitious and comprehensive package that outlines progressive approaches to some of the most important issues facing the United States and our world today, Rhodes said.\n\nHuman Rights Watch's Andrea Prasow praised Omar as a leader on the subject:  With an administration that's a no-show on human rights, it's important that Congress press forward with resolutions in support of the most vulnerable, including children, migrants, and victims of atrocity crimes.\n\nOmar and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) were the first Muslim women elected to Congress once they won their races in the 2018 midterm elections. They are part of a small group of firebrand progressive freshmen known as The Squad, led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and including Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Since her election, Omar has been mired in controversy, facing scrutiny for a 2012 social media post saying Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. Days after taking her oath of office, Omar spread a conspiracy theory that Sen. Lindsey Graham is compromised by sexual blackmail. The next month, she was denounced by senior Democrats for spreading antisemitic tropes that AIPAC influences U.S. foreign policy with bribes and pro-Israel lawmakers hold allegiance to a foreign country. She ultimately kept her seat on the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nMore recently, Omar has been mired in more personal controversies. In late 2019, she filed for divorce from Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her children, amid swirling reports of an affair with Democratic operative Tim Mynett. She is now facing scrutiny for alleged campaign payments to his consulting firm. Likewise, long-simmering questions about her marriage to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi in 2009 — which critics have alleged was a marriage to her brother for immigration purposes — have reportedly reached the FBI.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter
A court in India ruled on Monday that the term Hindu bride must also include transgender women, thus directing authorities to register a marriage solemnized between a man and a transgender woman.\n\nJustice G R Swaminathan of the Madras high court, the capital of Tamil Nadu State, issued a ruling on Monday that the term bride as defined by the Hindu Marriage Act must also include transgender women, who are biologically male. The case was brought by a man and his transgender partner after registration authorities refused to certify their marriage, citing Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act 1956 that states that a transgender woman cannot be considered a bride.\n\nSwaminathan chose to discard the ruling by referring to cases such as the recent decriminalization of homosexuality while observing that equal rights are afforded to transgenders under the Indian Constitution.\n\nAfter making an exhaustive reference to the human rights jurisprudence worldwide in this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that Article 14 of the Constitution of India which affirms that the State shall not deny to 'any person' equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India would apply to transgenders also, he said in his ruling.\n\nTransgender persons fall within the expression 'person' and hence entitled to legal protection of laws in all spheres of State activity as enjoyed by any other citizen of this country, he continued.\n\n\n\nSwaminathan observed that gender identity falls within the domain of her personal autonomy and involves her right to privacy and dignity, arguing that it was not for State authorities to question this self-determination of the second petitioner herein.\n\nWhen the right of the transgender persons to marry has been upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the very nature of things, they cannot be kept out of the purview of the Hindu Marriage Act, he added. One can have a civil marriage. One can also have a sacramental marriage. The petitioners' marriage was solemnized in a temple. Therefore, their fundamental right under Article 25 has also been infringed in this case.\n\nSwaminathan also took steps to outlaw gender reassignment surgeries on children who identify as intersex, saying that they required more time and maturity to make such a decision. However, he said the government must launch campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the issue so that parents and children did not feel a sense of shame.\n\nParents must be encouraged to feel that the birth of an inter-sex child is not a matter of embarrassment or shame, the court ruled. Any intersex child is entitled to stay within the folds of the family, he observed. The running away to the margins and beyond is a fatal journey that must be arrested. Time has come when they are brought back from the margins to the mainstream.\n\nDespite being known for its ultra-conservative society, India has taken steps to implement various LGBT rights over recent years. Last year, the Supreme Court overturned a ruling criminalizing homosexuality, while sexual reassignment surgery remains legal and readily accessible.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.
The U.S. Bishops' Conference (USCCB) has again voiced its opposition to the Equality Act, warning it would discriminate against people of faith and inflict numerous legal and social harms on Americans.\n\nIn a strongly worded letter to the U.S. Congress, the bishops assert the Equality Act would impose novel and divisive viewpoints regarding 'gender' on individuals and organizations while dismissing sexual difference and falsely presenting 'gender' as only a social construct.\n\nThe Feb. 23 letter, signed by five leaders of the USCCB, notes sex and gender can be distinguished but not separated, while denouncing underlying ideologies that attempt to sunder what are inseparable aspects of reality.\n\nRather than affirm human dignity in ways that meaningfully exceed existing practical protections, the Equality Act would discriminate against people of faith, they insist.\n\nBecause of its abolition of real sexual differences in favor of subjective gender identities, the proposed legislation would force girls and women to compete against boys and men for limited opportunities in school sports, and to share locker rooms and shower spaces with biological males who claim to identify as women, the bishops contend.\n\nMoreover, the Act would exclude people from the careers and livelihoods that they love, just for maintaining the truth of their beliefs on marriage and sexuality and discriminate against individuals and religious organizations based on their different beliefs, they argue.\n\nIn their litany of the many problems with the proposed law, the bishops also assert it would punish faith-based charities such as shelters and foster care agencies, and in turn their thousands of beneficiaries, simply because of their beliefs on marriage and sexuality.\n\nThe letter was signed by New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, chairman of the Committee for Religious Liberty; Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S. Coakley, chairman of the Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development; Oakland Bishop Michael Barber, chairman of the Committee on Catholic Education; Tulsa Bishop David Konderla, chairman of the Subcommittee for the Promotion and Defense of Marriage; and Kansas City Archbishop Joseph Naumann, chairman of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
Angelina Jolie has filed for divorce from her longtime partner Brad Pitt, according to a report.\n\nTMZ reports that the 41-year-old actress and United Nations special envoy filed court papers Monday citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.\n\nThe outlet further reports that Jolie was unhappy with the way Pitt, 52, was raising their children. The couple — who married in 2014 but have been together since 2004 — are parents to six children: Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivenne, both 8.\n\nA source close to the couple told TMZ that Jolie was extremely upset with Pitt's parenting methods.\n\nAn unnamed source also reportedly told the outlet that Jolie was fed up with what the source said was his alleged use of marijuana and anger issues. The source added that Jolie felt the children were in danger around Pitt.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Post's Page Six reports that Jolie had hired a private detective to spy on Pitt on the set of his new London-set movie Allied, where she suspected he had been cheating with co-star Marion Cotillard. The outlet reported that the private eye did catch Pitt cheating with Cotillard.\n\nPage Six also reported several other details related to the split: Jolie reportedly wants to become more involved with her humanitarian work, while Pitt wants to continue to make movies and enjoys Hollywood parties. Jolie appeared at the United Nations just last week to lobby on behalf of Syrian refugees.\n\nThe outlet further reported that Pitt is closer to Jolie's father, actor Jon Voight, than she is: Jon's a Hollywood guy, and she's been estranged. Brad hangs out with her father more than she does, a source said.\n\nJolie is reportedly seeking sole physical custody of their six children and asking a judge to grant visitation rights to Pitt.\n\nThe couple — dubbed by celebrity tabloid outlets as Brangelina — first met on the set of their 2003 thriller Mr. and Mrs. Smith. They recently starred as a couple trying to repair their marriage in last year's Jolie-directed drama By the Sea.\n\nJolie has reportedly retained attorney Laura Wasser, who represented actress Amber Heard in her high-profile divorce case against Johnny Depp earlier this summer.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional details.\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) noted Thursday on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives that the Equality Act, which would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexuality and gender identity, specifically disallows religious exemptions.\n\nJordan was responding to a speech by Rep. Sean Maloney (D-NY), who accused Republicans of using freedom of religion as an excuse to hate on gay people, and claimed that religious freedom would still be protected under the Equality Act.\n\nBut Jordan pointed to the text of the bill itself, which states: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) was enacted to protect the First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion except for compelling government interest.\n\nReligion has been at the heart of debates about same-sex marriage, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Democrats tried to short-circuit that debate in the Equality Act, which implies that religion cannot be cited as a basis for discrimination.\n\nFollowing Jordan, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) argued that language in the text of the bill also attempts to create a statutory right to abortion by prohibiting discrimination regarding a related medical condition connected to pregnancy.\n\nThe Equality Act passed the House on a largely party-line vote, 224-206, with only three Republicans joining Democrats in favor.\n\nThe Senate is considered unlikely to pass the Equality Act, for the reasons of religious liberty Jordan mentioned.\n\nJoel B.

A California bakery owned by Christians has been forced to take down its website and social media accounts after a bombardment of criticism and a boycott followed their decision not to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding involving two lesbians.\n\nCathy Miller, the owner of Tastries Bakery in Bakersfield, CA, explained that she was not refusing to serve a certain sort of customer, but rather to patronize a certain sort of event that goes against her religious convictions as a Christian.\n\nA ceremony, when you're getting married is in the eyes of the Lord, okay, and that's a celebration of a union that God has brought together and that's a whole lot different than coming in and wanting a cookie, Miller explained.\n\nEileen Del Rio claimed that she and her girlfriend suffered discrimination because Tastries Bakery refused to grant them a wedding cake tasting due to the Millers' Christian belief in marriage as the union between a man and a woman.\n\nDel Rio wrote about the incident on Facebook, bringing down a bombardment of negativity against Miller. As a result, the owners were forced to take down the Tastries Bakery website and Facebook page.\n\nSo we go to this bakery a week ago to sign up for tasting and choose our wedding cake. The owner met with us today to set up the process, Del Rio wrote. Well this rude ass person says I will make your order but I don't condone same sex marriages and will have no part in this process. Oh but you want to take my order and give it another bakery so that bakery can do it.\n\nShe don't condone same sex marriages so refused to make our wedding cake and set up our order. She wanted all our information to send to another bakery so they could make it, she added, along with a hashtag suggesting the owner was probably a supporter of Donald Trump.\n\nMiller said that she has nothing against gay people but there are certain activities she cannot support because of who she is.\n\nHere at Tastries, we love everyone, Miller said. My husband and I are Christians and we know that God created everyone and he created everyone equal so it's not that we don't like people of certain groups of people.\n\nThere are just certain things that violate my conscience, Miller said.\n\nFor years, Tastries has been referring gay customers who want a wedding cake to a competitor called Gimmee Some Sugar, so they can receive the service they ask for.\n\nI'm really hurt by this. I don't think we should be picked on because of our beliefs, Miller said.\n\nIn the last two days, LGBT activists have loaded a barrage of negative reviews against the bakery on Yelp and TripAdvisor in an effort to tank the business.\n\nLast May, President Trump issued an executive order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty, in which he stated that the executive branch would vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.\n\nThe Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices and views were integral to a vibrant public square, and in which religious people and institutions were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by the Federal Government, he said, noting that the fundamental right to religious liberty is Americans' first freedom.\n\nFederal law protects the freedom of Americans and their organizations to exercise religion and participate fully in civic life without undue interference by the Federal Government. The executive branch will honor and enforce those protections, he said.\n\nFollow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome
A British police officer called a charity to ask if it were acceptable for an Iraqi man to date a 12-year-old girl because he wanted to be culturally sensitive when dealing with a suspected paedophile.\n\nAn unnamed police detective called the charity Karma Nirvana, which tackles forced marriage and other forms of 'honour-based' abuse, after he had arrested a 26-year-old Iraqi man who said that in his culture, it was acceptable for him to be in a relationship with a child, according to the charity's call logs seen by The Times.\n\nAccording to the call log, the policeman said the accused is stating that it is 'completely acceptable in my culture to be with a 12-year-old'.\n\nThe record added that the officer 'just wished to know if it is accepted in Iraqi culture to be with a 12-year-old girl' as he wished to be 'culturally sensitive'.\n\nThe charity advised that he deal with the Iraqi in the same way they would deal with any other suspected child sex predator.\n\nKarma Nirvana said that this call showed the dangers of authorities filtering serious crimes through a 'cultural sensitivity' lens, for fear of being perceived as racist.\n\nChain Migration: UK Govt 'Turns Blind Eye' to Forced Marriage, Hands Visas to Foreign Rapists https://t.co/ExXaJ9pqD2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2018\n\nJasvinder Sanghera, the charity's founder, said that We've got a number of professionals who are turning a blind eye. They don't want to rock the multicultural boat.\n\nThe revelation is one of many to be released by The Times after it published a series of reports detailing authorities turning a blind eye to forced and underage marriages by predominately South Asians.\n\nIt was revealed this week that government officials had been handing visas to the husbands of girls who have been forcibly married, raped, and impregnated abroad, allowing them to settle in Britain permanently; at times the victims were mentally disabled.\n\nOf the 3,800 reports of forced marriages or children and young people at risk of being forced into marriage, over the past three years to the government's Home Office, the police have charged less than 80 suspects and the judicial system has convicted suspects in just three cases.
Hungary has offered a model to the West of how to effectively address the widespread demographic crisis, writes Catholic University of America theology professor Chad Pecknold.\n\nWhile European nations languish with rapidly declining birthrates, Hungary stands out with rising marriage rates, falling abortions, and its highest birthrate in 20 years, Pecknold notes in an essay in the Catholic Herald Thursday.\n\nMarriage is up by 43 percent since 2010, while divorce has dropped by 22.5 percent in the same period. This demographic turnaround has not been an accident, but the fruit of deliberate programs to promote marriage and the family while defending Hungary's cultural identity and Christian roots.\n\nAfter we won the election in 2010 with a two-thirds majority, we decided to build a family-friendly country and to strengthen families raising children, said Hungary's Minister for the Family, Katalin Novak.\n\nStanding firm in its position despite fierce opposition from the socialist left, the Orbán government enacted legislation resulting in a comprehensive family-support system, a family-friendly tax system, a housing program, 800,000 new jobs, and many opportunities to create a balance between life and work, Ms. Novak stated.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, the Orbán government has introduced seven family-friendly government programs encouraging Hungarians to have children in response to the European Union's mass migration agenda.\n\nWe are living in times when fewer and fewer children are being born throughout Europe. People in the West are responding to this with immigration, Prime Minister Orbán said at the State of the Nation address in Budapest in February.\n\nHungarians see this in a different light. We do not need numbers, but Hungarian children, the Fidesz party leader added.\n\nThe new law will come into effect July 1 and includes pro-family incentives such as a 3,000 euro mortgage reduction for a second child, a 12,000 euro reduction for a third child, a car-purchasing program for large families, and comprehensive daycare.\n\nAs of 2020, mothers with four or more children will enjoy a lifetime personal income tax exemption.\n\nHungary is proving that pro-family policies are better for nations than those policies which deracinate and diminish the family by the whims of ideological dictate, Pecknold observes.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

As President Obama's last year in office winds down and he comes to the realization that he won't be able to close the Guantanamo Bay terrorist detention facility like he promised in 2008, he's been busy transferring inmates to other countries as a fallback plan. This month, Obama has sent Osama bin Laden's alleged bodyguard to the country of Montenegro.\n\nAbdel Malik Ahmed Abdel Wahab al-Rahabi has been held at Gitmo for 14 years but will now get a change of scenery, with the administration deciding that the bin Laden associate is no longer a threat to the U.S. and recommending his transfer. And according to NBC News, the Department of Defense insists that the transfer is consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures.\n\nAnnouncing the move, the administration thanked the small Eastern European nation for taking the accused terrorist off America's hands\n\nMontenegro, a small country situated between Bosnia, and Herzegovina, and Albania, and across from Italy on the Adriatic Sea, said it would release al-Rahabi once it takes custody of him, allowing him to return to his family.\n\nAl-Rahabi was detained in 2001 by Pakistani forces then transferred to Gitmo a month after his arrest.\n\nPentagon documents say the prisoner is related to bin Laden by marriage and was trained to hijack airliners and fly a suicide mission in conjunction with the 9/11 attacks. For whatever reason, the detainee never committed to the suicide mission.\n\nClaiming to close the Guantanamo facility was one of the first actions Obama took when he first entered office in 2008 when he signed an Executive Order promising he would shut the facility down in the first year of his presidency.\n\nClosing the detention center was one of Obama's main campaign promises, but in spite of his promises and the Executive Order he immediately issued upon entering the White House, Obama never did shutter the facility. Instead, he began a campaign of transferring prisoners from the facility to nations that volunteered to take them.\n\nBut since he began his program of freeing prisoners by transferring them, well over 100 have simply returned to the battlefields to kill westerners in general and Americans in particular.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston, or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.
The Vatican under Pope Francis is consolidating its opposition to gender theory, the notion that maleness and femaleness can be separated from biological sex, according to veteran Vatican analyst John L. Allen, Jr.\n\nAlthough prior popes were also critical of gender theory, Allen writes in a March 15 essay, opposition has intensified on Francis's watch.\n\nThe pope has repeatedly warned against the dangers of ideologies that separate sexual identity from biology, decrying gender theory as against the nature of things. It seems, Allen writes, that folks at the Vatican have picked up on Francis' war on gender theory and have decided to throw themselves into the fray.\n\nAs an example, Allen cites a conference at Rome's Santa Croce University this week that featured a forceful critique of gender theory, notably during a panel chaired by German Archbishop Georg Gänswein, aide to emeritus Pope Benedict XVI and currently the Prefect of the Papal Household.\n\nThe paper was prepared by canon lawyer Vincenzo Turchi, which served to throw some doctrinal heft behind the pope's sometimes casual statements on the subject.\n\nAllen condenses the Church's opposition to gender theory into three bullet points, all contained in Turchi's talk:\n\n– It undermines the objective moral norms governing sexual behavior by proposing that sexual identity and orientation are not given in nature, but rather the result of contingent historical and cultural factors.\n\n– In the hands of educators, it jeopardizes the right of parents to be the primary teachers of their children.\n\n– It threatens traditional Christian morality by casting it as discriminatory and bigoted.\n\nGender theory is based on the primacy of culture over nature, Turchi's paper read. Since gender theory views nature and biology data as marginal, sexual differences are fluid and changeable and can be fashioned on the basis of individual self-determination.\n\nCommenting on educational programs where gender theory is currently employed, Turchi spoke of a pilot curriculum in Spain where children are encouraged to pretend that they are members of the opposite sex to break down their natural identification with their bodies.\n\nThis includes acting out fairy tales, where boys are encouraged to play the part of Little Red Riding Hood, while girls are invited to play the part of the wolf, Allen notes.\n\nAdded to this, Turchi cited developments in northern Europe, such as the adoption of gender-neutral pronouns in Swedish schools and sexual education in Denmark that includes the possibility for guest speakers such as a transsexual prostitute.\n\nFrancis denounced gender theory for its denial of the difference and reciprocity in nature of a man and a woman and for its dream of a society without sexual differences in a lengthy 2017 teaching letter on marriage and the family called The Joy of Love (Amoris Laetitia).\n\nAn appreciation of our body as male or female, he wrote, is necessary for our own self-awareness in an encounter with others different from ourselves and is far from the unisex utopia that some would like to impose.\n\nEfforts to blot out sexual differences based on anatomy are symptomatic of a sick society that no longer knows how to deal with it, he added.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren told attendees at a town hall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa Sunday that, if she is elected president, her education secretary will have to be approved by a transgender child.\n\nWhen a supporter told Warren public schools need to teach more about LGBTQ history and sex education, the Massachusetts senator replied her education secretary would have to be interviewed by a transgender child.\n\nC-SPAN\n\nI have two qualifications that I have talked about over and over for my secretary of education, Warren said. The first, it has to be someone who has taught in a public school.\n\nThen, Warren said that since the question came from a young trans person who asked about a welcoming community, she would have that trans child interview the nominee for education secretary and look for the child's approval:\n\nI said it starts with the Secretary of Education who has a lot to do with where we spend our money, with what gets advanced in our public schools, with what the standards are. And I said I'm gonna have a Secretary of Education that this young trans person interviews on my behalf and only if this person believes that our secretary or secretary of education nominee is – is committed to creating a welcoming environment, a safe environment, and a full educational curriculum for everyone, will that person actually be advanced to be Secretary of Education.\n\nWarren has been reaching out to LGBT voters by condemning Christian schools that hold and teach a biblical worldview of human sexuality and marriage.\n\nStates should focus on funding public schools, not private ones—especially not ones that maintain anti-LGBTQ+ policies. We must ensure every kid—especially LGBTQ+ kids—can get a high-quality public education. https://t.co/hxKap5Ofjm — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 26, 2020\n\nAs Breitbart News also reported in January, if elected, Warren has also vowed to fill at least half of her Cabinet with women and non-binary individuals – or those who claim they are neither male nor female.\n\nHowever, as Gallup has observed, only 4.5 percent of U.S. adults identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) in 2017.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Trump administration, Democrats have continually criticized current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos for not having worked as a regular public school teacher. Most Democrat 2020 candidates have represented the views of the teachers' unions whose leadership has condemned the administration's support for school choice, viewing it as a threat to public schools.
WASHINGTON, DC – Chairman Chuck Grassley's (R-IA) Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC) sent four more judicial nominees to the Senate floor and plans to pass another four at its next business meeting, advancing President Trump's persistent march to keep his campaign promise of reshaping the federal judiciary.\n\nSenators on Thursday voted to send three federal trial court nominees and one federal appeals court nominee to the full Senate, where they are expected to be approved. In a sign of the Democrats' possible weakening resolve to uniformly oppose all Trump judicial picks, three of the nominees received some Democratic votes in support. The appellate nominee, Kurt Engelhardt for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was approved 15-6.\n\nThe only one approved on a straight 11-10 party-line vote was Howard Nielson, nominated for the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah. Nielson is a well-respected former law clerk to a top appellate judge and then worked at the elite Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) at the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nDemocrats are opposing Nielson because of his work defending traditional marriage at the Supreme Court in 2012 and 2013, as well as his work at OLC defending presidential power to subject enemy combatants to enhanced interrogation. He is a partner at Cooper & Kirk, the powerhouse law firm headed by one of the most accomplished lawyers in the nation, Chuck Cooper, who headed OLC as its assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan and Attorney General Ed Meese. Cooper is also a savvy political figure in D.C. and a close ally and personal lawyer to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nEven Nielson's critics acknowledge that he is well-qualified for a judgeship, and attempts to stop him will likely look like partisan obstruction that continues to diminish Democrats' political currency. He is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate.\n\nSJC held over four more nominations to be voted on at its next business meeting.\n\nThese include Michael Brennan for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Brennan's nomination has been slow-walked because home-state Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI)—an aggressive partisan who is vulnerable for re-election in 2018—has refused to return her blue slip consenting to a committee hearing.\n\nBlue slips are a courtesy that Senate Democrats have abused during the Trump presidency, which formerly allowed a home-state senator to insist on consultations but which were never intended as a one-senator veto on a nominee with majority support. Democrats' misuse of blue slips to derail nominees led to Grassley's discarding of the process, and last month, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) led the full Senate to confirm the first Trump nominee to be initially blocked by a blue slip, Judge David Stras to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n\nBrennan and the other held-over nominees are expected to eventually be confirmed as well. Despite Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) efforts to derail President Trump's agenda, the president's aggressive promise to reorient the nation's courts continues apace.\n\nKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Alice Johnson, the woman who had her prison sentence commuted by President Donald Trump in 2018, spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Saturday.\n\nMy life has been totally changed by President Trump, she said, thanking the president for realizing her plight and acting to free her.\n\nCPAC attendees were familiar with Johnson after she was featured in a Trump campaign Super Bowl ad in 2020, and his State of the Union speech, but her appearance at the conservative conference allowed her to share the details of her story.\n\nI made a mistake, I take full responsibility for something that was wrong, she said, sharing the story of how she found herself as a divorced single mother of five children after 19 years of marriage. She admitted that she became addicted to gambling, lost her job, and lost a 12-year-old son in a scooter accident.\n\nUnder those circumstances, she admitted, she turned to crime, acting as a phone mule for a multimillion-dollar cocaine ring.\n\nI'm going to call it just what it was; it was an opportunity from hell, she said. You see what's right now but you never ever see the end. Sin will always take you further than you thought you would go.\n\nJohnson drew audible gasps from the crowd after revealed she was sentenced to life in prison with an additional 25 years with no parole.\n\nShe said she was offered three to five years if she entered into a plea deal and had no idea that a life sentence was even on the table.\n\nJohnson said she was sent to a prison 1,500 miles away from home.\n\nI had a family, and they would tell me that visiting me in prison was like visiting a graveyard because they would come and see the place where my body lay but they could never ever take me back home again, she said.\n\nIn prison, she said, she worked to help other women's lives with mentorship and counseling.\n\nI was able to bring light into a place that only is supposed to be darkness because I went there, but I did not go there by myself, she said. The Lord was with me.\n\nJohnson shocked the crowd when she revealed that she spent 21 years, seven months, and six days in federal prison and her appeal was turned down three times.\n\nThe rest is history, as video of her case made it's way on Twitter to celebrity Kim Kardashian, who shared it on Twitter and brought her case to the attention of President Trump.\n\nWe know it was divine intervention, she said, adding that she, had no idea who Kim Kardashian was.\n\nJohnson thanked the president for commuting the sentences of three other women that she singled out for a second chance last week, noting that she had become the face of criminal justice reform.\n\nI became a face of compassion, of redemption, of grace, and of second chances, because that is what this country has been built upon, she said.\n\nShe praised Trump for signing the criminal justice reform bill and making it a significant part of his administration.\n\nIt's more than just a social justice issue, it's a humanitarian issue, she said.
The ongoing saga of LGBT protests of an upcoming Chick-fil-A restaurant on campus at Duquesne University, a Catholic college in Pittsburgh, has taken on biblical dimensions as a test-case of safe spaces and microaggressions in American higher education.\n\nAccording to its mission statement, Duquesne University is a Catholic university founded by members of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, dedicated to serving God while espousing a profound concern for moral and spiritual values. It also professes a commitment to an ecumenical atmosphere open to diversity.\n\nFor its part, Chick-fil-A CEO management has articulated a biblical understanding of marriage that exactly mirrors Catholic teaching, while also emphasizing that they do not discriminate in any way, and are more than happy to serve anyone who wishes to eat at their establishment.\n\nIn 2012, Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-A, stated: We are very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.\n\nWe know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles, he said.\n\nLambda Gay-Straight Alliance, the LGBT student organization on campus, considers Chick-fil-A's commitment to traditional marriage potentially offensive to gay students, despite the obvious fact that no one is required to patronize the restaurant who doesn't want to.\n\nAt the March 26 meeting, Lambda executive board member Niko Martini proposed that the Student Government Association (SGA) pass a resolution asking the university to reconsider the inclusion of Chick-fil-A as a dining option for students. Martini said he made the proposal on his own behalf and not Lambda's.\n\nChick-fil-A has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights, Martini said. I think it's imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university's] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.\n\nMartini did not explain how eliminating a food establishment committed to a biblical understanding of marriage would increase diversity on campus.\n\nMeanwhile Lambda President Rachel Coury expressed worries that the safety of LGBT students might be at risk.\n\nI've tried very hard within the last semester and a half to promote this safe environment for the LGBTQ+ community, Coury said. So I fear that with the Chick-fil-A being in Options that maybe people will feel that safe place is at risk.\n\nDebate sparked by the confrontation, swirling around a series of issues from religious liberty to gay rights to a proper academic environment, have now reached a national level, according to the Duquesne Duke, the university's campus newspaper.\n\nIn an interview on Fox and Friends, retired U.S. Army Ranger Sean Parnell, an alumnus of Duquesne University, minced no words in expressing his dissent from the contemporary environment on the campus of his alma mater.\n\nThey're a bunch of babies. College is supposed to prepare you for the real world, not shield you from opposing opinions, and safe spaces do exactly that. Who doesn't want as an undergrad Chick-fil-A on their campus? I would have killed for a c on my campus when I was at Duquesne, he said.\n\nMy message is: toughen up. there are no safe spaces in the real world, he said. If you're going to be successful in this life after you leave college you've got to learn to embrace adversity and open yourself up to a litany of different opinions. You will never be a CEO of a major company or an entrepreneur or a manager if you are not willing to work with people different than you.\n\nHostility toward proponents of traditional marriage was foreseen by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in his potent dissent of the landmark 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that made gay marriage the law of the land.\n\nAlito prophesied that the misguided decision would be used to damage citizens who do not share a contemporary view of marriage as an elastic arrangement between an unspecified number of unspecified persons.\n\nIt will be used, he wrote presciently, to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

BOSTON (AP) — Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric Co. into a highly profitable multinational conglomerate and parlayed his legendary business acumen into a retirement career as a corporate leadership guru, has died. He was 84.\n\nHis death was confirmed Monday by GE. The cause of death was renal failure, his wife Suzy told The New York Times.\n\nWelch became one of the nation's most well-known and highly regarded corporate leaders during his two decades as GE's chairman and chief executive, from 1981 to 2001. He personified the so-called cult of the CEO during the late-1990s boom, when GE's soaring stock price made it the most valuable company in the world.\n\nA chemical engineer by training, Welch transformed the company from a maker of appliances and light bulbs into an industrial and financial services powerhouse. During his tenure, GE's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.\n\nWelch's results-driven management approach and hands-on style were credited with helping GE turn a financial corner, although some of the success came at the expense of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in Welch's relentless efforts to cut costs and rid GE of unprofitable businesses.\n\nBusiness success and outspokenness brought him wide fame.\n\nIn 1999, Fortune magazine named Welch as its Manager of the Century.\n\nFor his first book, Jack: Straight From the Gut, Welch received a $7.1 million advance. Although released on the very morning of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, the book became a best-seller, and led to frequent speaking engagements where he took his candor on stage.\n\nFrom the day I joined GE to the day I was named CEO, 20 years later, my bosses cautioned me about my candor, Welch wrote in 'Straight from the Gut.' I was labeled abrasive and consistently warned my candor would soon get in the way of my career … and I'm telling you that it was candor that helped make it work.\n\nWelch did not slow down after leaving GE.\n\nHe became a senior advisor with private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice in 2001. He also taught a course on business leadership at MIT's Sloan School of Management in 2006. In 2009, Welch founded the Jack Welch Management Institute, an online MBA program that is now part of Strayer University.\n\nWhile Welch was known for being hypercompetitive, he also stressed giving everyone a fair shake.\n\nIn the 2005 book, Winning, Welch wrote that he would like to be remembered as a huge advocate of candor and meritocracy, and believing everyone deserves a chance. And I'd like to be remembered for trying to make the case that you can never let yourself be a victim.\n\nAlong with Welch's fame came greater scrutiny. Welch found himself defending his retirement compensation. Amid a wave of corporate scandals, details of Welch's GE perks emerged in court papers during his 2002 divorce from his wife of 13 years, Jane Beasley. He received millions of dollars in benefits, including unlimited personal use of GE's planes, office space and financial services.\n\nAfter the perks became public, Welch reimbursed the company for many of them, and paid for use of aircraft and other services.\n\nHis first marriage, to Carolyn, ended amicably in divorce after 28 years in 1987. Plans for his second divorce were disclosed shortly after Harvard Business Review editor Suzy Wetlaufer revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch while working on a story about him.\n\nWelch didn't blame the media for the attention the affair generated.\n\nChrist, if I was a journalist, I'd write a scandalous story, Welch told the CBS television news magazine 60 Minutes in a 2005 interview. I mean, it's a good story, but I don't care. I fell in love.\n\nWetlaufer resigned the Harvard editing post in 2002 because of a furor caused by her relationship with Welch. In a January 2012 interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, when asked how he persuaded Wetlaufer to marry him, Welch replied, My charm and probably my wallet.\n\nWe had a little scandal at the beginning, he continued. And it's been the greatest 10 years of our lives.\n\nThe couple wrote a regular column, called The Welch Way, in Business Week magazine for four years. They also wrote management books, including Winning in 2005.\n\nThe Welches resumed writing a regular column in 2012, this time for Reuters. They used the column to dole out advice for business and political figures, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, whom they supported.\n\nWelch was also active on Twitter, where he opined on everything from politics to business to sports and had 1.4 million followers.\n\nSome of those opinions generated controversy.\n\nHe questioned a monthly jobs report in October 2012 that showed the unemployment rate had fallen below 8% for the first time in three and a half years. The report came two days after President Barack Obama had performed poorly in his first debate with Romney and a month before the election.\n\nUnbelievable jobs numbers, he tweeted. These Chicago guys will do anything…can't debate so change numbers.\n\nObama hailed from Chicago. While some Republican members of Congress echoed his views, his criticism was mostly derided by economists and by former Labor Department officials from the Bush administration, who vouched for the accuracy of the data.\n\nIn his writing and speaking, Welch shared the wisdom he gained in a GE career that began right after he left grad school. He quickly climbed the ranks, and became the company's youngest chairman and CEO in 1981, at age 45. Welch quickly shook up GE, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname Neutron Jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. Welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. Welch also divested GE of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be No. 1 or 2 in their markets. The early moves dismantled GE's bureaucracy and eliminated many layers of reporting relationships.\n\nHe's quick on the trigger — sometimes too quick, Noel Tichy, the author of a 1993 book on Welch and a former leader of GE's vaunted training programs, said in 2001. He'll make snap judgments. He's a human being that has temper tantrums.\n\nWith all that, I think he's the greatest business leader I ever met, Tichy said.\n\nAnd Welch freely acknowledged his mistakes. One was Calma, a computer design firm that GE bought in 1981. The company wound up losing $50 million annually until GE sold it in 1988.\n\nWelch delayed his retirement for one last bold move, a $41 billion bid to buy Honeywell International.\n\nWelch predicted easy government approval for the largest acquisition GE had ever attempted, but European regulators rejected the deal as bad for competition.\n\nIn 1986, Welch made one of his boldest moves, a $6.4 billion acquisition of RCA, including the NBC television network. The deal energized GE, which made hundreds more acquisitions as the company moved aggressively into financial services, medical equipment and jet engines.\n\nOne of Welch's greatest accomplishments, his supporters say, is the talent GE has created by placing a premium on developing leaders. Many former GE executives now lead Fortune 500 companies.\n\nAmong the leaders Welch groomed was his GE successor, Jeffrey Immelt. Welch has written that picking his successor leading up to the 2001 leadership transition was the most important and agonizing decision he ever made.\n\nIn April 2008, Immelt became the target of Welch's blunt talk when GE missed a quarterly earnings target, a month after Immelt had promised investors the company would meet its goals. The disappointment sent GE shares down nearly 13% in a single day, prompting Welch to say that he would get a gun out and shoot Immelt if he allowed GE to miss earnings targets again.\n\nAfter making the comment on CNBC, Welch went back on the GE-owned cable station the next day to renounce his harsh talk, saying, Nothing, nothing, nothing is as disgusting to me as some old CEO chirping away about how things aren't as good under the new guy as they were under him.\n\nAnd he never strayed far from GE.\n\nWhen I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, 'So how exactly are you running the company?' Jack was still in it – committed to GE's success. And to have Jack Welch ask me how I am running GE is pretty humbling, said GE's current CEO, Larry Culp.\n\nHe will be deeply missed by me and the entire GE team. And we'll continue to honor his legacy by doing exactly what Jack would want us to do: win. We extend our thoughts and sympathies to Suzy and his family during this time.\n\nBorn Nov. 19, 1935, as the only child of an Irish working-class family in Salem, Mass., Welch graduated from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in 1957 with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. He later obtained master's and doctoral degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois, finishing in 1960.\n\nWelch joined GE that year as a junior engineer in Pittsfield, Mass.\n\nHe rose through the ranks, and built GE's plastics business into one of the company's fastest growing business units. He became a senior vice president in 1977, and vice chairman in 1979. In 1995, Welch suffered chest pains and underwent heart bypass surgery.\n\nThe setback led to speculation that GE could be seeking a quick successor to Welch, but he remained at the helm another six years.\n\nWelch moved to Boston after his career at GE, living in a townhouse in the city's Beacon Hill section.\n\nIn his later years, Welch also devoted more time to passions such as baseball — specifically, the Boston Red Sox.\n\nHe is survived by his third wife, Suzy Welch, and four children from his first marriage.
The Arizona Republican Party will vote on resolutions to censure Cindy McCain, former Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, when it meets on January 23.\n\nMcCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), endorsed President-elect Joe Biden over President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nOn Tuesday, Arizona Central reported the text of the draft resolution to censure and dissolve any connections between the Republican Party and McCain:\n\nWHEREAS, Cindy Hensley McCain, the wife of the late Arizona US Senator John McCain, has supported leftist causes such as gay marriage, growth of the administrative state, and others that run counter to Republican values, a Republican form of government, and the US Constitution; WHEREAS, Cindy McCain has failed to support Conservative Republican candidates such as President Trump; WHEREAS, Cindy McCain has supported globalist policies and candidates, including Democrats such as Joe Biden, in direct opposition to Republican values, the interests of the American people, and the Constitution of the United States; WHEREAS, Cindy McCain has condemned President Trump for his criticism of her husband and erroneously placed behaviors over actual presidential results; and\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican National Committee Chairman Ronna McDaniel issued a statement opposing the censure resolution of McCain.\n\nObviously we are upset that a prominent Republican would support Joe Biden whose beliefs are the opposite of what our party stands for, but the language in this resolution is abhorrent, McDaniel said in the statement.\n\nMy hope is that the Arizona Republican Party will not entertain it. This does nothing to grow our party or put us in a better position to win in 2022, McDaniel added.\n\n12 News subsequently reported that the language of the draft censure resolution has been modified:\n\nMcDaniel was reacting to an initial draft of the McCain resolution that included inflammatory language about both Cindy McCain and her late husband, Sen. John McCain. That language was removed from the resolution that will go to a vote in two weeks. The chairman of the Republican Party nationally understands that the chairman of the Republican Party locally is a complete goofball, said Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general and longtime McCain family friend. . . Sen. McCain was censured by the state party in 2014. He went on to win re-election two years later, defeating current party chair Kelli Ward in the GOP primary.\n\nI'm not surprised by the continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward . . . She's shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections — her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins, McCain said in a statement released to the Arizona Republic late Tuesday.\n\nWard is a former state legislator who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Arizona and is a strong supporter of President Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal said resolutions addressing Flake and Ducey will also be considered at the January 23 meeting of the Arizona Republican Party.\n\nA separate resolution to censure Flake cites his opposition to President Trump's re-election, and a third resolution to censure Ducey cites his failure to remove emergency coronavirus pandemic restrictions.
South Bend Mayor and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg suggested Tuesday that Vice President Mike Pence is not as sincere in his Christian faith as he claims to be, judging based on his political alliance with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe section in my book about Mike Pence begins with that quote from Lincoln where he says, Both sides in great contests invoke God, think and hope that God's on their side. Both may be, and one must be, wrong, Buttigieg told Father Edward Beck in a wide-ranging interview on faith and public service for CNN. The idea that God wants somebody like Mike Pence to be the cheerleader for a President largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give God very little credit.\n\nMichael D'Antonio, co-author of The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence, told CNN in August 2018 that Pence believes him becoming vice president was divine intervention. Absolutely everything that Mike Pence does is oriented towards him becoming President… by the time he left high school, he had decided he was going to be President of the United States.\n\nAnd as he rose through life, becoming a member of Congress and then Governor of Indiana, he actually sort of heard in his being God's direction, D'Antonio told New Day co-host John Berman. The author went on to claim how Pence thought that God was calling him to now be Vice President and function as a President-in-waiting.\n\nIn his discussion with Beck, Buttigieg took aim at Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, legislation that Pence, then governor of the state, signed into law in 2015. The law allows both individuals and business to assert as a defense in legal proceedings that their religion has been burdened. The small town mayor called it a license to harm others in the name of religion.\n\nIt was to me a trashing not just of our sense of freedom and our sense of rights, but also, in some way, a trashing of religion, he said. Like is this really the biggest thing we should be doing to accommodate religion right now? Making it easier to harm people in its name?\n\nIn another portion of the pair's discussion, Buttigieg spoke about why he believes same-sex marriage is a contentious issue in religious circles.\n\nIt saddens me because when I think about the blessings of marriage, first of all it's one of the most conservative things about my life, very conventional, the 37-year-old said. It is morally one of the best things in my life. Being married to Chasten makes me a better person. I would even say it moves me closer to God.\n\nAnd so the idea that this of all things is what people are attacking each other over and excluding each other over, when God is love, we are taught, he went on. Of all the things to beat people up over on theological grounds, it just seems to me that loving shouldn't be one of them. So it's a painful thing to watch.\n\nIf you believe marriage has to do with love, if also, by the way, at the risk of sounding a bit conservative, you believe that sex has to do with love, or ought to, then I think it takes you to a pretty specific place, he added. I've learned that it's an expression of love, at least it can be. And I guess I believe it ought to be.\n\nThe interview comes after Buttigieg announced his campaign had raised more than $7 million in the first quarter.
Actor Jason Lee has become the latest celebrity to confirm he is no longer practicing Scientology.\n\nThe 46-year-old My Name is Earl star, who moved to Denton, Texas with his wife Ceren Alkac and their children last year, confirmed his exit from the controversial religion in an interview with local outlet The Dentonite this weekend.\n\nThe actor told the outlet that, contrary to rumors that have been floated about his move to Texas, he has no plans to open a Scientology or any other religious center in the city.\n\nIf Ceren and I had an idea for a business, it certainly wouldn't happen at the cost of someone else's. And being that we don't practice Scientology, and that we aren't particularly interested in opening religious centers in general, we have no plans to open a Scientology center, the actor said.\n\nQuite a few rumors about me/us floating around but none of it's true, he added. We're not here to buy up or change or take over Denton, put some kind of personal stamp on it. We're just here like anyone else who wants to be a part of Denton's very cool creative community, and to be involved and perhaps help where we can.\n\nIn an essay for Gawker last year, Lee's first wife Carmen Llywelyn blamed Scientology for the breakup of their marriage. Lee and Llewelyn were married from 1995 to 2001.\n\nI was very much in love with the guy and wanted our marriage to work, she wrote.  I did what I thought was right. But I made the mistake of immersing myself completely in his world. I did what so many other people who join Scientology do: I lost all sense of individual identity in the name of the cult.\n\nLee joins several other recent high-profile defectors from the controversial Church, including actress Leah Remini, musician Lisa Marie Presley, director Paul Haggis, and actor Jason Beghe.\n\nIn March of last year, documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney released an HBO exposé on the controversial religion called Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief. The film — which won three Emmy Awards — detailed the controversial behind-the-scenes working of the church and made several explosive allegations regarding its most devoted celebrity adherents, including Tom Cruise and John Travolta.\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dnzussbaum
Britain's Labour Party is demanding the UK government impose an imperialistic diktat upon the predominantly black citizens of Bermuda for refusing to adhere to the liberal-left's same-sex marriage demands.\n\nHelen Goodman — Labour's shadow Foreign Office minister — said the devolved, democratic decision taken by Bermuda to repeal gay marriage laws — turns same-sex couples into second class citizens, implying force should be used to impose gay marriage laws.\n\nFor that to happen anyone in the world would be shameful. For it to happen in a British territory, for the legislation signed by a British governor and permitted by a British foreign secretary makes us complicit in something which this House has repeatedly voted against, she argued.\n\nApparently imperialism is fine, but only in the pursuit of leftist goals like those of the LGBTQII++ lobby, in a mostly Christian nation.\n\nThe British government called Bermuda's decision disappointing but resisted getting involved despite the island's status as a British Overseas Territory. It's almost as if the Brits retain some knowledge about holding together an empire. If Bermuda were in the European Union, there'd have probably been some kind of sanctions, or perhaps a gay-migrant quota by now.\n\nRenowned mastermind (click it) David Lammy MP somehow managed to invoke slavery into his pro-imperialist arguments:\n\nThe first slaves we brought to Bermuda in 1620, oppressed, segregated, discriminated against… And that is why leaders like Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu and Barack Obama have not just fought for race rights, but they have fought for rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people.\n\nThis country has been one of the world leaders on this subject – so if this is not the issue on which to refuse assent I don't know which is.\n\nThe Green Party's Caroline Lucas called it an absolute scandal that Britain was not willing to enforce LGBT ideals on another nation.\n\nThe rights of gay couples remain the same as those of straight married couples in Bermuda, but only the verbiage applied to each type of partnership is different.\n\nIn 2016, over 60 per cent of Bermudans rejected both same sex marriages and same sex civil unions in a plebiscite held on the same day as Britain's Brexit referendum. The votes were not binding as they did not pass the 50 per cent turnout threshold. Nevertheless the government sought to compromise on the matter, protecting LGBT rights and attempting to respect the will of the people vis a vis marriage as an institution.\n\nThe new rules — to add further irony — were drafted and passed by the Progressive Labour Party government in Bermuda, a nation of just over 60,000 people.\n\nWalton Brown, Bermuda's Minister of Home Affairs, said this week he was pleased with the decision as Governor John Rankin signed it into law.\n\nHere's the icing on the forcibly-baked-by-threat-of-imprisonment-same-sex marriage cake: Rankin is a 30+ year career diplomat from the British government, propelled into high office by Prime Minister Tony Blair's government in 2003 when he became Britain's Consul-General in Boston. He has since served in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Nepal, and now in Bermuda.\n\nRaheem Kassam is the editor in chief of Breitbart London
The Home Office is allowing women with severe mental disabilities to be forcibly married and raped, in both Britain and Pakistan, so that foreign men can obtain a visa and stay in the country.\n\nMigrant and Muslim families reportedly believe that marrying their disabled children to foreigners will secure them a carer — and are being allowed to because authorities are too politically correct to invene, according to critics.\n\nThe victims include a woman with the mental age of a 7-year-old allowed to marry in a British registry office to a Pakistani man who had overstayed his student visa, The Times reports.\n\nAuthorities had been aware of the case for over ten years and had received warnings the family of the man was paying around £20,000 to the woman's family because he wanted to stay in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe woman had been forced into marriage twice already abroad, beaten, and raped, but council officials allowed the British wedding as they were concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background of those involved, according to court documents.\n\nAnother Muslim woman with a very significant degree of learning disability was forcibly married to a cousin in Bangladesh and raped, before the abuser was handed a British visa.\n\nAt a hearing about the case in the Court of Protection, in 2012, a judge said the victim's husband was physically very rough and abusive, smacking her head, shaking her, and yanking her eyelid.\n\nHe added: I watched the wedding video and [the victim] was slumped in a chair almost comatose.\n\nChain Migration: UK Govt 'Turns Blind Eye' to Forced Marriage, Hands Visas to Foreign Rapists https://t.co/ExXaJ97Pes — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2018\n\nThe migrant she was forced to marry twice failed to get a visa and an immigration judge said that her ability to understand and sponsor him was very much in doubt. However, she was then forced to live with him and was raped and impregnated.\n\nHer parents were devout Muslims who saw nothing wrong with the arrangement, spoke little English, and were very largely insulated from mainstream English society and mistrustful of non-Bengalis the court heard.\n\nThe wedding was finally annulled and the child was taken in to care.\n\nIn a similar case the following year, Mr Justice Holman said: I have been told there are a number of incapacitated adults who have been the subject of arranged or forced marriages and that it is important to send a strong signal to the Muslim and Sikh communities that arranged marriages, where one party is mentally incapacitated, simply will not be tolerated.\n\nRachel Clawson, a former social worker and University of Nottingham academic specialising in forced marriage cases with disabled victims, told The Times:\n\nWe've come across all sorts of abusive issues where families have basically sold their son or daughter. Because families don't see these as forced marriages, lots of practitioners don't see them as forced marriages either.\n\nThey're worried about being perceived as racist or culturally insensitive. Most marriages take place overseas and people get visas to come over.\n\nReport: Ex-Labour Councillor and Immigration Lawyer Asama Javed Is Forced-Marriage Fixer for Girls as Young as 15 https://t.co/FChON70O39 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 2, 2018
Mark Anthony Conditt died on Wednesday morning when he exploded a device in his car as police attempted to take him into custody. Less than 12 hours later, information about who the Austin Serial Bomber is beginning to emerge.\n\nThe man described by his former employer as quiet and introverted went on a three-week rampage that left two people dead, five people injured, and people across Austin, Travis County, and FedEx stores and processing facilities terrorized.\n\nEducation:\n\nConditt's family homeschooled him before he graduated and attended Austin Community College. He attended the local college for about two years, but did not graduate, KVUE reported. His formal education at the school ended in 2012.\n\nDuring his college years, Conditt appears to have written some conservative blog posts as part of an assignment, NBC News reported. The blog, Defining My Stance, provided a platform for a host postings ranging from anti-gay marriage to his positions on free abortions to why sex offender registrations should be ended. The posts were allegedly authored by a Mark A. Conditt, but NBC News said they were unable to confirm with school officials if the bomber actually wrote the posts.\n\nEmployment:\n\nConditt does not appear to have any kind of military or law enforcement service in his background. He worked for Crux Manufacturing for about four years, overlapping the time he spent at Austin Community College, the Austin ABC affiliate reported. His former boss said he hired the then-19-year-old because he seemed like a smart kid who showed a lot of promise. He reportedly worked in sales and purchasing and did a little bit of everything. However, after his performance slipped and he received several unheeded warnings, Crux Manufacturing let him go in August 2017.\n\nHis former employers described him as a quiet and introverted man who would prioritize things in his own way, KVUE reported.\n\nConditt listed work as a computer repair technician, according to his profile on a job recruiting website, the Austin American Statesman reported.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott told KXAN's Phil Prazan that Conditt was unemployed when he died and had no military background.\n\nPolitics:\n\nThe college blog posts allegedly written by Conditt paint a picture of a politically conservative person.\n\nI am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended, the blog page's profile states. The reasons I am taking this class is because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.\n\nAgain, NBC could not confirm is the same Mark A. Conditt authored the posts on this blogsite.\n\nSome of the headlines on the 2012 blog read:\n\nWhy Gay Marriage Should be Illegal\n\nMy View on Free Abortions\n\nWhy We Might Want to Consider Doing Away with Sex Offender Registration\n\nAn Argument for the Death Penalty\n\nPersonality:\n\nConditt's neighbors paint a picture not dissimilar to that of his former employer. Jeff Reeb told NBC News that Conditt was a very normal kid and that his family was extremely nice.\n\nReeb told the Statesman that he struggled to wrap his mind about Conditt's actions. I know this is a cliché but I just can't imagine that, he explained about Conditt's involvement in the bombings. He said his grandson grew up with Conditt and they played together.\n\nHe is reported to be the oldest of four children.\n\nThe Bombings:\n\nThere is no reported criminal history in Conditt's past, several news outlets reported. That clear recorded ended on March 2 when Conditt allegedly delivered a package to the northeast Austin home of Anthony House. The package exploded and killed the 39-year-old black man.\n\nOn March 12, Conditt struck again by killing 17-year-old Draylen Mason in East Austin when a package exploded after he brought it inside his home. Mason's mother was also injured in the attack. A few hours later, Conditt also injured a 75-year-old Hispanic woman after she picked up a package on her front steps.\n\nOn March 19, two other young men were injured when Conditt changed his tactics. This time a tripwire bomb exploded — sending the two men to a local hospital.\n\nAustin Interim Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters that investigators believe the use of a tripwire in the fourth bomb shows a higher level of sophistication than already been demonstrated. He said it also indicates a shift in the serial bomber's strategy of targeting specific people to a more random style.\n\nThe randomness expanded when a package exploded at a FedEx processing facility in Schertz, Texas. A woman suffered ringing in her ears after the package exploded on an automated conveyor belt near her work location. Police tracked down a second package at a FedEx Ground facility in East Austin. Police later determined that package was an unexploded device.\n\nThe packages appeared to have been shipped from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley, Texas, near the location of the fourth bombing.\n\nU.S. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul (R-TX) told the Statesman that federal investigators obtained videos that could possibly show a suspect connected to the Schertz bombing.\n\nMcCaul told reporters that he hoped the bomber's biggest mistake was going through FedEx.\n\nIt was.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, law enforcement officials tracked down Conditt through a variety of techniques and identified the young man from Pflugerville as the suspect. Using cell phone technology, police tracked Conditt to a motel parking lot in neighboring Round Rock. A few hours later, Conditt killed himself by exploding a device inside his car.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThis is what we do not know about Mark Conditt. Police are continuing to investigate the young man's background and his Pflugerville home to search for clues as to why Conditt would suddenly launch a bombing attack that would kill two people, injur six others, and eventually take his own life.
Former Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Brad Grey died Sunday at his California home after a battle with cancer, his family has confirmed. He was 59.\n\nIn a statement, Grey's family confirmed that the former executive was surrounded by family and loved ones at his house in Holmby Hills when he passed away. A private funeral will be held later this week, while a public memorial service was set to be scheduled in the coming weeks.\n\nGrey exited Paramount in February after running the studio over a 12-year tenure that saw him oversee massive hits with films in the Star Trek and Transformers franchises.\n\nBefore taking the top job at Paramount, Grey co-founded the management agency Brillstein-Grey in the early 1980s, where he helped shepherd The Sopranos and Real Time with Bill Maher onto television, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nGrey was also a co-founder of production company Plan B with actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, where he helped produce Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Departed, which won the Best Picture Oscar in 2006.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by the sudden passing of our friend Brad Grey, whose tremendous kindness and talent inspired so many of us in the entertainment industry, Viacom owner Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari Redstone said in a statement. His vision and leadership at Paramount Pictures brought iconic films and programs to audiences around the world. We are so grateful for Brad's friendship.\n\nGrey is survived by his wife Cassandra, their son Jules, three grown children from a previous marriage, his mother Barbara Schumsky and siblings Michael and Robin Grey.\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum
Actor Terry Crews detailed his life-long battle with an addiction to pornography and revealed how it almost derailed his marriage in a three-part video series posted to Facebook.\n\nThe 47-year-old former NFL player and Brooklyn Nine-Nine star released his latest Dirty Little Secret Facebook video on Tuesday. In the first video posted earlier this month, the actor revealed he went to rehab for his addiction, and said it had really, really messed up life in a lot of ways.\n\nDirty Little Secret Posted by Terry Crews on Thursday, February 11, 2016\n\nIt became a thing where I didn't tell anybody, Crews says in the first video. It was my secret, nobody knew, and that allowed it to grow, and it got bad. If day turns into night and you are still watching, you probably got a problem, and that was me. I didn't tell my wife, didn't tell my friends, nobody knew.\n\nThe actor added that pornography can change the way human beings view each other, not as people but as objects and body parts.\n\nMy issue was and is with pornography is it changes the way you think about people. People become objects, people become body parts, they become things to be used rather than people to be loved, Crews said. You start to use people, you start to feel like you're the man and they're just whatever.\n\nIn the second clip, Crews said it was important not to let a sense of shame interfere in the battle against overcoming addiction.\n\nDirty Little Secret Part 2 Posted by Terry Crews on Wednesday, February 17, 2016\n\nShame doesn't say you did something bad, shame says you are bad, he said. And when you think and believe that you are bad, there's no way out. You say: 'You know what, forget it, I might as well use drugs, I might as well overeat, I might as well use porn.' Because if you believe that are bad, then you act accordingly. What you have to change is that paradigm in your life, you have to believe that you are good.\n\nDirty Little Secret part 3 Posted by Terry Crews on Tuesday, February 23, 2016\n\nIn the clip posted Tuesday, the actor revealed his pornography addiction became so bad he felt like my wife owed me sex.\n\nWhen you have a sense of entitlement, it's extremely dangerous, Crews said. What entitlement does is it gives you self-pity. And self-pity — it feels good. It feels good.\n\nEvery man out there desires intimacy. Every time you look at pornography, it's a desire for intimacy, he said. You are trying to fight your feelings of being alone by filling it with pornography in an attempt to feel that you are with someone and you know someone. But pornography is an intimacy killer. It kills all intimacy.\n\nCrews also cautioned both men and women to take more responsibility to combat the problem.\n\nYou cannot accept any pornography in your man's life. Anything that will make you feel denigrated, make you feel less than, you cannot accept it, he said.\n\nI'm calling on men to be more accountable. A true man and a true woman is a person who takes responsibility for everything in his life, good and bad, he added.\n\nWatch Crews' three-part Dirty Little Secret Facebook series above.
Things are about to change. Don't worry: it won't last forever. These things never do. It's a phase, and if you fly over it at 30,000 feet, what you will see is that all this social justice-systemic racism-defund the police nonsense comes down to one thing… The Democrat Party is returning to its soft-on-crime roots, and in the end, this will not end well for Democrats.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take a while for voters to come to their senses. Things are going to get worse before they get better — thankfully, this worsening will be contained in Democrat-run cities.\n\nNevertheless, the radical left is now emboldened and have the Democrat Party, academia, the media, countless district attorney offices, the government bureaucracy, corporate America, and Hollywood on the run… So until things get better (and I promise things will get better), here's my handy-dandy guide to surviving the coming era of social justice mob rule…\n\nGet the Hell Out of Democrat-Run Cities\n\nThis isn't an easy one to accomplish. I know because I've done it twice already. But you have to get out. The Democrats that run these cities did not only stand by as their cities were burned and looted, as predominantly black neighborhoods were burned and looted by predominantly white, left-wing terrorist groups like Antifa — these Democrats encouraged and continue to encourage burning and looting.\n\nI'm sorry, but the cities are lost to us now, and will be for years…\n\nWhen Democrats are releasing violent criminals, encouraging illegal immigration, and passing laws to disarm you while turning the police into eunuchs, it's over… Minneapolis is preparing to disband the police. Los Angeles just slashed police funding. New York is gearing up to slash police funding. I'm telling you, it's over…\n\nSo you have to get out now, especially if you own property because that property is about to become worthless.\n\nThis is not hyperbole. This is history repeating itself. The gangs and cartels are about to take over your city. Welcome back to the urban blight of the 1970s.\n\nNow… If you're a Democrat, you need to stay put. We don't need you voting to Californicate the rest of the country.\n\nMove to Rural America\n\nYou can try moving to the suburbs, I guess… But as your nearest Democrat-run city descends into hell, your taxes will explode. Plus, you'll be funding rotting schools, potholes, corrupt Democrat political machines, and self-destructive social justice programs.\n\nAlso, eventually, the blight moves outside the cities and into surrounding areas. Let me put it this way… If you do move to the suburbs, be prepared to move again the moment you see graffiti. Graffiti is always the beginning of the end.\n\nThe reason I recommend Rural America is because Democrats hate Rural America. They want their foofoo theaters and their foofoo cafes and their foofoo nightclubs. Rural America is Red America… I love it out here. Calm, peaceful, serene… Not a single drop of this social justice madness has touched my community.\n\nTo those of us out here in Rural America, all this mayhem is just a reality TV show we like to call Toldjaso!\n\nPrepare to Home School\n\nIf you can afford private school, great. If the public schools in your area are not yet polluted with social justice propaganda, great. But you must be prepared to home school because with the left emboldened and almost entirely in charge of academia, the last thing public schools will be teaching is reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n\nYou need to keep a close eye on what your school is teaching because the left only wants to teach your kids to engage in loveless sex, the sanctity of abortion, why America is evil, that men are women and women are men, and that Global Warming is real. (It's not.)\n\nBe prepared to home school.\n\nBuy Guns and Plenty of Ammo\n\nThis is not a troll. This is not an attempt to be inflammatory. There's only one reason the left-wing terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter always-always-always focused their marauding in left-wing cities: they know the populace is defenseless.\n\nThese terrorists also know that once they move out into the suburbs, people are more likely to own guns.\n\nAnd they damn well know Rural America is armed to the teeth, so they will never come out here.\n\nFirearms are not only necessary for self-defense and for you to honor your primary responsibility in life, which is to protect your family and property; they're an excellent deterrent. I own four firearms. Two are within reach of my bed. Peace of mind, baby.\n\nIt's time to arm yourself.\n\nI would also recommend obtaining a conceal carry permit.\n\nCancel Your Cable TV\n\nCable news is poison. Hollywood's idea of entertainment today is either pushing sex on your children or straight-up propaganda. Why are you paying to pump this garbage into your home? What, you like paying $125 a month to have CNNLOL deliberately misinform you and then call you racist, to have MTV glorify degeneracy?\n\nThere are all kinds of streaming options out there, many of them free. You'll save money, protect your kids, and best of all, push CNNLOL, MSNBC, and the rest one step closer to history's dustbin.\n\nI've written extensively on this. Please click here, here, and here — okay, that last click is to celebrate the weekend.\n\nKeep Hard Copies of Your Favorite Books, Movies, and TV Shows\n\nSix years ago, almost to the day, I was roundly laughed at for warning people to hold on to their hard copies of Blazing Saddles and Gone with the Wind.\n\nYou see, I've been around long enough to have learned one very important lesson about the left: no matter how outrageous the idea might sound at the time, the left — with the help of its media machine — will eventually mainstream that idea.\n\nHey, we went from zero to gay marriage in ten years. We went from zero to drag queen story hour in ten seconds.\n\nSo when America's leftists began to complain about classic films and television shows that are problematic, I knew it was only a matter of time… Well, the time has come.\n\nAlready, and even though he is innocent of the allegation, Woody Allen — one of our greatest living filmmakers — had his latest film blacklisted, along with his career. The Walt Disney Company has blacklisted its own Song of the South. The creator of The Simpsons has blacklisted an episode of his own show. The Library Journal published an article calling for a ban on books guilty of whiteness, whatever the hell that is. The Little House books are being burned.\n\nAnd now the blacklisting push is ramping up….\n\nJust this week, the far-left Washington Post demanded an immediate and total shutdown of all police movies and TV shows.\n\nLegos is already blacklisting its own toys.\n\nLet me tell you exactly how this is going to work…\n\nThe fascist mob is going to declare certain toys, books, movies, and television shows problematic, and these corporations, that are either cowardly or infested with social justice warriors, are going to disappear these things. Problematic books, movies, and TV shows will vanish off proverbial store shelves — physical and digital.\n\nAnother possibility is that they will be mutilated by censors. Problematic scenes, moments, characters, and words will be removed.\n\nA couple of years ago, I decided to move my movie collection to digital. But after The Simpsons self-blacklister announced that digital copies would be scrubbed of the problematic episode, that even if you purchased the episode digitally, they were going to go in and remove it, I've gotten smarter. Even if I already have a digital copy, I went back and purchased hard copies of movies and TV shows that are wonderfully problematic.\n\nLet me tell you right now, if you don't own hard copies of Manhattan (and probably all of Woody Allen's movies), Married with Children, Gone with the Wind, and pretty much every one of Normal Lear's 1970's sitcoms (All in the Family, Sanford & Son, etc.), you will eventually lose them.\n\nSame with problematic books. Amazon will remove them from your Kindle.\n\nStock Up on Food and Water\n\nThe left-wing Antifa and Black Lives Matter terrorists will probably try to attack the suburbs and Rural America in an indirect way — going after power stations and the like. And if things get bad enough in the cities, we might see supply chains interrupted, so be prepared.\n\n—\n\nListen, out here in Rural America, we're going to be just fine. Don't be stressed. Don't live in fear — just be prepared. Being prepared is a great way to relieve anxiety.\n\nOverall, and as I said earlier, the left is eating its own. Let them fight. Enjoy the show. It's a total waste of time to try and care about people more than they care about themselves. Democrats are getting the blue on blue violence they voted for. It's not your problem. It's not my problem.\n\nWhile Blue America reaps the whirlwind, the rest of us should clean our guns, grill meat, and enjoy Al Bundy taunting fat women.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

CNN's Chris Cuomo once again defended the left-wing terrorist group Antifa, this time declaring them a good cause.\n\nThe far-left Cuomo's abiding affection for these black-clad, fully masked terrorists and the violence they commit, not just against neo-Nazis, but police officers, journalists, and everyday citizens, reveals a lot about the dangerous radicalism of the basement-rated CNN.\n\nLate last year Cuomo openly embraced political violence against the right with a fascist rant defending Antifa's brutality and bloodshed.\n\nIt's not about being right in the eyes of the law, Cuomo said in defense of Antifa, but you also have to know what's right and wrong in a moral, in a good and evil sense.\n\nThat's why people who show up to fight against bigots are not to be judged the same as the bigots, even if they do resort to the same kinds of petty violence, he added.\n\nFight.\n\nWhat you have there is a CNN anchor justifying violence against bigotry in a world where his fake news network is defining Christians as bigots for opposing gay marriage, Republicans as bigots for not voting for Barack Obama, and 16-year-old boys as bigots for wearing Make America Great Again hats.\n\nIn other words, Cuomo and CNN are justifying violence against all of us, everyone to the right of Bernie Sanders.\n\nCuomo once compared these Antifa terrorists, these modern-day brownshirts who attack police officers and regularly assault journalists, to the American servicemen who stormed the beaches at Normandy.\n\nThat's a not a joke. It's right here…\n\nBut-but-but they fight bigotry, Cuomo argues — which is like arguing we need to remember Mussolini kept the trains running on time, Hitler built the autobahn, Mao fought for equality, and Stalin threw good dinner parties…\n\nNow listen to Cuomo attempt to justify mob violence if it's in service to a good cause.\n\nYou can talk about Antifa, I've watched them in streets protesting in different situations, OK? Cuomo argued. There are certainly aspects of them that are true to a cause, that is a good cause, they want social justice, they want whatever they want in that context.\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo says Antifa is a good cause pic.twitter.com/mCMgoyPszQ — Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) April 30, 2019\n\nSorry, decent people do not split hairs to excuse, champion, and encourage evil. Decent people remember that every one of history's monsters, from Hitler to Lenin to Castro to Pol Pot, believed they were fighting a good cause — some even believed they were fighting against bigotry and for social justice. So let's use this opportunity to examine Cuomo's definition of social justice.\n\nSome of you might remember that Fredo's twisted idea of social justice is to expose young girls to a penis without their consent.\n\nAnd let's not forget that Cuomo's warped idea of social justice also includes a return to McCarthyism, to a dark era where we blacklist people who express inappropriate ideas.\n\nCuomo's guest Steve Cortes tried reasoning with him.\n\nChris, Antifa is not a good cause, he said. Antifa does not have good aims, Antifa wants power, wants political power, taken through force. That's what Antifa is all about.\n\nBut Cuomo already knows this. Fredo's watched Antifa assault police offers, assault journalists, terrorize Tucker Carlson's wife, assault everyday people simply enjoying their right to assemble, and like the Southern Democrats of old, he's watched Antifa bully a black woman out of a restaurant.\n\nForget all that, though, and ask yourself on what planet does a decent person even attempt to defend a gang of thugs who dress all in black, wear masks, and brandish weapons?\n\nWell, that planet is called CNN.\n\nYou see, Antifa is okay with CNN because Antifa are their brownshirts, their terrorists, their violent gang of thugs taking it to we Trumptards who dare to point and laugh at CNN, who dare not recognize CNN's authority and wisdom.\n\nHere's some truth: CNN thrills over the petty ultra-violence Antifa unleashes against the political right. In the sick and sinister minds that run that Hate Network, Trump supporters got it coming, which is why — and this is important…\n\nCuomo and his far-left confederates regularly encourage these terrorists.\n\nThat's what's really going on here.\n\nCuomo's not just splitting the Hitler-and-the-autobahn hair to keep the debunked Charlottesville Hoax alive, he is using every opportunity to fire off a dogwhistle, to give his brownshirts a wink of encouragement and a nod of approval.\n\nCNN's association with, encouragement of, and affection for political violence has been well documented over the years, and as we get closer to the 2020 presidential election, it is only going to get worse… Much worse.\n\nAll Cuomo is doing here is prepping a battlefield CNN wants to see bloodied.\n\nP.S. Eighty-nine million who do not watch CNN are subsidizing this hate. Are you one of them?\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.
NASA's aircraft is roughly the size of a softball and weighs less than four pounds. It will make five autonomous flights above the surface of Mars in 2021.\n\nThe miniature aircraft will spin its rotors at about ten times the speed of a terrestrial one, due to the extremely low density of Mars' atmosphere — only about one percent of Earth's. JPL Mars Helicopter Project Manager MiMi Aung explained that the altitude record for a helicopter flying here on Earth is about 40,000 feet [12,000 meters], and when our helicopter is on the Martian surface, it's already at the Earth equivalent of 100,000 feet [30,000 m] up. Therefore, designers had to scrutinize everything, make it as light as possible while being as strong and as powerful as it can possibly be.\n\nIn an official statement posted to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration website, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said, NASA has a proud history of firsts. The idea of a helicopter flying the skies of another planet is thrilling. The Mars Helicopter holds much promise for our future science, discovery and exploration missions to Mars.\n\nTexas Representative John Culberson praised the effort. It's fitting that the United States of America is the first nation in history to fly the first heavier-than-air craft on another world, Culberson said. This exciting and visionary achievement will inspire young people all over the United States to become scientists and engineers, paving the way for even greater discoveries in the future.\n\nThe craft will launch onboard the United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in July 2020 and is expected to arrive on Mars in February 2021. Because of its immense distance — Earth will be several minutes away, traveling at the speed of light — Aung said that direct control will be impossible. Instead, the craft will have an autonomous capability that will be able to receive and interpret commands from the ground, and then fly the mission on its own.\n\nNASA Science Mission Directorate Associate Administrator Thomas Zurbuchen said that the project exemplifies a successful marriage of science and technology innovation and is a unique opportunity to advance Mars exploration for the future.\n\nAfter the Wright Brothers proved 117 years ago that powered, sustained, and controlled flight was possible here on Earth, he said, another group of American pioneers may prove the same can be done on another world.

Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, the Vatican's former doctrinal czar, warned against Catholics who long for a meta-religion of world unity in a January 1 homily in Phoenix.\n\nSome Catholics want the Church to modernize, abandoning its doctrines for the sake of building a new religion of world unity, Müller warned thousands of Catholics gathered in Phoenix for the 2020 Student Leadership Summit hosted by the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS).\n\nIn order to be admitted to this meta-religion, the only price the Church would have to pay is giving up her truth claim, the cardinal told the students. No big deal, it seems, as the relativism dominant in our world anyway rejects the idea that we could actually know the truth and presents itself as guarantor of peace between all world views and world religions.\n\nThe post-Christian world welcomes these efforts to remake the Church as a convenient civil religion, Müller said.\n\nThe German cardinal tied his remarks to claims by the late Jesuit cardinal Carlo Maria Martini that the Church was 200 years behind the times and needed to modernize in order to catch up.\n\nFor some, the Catholic Church is lagging behind by 200 years compared to where the world is today. Is there any truth to this accusation? Müller asked the group.\n\nIt is surely no coincidence that Pope Francis had cited this same quotation in a positive sense just days before Christmas in an address to the Roman Curia, calling for epochal change while insisting that resistance to change always hides some mental disorder.\n\nThe Church has remained 200 years behind the times. Why has it not been shaken up? Are we scared? Fear instead of courage? Pope Francis cited Martini to the Curia, adding that these are words that should make us think.\n\nThere is always a temptation to fall back on the past, Francis continued in his Dec. 21 address, because it is more reassuring, known and, certainly less conflictual. Yet this too is part of the process and the risk of undertaking significant changes.\n\nIt would not be unreasonable to suggest that Cardinal Müller's homily Wednesday was in fact a response to the pope's call for modernization.\n\nAccording to Müller, the crisis facing the Catholic Church today has arisen from attempts to align with secular culture while abandoning the teachings of the faith in the process.\n\nThe crisis in the Church is man-made and has arisen because we have cozily adapted ourselves to the spirit of a life without God, the cardinal said.\n\nThe poison paralyzing the Church is the opinion that we should adapt to the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, and not the spirit of God, he said, that we should relativize God's commandments and reinterpret the doctrine of the revealed faith.\n\nSome people in the Church are longing for a Catholicism without dogmas, without sacraments, and without an infallible magisterium, Müller proposed.\n\nIn his homily, Müller told the students that the antidote to secularization within the Church is a life of faith, since people of faith do not crave the gratifications that the world offers.\n\nThe one who believes needs no ideology, he said. The one who hopes will not reach for drugs. The one who loves is not after the lust of this world, which passes along with the world. The one who loves God and his neighbor finds happiness in the sacrifice of self-giving.\n\nWe will be happy and free when in the spirit of love we embrace the form of life to which God has called each one of us personally: in the sacrament of marriage, in celibate priesthood, or in religious life according to the three evangelical counsels of poverty, obedience and chastity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, he said.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome
For the first time in more than 130 years of record-keeping, young adults in the United States are more likely living with mom and dad than they are living with a spouse or partner.\n\nThirty-two percent of millennials adults aged 18-34 were living in their parents' home in 2014, compared to 31.6 percent of millennials who live with a spouse or significant other, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data.\n\nAnother 14 percent of millennials live alone, or else are single parents. Twenty-two percent live in other circumstances.\n\nThis turn of events is fueled primarily by the dramatic drop in the share of young Americans who are choosing to settle down romantically before age 35, Pew's analysis reads.\n\nDating back to 1880, the most common living arrangement among young adults has been living with a romantic partner, whether a spouse or a significant other, it continues. This type of arrangement peaked around 1960, when 62% of the nation's 18- to 34-year-olds were living with a spouse or partner in their own household, and only one-in-five were living with their parents.\n\nAs Pew reports, the trend is most prevalent among young men, with 35 percent of male millennials opting for the comforts of mom and dad's home, compared to 28 percent who were living with a spouse or partner in their own place.\n\nYoung women, on the other hand, are actually more likely to be living with a spouse (35 percent) than their parents (29 percent).\n\nMarriage and cohabitation have been on the decline since 1990, according to Pew, which projects that one-in-four millennials will never marry. In addition to the decline in marriage, Pew also cites the economy as a central fact causing the adults' retreat to mom and dad's house — simply put, fewer young men have decent jobs.\n\nThe share of young men with jobs peaked around 1960 at 84%. In 2014, only 71% of 18 to 34-year-old men were employed, Pew reports. Similarly with earnings, young men's wages (after adjusting for inflation) have been on a downward trajectory since 1970 and fell significantly from 2000 to 2010. As wages have fallen, the share of young men living in the home of their parent(s) has risen.\n\nThe phenomena also varies among racial and ethnic groups. Black (36 percent) and Hispanic (36 percent) young adults are more likely to live at home than are white (30 percent) young adults.\n\nWhite young adults are more likely to be living with a spouse or partner (36%), the report reads. But the trends are similar for all major racial and ethnic groups including whites: Since 1960, a greater share are living at home and fewer are married or [are] cohabiting and living in their own household.

The Vatican has announced in a statement this week that Pope Paul VI will be canonized in Rome next October with Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was killed in 1980 while celebrating Mass.\n\nPaul VI was pope from 1963 to 1978 and oversaw the close of the Second Vatican Council, which introduced sweeping changes in the church, including the introduction of the use of local languages in the liturgy and a rapprochement between Catholics and other religions, notably the Jews.\n\nThe pope's most controversial move during his tumultuous, 15-year pontificate was the publication of the 1968 encyclical letter titled Humanae Vitae (On Human Life), which confirmed the church's longstanding teaching regarding the immorality of the use of contraceptives to avoid pregnancy. Many inside and outside the church had expected Paul to overturn traditional teaching on contraception, along with the majority of the members of a special commission Paul had set up to study the question.\n\nAs Paul himself noted:\n\nWithin the commission itself, there was not complete agreement concerning the moral norms to be proposed, and … certain approaches and criteria for a solution to this question had emerged which were at variance with the moral doctrine on marriage constantly taught by the magisterium of the Church.\n\nPope Francis has significantly chosen the year 2018—the fiftieth anniversary of Humanae Vitae—for the canonization of Pope Paul VI. Francis has often voiced his personal esteem for Paul VI and has held up Humanae Vitae as a critically important document for today's world.\n\nIn his 2016 letter, Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), Francis cited Humanae Vitae four times, praising the way that Paul had brought out the intrinsic bond between conjugal love and the generation of life.\n\nThe teaching of the Encyclical Humanae Vitae ought to be taken up anew, Francis wrote, in order to counter a mentality that is often hostile to life.\n\nPope John Paul II spent the first five years of his 27-year papacy explaining the theology underlying Humanae Vitae in a series of weekly addresses in what he described as a theology of the body. As Michael Waldstein has written, One of the main goals of the theology of the body is the defense of Paul VI's prophetic encyclical Humanae Vitae.\n\nTen years ago, in a conference commemorating Humanae Vitae's 40th anniversary, Pope Benedict XVI referred to the encyclical as crucial for humanity's future, declaring that it constituted on the part of Paul VI a significant show of courage in reasserting the continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition.\n\nVatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin reportedly said Tuesday that the canonization ceremony of Paul VI and Oscar Romero will take place in late October following a meeting of the Synod of Bishops.\n\nPope Francis beatified Paul VI in 2014 after a first miracle was attributed to his intercession. In early February, a Vatican commission consisting of theologians and doctors approved a second miracle attributed to him by a unanimous vote.\n\nFollow Thomas D.

President Obama's statement on gun control Tuesday included an attempt to dismiss claims he ultimately wants to undermine the 2nd Amendment:\n\nNow, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.\n\nNot a very convincing performance. Is there any other Amendment to the Constitution the president would downplay in this way? Saying, It's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th Amendment.\n\nIf the tone struck you as vaguely familiar, that suggests you've been paying attention. President Obama has often promised that he understood people's concerns about a particular issue, only to reveal later it was all about getting his way.\n\n1.) Here's the president swearing repeatedly, If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\n\nAs it turns out, that was not true. In fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. When the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. In November 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. As you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.\n\nA month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. It was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.\n\n2.) It wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about Obamacare. He also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.\n\nUnfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in Congress and the media were as disciplined. A number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. Some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. The president tried to fool the American people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. He almost got away with it.\n\n3.) Before he became president, Obama told Pastor Rick Warren, I believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJhQBZ1La0w\n\nHard to be more clear than that. Obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. And then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. Finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. But had he really? According to chief strategist David Axelrod, Obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:\n\nAxelrod writes that he knew Obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as Obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. Axelrod also admits to counseling Obama to conceal that position for political reasons. Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' Axelrod writes.\n\nObama reportedly told Axelrod, after he stated his opposition to gay marriage at an event, I'm just not very good at bullshitting. Based on his utterly unconvincing statement regarding the 2nd Amendment this morning, the president still isn't very good at it.
A gay guidance counselor suspended from a Catholic high school is pushing to change the policy of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis that bans employees who are in same-sex marriages – even though she signed a contract stating she understood the expectations of employees of the Catholic archdiocese.\n\nShelly Fitzgerald said she was suspended from her job as a guidance counselor at Roncalli High School, a Catholic school that is overseen by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, Indiana, after it was discovered she had married another woman.\n\nA report at ABC affiliate rtv6 stated Fitzgerald posted to her Facebook account:\n\nSomeone sought out my marriage certificate from Hancock County and turned it into Joe Hollowell (the school's chief administrator). He then turned it over to the Archbishop of Indianapolis, the superintendent and Chuck Weisenbach [Roncalli school principal].\n\nThe report continues that Fitzgerald, who had been employed at the school for 15 years, says she met with the school's administrator and principal and was given the options of resigning, dissolving her marriage, or wait it out and stay quiet and maybe I can make it the rest of the year, but they will not renew my contract next year.\n\nI love my wife very much, Fitzgerald said. I didn't have any intention to resign a job that I adore. For me to walk out was like saying I didn't want to be there anymore and that wasn't the case.\n\nIndiana state Rep. Dan Forestal, a Democrat, said he will intervene in the case by trying to block schools whose religious beliefs oppose same-sex marriage from receiving taxpayer voucher funds.\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nRoncalli is a private school but they also receive state funding through Indiana's School Choice Voucher program. An annual report from the Indiana Department of Education shows that the school received more than $1.5 million in taxpayer dollars last year.\n\nRoncalli should not be rewarded with state dollars if they choose to discriminate against employees simply based on who they love, Forestal said.\n\nAs Fox59 reported, Fitzgerald has hired an attorney, David Page, who refused to give details about his client's signed contract due to the possibility of future litigation.\n\nIn a statement, the Catholic school has said as role models for students, the personal conduct of every teacher, guidance counselor, administrator and staff member, both at school and away from school, must convey and be supportive of the teachings of the Catholic Church, the report continued.\n\nPage said his client was barred from the campus and her school email account.\n\n[S]he was heartbroken and stunned, Page said. Stunned is the word she uses most often.\n\nThe attorney added that everyone at the school knew she was gay.\n\nFitzgerald has received an outpouring of support via an online petition signed by over 15,000 supporters.\n\nThe petition states:\n\nAfter a nosey member of the community found out Shelly Fitzgerald was married and informed her employer, she was called into the office. Not because they wanted to congratulate her on her previously unknown marriage, but because they wanted to fire her. For 15 years, Shelly has worked as a guidance counselor at Roncalli High School (RHS), a Catholic High School in Indiana. And when the school found out she was married to a woman they were not pleased. They gave her a choice: she could either dissolve her marriage or resign from her job. Shelly isn't taking this lying down, she says she has no intention of leaving the woman she loves who she has been with for more than two decades. And she plans to hire a lawyer. But should she have to? The school says they have every right to force Shelly to choose since all employees know that they are expected to support the teachings of the Catholic Church both in and out of school. That includes the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.\n\nOne Roncalli board member, Daniel Parker, resigned from his post in support of Fitzgerald because she has been his child's guidance counselor.\n\nClearly, we are doing something right when our young students and graduates understand better than some older adults that love is love, commitment is commitment, and marriage is marriage no matter who opens their heart to those wonderful gifts from God, Parker said.\n\nRoncalli High School is named for Cardinal Angelo Roncalli, who became Pope John XXIII and, since his canonization, is now referred to as Saint John XXIII.
A Muslim from Sunderland who started a polygamy matchmaking website for men seeking multiple Sharia marriages says that monogamy is not in tune with man's nature and believes he has already been responsible for 100 'weddings'.\n\nAzad Chaiwala, 33, who launched Secondwife.com in 2014 followed by Polygamy.com this year, claims that both sites have 70,000 members looking for polygamous marriages.\n\nUnapologetic about his own desire for multiple wives, he told his own wife early on in their marriage, which was arranged by his family, that she would not be the only one.\n\nHowever, in seeking a second wife Mr. Chaiwala admitted that none of his family wanted to help saying there was a taboo about the subject, reports The Times.\n\nNoting that there were dating sites catering to every niche, desire, and fetish, he said: I think polygamy is more in tune with [man's] nature than monogamy.\n\nChaiwala's Sharia marriage websites were directly cited in the review on social integration by cohesion advisor Dame Louise Casey on how foreign cultural practices contrary to British values are being tolerated. The report largely blames the tolerance of regressive cultures for segregation and said that pressure should be put on migrants to integrate.\n\nThe practice of unregistered polygamy appears to be more commonplace than might be expected, Dame Louise said. The existence of matchmaking sites like secondwife.com and the prevalence of unregistered marriage is particularly concerning.\n\nHer report said that there were approximately 100,000 Sharia marriages, many of which are not recognised by UK law and therefore do not offer the same legal protections to women in cases of divorce. A sizeable proportion of these 'marriages' are thought to be polygynous (specifically where a man has multiple wives).\n\nBaroness Cox, a cross-bench member of the House of Lords, said in October that polygamy is commonplace within Muslim communities in Britain, with husbands fathering as many as 20 children by four wives.\n\nShe explained: Under sharia law, a husband is entitled to up to four wives providing he takes responsibility for making appropriate provision for all. In many Muslim communities in this country, polygamy is commonplace although as a nation bigamy is legally forbidden.\n\nWitnesses to the Commons Home Affairs Committee, as part of the broader inquiry into Sharia councils, have warned that the number of polygynous marriages is on the rise.\n\nThey point out that whilst polygamy is illegal, there is no requirement for a civil, legal, ceremony to precede a Sharia marriage. This means that imams are under no obligation to refuse to perform a marriage because the man is already married.\n\nAina Khan, a leading family lawyer specialising in Islamic marriages, said that the Marriage Act was out of date.\n\nIt dates back to 1949 and only Anglicans, Jews and Quakers must register their religious ceremony with the register office . . . Now nearly three million Muslims, with origins from many countries, live here.\n\nNoting that having more than one wife was an outward sign of religiosity, Ms. Khan said that of the couples who came to her seeking to separate, a quarter involved polygynous issues.\n\nIt is not a recipe for a happy marriage. They do not last, she said.\n\nIn 2015 Amra Bone, who was the UK's first female Sharia council judge, said that the government cannot…ask Muslims not to have more than one wife. People have a right to decide for themselves.
A coalition of anti-racist, gay rights and student groups are preparing to sue Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for allegedly hosting hate speech but continuing to censor pornographic content.\n\nFrance's largest anti-racism group, SOS Racism, the Jewish Students' Union (UEJF), and a group called SOS Homophobie have released the results of a social media survey carried out between the 31st of March and the 10th of May.\n\nIt claimed to find 586 examples of content that is racist, anti-semitic or homophobic, denies the Holocaust or seeks to justify terrorism or crimes against humanity. They insist this is in breach of the law in France, which has sweeping protections against hate speech.\n\nAccording to Humanité, the report went on to say that of the 586 reported cases of alleged hate material, only four per cent were removed from Twitter, seven per cent from YouTube, and 34 per cent from Facebook.\n\nThe term hate speech is notably broad and open to wide interpretation. It has been appropriated to cover anything from mild criticism of Islam, gay marriage and mass migration, to neo-Nazi and Islamist propaganda.\n\nIf the French groups win their case, it could result in even more conservative material disappearing from the accused social media platforms.\n\nSacha Reingewirtz, President of UEJF, slammed the tech firms for not removing perceived offensive content or revealing how they choose stories to occupy their trending news section.\n\nGiven the profits Youtube, Twitter and Facebook make in France, and the few taxes they pay, their refusal to invest in the fight against hatred is unacceptable, she said.\n\nShe added: The mystery surrounding the functioning of the moderation teams of social networks prevents any serious progress in reducing racist and anti-Semitic messages. Since the major platforms do not respect French law, not even their own conditions, they will have to face justice.\n\nDominique Sopo, president of SOS Racisme, argued that female breasts should be splashed across social media, saying:\n\nTwitter, YouTube and Facebook cannot continue to use soothing words to cover their inaction on moderation.\n\nThese platforms seem more shocked by toplessness, which is promptly censored, than the incitement to hatred against persons or groups of persons. Our lawsuit against them is to enforce a right that they must now fully comply with.\n\nGilles Dehais President of SOS Homophobia, said: Despite an effort to address hate speech when it is reported, this testing campaign shows the lack of responsiveness to flagged content via the current route.\n\nWe regret that the majority of Internet players still do not implement sufficient means to protect their users from homophobic, biphobic and transphobic sentiments, and enforce French law.
Thirty-year-old millennials' fortunes, sex lives, and income are all pitiful compared to what their fathers enjoyed at age 30, according to Axios.\n\nMillennial men pay 2.5 times as much for college, have triple the debt, have half the chance of being married, fewer kids, and are much less likely to own a home, according to the data presented by Axios.\n\nOver the last 4 decades, young Americans have paid more for education even as their incomes have stayed flat. The result? WAY more debt, and fewer adult rites of passage like marriage and homeownership. Explore the numbers: https://t.co/AfhXddTbim via @axiosvisuals @axios pic.twitter.com/EcF3fq60qv — Harry Stevens (@Harry_Stevens) July 23, 2018\n\nAxios reported that compared to 30 years ago:\n\nMen are more likely to earn less. In 1975, only a quarter of 25 to 34-year-old men made less than $30K per year, but that number rose to 41% in 2016. Going deeper: As a measure of upward mobility, 92% of 30-year-olds in 1970 earned more than their parents at that age, according to a 2016 study led by Raj Chetty, a Stanford economist (h/t Roger Lowenstein). But of those who were 30 in 2014, just half earned more. [Economist Raj] Chetty attributed most of this erosion to slower GDP growth and a change in the distribution of GDP favoring higher earners: GDP would have to rise by 6% a year to get the same impact, he said, and wealth would have to be distributed much more evenly.\n\nMillennial women are individually better off than their mothers — but the women's husbands are the millennial men.\n\nMissing from Axios, however, is any mention of the causes, such as the federal government's immigration policy of importing one new worker for every four Americans who graduate school or college each year.\n\nThis massive 25 percent inflation of the labor supply is widely ignored by economists who struggle to understand why young men earn so much less than their parents. The new-labor inflation is made worse by the government's policy of importing temporary workers for good jobs in the expanding professional sectors. Roughly 1.5 million foreign guest-workers now hold jobs in healthcare, technology, academia and other sectors, even as young American college graduates struggle to pay off debts.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Hire American campaign would modestly curb the inflow of immigrants and foreign workers, but it is strongly opposed by progressives, Democrats and business-first Republicans.\n\nFour million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market — but the government provides green cards to roughly 1 million legal immigrants and temporary work-permits to roughly 3 million foreign workers.\n\nThe Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with foreign labor. That process spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. The policy also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.
A new study shows there's much more depression, obesity and suicidal tendencies among adults raised by same-sex couples than among adults raised by a normal family of complementary male and female parents.\n\nAccording to the study, which tracks the development of children to adulthood, 51 percent of those raised by same-sex couples had experienced depression, compared to only 19.7 percent of those raised in normal married households.\n\nBy age 28 a cohort of children raised by same-sex parents are 2.25 times more likely to experience depression than is the general population. Adult onset depression is associated with a more frequent history of abuse victimization, obesity, stigma, and distance from one or both parents.\n\nThirty percent of adults from gay households fanaticized about suicide as an adult, compared to 7 percent from normal households. A whopping 71.9 percent of adults raised in gay homes reported obesity, compared to 37 percent from opposite-sex homes.\n\nThe study shows more kids raised by gays reported that a parent or caregiver had slapped, hit, or kicked them. More of them said they were touched in a sexual way or forced to touch someone in a sexual way or were forced into sex relations.\n\nThe study flies in the face of recent claims by gay advocates that there is no difference between being raised by gays or by straights.\n\nThe study used data from the non-partisan National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and was produced by Professor Paul Sullins of the Leo Initiative. He's worked with the Department of Sociology at the Catholic University of America for many years.\n\nThe major limitation of of the study is that the database contained information on kids raised by only twenty same-sex couples. But there are very few children raised by gays at all, let alone over a long period. Even so, as sociologist Mark Regnerus says of this study, This makes the same-sex household estimates displayed in the graph imprecise, but it does nothing to undermine the significance of the differences between groups.\n\nThe study has already come under attack from gay blogs that tend to pounce on any negative data.\n\nAt the urging of gay bloggers, in 2012, Regnerus of the University of Texas at Austin was investigated by his university and attempts were made to bring him up on charges and get him fired for reaching much the same conclusions as Sullins has reached. Though the University of Texas backed him up and the journal that published his paper has not withdrawn it, he still comes under bitter criticism from gay advocates.\n\nThinkProgress has tried to smear Sullins for his religious faith and his priesthood. The author, Zack Ford, a columnist and not an expert in sociological research, called the study hugely flawed and ran a picture of Sullins in his priestly garb. He also complained that the study was carried out on children raised by gays prior to the legalization of gay marriage, proposing that marriage will make all the difference in outcomes for kids.\n\nEven liberal advocates admit that children do best when raised by their own mom and dad. Secular sociologist Sara McLanahan of Princeton University and other secular experts have reported for decades that children do best within normal families.
Conservative David Benham was arrested outside of a clinic in North Carolina over the weekend for allegedly violating the state and federal coronavirus rules. Prior to the outbreak, it was legal for pro-life advocates to gather at a certain distance outside of abortion clinics to offer women alternatives to ending the life of their unborn child.\n\nDavid and his twin brother, Jason, gained fame as successful businessmen who were offered a show on the Home and Garden TV channel but were abruptly fired after their Christian worldview was revealed, including their support for traditional marriage between a man and a woman and respecting life from conception to natural death.\n\nDavid Benham posted a video of his interaction with police on the brothers' Facebook page.\n\nThat abortion clinic exceeds the number of ten, David Benham said, referring to the federal government guidance that no groups larger than ten people should gather in one place.\n\nDavid Benham told the police arresting him that he and the others outside of the clinic were there with a group that helps at-risk mothers and babies.\n\nWe are within our rights to be here, David Benham said. We are practicing social distancing. We have cleaned our hands, and we are offering help to these mothers.\n\nAnd if you are saying we don't have the right to be here then go in the abortion clinic and make the arrests there, Benham said to an officer, who said he did not have the authority to go inside the clinic.\n\nI appreciate your serving, David Benham said. I appreciate everything that you do for us, but this is wrong and you know it.\n\nThe Christian Post reported on David Benham speaking with the Daily Wire about his arrest:\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Wire, Benham said, This is selective enforcement of the law. You are coming after us because we're standing in front of an abortion clinic … I am not going to let the government have unlimited power and use this crisis to their advantage. Benham says his federally recognized public charity, Cities For Life, is considered an essential service. However, police officers claimed that more than 10 people had gathered, an accusation that Benham denied.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) offered his friend support on social media, calling the arrest unconstitutional.\n\nMy friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic, Cruz tweeted. If NC deems abortion 'essential,' then pregnancy care services are as well. This is WRONG; Governor Cooper should be ashamed.\n\nWATCH: My friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic.

As President Trump requests full funding for a border wall along the United States-Mexico border, elected Democrats continue to claim that walls are immoral and racist.\n\nFrom the walls surrounding Vatican City to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) iron fence, below, Breitbart News breaks down 20 walls, fences, and barriers from around the world.\n\n1. The Walls of Vatican City and St. Peter's Square\n\nThough Pope Francis has routinely blasted the enforcement of international borders, Vatican City and St. Peter's Square are completely walled off from Italy.\n\n2. Hillary Clinton's Home Privacy Fence in Chappaqua\n\nFailed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lives peacefully in her upstate Chappaqua, New York home, which is walled off from the general public by a giant white privacy wall. Passersby can barely get a glimpse of Clinton's home, as she the wall stretches across the front, and trees act as a natural barrier for security.\n\n3. Israel's Border Fence\n\nIsrael has had one of the most effective border fences and walls in the world, decreasing illegal immigration to the country by 100 percent after it was constructed and built.\n\n4. Hollywood's Walled Off Awards Shows\n\nWhen Hollywood's elite have their annual awards shows, such asthe Academy Awards (Oscars), they have automatic guaranteed security at their ceremonies. Pictured below, the Oscars keep pedestrians and bystanders out of the general area by erecting tall chain link fences around the grounds of the red carpet. The fencing around the borders keeps celebrities safe.\n\n5. North Carolina's Supermax Prison Fence\n\nButner, North Carolina, is home to one of the country's multiple Federal Correctional complexes. As seen in photos, this maximum security prison has various layers of fencing, all covered with barbed wire from top to bottom.\n\n6. Obama's Backyard Brick Barrier\n\nWhen former President Obama moved out of the White House, he moved into this Kalorama Heights neighborhood home in Washington, D.C. The home has a side gate and fence, as well as a full brick and concrete barrier in the backyard.\n\n7. The 2016 Democratic National Convention's Security Walls\n\nThough failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke out against border walls for the U.S., her 2016 Democratic National Convention made sure to keep protesters and Bernie Sanders supporters out of the general area by erecting steel and iron fences. Sanders supporters can be seen standing plastered outside the barriers where police and guards stood opposite, ensuring no person made it past the fence.\n\n8. Barbed Wire Fence at Guantanamo Bay\n\nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, holds some of the most brutal suspected and convicted terrorists in the world. The facility is surrounded, as shown in photos, by not only 24-hour security guards, but also a number of barbed wire fences.\n\n9. The Gates of Chateau de Versailles\n\nThe Castle of Versaille near Paris, France is one of the most recognizable barriers in the Western world. This beautifully gold fence and gate keep the castle safe and secure. Barriers don't have to be eyesores. Versaille proves that.\n\n10. Hungary's Migrant Crisis Fix\n\nPerhaps no other European nation has a border as secure as Hungary. The populist-nationalist Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, decided to fully guard his country's borders with this fence as a response to the continent's migrant crisis.\n\n11. Bill Gates' Gates\n\nTech billionaire Bill Gates professes a globalist worldview, but his own home off of Lake Washington has not only giant gates guarding it from outsiders, but also is meticulously surrounded by natural barriers like trees, hedges, and water.\n\n12. Largest Nuclear Power Plant's Secure Fence\n\nThe country's largest nuclear power plant, Palo Verde Nuclear, in Phoenix, Arizona, is safely secured with multi-layered fencing and barbed wire, even as it sits far into the desert.\n\n13. Elizabeth Warren's Iron Fence\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has repeatedly said she opposes border walls and barriers for the U.S., but her home and yard in Cambridge, Massachusettes,is lined with an iron fence. The fence serves as security to safeguard her home from those walking on the sidewalk.\n\n14. 2020 Olympics Construction Barriers\n\nAs Tokyo, Japan prepares for the 2020 Summer Olympic games, crews have built barriers around construction sites to protect the facilities. These barriers have been captured in photos, where guards can be seen opening and closing the barrier to allow more crew members into the secure location.\n\n15. Royal Gates of Buckingham Palace\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is securely protected by royal guards and a beautiful fence outside her working residence at Buckingham Palace, London, England. Tourists on the street must view the palace from behind the fence, which is adorned with detailed sculpted columns and the Royal Family's crest.\n\n16. Bill de Blasio's Brick Wall\n\nFor a self-professed liberal, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) sure enjoys the protection that comes with having a brick wall around his home, Gracie Mansion, on the Upper East Side. These photos show how de Blasio's house is completely secured by a brick wall and iron gates.\n\n17. Oklahoma's Prison Fence\n\nEl Reno, Oklahoma, is home to one of the country's many Federal Correctional institutions. This facility, which former President Obama visited in 2015, is surrounded by a chain link fence and barbed wire. The entrance of the facility is secured with a steel-slatted gate as prison guards patrol the grounds.\n\n18. Paul Ryan's Personal Sovereignty\n\nDespite former House Speaker Paul Ryan's admiration for open borders, when it comes to his own living quarters, he prefers personal security and sovereignty. Ryan's Wisconsin home is surrounded by a fence and brick columns, coupled with a natural barrier.\n\n(Breitbart News)\n\n19. Bulgaria's Border Fence\n\nSimilar to Hungary, Bulgaria has erected a border fence on the Bulgarian-Turkish border to prevent illegal immigration. Both barriers are lined along the top with barbed wire and guarded by border patrol.\n\n20. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's Mansion\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) has spoken out against border walls for the U.S., but when it comes to his personal security, he prefers iron gates and fences. At this governor's mansion in Albany, New York, Cuomo enjoys security and protection thanks to a chain link fence and sculptured iron gates.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Wednesday on Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson opened the program by reacting to Sen-elect Mitt Romney's (R-UT) public critique of President Donald Trump.\n\nCarlson reminded viewers of Romney's path to prosperity at Bain Capital and how his exploitation of the finance-based economy had implications on real Americans. Carlson said it was indicative of the broader problem of how the ruling class is harming the country overall, which led to the election of Trump.\n\nTranscript as follows:\n\nGood evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Happy New Year. Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post savaging Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response this morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see. But for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\n\nRomney's main complaint is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true of course. Beneath the personal slights, though, Romney has a policy critique. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\n\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those too. His piece throws throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago. This isn't surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this. Meanwhile, a remarkable number of those companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\n\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. He's right. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support these goals. There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\n\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions. But they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live?\n\nThese are the only questions that matter. The answer used to be obvious: the overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. Yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\n\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would if they cared. But our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\n\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell is that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this. Members of our educated upper-middle-classes, now the backbone of the Democratic Party, usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\n\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, but reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\n\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\n\nThere was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.\n\nTwo different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\n\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\n\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\n\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids. Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It's not. It's bondage. Republicans should say so.\n\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest. We're ok with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\n\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere. That's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about you.\n\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other. That happens in countries too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. Nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\n\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old. A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\n\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point. But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families isn't worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\n\nInternalizing this won't be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism. That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and soon, unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\n\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first.
On Tuesday, Manny Pacquiao, Fighter of the Decade for the 2000s according to the Boxing Writers Association of America and Ring Magazine, apologized for remarks in which he called homosexuality something that even animals don't try.\n\nPacquiao refused to retract his opposition to gay marriage.\n\nPacquiao had responded to an inquiry from the TV5 network in which they asked celebrities about same-sex marriage, which he opposes. He asserted, It's just common sense. Have you seen any animal having male-to-male or female-to-female relations? Adding that even animals understand gender differences, he opined, if you have male-to-male or female-to-female [relationships], then people are worse than animals.\n\nPacquiao's comments sparked outrage, as TV host Jose Marie Viceral, tweeted that lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people are humans, not animals. Danton Remoto, chairman of the LGBT group Ladlad, pointing out Pacquiao's position in the Philippines House of Representatives and his current campaign for a Senate seat, echoed, He is running for a national position and he should be a senator of everybody, not just over-the-hill boxers and straight people. He said that Pacquiao and his advisers should adhere to current political correctness, sniping, Otherwise, they would be left behind in the Dark Ages, when the cavemen ruled and the numbskulls roamed the earth,.\n\nLesbian singer Aiza Seguerra ripped Pacquiao on Instagram: You might've done our country proud but with your statement, you just showed the whole country why we shouldn't vote for you. And yes, I think you are an ignorant, bigoted hypocrite.\n\nPacquiao backed down on a Facebook video, stating: I'm sorry for hurting people by comparing homosexuals to animals. Please forgive me for those I've hurt. But in an Instagram post, he simply stated:\n\nI rather obey the Lord's command than obeying the desires of the flesh. Im not condemning anyone, but I'm just telling the truth of what the Bible says. The truth from the Bible is what changed me from my old ways. 1 Corinthians 6:9 [9] Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men. God Bless everyone i love you all.\n\nIn 2012, the Los Angeles shopping center The Grove banned Pacquiao from its grounds after an interview in The National Examiner wrongly attributed remarks to Pacquiao. The 57-6-2 fighter later told The Los Angeles Times, What I said is a reporter asked me about gay marriage … I am against gay marriage, but I'm not condemning gays. I have family — a cousin — who's gay, and friends too. I'm just against gay marriage. I don't even want to talk about the issue, but I was asked about it, so I gave my opinion.\n\nPacquiao plans to retire from boxing after his rubber match with Timothy Bradley on April 9.
With the Russia Collusion Hoax debunked forever, the corrupt establishment media are now in a mad scramble to manufacture a different kind of anxiety against President Trump, this time using multiple artificial hysterias.\n\nHonestly, any rational person who lives in the real world — and I like to count myself among that group — must be baffled by the news media's ongoing meltdown; the screech of one crisis after another, which reflects nothing close to reality.\n\nFor example: Yesterday, I paid 98 cents for a dozen eggs. My 401(k) is kicking butt. No one I know is struggling to find work, which was definitely not the case a few years ago. American servicemen are not coming home in body bags. There are no race riots, which also wasn't the case a few years ago. There seems to be fewer domestic terror attacks. For the last two years global temperatures have dropped and this year, so far, has certainly been a cool one.\n\nUnemployment has reached record lows. Wages are rising. Manufacturing jobs are coming back. Inflation is almost non-existent…\n\nThis, my friends, is what peace and prosperity look and feel like. This is it. Take it from a middle-aged guy who lived through Watergate, Vietnam, the Carter years, 9/11, Iraq, and Barry Obama's managed decline — this is as good as America gets.\n\nBut with a Republican in office, most especially a Republican named Donald Trump, the media are desperate to distract us from this inconvenient good news, and so they are manufacturing a fabricated reality where Mississippi is still burning, white supremacism is on the march, the Chinese are about to Red Dawn our economy, everyone's going to be shot at school, democracy itself teeters on the brink, and women are about to be forced back into the kitchen.\n\nHere's a quick round up of the latest nonsense our corrupt media are hoaxing the country with.\n\nTrump's Tariff War with China Is Going to Kill the Economy\n\nThis, to me, is the dumbest crisis of them all. To begin with, none of the tariffs Trump has so far raised have had any effect on consumer prices or economic growth. In fact, in almost every area, our economy is doing much better than our lousy experts predicted last year.\n\nHow many times can the media turn a single day stock market drop into a financial crisis before we all roll our eyes and turn the channel?\n\nI find this hysteria tedious.\n\nGlobal Warming Will Kill You\n\nI guess it's a good thing Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy is backing off her claim we will all die in 12 years, but she's still assuring us Global Warming is a real threat that will kill us, but you'll have to pardon me if I don't take my climate advice from a 29-year-old who freaks out over her first look at a garbage disposal.\n\nIt's May 15, I live in the South, and when I woke up this morning it was 36 degrees. There was even a little frost on the ground.\n\nThe planet appears to be doing just fine, much better than the eternally neurotic Ocasio-Crazy.\n\nSchool Shooting Epidemic\n\nTo gin up this lie, media outlets, most especially CNN, are spreading provably false statistics — lies easily debunked by anyone who can Google.\n\nThe truth is that when it comes to these terrible shootings, our schools are much safer than they were 20 years ago.\n\nTrump's 'Constitutional Crisis'\n\nIn a woefully transparent act of collusion between Democrats and the establishment media, the media repeated the phrase constitutional crisis 386 times between May 8 and 12.\n\nA perfect example courtesy of NewsBusters: On Friday, CNN's Erin Burnett asked indignantly: If this is a constitutional crisis, how can Democrats not move forward with impeachment hearings?\n\nMuch of this hysteria is based on the Trump administration fighting congress over document requests and all those subpoenas being issued so that sore loser Democrats can come up with a Russia Collusion Hoax do-over — you know, because Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his gang of partisan Democrats spending three years and $35 million to locate a dry collusion/obstruction hole means nothing.\n\nThe executive branch has been fighting the legislative branch over this stuff since the creation of our government and nothing is a constitutional crisis until the executive branch defies a Supreme Court order, or the equivalent of one, to cooperate with congress. .\n\nSorry, that's just a fact.\n\nWe cannot be in a constitutional crisis when the executive branch is 1) complying with court orders and 2) using constitutional means to tell congress to shove it.\n\nActually, this is the opposite of a constitutional crisis; this is the constitution at its best: the war is political and legal as opposed to physical.\n\nGod bless America.\n\nWhite Supremacism Epidemic\n\nHand-picked experts are telling the conspiracy theorists at CNN that white supremacism is on the rise and a contagion and must be labeled as terrorism so it can be treated like ISIS.\n\nYeah, there's a good idea: treat our own citizens like foreign terrorists.\n\nFirst off, the so-called boost in hate crimes is a hoax based solely on the fact that more agencies have been added to those reporting hate crimes.\n\nSecondly, if white supremacism was a real problem in America, CNN and the rest of the media would not be forced to manufacture one hate crime after another: Remember Hands Up, Don't Shoot; George Zimmerman the White Hispanic; the KKKids from KKKovington High School; Jussie Smollett? All hoaxes.\n\nIn fact, most hate crimes end up being debunked as hoaxes.\n\nRiddle me this: How much white supremacism can there be in America when the long-dead Kate Smith has to be disinterred for a Two Minute Hate? Good grief, there is so little racism in America, we are forced to dig up corpses just so we can have something to virtual signal at. And even then, the racism charge is still a hoax. Kate Smith was no racist.\n\nI've lived in the south for nearly 20 years and my interracial marriage has never brought my wife and I so much as a double take.\n\nThe Return of Back Alley Abortions\n\nThank God states like Alabama are aggressively looking to put an end to the holocaust of abortion. Regardless, the worst case scenario for the pro-infanticide crowd is that the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, and as unlikely as that is to happen, it would still not outlaw the killing of the unborn for convenience purposes.\n\nOverturning Roe v. Wade means the states get to decide on the legality of abortion, which means it will always be legal somewhere. With all the government money they receive, I'm sure Planned Parenthood will be able to offer a free bus pass with every child murder.\n\nTo be fair, though, Alyssa Milano's sex strike, her refusal to have sex with anyone until she gets her way on abortion would have been a legitimate crisis … in 1998.\n\nFox News Is the Devil\n\nIn an ocean of leftist news outlets Fox News is a lonely buoy that offers some right-of-center opinion. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) (aka Indian Princess Lies-Like-a-Rug) is only the latest example of the hate poured all over Fox, but according to CNN and other media outlets, Fox is a disease helping to spread all six of the phony crises listed above.\n\nThis is how intolerant the left and media are — they don't even want one buoy in their ocean of lies.\n\n—\n\nSeriously, y'all, it's all a hoax, it's all fake news, and summer is on the horizon. So unless you live in a city like Baltimore, Chicago, or San Francisco — a city exclusively run by Democrats for the last 50 or so years that is now filled with poverty, the homeless, and poop; take a vacation from the media, take a breath, take a step outside, and take a long look around… Life is good in Trump's America, about as good as it gets… And all of this hysterical BS, this crises propaganda, these lies, are all being manufactured to take our eye off that fact.\n\nThe media cannot defeat Trump in 2020 based on the mostly positive results of his policies; they cannot argue against the first era of peace and prosperity we've enjoyed in almost two decades, so they're trying to stress us out with these absurd hoaxes even though the planet is cooling, eggs are 98 cents a dozen, and our guys are not dying in futile overseas wars.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

An offshoot of the Chinese Communist Youth League published a video featuring Chinese celebrities promoting the nation's totalitarian social credit system to young people, urging them to give thumbs up to integrity, Australia's ABC News reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe music video, titled, Live Up to Your Word, features a variety of Chinese actors and musicians who cater to young audiences, including 24-year-old actor Xu Weizhou, popular boy band member Wang Yuan, and romantic comedy star Wei Daxun.\n\nBeginning with a heavy guitar riff reminiscent of early 2000s American punk-pop, the video features its stars in various public settings encouraging the listener to participate in communist society as the Party decrees, whether at school, in the workplace, or playing sports. The stars lead business meetings, study in libraries, and grocery shop, the implicit message of the video being that only by obeying the Party can a young person have access to the necessary resources to participate in society.\n\nAccording to ABC News' translation, the lyrics urge the viewer to be a trustworthy youth.\n\nLet's give the thumbs up to integrity, and unite in building Credit China together, the video suggests. Live every day carefully.\n\nAlthough the lyrics don't specifically mention the Social Credit System (SCS), actors and singers are seen demonstrating how to be a trustworthy citizen in a range of scenarios such as shopping at an unmanned store, renting a shared bike, reading at a public library, and finalising a business deal, the ABC report notes.\n\nThe video is reportedly a production of China Youth Credit Action, a campaign to promote the social credit system supervised by the Communist Youth League. The Youth League is responsible for recruiting young communists, ensuring that young people do not deviate away from communist values, and controlling nearly every aspect of the lives of its members. The group has worked to promote banning participation in Western festivities such as Christmas, and launched a dating service in 2017 to promote marriage and reproduction among communists (and, presumably, to keep communists from falling in love with unauthorized persons who may hold alternative points of view).\n\nThe social credit system is an all-encompassing control method in which the government assigned a numerical value to the credit of a person to society. The number is based on both loyalty to the Party and general courtesy in public – both political dissidence and general misbehavior, such as littering or jaywalking, could hurt a person's score. The consequences of a low score make it harder for a person to participate in society by limiting access to flights, trains, and public transportation or depriving people of access to government services.\n\nThe system will not fully go into place until 2020, so the government has begun publishing promotional material for it now. It is currently partially operational, however, and blocked Chinese citizens from buying 23 million airplane and train tickets as of March 2019.\n\nOn Thursday, the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper reported that the Communist Party is considering adding unpaid parking tickets to the metric that determines a person's credit score. The article discusses traditional financial credit scores but states that the People's Bank of China (PBC) is working to integrate its credit system into a government-controlled personal credit score. It quotes a Chinese professor promoting the use of all human behavior to determine a financial credit score.\n\nDong Dengxin, director of the Financial Securities Institute at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Wednesday that it is important to establish a comprehensive credit system, rather than a one-sided database that only focuses on financial activities, in order to regulate social behavior, the newspaper reports, noting that Dong believes this system is not possible without having strict privacy protection in place so that only the repressive Communist Party has access to the information.\n\nThe Global Times also ran a column Wednesday by a senior PBC official urging the establishment of a credit score for local governments, so that the national Communist Party can keep them under tight control.\n\nGovernment credibility is an important part of establishing a social credit system, which should supervise government activities and debt risks, the article argued.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.
Produced by Chris O'Connell and Lauren Clark\n\n[This story previously aired on March 9. It was updated on August 10.]\n\nImagine a loved one brutally murdered in a foreign country -- allegedly by another American.\n\nCorrespondent Peter Van Sant and his team have investigated the disturbing 1988 murder of Carolyn Abel, an American teacher in South Korea, and the loophole in U.S. laws at the time that mean the suspected killer may never face trial.\n\nA MYSTERY BEGINS\n\nFor writer and author Nancy Bercaw, flying to South Korea in the winter of 2018 reopened a painful chapter in her life: one of murder, loss and fear.\n\nNancy Bercaw: Not only were we devastated about the loss of Carolyn … We of course wondered, Who's next?\n\nPeter Van Sant: Back in Seoul. Where should be our first stop?\n\nNancy Bercaw: Well, I think we should go to the school, to ELS, where we all taught.\n\nELS is the English Language School, where Bercaw met fellow teacher Carolyn Abel back in 1988.\n\nNancy Bercaw: This is the school. ... And the world was never the same for any of us who were in that building together on December 20th.\n\nThe events of that day have haunted Carolyn Abel's family for more than 30 years.\n\nWanda Abel: And the damage that's been done … was just so devastating.\n\nWanda Abel remembers her younger sister Carolyn as the center or attention from an early age.\n\nThis is our very first passport photo. Carolyn is on the right, said Wanda Abel, who is pictured with her sisters. CBS News/Wanda Abel\n\nWanda Abel: She was the youngest and the cutest and … the baby of the family.\n\nThe youngest daughter of professors Dr. Francis and Evelyn Abel, Carolyn had a love of photography and a wanderlust that took her around the world.\n\nWanda Abel: My mother said in retrospect it was almost like she knew she didn't have a lot of time ... she wanted to do as much as she could in the time she had, and not waste a second.\n\nBy the time she graduated from college, Carolyn had already lived in Pakistan, East Asia, Germany and France.\n\nWanda Abel: She would get restless. She didn't like being just in one place for too long.\n\nThat restlessness compelled Carolyn to join the Peace Corps after college, serving in Nepal where she taught English. In 1987, Carolyn took another teaching job in Japan, where she met Tomoyuki Ayagaki, a customs agent.\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki [translated]: She's always -- cheerful.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did she make you laugh?\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki: Yes, she's funny.\n\nCarolyn and Ayagaki began a relationship that very quickly became serious.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you fall in love with Carolyn?\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki: Oh, yes.\n\nWanda Abel: Tomoyuki did propose to Carolyn.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what was her answer? Do you know?\n\nWanda Abel: Carolyn … was trying to decide whether she would be happy being married and staying in Japan.\n\nWhile contemplating a future life with Ayagaki, Carolyn received an offer for another job 330 miles away and across the Sea of Japan.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, Carolyn set out on her next adventure in life, teaching English in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nCarolyn Abel Wanda Abel\n\nNancy Bercaw: And from the minute she walked into the staff room, she was just a breath of fresh air. …She sort of looked a little bit like Farrah Fawcett.\n\nThat's where Carolyn quickly fell in with Nancy Bercaw and the other American teachers at school. Like Sandra Ames, who requested that we alter her current appearance for this interview.\n\nSandra Ames: She was making her students laugh, and sing, and -- and have fun learning English.\n\nAnd Tamara Doak.\n\nTamara Doak: She made friends with everybody. She was very, very friendly.\n\nCarolyn also hit it off with the head teacher at the school, Kathy Patrick.\n\nSandra Ames: Carolyn and Kathy Patrick were extremely good friends. …They were considered, if I can use a modern term, besties.\n\nThe women taught, traveled and partied together.\n\nNancy Bercaw: Ex-pat life in Seoul in the late '80s was wild and … one place where our worlds collided and that was Itaewon, the red-light district. … So, what we did is we danced and drank like crazy people.\n\nOn the weekend of Dec. 17, 1988, just three days before the murder, Ames, Patrick, Carolyn and some Korean students took a trip into the mountains. Carolyn took pictures.\n\nSandra Ames: We spent the time looking at temples, and hiking and then partying in the evenings.\n\nClasses were winding down for the winter break. Ayagaki was getting ready to fly to Seoul, hoping to get an answer to his marriage proposal. On Tuesday, Dec. 20, Carolyn never made it to work.\n\nNancy Bercaw: And a lot of us … missed work on occasion for various reasons.\n\nSandra Ames: I was not at that point concerned. But … Kathy was concerned about Carolyn because she couldn't get her on the phone.\n\nKathy Patrick was the head teacher at the English Language School in Seoul when Carolyn Abel arrived to teach there Wanda Abel\n\nNancy Bercaw: Kathy was asking all of us -- had any of us heard from Carolyn. … No.\n\nSandra Ames: Kathy was very upset, convinced that something had happened to Carolyn.\n\nTamara Doak: And -- I said, Well … maybe we should go over there.\n\nSandra Aes: At that point, some of our students drove us to Carolyn's apartment. We went into the apartment, and Kathy … discovered the body … She was murdered brutally and horribly and in a way she did not deserve.\n\nTamara Doak: And we were just all in shock. … just trying to figure out … what happened.\n\nNancy Bercaw: I think we all just felt like, What the hell's gonna happen now? Are we in danger? How will Sandra and Kathy ever recover from the shock of seeing their dead friend? Where do we go from here?\n\nWHAT HAPPENED IN CAROLYN'S APARTMENT?\n\nPETER VAN SANT [outside Carolyn's apartment building]: Carolyn's apartment was on the 15th floor. So here we are. PETER VAN SANT [ knocks on door, speaks to man in Carolyn's old apartment]: I'm Peter Van Sant. And I'm a reporter for CBS News and we are working on a story about a woman named Carolyn who used to live in your apartment. … and we came by to ask you … if we may have permission … to come into your apartment to take some video pictures.\n\nEarly in the afternoon on Dec. 20, 1988, colleagues and students of Carolyn Abel's came to her apartment building after she failed to show up for work.\n\nKathy Patrick, Sandra Ames and three Korean men walked down the outdoor hallway. Surprisingly, the door was unlocked and they went inside.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Who was the first person into the apartment?\n\nSandra Ames: Kathy … She went -- did a B-line right to the bedroom. … Kathy came out of the room and said, Carolyn's dead. We need to call an ambulance. No, we need to call the cops. And she didn't want me to go look at the body.\n\nCarolyn Abel put up a fight in her last minutes of life. She had a number of defensive wounds. And she took the brunt of it. More than 30 stab wounds including a cut -- from ear to ear on the-- on the throat. And there was blood everywhere in here. On the walls, on the bed. It was a mess.\n\nKorean police and press swarmed Carolyn's apartment, which had been ransacked. U.S. Army CID\n\nKorean police and press swarmed the apartment, which had been ransacked. Within hours, the murder led the national news in South Korea.\n\nTamara Doak: And I remember watching the news and the cameras panning around the room. And they kept, you know, going in on this teddy bear … And it was really horrible.\n\nNancy Bercaw: The impact of seeing her body wheeled out in a body bag really made it quite real … it wasn't a dream. It became the nightmare that it really still is to this day.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How did you get the news of what had happened to your sister?\n\nWanda Abel: I was at home. … And my mother called me … she told me that Carolyn had been murdered. And I just -- I screamed … We're just -- crying … trying to figure out, I mean, how could this happen? Who would wanna do this to her? Everybody loved Carolyn. Why?\n\nWith the killer still out there, Carolyn's friends wondered … could they be next?\n\nNancy Bercaw: We were all certain that … perhaps a Korean … had probably killed her. … if a Korean hated an American this much, was he coming after the rest of us?\n\nThe shocked friends turned their attention to Kathy Patrick and Sandra Ames, who had discovered Carolyn's body.\n\nTamara Doak: They seemed horrified. … I was so concerned about them.\n\nNancy Bercaw: They were hysterical. … it seemed as if they were having a nervous breakdown.\n\n\n\nDays later, Patrick led a memorial service for Carolyn.\n\nNancy Bercaw [emotional]: And I think it was quite moving.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Even now thinking about it, you tear up a bit.\n\nPatrick also wrote to Carolyn's parents. Wanda Abel still has that letter.\n\nWanda Abel [reading]: Please know that I loved Carolyn as a sister and a dear friend. … My roommate and are I the two people who found Carolyn in her apartment. Let me know if I can tell you anything.\n\nIn Japan, Tomoyuki Ayagaki learned the love of his life with was gone. But he decided to make his trip to South Korea anyway. He stayed with Patrick and Ames.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Even today after all these years, 30 years, this still gets to you, doesn't it?\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki: Yeah [wipes away a tear]. Sorry.\n\nIn Seoul, rumors were swirling and South Korean police cast a wide net.\n\nNancy Bercaw: We were all suspects. … Every single teacher on the staff was interviewed. … And, you know, the Korean police were in our faces just like, Where were you? How did you know Carolyn? What's your story? Why are you here? Why did you come into our country? Are you secretly FBI? … We just kept thinking, Why are you asking me this? Get out there and find the real killer.\n\nThen, Bercaw took a phone call in the teachers' lounge that moved the investigation in a whole new direction.\n\nNancy Bercaw: It sounded like a Korean woman. … And then very quickly, she said, I know who killed Carolyn. I said, What? … She said, An American military officer.\n\nBercaw told the South Korean police, who brought in detectives from the U.S. Army.\n\nNancy Bercaw: And very quickly thereafter John Boatwright walked in.\n\nJohn Boatwright was a legendary chief of detectives for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division in South Korea. He quickly eliminated the U.S. military officer who was pegged as a suspect by his ex-girlfriend.\n\nJohn Boatwright: He did not know Carolyn Abel. … And it appeared that she was just trying to get revenge on him for the bad breakup.\n\nThree weeks after the murder, an autopsy revealed the cause of death: a stab wound to her right lung. The report also confirmed her throat was cut.\n\nJohn Boatwright: In my opinion, her throat was cut after she was deceased.\n\nPeter Van Sant: After? How unusual is that based on your experience?\n\nJohn Boatwright: Very unusual.\n\nJohn Boatwright was a legendary chief of detectives for the Army's Criminal Investigation Division in South Korea. He quickly eliminated the U.S. military officer who was pegged as a suspect by his ex-girlfriend. John Boatwright\n\nSo, what did happen at Carolyn's apartment?\n\nJohn Boatwright: I was convinced that … whoever did this probably knew Carolyn.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Why?\n\nJohn Boatwright: Because there was no signs of forced entry into the apartment. … It appeared that whoever was in that apartment knew her.\n\nPeter Van Sant: There were two coffee cups found in the room. … If there's a break-in, generally, a criminal would not say, Hey, let's -- let's have a cup of coffee before I ransack your place and attack you.\n\nJohn Boatwright: That certainly would not be normal.\n\nLike his South Korean counterparts, Boatwright decided to question Carolyn's colleagues, who told him:\n\nJohn Boatwright: You really should look at the two girls who found the body.\n\nThose two women? Sandra Ames and Kathy Patrick.\n\nNancy Bercaw: We assumed that a Korean had probably killed her. …But little did we know that the enemy was inside that staff room with us.\n\nA SUSPECT COMES INTO FOCUS\n\nJust weeks after Carolyn Abel's murder, the investigation by John Boatwright was focusing on the two friends who had discovered her body: roommates Kathy Patrick and Sandra Ames.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And do you get a chance to question each of them?\n\nJohn Boatwright: No. Kathy Patrick had already gotten on a plane and left Korea.\n\nNancy Bercaw: We had encouraged her to go. She must have lost 15 pounds … She just looked like someone who was about to break.\n\nKathy Patrick, left, and Sandra Ames\n\nPatrick returned home to Washington state, but Ames was still in Seoul.\n\nJohn Boatwright: I took a statement from her … And then, I ask her, Did you kill Carolyn? And … She just, sort of, sat there and stared at me.\n\nPeter Van Sant: She's just staring at you?\n\nJohn Boatwright: That's correct. … After about 30 seconds, she was very quiet, but she said, No. … That was just -- just not normal.\n\nAmes maintains she had nothing to hide. So, two months after the murder, she waived her right to an attorney and agreed to take a lie detector test.\n\nSandra Ames: I remember … being hooked up to all the wires in a darkened room.\n\nJohn Boatwright: He asked her, Do you know where the murder weapon is? And she said, No. And she really peaked out on that … indicating … she was not being truthful.\n\nSandra Ames: I said, I'm not lying. I'm telling the truth. … So we took it again with the same results. And at that point I said, Let me tell you about this picture in my head. … The picture was a dark shape on a bed covered in a quilt that I knew was a body.\n\nAmes described that picture in her head as a fragmented memory of that night. As Boatwright asked her for more details, she told a new story. It was nothing short of a bombshell.\n\nSandra Ames: The story began with being in bed, and having Kathy at the door of my room, and coming in and saying, I think I killed Carolyn. What with? I asked. And she said, A knife. Where is it? I asked. In the kitchen sink.\n\nAmes said she was in disbelief, and asked Patrick to take her to Carolyn's apartment where she saw her friend's brutalized body on the bed, covered in blood.\n\nSandra Ames: To the best of my recollection, we sat in the living room at Carolyn's apartment, and … she convinced me, manipulated me, to help her make it look like a robbery.\n\nThough she didn't mention it when we spoke with her, Boatwright says that during their interview, Sandra made another statement about her own actions that night after she walked in and saw Carolyn's body.\n\nJohn Boatwright: She says, I touched her arm and it was warm. And at that point, I realized that she may be still alive and that she might testify against … Kathy. And so I went to the kitchen, got a knife, and came back, and I cut her throat to make sure she was dead.\n\nRemember, Boatwright believed that wound was inflicted after Carolyn was already dead from the stab wound to the lung.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So what Sandra is telling you is actually forensically matching up w -- what was done to Carolyn's body?\n\nJohn Boatwright: Absolutely.\n\nBut Sandra Ames' story quickly changed. In official statements, Ames wrote that Kathy Patrick had admitted to cutting Carolyn's throat. And today Ames claims that the only reason she made that admission was due to false memories implanted by investigators. But she doesn't deny going to the crime scene or handling the murder weapon.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You did tell authorities at the time that you cleaned a bloody knife.\n\nSandra Ames: I did. I did, and that was because -- I remembered putting the clean knife into the dish rack … Kathy had said that that was the knife she had used to kill Carolyn.\n\nIt may seem far-fetched, but Ames claims those memories had been suppressed deep in her subconscious mind until the interview with Boatwright.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Are you telling me the truth?\n\nSandra Ames: Yes. Yes.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Because some of these lapses in memory are kind of convenient.\n\nSandra Ames: Oh, they're very convenient. … But no, this is the truth as I lived it.\n\nThough Ames' story was bizarre to say the least, investigators believed the core details, which never changed: that Patrick woke her up and confessed to killing Carolyn, and the two of them staged it to look like a robbery. And the evidence they collected, appeared to back that up.\n\nJohn Boatwright: Each time that she was interviewed later, she kept changing the facts to -- to limit her involvement in the murder. But she never denied that Kathy did the murder. And she never denied that she was present just after the murder.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Who do you believe held the knife and murdered Carolyn Abel?\n\nJohn Boatwright: Kathy Patrick.\n\nAfter her confession, Sandra Ames was kept in house arrest in Seoul. Five months later, in July 1989, she pleaded guilty to harboring a criminal and suppressing evidence.\n\nSandra Ames: I was fingerprinted, photographed and put into a holding cell.\n\nBut why would Patrick want Carolyn dead? Investigators uncovered a secret which provided a potential motive.\n\nTamara Doak: Kathy really fell for Carolyn.\n\nTamara Doak was one of the few teachers who knew Kathy was gay.\n\nTamara Doak: And she would confide in me, you know, I really like this woman. … I think she's into me. And I'm like, Kathy, I don't really think she's gay. You should really be careful.\n\nSandra Ames: Kathy told me that she was in love with Carolyn … and that … her feelings were not necessarily returned.\n\nJohn Boatwright: I believe that -- Kathy and Carolyn were alone -- during that initial attack. … The thing that makes the most sense to me is … Kathy tried to kiss Carolyn and Carolyn pushed her away and rejected that kiss. … I think Kathy was so enraged and angry that she lost control.\n\nKathy Patrick was now the prime suspect in Carolyn Abel's murder. A murder warrant for her arrest was issued in South Korea. Back in Japan, Carolyn's boyfriend, Tomoyuki Ayagaki, heard the news.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You stayed with Kathy at her apartment.\n\nTomoyuki Ayagaki: Apart-- yes. … [via interpreter] It was a huge shock … if that's true, if I stayed in the home of the -- of the murderer, I -- I feel terrible.\n\nKathy Patrick was now the prime suspect in Carolyn Abel's murder. Tamara Doak\n\nFor her part in the alleged crimes, Sandra Ames was sentenced to one year in prison. Meanwhile, Kathy Patrick was back at home in Washington state. The South Korean government made diplomatic requests to return her to Seoul from the U.S. to face a murder charge, but hit a wall.\n\nJohn Boatwright: There was no extradition treaty with Korea at the time.\n\nTamara Doak: Once she left … they couldn't get her back there.\n\nNancy Bercaw: Why couldn't we see through Kathy and Sandra? It's just – unreal. You know, in one fell swoop, you learn that your friends are involved in this crime … And that the one who might have been the killer is free. … because of this loophole in American law.\n\nIn the States, Carolyn's family pushed for an arrest.\n\nWanda Abel: The U.S. attorney in Washington state said, No, you can't arrest her because she hasn't committed a crime in the United States. …there was no jurisdiction to arrest her for murder … And that's what pushed my family to say, Wait a minute. This isn't right.\n\nBut American authorities weren't finished with Kathy Patrick. And soon, they would come face-to-face with her.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you ask Kathy Patrick flat-out, Did you murder Carolyn Abel?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Yes, I did.\n\nA FAMILY'S FIGHT FOR JUSTICE\n\nIn the days after Carolyn's murder, Wanda Abel worked overtime during the holidays to bring her home.\n\nWanda Abel: We got her back in time to hold the funeral on New Year's Eve.\n\nGone but never forgotten. Wanda Abel and her family were pushing the government to pursue a case against Kathy Patrick, who had left South Korea just weeks after Carolyn's murder.\n\nWanda Abel holds one of the last pictures taken of her sister, Carolyn. CBS News/Wanda Abel\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, do you believe this sudden move from South Korea to the United States was in a way-- an expression of consciousness of guilt?\n\nWanda Abel: Yes. … Kathy knew she did it, so she had to suspect that sooner or later somebody was going to put it together or that Sandra was going to crack and tell on her. … So she spends as little time in South Korea as possible after she killed Carolyn.\n\nWith Kathy Patrick back in Washington State, Carolyn Abel's family was fearful they could be targeted.\n\nWanda Abel: I was worried that Kathy would try to kill us, because Kathy wrote these letters to my parents that she was her great friend and that … she'd love to meet them. … and I was working through my mind, What would I do if I saw this person or if she showed up at my house?\n\nDespite the lack of an extradition treaty, there was still that South Korean arrest warrant for murder for Kathy Patrick. They also asked the U.S. government for help.\n\nSteven Schroeder: My name is Steven Schroeder, I'm a retired Assistant United States Attorney and I worked in Seattle.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did the South Koreans want you to do?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Among other things, they wanted me to take a deposition of Kathy Patrick and ask her some questions about the murder that occurred in Seoul.\n\nIt was 1989 when Steven Schroeder was assigned the case with John Boatwright and FBI agents. Along with her lawyer, Kathy Patrick willingly sat down with them to be questioned.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you ask Kathy Patrick flat-out, Did you murder Carolyn Abel?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Yes, I did.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did she say?\n\nSteven Schroeder: She said she did not.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And did you present her with what her roommate had said?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Yes.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what did she say about that?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Simply, it wasn't true.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And did Kathy try to shift blame at all? Did she point the finger of suspicion at all at Sandra?\n\nSteven Schroeder: Not with me.\n\nPatrick also denied, under oath, that she was in love with Carolyn Abel.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you believe Kathy Patrick lied to you?\n\nSteven Schroeder: There was enough indication of that to justify us doing further investigation, yes. … my strategy at that point was if the Koreans did not prosecute her, then to look whether we could for basically false statements, perjury, obstruction of justice.\n\nEven though lie detector tests are inadmissible in federal court, they are a tool used by investigators to confirm deception. Kathy Patrick willingly agreed to take one and answer questions about Carolyn's murder.\n\nSteven Schroeder: The examiner concluded that she was deceptive.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And deception is –\n\nSteven Schroeder: Lying.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Lying.\n\nAfter the polygraph, Kathy Patrick -- whom South Korea still wanted to arrest for murder -- was free to leave and resume her life in Washington State.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is that frustrating?\n\nSteven Schroeder: It was very frustrating.\n\nCompounding Carolyn's family's grief, Sandra Ames was released from a South Korean prison after serving just six months of her one-year sentence -- and it wasn't because of good behavior.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is it true you got out of prison because someone bribed a judge to get you out?\n\nSandra Ames: Yep. Absolutely.\n\nWanda Abel: We just couldn't believe it. I mean, six months for assisting a murderer and covering up the crime scene and making it look like a burglary and not even telling anybody? Not talking? … I don't understand.\n\nWhen Ames returned to the United States, she was recruited by the FBI to go undercover and secretly record a reunion with Kathy Patrick in hopes of eliciting a confession.\n\nSandra Ames: I didn't even call. I simply went to her house.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what did she say to you? … Sandra, what are you doing here?\n\nSandra Ames: Probably [laughs]. … And I think I said something along the lines of, How could you have done that? How could you have killed Carolyn? … And she said, I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nWithout incriminating statements from Patrick, the Feds were not able to press charges for perjury.\n\nPeter Van Sant: As long as she stays within these borders, she's a free woman.\n\nSteven Schroeder: That's -- that's correct, yes.\n\nAnd with no extradition treaty in place, South Korean authorities put the murder case on the shelf.\n\nWanda Abel: I think the South Koreans were taking the attitude that this is a U.S. problem. It's two U.S. citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn's family carried on with their quest for justice.\n\nWanda Abel: My dad … contacting every congressman, every senator … He wrote to news stations – 60 Minutes … 'cause he was hoping that if that happened, then there would be more publicity, more pressure.\n\nWhile Kathy Patrick carried on with her life.\n\nPeter Van Sant If it is true that Kathy Patrick murdered your sister, is she a danger today to the public?\n\nWanda Abel: I think she probably is. … And who knows what would trigger some kind -- that kind of violence again?\n\nPRIME SUSPECT SPEAKS\n\nFor almost three decades, Kathy Patrick has a lived a quiet life in Bellingham, Washington, located north of Seattle, where for the last 18 years, she has worked as a student advisor at Western Washington University.\n\nPatrick turned down 48 Hours' request for an interview, saying Carolyn's murder was too painful to talk about. But on this day, her past was fast approaching.\n\nPeter Van Sant [walking outside]: We're gonna make our move now to Kathy Patrick's office.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Hi, Kathy Patrick?\n\nKathy Patrick: Hi.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Hi. Peter Van Sant, with CBS News. … There are investigators from two countries that … are certain that you murdered Carolyn Abel, what do you have to say?\n\nKathy Patrick: Umm, I have to say that I'm innocent. And that I -- don't know what happened after I found Carolyn's body.\n\nKathy Patrick and 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant CBS News\n\nThese are Kathy Patrick's first public words on the murder of Carolyn Abel in 30 years.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Now your roommate says just the opposite. That you confessed to her, and that the two of you then went back over to Carolyn's apartment and staged the scene as a burglary.\n\nKathy Patrick: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: That never happened?\n\nKathy Patrick: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So she is lying to us when she told us that?\n\nKathy Patrick: I believe she is.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You flunked a polygraph test … how did that happen?\n\nKathy Patrick: I don't know the science of polygraphs, I'm not surprised that I would, um, flunk it in retrospect given how clammy and nervous I am right now and I am even shaking. It was a frightening experience and I absolutely do not know what happened before I went to her apartment and found her body. Please sit.\n\nPeter Van Sant: It has been 30 years since this –\n\nPeter Van Sant: Isn't it time to come clean about this? Investigators are certain that you committed this murder\n\nKathy Patrick: They are wrong.\n\nPeter Van Sant: If you didn't who did?\n\nKathy Patrick: I believe it must have been … Ames.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Sandra Ames? … She says you did it, and you had her go over and help manipulate the room to make it look like a burglary.\n\nKathy Patrick: That's not true.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Another circumstance in all of this is that –\n\nKathy Patrick: Um, can we stop right now?\n\nPeter Van Sant: These are important questions to be asked about this. There were 30 stab wounds on Carolyn's body and friends say that you attacked her after she rejected you –\n\nKathy Patrick [emphatic]: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: -- your romantic advances.\n\nKathy Patrick: No! This has to stop now, please. … You're really sidelining me here, and I am not prepared to answer questions here at my place of work. This happened 30 years ago, I have been available to investigators in Korea and in the U.S.\n\nIn her interviews with South Korean police, a deposition and a polygraph test with American investigators, Kathy Patrick did not point a finger at Sandra Ames. Steven Schroeder had a question about that for Patrick.\n\nSteven Schroeder: Well, why didn't you tell us that 29 years ago?\n\nWhen 48 Hours recently contacted Sandra Ames, she told us she wasn't surprised that Kathy Patrick tried to blame her and denied having participated in Carolyn's murder.\n\nSandra Ames: If it went to trial, I would be willing to testify. I would need to testify.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Where should Kathy Patrick be today, in your opinion?\n\nWanda Abel: She should be in prison. Plain and simple.\n\nThanks to the Abel family's lobbying efforts, in 1994 Congress passed a law that allows for the U.S. prosecution of U.S. nationals who kill other Americans in foreign countries.\n\nSteven Schroeder: And so, today, American families -- if their loved ones are murdered abroad by an American -- will have a very different experience than Carolyn Abel's family did. And I think -- I think we all owe them a debt of gratitude.\n\nBut in Carolyn Abel's case, any trial seems highly unlikely. In South Korea, the statute of limitations for her murder has expired. And the Abel family says investigators told them the physical evidence in the case has been destroyed -- evidence that would've been crucial for a trial in the United States.\n\nWanda Abel: No one should have to go through what my family went through. How … do we live in a world … where a U.S. citizen and go and murder a U.S. citizen, and then come back and live like nothing happened? That's the outrage of this.\n\nIn a case where nothing is simple, the long path to justice may never reach its destination.\n\nWanda Abel: I honestly can't picture her old 'cause she was just always so -- so vibrant and so energetic. And I -- I -- I think she still would be. … you know, I miss her. She was like my best friend.\n\nNancy Bercaw: We've all continued our lives as adventurous people. …But, you know, we kind of … carry the memory of Carolyn … behind us, whatever ground we walk on. It's hard not to remember there's another one of us who could be out there on the same path.\n\nThe law that Carolyn Abel's family helped pass has led to three successful murder prosecutions.
Marc Anthony is one of the music world's biggest stars, but he regrets the time chasing his career took away from being a father, he tells Tracy Smith in an interview for CBS' Sunday Morning.\n\nThe one regret would be that what I chose to do took so much of my time. What I would have done to have been a stay-at-home dad, and, you know, witnessed every second of everything, Anthony told Smith, in an interview to be broadcast on May 1. I would have loved that. Didn't work out that way. So it's the one thing that just tugs at me ... that's the biggest sacrifice. And you sort of start to wonder, was it all worth it? Was it worth it?\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, the Grammy-winner talks about his childhood growing up one of eight kids in New York City's Spanish Harlem. Anthony dreamed of getting out of the neighborhood, but to do so, he says, he had to change who he was.\n\nTo my mom, I was a pain in the ass. To my dad, I was the light of his eyes. And to me, I was awkward, he said. I had glasses. I weighed two pounds. My dad always told me, and as God's honest truth, 'Son, we're ugly. Work on your personality.'\n\nHe says it was the best thing his father ever told him.\n\nIt worked. Anthony has sold more than 12 million albums worldwide, has a line of clothing at Kohl's, owns a piece of the Miami Dolphins, and has recently launched his own company, Magnus Media, to help fellow musicians and athletes target the $1.5 trillion that Latinos spend each year.\n\nThis started as a dream and it became a reality, Anthony says of the business.\n\nAnthony also talks in the interview about his former marriage to Jennifer Lopez, and his decision to speak out against Donald Trump during a performance at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning Sunday Morning with Charles Osgood is broadcast on CBS on Sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET. Executive producer is Rand Morrison.\n\nFollow the program on Twitter (@CBSSunday), Facebook, Instagram (#CBSSundayMorning) and at cbssundaymorning.com.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's defiance of federal court rulings on same-sex marriage violated judicial ethics, a disciplinary court ruled on Friday before suspending him for the rest of his term.\n\nThe punishment effectively removes Moore from office without the nine-member Alabama Court of the Judiciary officially ousting him. Given his age, he will not be able to run for chief justice again under state law.\n\nMoore was found to have encouraged probate judges to deny marriage licenses to gay couples six months after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that everyone has a fundamental right to marry in all 50 states.\n\nMoore vehemently denied that his administrative order was an act of defiance and said his personal beliefs had nothing to do with it.\n\nThe same panel removed the outspoken Republican in 2003 because he refused to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state judicial building. Voters later re-elected him as chief justice after he lost a race for governor.\n\nThis time, Moore sent an administrative order to the state's 68 probate judges, maintaining that the Alabama Supreme Court's same-sex marriage ban remained in full force and effect despite the ruling from the nation's highest court.\n\nMoore testified that his personal beliefs had nothing to do with it, and that his January order merely provided judges with a status report on a technical aspect of the law.\n\nMoore, 69, had already been suspended from the bench since May, when the state's Judicial Inquiry Commission accused him of violating judicial ethics. By the end of his term in 2019, he'll be beyond the age limit of 70 for judges, unless voters raise the limit in November.\n\nWe are here 13 years later because the Chief Justice learned nothing from his first removal. He continues to defy the law, John Carroll, a lawyer representing the commission, argued Wednesday in Moore's judicial court hearing.\n\nMoore was loudly applauded when he entered the ornate chamber where he usually presides over the state Supreme Court. He told his inquisitors that the ethics charges were ridiculous.\n\nI gave them a status in the case, a status of the facts that these orders exist. That is all I did, Moore testified.\n\nMoore's ethics trial came amid upheaval in all three branches of Alabama's government. The Republican speaker of the state House of Representatives was removed from office this summer for criminal ethics violations. A legislative committee is weighing whether Gov. Robert Bentley should be impeached over a scandal involving a top aide.
Jesse Tyler Ferguson is going to start a modern family of his own. The actor announced on The Late Late Show with James Corden that he and husband Justin Mikita are expecting their first child together.\n\nThe reveal came after host James Corden mentioned fellow guest Charlie Hunnam is hitting a milestone — his 40th birthday. Ferguson, who is 44, chimed in to say turning 40 is when you finally become an adult... like 'I need to start getting serious about things.'\n\nActually, this is something I haven't even mentioned to anyone — if we can keep this between us three and you all, he said gesturing to the audience. I'm actually expecting a baby in July with my husband. The crowd erupted with cheers and Ferguson joked, Let's just keep it between us.\n\nHe didn't reveal if he and Mikita are having a boy or girl, just saying that they're having a human.\n\nActor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, left, and his husband Justin Mikita arrive for the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards in Newark, New Jersey on August 26, 2019. JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images\n\nOn Modern Family, the actor plays Michell Pritchett, an uptight lawyer who married his longtime partner, Cameron, and adopted a baby girl named Lily. The sitcom chronicles their journey to fatherhood and raising their daughter.\n\nIt appears life imitates art. In real life, Ferguson is married to a lawyer and now they're about to become dads. The pair wed in 2013.\n\nMikita is also an activist. He and Ferguson started the nonprofit organization Tie the Knot, which raises money and awareness for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights while also providing stylish bowties and other accessories for couples to wear during their nuptials.\n\nThe goal of Tie The Knot is clear: to advocate for LGBTQ civil rights throughout the United States & beyond, and to look damn good while doing it, the organization's website reads.\n\nOn The Late Late Show, Ferguson didn't reveal many details about his and Mikita's future bundle of joy, but he did open up about the end of Modern Family.\n\nIt's incredibly sad. It's something I've been doing for 11 years — that's like first through eleventh grade as a kid. That's a lifetime, he said about the show's upcoming ending. We'll never have a job this good.\n\nI'm big with an 'Irish exit.' I do not like long goodbyes, so maybe that's what I'll do. After my last scene I'll just leave the lot and just drive home, he said, receiving laughs from the audience. I think that's the only way I'll be able to manage this. It's really emotional.\n\nCorden put things in perspective for Ferguson: On your last day of 'Modern Family,' knowing what we know now, you should think I'm leaving 'Modern Family' behind, but come July, you're going to make your new modern family — and it's going to be beautiful.
Franklin Graham, who is the son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and a prominent supporter of President Trump, slammed Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for being gay, Christian and married. In a series of three tweets Wednesday, he assailed Buttigieg for remarks he has made about being a gay Christian.\n\nPresidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right—God doesn't have a political party, Graham wrote. But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by. God doesn't change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever.\n\nThen, Graham added, Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.\n\nGraham, who heads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and the Christian relief group Samaritan's Purse, faced a storm of criticism for the comment. Several expressed outrage over the judgment he pronounced on Buttigieg, in light of his support of Mr. Trump. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough exclaimed, Oh shut up. You are a disgrace, adding, You are a disgrace for normalizing Donald Trump's behavior.\n\nGraham has said of Mr. Trump, I never said he was the best example of the Christian faith. He defends the faith. And I appreciate that very much. And he said that the president has admitted his faults and has apologized to his wife and daughter for things he has done and said. And he has to stand before God for those things.\n\nButtigieg has been feuding with Vice President Mike Pence over his opposition to gay marriage and gay rights. If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, Buttigieg said at an LGBTQ Victory Fund brunch earlier this month. And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand — that if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.\n\nHe has also suggested that suffers from his own Christian failings in supporting Mr. Trump. How could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn star presidency? Is it that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump? he said at a CNN town hall in March.\n\nIn 2015, when both Buttigieg and Pence were serving in Indiana, Pence, then the governor, signed a law that critics said unfairly targeted members of the LGBTQ community. Months later, during his mayoral re-election bid, Buttigieg came out as gay. The law was eventually rolled back amid a national outcry.\n\nLast year, Buttigieg married teacher Chasten Glezman, and should he win the presidency, the two would be the first gay first couple in the White House.\n\nButtigieg has not yet responded to Graham's remarks.
Linda Ronstadt quit performing years ago – her Parkinson's disease makes singing impossible. But last fall, she spoke to a sellout crowd at The Theatre at Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, who came to see her in person, and listen to her talk about what has been a magical life.\n\nThe great thing about having a hit is that means people like you, Ronstadt told the audience.\n\nBut the bad thing about it is, it means you have to sing that song over and over and over again, night after and night after night, 'til it starts sounding like your washing machine.\n\nLinda Ronstadt, with John Boylan, appeared on stage at A Conversation With Linda Ronstadt in Los Angles last October. CBS News\n\nThe crowd basked in Ronstadt's tales of her life and career, such as when she toured for four months as the opening act of The Doors: It was pretty tough to play with The Doors. It was kinda like a double bill of 'Bambi' and 'Deep Throat'!\n\nCorrespondent Tracy Smith asked Ronstadt, What's it like to get that kind of warmth when you're just talking?\n\nI was just astounded. I mean, it made me feel good, but I was glad they didn't boo, or start yelling for 'Heat Wave'!\n\nAnd you know she's heard that before.\n\nIn case you need a reminder, Ronstadt was a musical force of nature who sold 100 million records, had four consecutive platinum albums, and won an armful of Grammys for songs in wildly different music styles, like country, Latin and pop.\n\nFor much of her career, she practically lived on the road. But these days, her world is a bit smaller:\n\nShe mostly keeps to a San Francisco neighborhood close to the famous bridge, and a house on a quiet street where it seems she has now become the world's most famous couch potato.\n\nThese days she spends much of her time reading. I can't do a lot of things that are active, she said. I can't spend very much time on my feet, or even very much time sitting up. I have to kind of lounge around. But I'm lazy, so it's a good thing that I lounge!\n\nSo, I'm glad to have the leisure time. I have a huge stack of books that I need to read.\n\nSmith asked, When you think about those songs, in your mind, can you still sing?\n\nOh, I can sing in my brain; I sing in my brain all the time. But it's not quite the same as doing it physically. You know, there's a physical feeling in singing that's just like skiing down a hill, except better, 'cause I'm not a very good skier!\n\nBut she was a very good singer:\n\nFor more than four decades it seemed there was nothing Linda Ronstadt couldn't do, until she sensed that her voice was beginning to fail her.\n\nSmith asked, When did you start noticing there was something wrong with your voice?\n\n2000, she replied. I'd start to sing and then it would just clamp up. It was, like, a cramp. My voice would freeze. And I said, 'There's something wrong with my voice.' And people would say, 'Oh, you're just a perfectionist.' I go, 'No, there's really something systemically wrong.'\n\nAnd it's very slow-moving, this disease, so it took a long time to really finally manifest.\n\nShe played her last show in 2009, but it wasn't until 2013 that she revealed she'd been diagnosed with Parkinson's.\n\nShe'd retired before she knew what was happening: Oh yeah. I was just yelling. Instead of singing, I was just kind of yelling. I didn't want to charge people for that.\n\nDo you think other people heard it, too, really? asked Smith.\n\nYeah, yeah. But I mean, it wouldn't have mattered. I could hear it. It wasn't any fun anymore. You know, singing is … there are really a lot of things you can do with your voice; you can slide on all different sorts of textures and things. And if you're not doing that, it's not interesting.\n\nAnd she always tried to keep it interesting. Besides her solo work, she teamed up with some of the greatest voices in the business.\n\nTo watch Linda Ronstadt perform with Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris on The Late Show with David Letterman, click on the video player below:\n\nNo record company wanted to touch that, Ronstadt said. Called us the 'Queenston Trio.'\n\nIt's an amazing thing, when you sing with somebody. It's a very intimate relationship. It's almost like sex. It's as intimate as sex, but it's not sex. It's different. It's that intimate. It's like a great love affair.\n\nHer own love affair with music started when she was a kid growing up in Arizona in a musical family, learning to sing and play the guitar.\n\nShe was, and is, an independent spirit, from her career choices to her relationships, like her much-publicized romance with former California Governor Jerry Brown.\n\nShe says she still talks with Brown. Yeah, he was here for Thanksgiving.\n\nIt seems like you've managed to maintain relationships with people who were in your life, Smith said.\n\nI don't know why they're still speaking to me, but they are!\n\nWhy didn't you ever get married?\n\nI was not cut out for marriage, Ronstadt replied. I used to dream that I was gonna get married, and I'd go, 'I'm too young to get married.' And this was when I was, like, 45, you know? And I'd go, 'I can't get married. I'm too young.' So I guess that means I'm just really immature! I'm not good at compromising.\n\nYou know this about yourself?\n\nOh boy, do I ever!\n\nThe Stone Poneys, featuring Linda Ronstadt, performs Different Drum:\n\nBut her refusal to compromise helped her reach the heights of artistic achievement, and take home countless awards, including the National Medal of Arts in 2014, presented by an admittedly smitten president.\n\nSmith said, President Obama confessed, or admitted, to having a crush on you.\n\nOh, he was being nice to a 70-year-old woman in a wheelchair, Ronstadt said.\n\nHow about that medal? Do accolades like that mean something to you?\n\nWell, it's kinda big! I didn't know what to do with that. I put it under the bed. It's under my bed, with my crowbar that I have for in case there's an earthquake and I have to pry the roof off myself. I have a crowbar and medal under the bed!\n\nI mean, it's nice to be acknowledged, nice for your work to be acknowledged. But it's not what you do it for. You do it for the work. And if you're doing it for prizes, you're in big trouble.\n\nAnd who knows, there could be even more awards on the way: Last week she came out with a new live album – her first ever – made from newly-uncovered tapes of a made-for-TV concert in 1980, when she was at the height of her vocal powers.\n\nTo watch Linda Ronstadt perform You're No Good, from her new album, Linda Ronstadt Live in Hollywood, click on the video player:\n\nNow, she says, she can't even sing in the shower.\n\nSmith asked, Do you try?\n\nYeah, but it doesn't, I can't make sound, Ronstadt replied.\n\nThey've talked over the years about various treatments that could make singing come back.\n\nI'm sure they'll find something eventually, you know? They're learning so much more about it every day.\n\nRhino Records\n\nI mean, I'm 72. We're all gonna die. They say people usually die with Parkinson's. They don't always die of it, because it's so slow-moving, so I figure I'll die of something. And I've watched people die, so I'm not as afraid of dying. I'm afraid of suffering, but I'm not afraid of dying.\n\nAnd ever the performer, she says she'd like to go out singing.\n\nThat's the way I'd like to die, is right in the middle of a note! she said.\n\nAs of right now, there are no more Conversations With Linda Ronstadt on the books. But at 72, she's learned never to say never. And at the end of her appearance in L.A., as she started to leave the stage, she hesitated for just a moment. Maybe that's because, like her millions of fans, Linda Ronstadt is not quite ready to say goodbye.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by John D'Amelio.
Seven Democratic candidates met on stage in South Carolina for the last debate before the state's primary and Super Tuesday, co-hosted by CBS News, the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and Twitter. Read CBS News' full coverage here, and find the full transcript below.\n\nNORAH O'DONNELL, CBS NEWS ANCHOR: Tonight, the battle for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, where everything is on the line.\n\nGAYLE KING, CO-HOST, CBS THIS MORNING: Seven candidates face off in the final debate before the South Carolina and Super Tuesday primaries.\n\nI'm Gayle King.\n\nO'DONNELL: And I'm Norah O'Donnell.\n\nLet's get started.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The time has come to turn the page and open up a new chapter in the American story.\n\nANNOUNCER (voice-over): Tonight:\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Let us go forward. Let's win this thing. Let's transform America!\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nANNOUNCER: America decides.\n\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: 2020 is our time to change who makes the rules.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nANNOUNCER: One stage.\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This election is just too important, and we cannot afford to get it wrong.\n\nJOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There's no limit to what we could get done in the next four years.\n\nTOM STEYER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Show up in November of 2020 and win.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nANNOUNCER: Seven Democratic candidates.\n\nWARREN: Together, we have built a movement.\n\nSTEYER: We have a fantastically diverse and wonderful party.\n\nBIDEN: We choose hope over fear.\n\nSANDERS: We are going to unite together.\n\nBLOOMBERG: And, together, we are going to get it done.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We will deliver a democracy worthy of the name.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: We are here, and we are strong.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nANNOUNCER: Live from the Gaillard Center in Charleston, South Carolina, this is the CBS News Democratic debate.\n\nHere are the seven candidates for the presidential nomination.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: Good evening, and welcome.\n\nThe Democratic presidential primary here in South Carolina, the first primary in the South, is just four days away.\n\nKING: And Super Tuesday is just a week away. And this is the biggest primary day of the year, as voters in 14 states cast ballots, and many of them tell us they have not actually made up their mind.\n\nSo, this debate, when you think about it tonight, may be the last, best chance for the candidates to make their case to South Carolina and Super Tuesday voters.\n\nO'DONNELL: And CBS News is proud too bring you this debate, along with our co-sponsors.\n\nThey are the Democratic National Committee and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, a nonpartisan organization committed to educating voters and training political leaders.\n\nKING: And we are partnering tonight also with Twitter.\n\nSo, you at home can participate in this debate. How do you do that? Send us your questions for the candidates using the Twitter hashtag #DemDebate.\n\nO'DONNELL: Now, here are the rules for the next two hours.\n\nWhen you are asked a question, you will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer, and 45 seconds for follow-ups.\n\nSo, let's begin.\n\nSenator Sanders, we haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower.\n\nHow will you convince voters that a Democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?\n\nSANDERS: Well, you're right. The economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: In the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth.\n\nBut you know what? For the ordinary American, things are not so good. Last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than 1 percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck; 87 million Americans have no health insurance or are underinsured; 45 million people are struggling with student debt; 500,000 people tonight are sleeping out on the street, including 30,000 veterans.\n\nThat is not an economy that's working for the American people. That's an economy working for the 1 percent.\n\nWe're going to create an economy for all, not just wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Senator...\n\nO'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg...\n\nBLOOMBERG: Senator...\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBLOOMBERG: Senator...\n\nO'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, I'll let you respond to that.\n\nDo you think Senator Sanders' economy would be better for America than President Trump's?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I -- I think that Donald Trump thinks it would be better if he's president. I do not think so.\n\nVladimir Putin thinks that Donald Trump should be president of the United States.\n\nAnd that's why Russia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, Mr. Bloomberg.\n\nLet me tell Mr. Putin, OK, I'm not a good friend of President Xi of China. I think President Xi is an authoritarian leader.\n\nAnd let me tell Mr. Putin, who interfered in the 2016 election, try to bring Americans against Americans, hey, Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not going to interfere in any more American elections.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Warren?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Look, we know what the president -- what Russia wants. It's chaos.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas, even if there are a lot of people on this stage who don't want to say so.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: You know, but Bernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I would make a better president than Bernie.\n\nAnd the reason for that is that getting a progressive agenda enacted is going to be really hard, and it's going to take someone who digs into the details to make it happen.\n\nBernie and I both wanted to help rein in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance. But I dug in. I fought the big banks. I built the coalitions, and I won.\n\nBernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank...\n\nWARREN: I dug in. I did the work. And then Bernie's team trashed me for it.\n\nWe need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done. Progressives have got one shot. And we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done.\n\nKING: Mayor Buttigieg, we want to bring you in this conversation.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Why would the Russians want to be working on behalf of Bernie Sanders?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I will tell you what the Russians want. They don't have a political party. They want chaos.\n\nAnd chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Think about what that will be like for this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: And, meanwhile, folks at home, from South Carolina to South Bend, are trying to figure out what any of this means for us, because it's right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up, and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement.\n\nBut, also, there's a majority of the American people who I think right now just want to be able to turn on the TV, see their president, and actually feel their blood pressure go down a little bit, instead of up through the roof.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We have an opportunity to set a different tone.\n\nO'DONNELL: Mr. Steyer.\n\nKING: Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: Bernie Sanders' analysis is right.\n\nThe difference is, I don't like his solutions. I don't believe that a government takeover of large parts of the economy makes any sense for working people or for families.\n\nI think that what we need to do is to present an alternative that includes a vibrant, competitive private sector.\n\nBut we all know, unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer is not for the government to take over the private sector, though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.\n\nKING: Vice President Biden?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTEYER: We need to -- well, let me just finish, because we need to have an alternative to Donald Trump.\n\nI'm talking about doubling the minimum wage, cutting taxes by 10 percent for everybody who makes less than $250,000 and creating over 4.5 million good-paying union jobs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTEYER: Donald Trump thinks -- he's incompetent as a steward of the American economy. We have to show that we can create a growing, prosperous economy that works for American working people.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nGayle?\n\nKING: Mr. Steyer, thank you. Your time is up.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: You know, when we talk about progressive, let's talk about being progressive.\n\nWalking distance of here is Mother Emanuel Church, nine people shot dead by a white supremacist.\n\nBernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and wanted a waiting period...\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: No, let me finish.\n\n2010-2015 Josh\n\nA waiting period of 12 hours. I'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest until you are cleared.\n\nIn addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama -- he wanted a primary-- he said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, this is -- let's talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done, and that's what we got done. We got a lot done\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Senator Sanders -- Senator Sanders, your response.\n\nSANDERS: You know, Pete mentioned -- I'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSANDERS: I wonder why. And maybe, you know, Pete mentions what the American people want. I will tell you, Pete, what the American people want, and, Joe, what the American people want. They don't want candidates to be running to billionaires for huge amounts of funding.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: All right, let's clear this up once and for all.\n\nSANDERS: Pete has gotten funding from over 50 billionaires.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: You've got people believing something that is false. This needs to be cleared up.\n\nSANDERS: Joe, I think, has gotten a little bit more. What the American people want, by the way, and a lot of the issues we'll be discussing tonight are issues I raised four years ago: raising the minimum wage to a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. Making public colleges and universities tuition-free. And finally, doing what every other major country on Earth does, guaranteeing health care to all people as a human right through a Medicare for All, single-payer system.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I can't allow -- I can't allow this to stand because it's just not true. Senator Sanders...\n\nKING: We're going to allow everyone an opportunity opportunity to respond.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... has got people believing something that is untrue about my campaign. The idea that most of my campaign is funded by billionaires...\n\nSANDERS: I didn't say that, Pete.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Fifty people, all right. In Charleston alone, just in Charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. That means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from Charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned. Grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign.\n\nIn fact, I shouldn't miss the opportunity, if you're watching right now and you support my campaign, go to peteforamerica.com, and chip in. And if you are watching right now, and you're a billionaire, I will raise your taxes. But if you'd like to defeat Donald Trump, please go to peteforamerica.com and donate legal maximum of $2,800, if you're a billionaire.\n\nKING: All right, all right, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nVice President Biden, I want to make -- I want to bring us to another topic. We're in South Carolina. It's the first primary with a significant black voting population. Your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters. And I'm wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time.\n\nBIDEN: Well, first of all, the latest poll I saw, my numbers -- I'm still 15 points ahead, the latest poll.\n\nKING: Yes, yes, you're correct. You're correct.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: But look, look...\n\nKING: But Senator Sanders is in striking distance of you. You are within the margin of error in this state.\n\nBIDEN: Well, it depends which -- look, I've earned the vote, I've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African-American community, not just here but across the country. I've been coming here for years and years, creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example, that employs one in 11 people, we put $500 million, in our administration, just into this county. We've created jobs for people.\n\nThe people know me. My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties. I don't expect anything. I plan to earn the vote. I'm here to ask. I'm here to earn it. But, folks, I intend to win in South Carolina, and I will win the African-American vote here in South Carolina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Mr. Biden, will you continue if you do not win South Carolina? You have said that South Carolina will determine the outcome of this presidential race. If you don't win South Carolina, will you continue in this race?\n\nBIDEN: I will win South Carolina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, sir.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, I'd like to bring you into this conversation. I want to ask you about a question that impacts the black and brown community. You've apologized for stop and frisk repeatedly. What exactly are you apologizing for?\n\nBLOOMBERG: We let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95 percent. And I've apologized and asked for forgiveness. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time.\n\nBut let me tell you, I have been working very hard. We've improved the school system for black and brown students in New York City. We've increased the jobs that are available to them. We've increased the housing that's available to them. We have programs like the...\n\nKING: But what more can you do about this issue, Mr. Mayor, to put people's fears and skepticism to rest? It continues to follow you.\n\nBLOOMBERG: No -- well, that's because it's in their interest to promote that. But if you talk to the people in New York City, I have over 100 black elected officials that have endorsed me. A lot of them are in the audience tonight. And I've earned the respect of people in New York City.\n\nI was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the United States for 12 years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. It is safer for everybody. The school system is better. The budget is under control. We've done the things that people need in New York City for all ethnicities.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Mayor Buttigieg, mayor to mayor, mayor to mayor, you've certainly had your issues with the black community as well. Do you think the New York City's implementation of stop and frisk was racist?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Yes, in effect, it was. Because it was about profiling people based on their race. And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. And I'm not here to score points. I come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community.\n\nAnd I come to this with some humility because I'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. None of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin.\n\nNone of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by, of going into a doctor, and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race. Since we don't have the experience, the next best thing we can do...\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mayor.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... is actually listen to those who do.\n\nBLOOMBERG: I know -- wait a second. I know that if I were black, my success would have been a lot harder to achieve. And I know a lot of black people that if they were white it would have been a lot easier for them. That's just a fact, and we've got to do something about it than rather just demagogue about it.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, was the way that the mayor implemented stop and frisk racist?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Yes, and I think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. Martin Luther King once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it.\n\nAnd to me that means sentencing reform, like the First Step Act, and extending that to the states with the Second Step Act. It means equal opportunity. Because if we don't pass Representative Clyburn's bill out of South Carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny.\n\nAnd we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. And then, finally, voting. While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls. Georgia kicked 100,000 off. As president, I will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: Senator Warren, I'm coming to you. I want to direct this question to you because you -- because Mayor Bloomberg has said he got in this race late because he doesn't believe that any of you on stage can beat Donald Trump. You said Mayor Bloomberg is not the safest candidate, he is the riskiest candidate. What did you mean by that?\n\nWARREN: I mean that Mayor Bloomberg -- let's think of it this way. We're here in Charleston, and you know who is going to be in Charleston later this week is Donald Trump. He's going to be here to raise money for his buddy Senator Lindsey Graham, who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re-election last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nAnd that's not the only right-wing senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded. In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point.\n\nIn 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will. And the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the Democratic Party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, Senator Warren, thank you.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond? Mayor Bloomberg?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I have been training for this job since I stepped on the pile that was still smoldering on 9/11. I know what to do. I've shown I know how to run a country. I've run the city which is almost the same size -- bigger than most countries in the world.\n\nI am not the -- I'm the one choice that makes some sense. I have the experience. I have the resources. And I have the record. And all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. When people hired me to run New York City three times, in an overwhelmingly Democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again.\n\nO'DONNELL: Mr. Vice President?\n\nWARREN: I was mentioned in this.\n\nBIDEN: No...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: I'd like to respond.\n\nO'DONNELL: Go ahead, Senator.\n\nWARREN: He called me out by name.\n\nBIDEN: There was a -- I thought...\n\nWARREN: ... and referred to what I talk about as a sideshow. You know, this is personal for me. When I was 21 years old, I got my first job as a special education teacher. I loved that job. And by the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant.\n\nThe principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination, you bet. But I was 21 years old. I didn't have a union to protect me. And I didn't have any federal law on my side. So I packed up my stuff, and I went home. At least I didn't have a boss who said to me, Kill it, the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said...\n\nBLOOMBERG: I never said that. Oh, come on.\n\nWARREN: ... to one of his pregnant employees. People want a chance to hear...\n\n(AUDIENCE BOOS)\n\nPeople want a chance to hear from the women who have worked for...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLOOMBERG: I never said that. And for the record, if she was a teacher in New York City, she would never have had that problem. We treated our teachers the right way, and the unions will tell you exactly that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: Well, Mayor Bloomberg, Senator Warren has raised...\n\nWARREN: Then let us -- let us have -- the women have an opportunity to speak. The Bloomberg corporations and Mayor Bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination. They are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak. If he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: ... so that they can tell their stories the way I can tell my story without having the fear they're going to be sued by a billionaire.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you. Thank you. We have a number of issues to discuss tonight, but I want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond, because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace. At the last debate, you said some of your female employees might not have liked some of your jokes. Did these women take your jokes wrong? Or were you wrong to make the jokes?\n\nBLOOMBERG: Probably wrong to make the jokes. I don't remember what they were. So I assume -- if it bothered them, I was wrong, and I apologize. I'm sorry for that.\n\nBut what happened here is we went back 40 years and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable. Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two. And what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. I did that two days later, and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again. The senator has got it. And I don't know what else she wants us to do.\n\nWARREN: Oh, I'll be clear.\n\nBLOOMBERG: We're following exactly what she asked to do.\n\nWARREN: I'll tell you exactly what I want you to do.\n\nBLOOMBERG: And the trouble is with this senator, enough is never enough for what this -- I'm going to start focusing on some of these other things. We just cannot continue to re-litigate this every time. We did what she asked. And, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it. And by my company renouncing using these, we probably changed, hopefully, the corporate landscape all across America.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: If you get nominated, we'll be re-litigating this all year.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: Sorry, Mayor, you did not do what I asked.\n\nKING: Senator Warren, that is a very serious charge that you leveled at the mayor.\n\nWARREN: Yes.\n\nKING: He told a woman to get an abortion. What evidence do you have of that?\n\nWARREN: Her own words.\n\nKING: And, Mayor Bloomberg, could you respond to this?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I never said it, period, end of story. Categorically never said it. When it was accused -- when I was accused of doing it, we couldn't figure out what she was talking about. But right now, I'm sorry if she heard what she thought she heard, or whatever happened. I didn't take any pleasure in that. And we've just got to go on. But I never said it. Come on.\n\nWARREN: What I asked the mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims...\n\nBLOOMBERG: We are doing that, Senator.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: We want to get to the -- we want to get to the issue -- we want to get to the issue of electability and the ideological difference within the Democratic Party.\n\nWARREN: OK.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, the cost of your agenda. Yesterday, you released information about how you will pay for your major proposals, but not all of your details are clear. You've proposed more than $50 trillion in new spending.\n\nSANDERS: Over a 10-year period.\n\nO'DONNELL: You've said Medicare for all will cost $30 trillion.\n\nSANDERS: Over a 10-year period.\n\nO'DONNELL: But you can only explain how you'll pay for just about half of that. Can you do the math for the rest of us?\n\nSANDERS: How many hours do you have?\n\nKING: Two.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: That's the problem.\n\nSANDERS: No, it's not the problem. All right, let's talk about Medicare for all. I'm sure you're familiar with the new study that just came out of Yale University, published in Lancet magazine, one of the prestigious medical journals in the world. You know what it said? Medicare for all will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save 68,000 lives of people who otherwise would have died.\n\nWhat we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does: guarantee health care to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer.\n\nOur plan -- we have laid out options all over the place. One of the options is a 7.5 percent payroll tax on employers, which will save them substantial sums of money. Another...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Bernie, let me -- let me respond to this.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: You asked me a question.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, does the math add up?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: No, the math does not add up. In fact, just on 60 Minutes this weekend, he said he wasn't going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes. Well, let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we're talking about: nearly $60 trillion. Do you know how much that is, for all of his programs?\n\nSANDERS: Not true.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: That is three times the American economy -- not the federal government -- the entire American economy. The Medicare for all plan alone on page eight clearly says that it will kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. That is true.\n\nAs one prominent Democrat once said, we should pay attention to where the voters of this country are, Bernie. That prominent Democrat was Barack Obama a few months ago. And I think that's what we should do. They are not with you on spending nearly $60 trillion.\n\nSANDERS: First of all...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: What I think we should do is make things more affordable, nonprofit public option, make sure we're paying for long-term care better, take on the pharmaceuticals, like you and I have done together...\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... and do something for the people of America.\n\nKING: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Instead of a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers.\n\nKING: Mr. Steyer -- Mr. Steyer...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I think we're talking about math.\n\nKING: We'll get to you, Mr. Sanders.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about it.\n\nSTEYER: Can I say something?\n\nSANDERS: First of all...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: No, let me go.\n\nSANDERS: No, I think -- Tom, I think she was talking about my plan, not yours.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I think we were talking about math, and it doesn't take two hours to do the math.\n\nSANDERS: No, no, well, let's talk about math.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Because let's talk about what it adds up to.\n\nSANDERS: Let's talk about math.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about math, indeed. OK, so here's the math...\n\nSANDERS: If we do nothing is what...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: No, here's the math.\n\nSANDERS: Excuse me, can I respond to the attack?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: To do nothing is what will happen...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you are allowed a quick response and then we would like to allow the other candidates...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: Listen to the moderator, guys.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders. Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: The moderator -- is it my turn?\n\nBIDEN: This helps a lot, doesn't?\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you have been name checked. You are allowed to respond.\n\nSANDERS: OK. What the Health and Human Services have said in analyzing health care costs, what Yale -- recent Yale study has said is that your program would cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period. We would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs. What every study out there -- conservative or progressive -- says, Medicare for all will save money. Ours will cost about $45 billion, not $60 trillion.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Bernie, I was talking about -- I was talking about...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKING: We would like -- Senator Sanders, we would like to bring Mr. Steyer in on this conversation.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: Mr. Steyer, please.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I was talking about all your programs.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: Excuse me, Amy. This conversation shows a huge risk for the Democratic Party. We are looking at a party that has decided that we're either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a Republican.\n\nAnd let me say that I got into this race because I wanted to fight for economic justice, for racial justice, and to make sure we had climate justice for the American people. And I am scared.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIf we cannot pull this party together, if we go to one of those extremes, we take a terrible risk of re-electing Donald Trump.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: And that is something -- I still have some time. And let me say this.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: That is a risk that will hurt the American people in a way that none of us on this stage should be willing to risk.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you. Let's keep this topic going. Mayor Pete?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: So let's do this math. Senator Sanders at one point said it was going to be $40 trillion, then it was $30 trillion, then it was $17 trillion. That's an incredible shrinking price tag. At some point, has said it is unknowable to even see what the price tag would be. Now there are new numbers.\n\nI'll tell you exactly what it adds up to.\n\nIt adds to four more years of Donald Trump, Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, and the inability to get the Senate into Democratic hands.\n\nThe time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters. Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump reelected.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We got a House to worry about. We got a Senate to worry about. And this is -- this is really important.\n\nLook...\n\nBIDEN: Hello?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... if you want to keep the House in Democratic hands, you might want to check with the people who actually turned the House blue, 40 Democrats, who are not running on your platform.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I want to send those Democrats back to the United States House.\n\nKING: Vice President Biden.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Let's listen to them...\n\nKING: Vice President Biden.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... when they say that they don't want to be out there defending Senator Sanders...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKING: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nVice President Biden, please.\n\nBIDEN: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.\n\nI guess the only way you do this is jump in and speak twice as long as you should.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBIDEN: Here's the deal. Here's the deal.\n\nLook, a guy who's a friend of mine down here named Fritz Hollings -- he passed away -- he said, you want to know what a woman will do, look what they have done. Look what they have done.\n\nYou talk about -- concerned about race. Well, my good friend on the end of this platform, he, in fact, bought a system that was a private prison system, after, after he knew that, in fact, what happened was, they hog-tied young men in prison here in this state.\n\nThey, in fact, made sure that, in Georgia, they did not have health care for the people who were being held. They, in fact, went on, and he said, after he knew that, he bought it. And then he said he was proud of his accomplishment.\n\nYou talk about what we're talking about with Bernie. Bernie, in fact, hasn't passed much of anything. The fact of the matter is...\n\nSTEYER: OK. But I get to answer.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: No, no, no.\n\nSTEYER: I get to answer that.\n\nBIDEN: The -- look -- look...\n\nSTEYER: No, that...\n\nBIDEN: ... fact is...\n\nSTEYER: You're out of time.\n\nI get to answer...\n\nBIDEN: Here's the deal.\n\nI'm not out of time. You spoke over time, and I'm going to talk.\n\nHere's the deal.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: Here's the deal.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, look at what's happening here. Look at what's happening here. We have to win the Senate back.\n\nAnd, by the way, I went into all of those races that got 41 new Democrats. The majority of them are supporting me for president and endorsing me.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: And, Mr. Vice President, I have to allow -- yes, Mr. Mayor.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Mr. Mayor, you're allowed to respond.\n\nSTEYER: I bought stock in a prison company thinking they would do a better job. And I investigated. And I sold it.\n\nBLOOMBERG: OK.\n\nBIDEN: But you knew -- you knew when you bought it they'd done that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: I get to answer this question.\n\nAnd, in fact, since then, I have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state, and we have ended it. I have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses, women ownership of businesses, and Latino owners of businesses, because this financial service industry is prejudiced.\n\nI have worked tirelessly on this. And you know I'm right. You wrote the crime bill that you called...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Where we come from, that's called Tommy come lately.\n\nBLOOMBERG: There are other people here.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTEYER: ... crime bill that put hundreds of thousands of young black and Latino men in prison.\n\nBIDEN: Not true.\n\nBLOOMBERG: OK. Let me say something.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: There's something going on here. I have worked for racial justice...\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nKING: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: ... completely. And that is an absolute unfair statement.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: All I know...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBIDEN: Tommy come lately.\n\nKING: Mayor Bloomberg. Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... if we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we're going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart.\n\nBIDEN: Look...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: So, my argument here is that we need to get back to what's happening right now.\n\nWe have a clear choice of who's going to lead this party. And I am the only one in the New Hampshire debate, when asked, if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket, that raised my hand.\n\nI like Bernie. We came in together to the Senate. But I do not think that this is the best person to lead the ticket.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And if you want to talk about getting things done and make a comparison, according to Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, last Congress, I was the most effective Democrat in the U.S. Senate on 15 metrics.\n\nBernie and Elizabeth were in the bottom half. It matters -- it matters if you can actually get things done.\n\nBLOOMBERG: OK. Gayle...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: It is not just who talks the best, who actually gets things done.\n\nAnd especially with the African-American community, there have been a lot of broken promises.. And I think having someone that keeps their promises and follows through and is going to get things done for these people matters. And that's why I ask for your support.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKING: Mayor Bloomberg, please.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Let's just go on the record.\n\nThey talk about 40 Democrats; 21 of those were people that I spent $100 million to help elect. All of the new Democrats that came in and put Nancy Pelosi in charge and gave the Congress the ability to control this president...\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nBLOOMBERG: ... I -- I got them.\n\nNumber two, when you talk about money, let's put this in perspective. The federal budget is $4.5 trillion a year. We get $3.5 trillion in revenue. We lose $1 trillion a year.\n\nThat's why the federal budget -- deficit is -- right now, the debt is $20 trillion, going up to 21.\n\nWe just cannot afford some of this stuff people talk about. But if you...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLOOMBERG: Let me finish.\n\nIf you keep on going, we will elect Bernie. Bernie will lose to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump and the House and the Senate and some of the statehouses will all go red.\n\nAnd then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges, for the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to live with this catastrophe.\n\nO'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, thank you.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: I will allow Senator Sanders a quick response, and then Senator Warren.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you very much, Norah.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, a quick response, and then Senator Warren.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you very much.\n\nMayor Bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support. The problem is, they're all billionaires.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nSANDERS: Now, if you look -- oh.\n\nOn the other hand, of the last 50 polls that have been done nationally, Mr. Bloomberg, I beat Trump 47 of those 50 times.\n\nIf you look at battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, polling just done this Sunday...\n\nBLOOMBERG: The polls aren't the election.\n\nSANDERS: ... I beat Trump.\n\nAnd if you want to beat Trump, what you're going to need is an unprecedented...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: ... grassroots movement of black and white and Latino, Native American and Asian, people who are standing up and fighting for justice.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nSANDERS: That's what our movement is about.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Can anybody -- can anybody in this room imagine moderate Republicans going over and voting for him?\n\nSANDERS: Absolutely.\n\nBLOOMBERG: And you have to do that, or you can't win.\n\nWARREN: You know, that is...\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nSenator Warren.\n\nWARREN: That is the problem.\n\nAnd that is that a progressive agenda is popular, Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nAnd, for everyone on this stage, we talk about how to build a future. That's what matters.\n\nI talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care. It's why I also have a way to pay for health care that doesn't raise taxes on middle-class families.\n\nBut it's so much more than that. As Democrats, we need to speak to the future we can build together. We need to speak of the prosperity we can build together.\n\nHow about a wealth tax in America? Because with a 2 cent tax on just the top one-tenth of 1 percent, we have a chance to invest in universal child care for every one of our babies, to really level the playing field.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nWARREN: Put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: And start closing the racial wealth gap by canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: We need to talk about our aspirations, our hopes.\n\nThis is a moment...\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator...\n\nWARREN: ... to choose hope over fear.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator, thank you.\n\nWARREN: This is our moment.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator, thank you.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: We have to take a quick break.\n\nWhen we come back, the Democratic presidential debate continues right after this, only on CBS.\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: I'm Gayle King with Norah O'Donnell. Joining us now on the question here in Charleston, South Carolina are CBS News colleagues, the A team, Bill Whitaker of 60 MINUTES, chief Washington correspondent, that's Major Garrett, and Margaret Brennan, moderator of FACE THE NATION.\n\nWe're going to begin with you, Vice President Biden, for this part. Just across the street, as you mentioned at the top of the debate, is the theater (sic) where nine people were shot and killed inside the Mother Emanuel Church. We all remember that day back in 2015.\n\nAnd every day in our country, over 100 people die from gun violence. You all have plans, I know, on this stage, to address the gun crisis. But Congress has not been able to pass a major gun legislation in a quarter of a century. And just think about this, in those 25 years we've had Columbine, Newtown, Parkland, Las Vegas. We could go on and on.\n\nVice President Biden, I want to start with you, why should anyone have faith that you're the one who can get this done now?\n\nBIDEN: Because I'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. I beat the NRA twice. I got assault weapons banned. I got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. I got them eliminated. Except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in Florida and it was not reauthorized.\n\nIn addition to, that I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers, absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. We would give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.\n\nCarnage on our streets. And I want to tell you, if I'm elected, NRA, I'm coming for you, and gun manufacturers, I'm going to take you on and I'm going to beat you. I'm the only one who has done it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That's why we have got to change what Washington can deliver.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: So this is about being able to dig in and talk about what really it's going to take to get something done. I've been in the Senate. What I've seen is gun safety legislation introduced, get a majority, and then doesn't pass because of the filibuster. Understand this, the filibuster is giving a veto to the gun industry.\n\nIt gives a veto to the oil industry. It's going to give a veto on immigration. Until we're willing to dig in and say that if Mitch McConnell is going to do to the next Democratic president what he did to President Obama, and that is try to block every single thing he does, that we are willing to roll back the filibuster, go with the majority vote, and do what needs to be done for the American people.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKING: We're going to stay on this top and allow Senator...\n\nBIDEN: ... and I can beat Mitch McConnell.\n\nWARREN: Understand this, many people on this stage do not support rolling back the filibuster. Until we're ready to do that, we can't have real change.\n\nO'DONNELL: I want to allow Senator Sanders to respond because you've gone after the insurance industry. You've taken on pharmaceutical companies. And you've taken on big tech. Why did you vote repeatedly to give gun manufacturers a pass?\n\nSANDERS: Well, you know, Joe has voted for terrible trade agreements.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nSANDERS: No, no, no, no, no. Joe voted for the war in Iraq. My point was, not to be -- I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes. That was a bad vote. I have today a D-minus voting record from the NRA. Thirty years ago, I likely lost a race for the one seat for Congress in Vermont because 30 years ago, I opposed -- I supported a ban on assault weapons. Thirty years ago.\n\nRight now, my view is we need to expand background checks, end the gun show loophole, and do what the American people want, not what the NRA wants.\n\nBIDEN: OK, but wait a second...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... the opposition to the filibuster is not a discretion from a long time ago.\n\nBLOOMBERG: I think she recognized me, thank you. I have a 6 million-person organization around this country. Moms Demand Action and Everytown.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLOOMBERG: We have put background checks -- we have got background checks in 20 states. So you can do it. It's Congress that can't seem to do it. And I don't know why we think they're going to do it. The vice president voted for a death bill, and supported the NRA. And certainly Senator Sanders has supported the NRA.\n\nBut we can do this. We have just got to stop talking about it.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: But the way we do it -- the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes. So I have long supported the assault weapon ban. I am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an AK-47.\n\nBIDEN: I wrote that law.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: That bill, along with -- you didn't write that bill. I wrote that bill.\n\nBIDEN: I wrote the bill, the Violence Against Women Act...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. You did you that.\n\nBIDEN: ... that took out of the hands of people who abused their...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. We'll have a fact check look at this.\n\nBIDEN: Let's look at the fact check...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Oh my goodness.\n\nBIDEN: The only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. I couldn't get that covered. You, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and Mitch McConnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the Violence Against Women Act across the board.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: OK. So, if I could finish. I have the bill. Anyone can check it out, to close the boyfriend loophole. Also to close the Charleston loophole is another bill that is out there. Universal background checks.\n\nBut let me say how we win this. We have got to win in the middle of the country. And while everyone talks about winning rural areas, suburban areas, I'm the only one up here with a receipts that has actually repeatedly, while being for the assault weapon ban, won in Republican congressional districts over and over again, including Michele Bachmann's district.\n\nSo having someone that can lead the ticket, that can bring people with her, is the way you get gun safety legislation. I look at these proposals and say, do they hit my uncle Dick in the deer stand? They do not. So coming from a proud hunting state and still being able to pass this legislation is going to be the key.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, thank you.\n\nWe want to allow many people to get in on this topic. Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country. But I want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took, this is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd we're in South Carolina. How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change? We are in this state...\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We are in the state where Strom Thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly. No less a Senate traditional figure than Harry Reid has called for it to go. It has got to go, because otherwise Washington will not deliver. I was in high school when the Columbine shooting happened. And I remember everybody in Washington saying, never again, we'll never let this happen again.\n\nAnd then a second school shooting generation has now been produced. Shame on us if we allow there to be a third. And also...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... in terms of making the case, I think it wouldn't be a bad idea for somebody to illustrate, from the perspective of the a veteran, why the kinds of weaponry, anything remotely like what I trained on in order to go serve in a war zone has no business being sold anywhere near an American school or church or neighbor.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, Senator Sanders, please.\n\nSANDERS: Thirty years ago, I supported a ban on assault weapons. Mike Bloomberg has started a very good organization, Moms Demand Actions. Congratulations.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Thank you.\n\nSANDERS: They have credited me with gun sense, as you know.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Yes, we did.\n\nSANDERS: Furthermore, furthermore, it is my view, the time is now, and Joe made this point, look, at the end of the day we need to rally the American people. Here is the good news. Because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings, the American people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety, not be dictated to by the NRA.\n\nAnd I am proud that I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. If elected president, it will get worse than that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, Mr. Steyer, please? Mr. Steyer?\n\nSTEYER: Look, it isn't a question of the American people deciding that we have too much gun violence. Everyone in America knows we have too much gun violence. The problem we have is that corporations have bought Washington, D.C.\n\nThe gun manufacturers own the Senate of the United States. So even though more than 90 percent of Americans want mandatory background checks on every gun purchase, we can't get it through the Senate.\n\nSo the question you have to ask yourself is, how do we change the Senate of the United States in a material way? And there are two things. That's why I am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator, to change who's in charge, to get rid of Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut I am also -- Senator Sanders is right. We need to win a huge victory across the board.\n\nKING: All right, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: Democrats need to go to the grassroots. I built one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the United States.\n\nKING: Your time's up, sir.\n\nSTEYER: The way to win at the grassroots is, tell the truth and organize.\n\nKING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?\n\nSTEYER: That's what it's going to take in 2020.\n\nKING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?\n\nWHITAKER: Let's talk about education. South Carolina's schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment. Black students here consistently score worse than white students. Mayor Bloomberg, a key element of your response to failing schools in New York City was a dramatic increase in public charter schools. As president, would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I'm not sure they're appropriate every place. I can only tell you, in New York, they provided parents with an alternative to send students to them. We had -- the charter schools are mixed in with the non-charter public schools, because our charter schools are public schools, as well. They've helped each other.\n\nI saw a statistic the other day, when I came into office, zero New York City schools were in the top 25 of the state. When I left, 23 out of 25 were from New York City. We've cut the gap between the rich and the poor. We've made an enormous difference in all of the options that parents have.\n\nI raised teacher salaries by 43 percent. I put an extra $5 billion into our school system. I value education. It is the only way to solve the poverty problem is to get people a good education. And rather than just talk about it in New York, we actually did it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWHITAKER: Senator Warren?\n\nWARREN: So this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself. And I'm going to start with my secretary of education. My secretary of education will be someone who has taught in public school.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMy secretary of education will be someone who believes in public education. And my secretary of education will believe that public dollars should stay in public schools.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOne more thing. My secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high-stakes testing. We need to support our children. But, look, we want to build a future in this country? We build a future by investing in our children. I've got a plan to put $800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.\n\nWARREN: Education is not free. We must invest in the future of our children.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWHITAKER: Senator Sanders?\n\nSANDERS: This campaign, our campaign, our campaign is about changing American priorities. Instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we're going to have high-quality, universal childcare for every family in this country.\n\nBecause the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development. We are going to triple funding for low-income Title I schools, because kids' education should not depend upon the ZIP Code in which they live. We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on Wall Street speculation. And we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in America earns less than $60,000 a year.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you, Senator.\n\nSANDERS: We want great teachers.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Can I...\n\nWHITAKER: Mayor Buttigieg?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Look, the best thing that we can do to support public education is to support public educators. I'm a little biased, because I'm married to one. And I get an education about education every day I come home.\n\nI have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms. Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids.\n\nAnd now some politicians, because they aren't willing to face the need for commonsense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom.\n\nWe have to show not only with compensation, but with support for the profession overall our regard for those who are educating our kids. And, yes, that means a secretary of education who will support teachers. It also means investing.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm proposing an education access...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: One way we -- one way we can support our teachers is to cancel student loan debt.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWHITAKER: We're going to pass this on to Major.\n\nGARRETT: Candidates, good evening. Candidates, good evening.\n\nWARREN: People across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. This is an issue we need to talk about.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: And that's what my plan would do, through the education...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGARRETT: As we all know, as we all know, the political conversation in our country is interactive, and because of our partner, Twitter, this debate is no different. So I want to put a question from Twitter to you, Senator Klobuchar. This is from Casey Pennington. How will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you. This is one of the first times we've talked about housing. And I put forward an extensive policy.\n\nI think -- when I've looked at this both in my job in local government and in the Senate, one sure way we can make sure that kids get a good start is if they have a roof over their head and a stable place to live.\n\nSo the way you do that is, first of all, taking care of the Section 8 backlog of applicants. There are literally hundreds of thousands of people waiting. And I have found a way to pay for this and a way to make sure that people get off that list and get into housing.\n\nSecondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it.\n\nAnd I want to make clear, given South Carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. It's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing.\n\nSo for me, it's building a coalition. And I actually like to get these things done and to -- the way you do it is by building a coalition between urban and rural so you can pass affordable housing and finally get it done.\n\nWARREN: This is a point...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGARRETT: Senator Warren, hold on one second, because I want to -- I want to...\n\nWARREN: This is a point where we need to talk about race, though.\n\nGARRETT: I understand.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: It is not enough to talk about housing neutrally...\n\nBIDEN: Can we just speak up when we want to? Is that the idea?\n\nWARREN: ... and just be race-blind. It is important to recognize the role that the federal government played for decades and decades in discriminating against African-Americans having an opportunity to buy homes.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat's red-lining.\n\nGARRETT: Mayor...\n\nWARREN: And while Mayor Bloomberg was blaming the housing crash of 2008 on African-Americans and on Latinos, in fact, I was out there fighting for a consumer agency to make sure people never get cheated again on their mortgages. We have a -- I have a housing plan, and what it has in it specifically...\n\nGARRETT: Senator Warren, thank you.\n\nWARREN: ... is a piece...\n\nGARRETT: Senator Warren, thank you.\n\nWARREN: ... to deal with the effects of red-lining. We can no longer pretend that everything is race-neutral. We have got to address race consciously, what's happening in this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGARRETT: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. I want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what Senator Warren just said on Twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Yes, she's -- I'm sorry, but, unfortunately, she's misinformed on red-lighting. You can go back and look at the record. I fought against it before '08, the crisis, during '08, and after that. Red-lining is not the problem with the mortgage market, but it was a problem for the communities where it was done, and we stopped that.\n\nLet me also say, because just -- since I have the floor for a second, that I really am surprised that all of these -- my fellow contestants up here, I guess, would be the right word for it...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... given nobody pays attention to the clock -- I'm surprised they show up, because I would have thought after I did such a good job in beating them last week, that they'd be a little bit afraid to do that.\n\n(AUDIENCE BOOS)\n\nBut let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in New York City. And I listened to them. They're in Congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. But if you change something like the president, they would. No, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done.\n\nI did it in New York City. I got the Republican State Senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country. You can work across the aisle. You just have to know how to deal with people.\n\nGARRETT: Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much. Back to you, Bill.\n\nWHITAKER: Vice President Biden, black men earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by white men, are about twice as likely to be unemployed, five times more likely to be incarcerated, conditions that ripple across black families and have endured during both Democratic and Republican administrations. How do you convince black voters that you can change years of inequities?\n\nBIDEN: Two ways. Number one, my entire life I've been involved with the black community. I was a public defender.\n\nI worked in the projects, I came along, and the first thing I did as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, extended the Voting Rights Act eventually for 25 years. And I have been deeply involved. And my first effort I had as a councilman was doing away with red-lining in the county.\n\nThe way we do this, we've got to help them create wealth, and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs, are as successful as any other group of people in the country. We go from 1.5 billion to $3 billion, taking $30 billion off the sidelines. That's how you create wealth.\n\nSecondly, I provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $15,000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. Thirdly, I go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. They're being bought out. You cannot find a place to live.\n\nAnd thirdly, I make sure that with regard to housing, we allow people -- look, right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white, the same exact house. We've got to deal with the institutional racism.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\nBIDEN: I note how you cut me off all the time but I'm not going to be quiet anymore, OK?\n\nWHITAKER: Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: Every single policy area in the United States has a gigantic subtext of race. We're talking about education. We're talking about criminal justice. We're talking about housing. We're talking about loans. I started a bank to basically correct the injustice in the financial services industry. Basically, to make loans to black-owned, Latino-owned, and women-owned businesses. We've supported over 8,000 affordable housing units.\n\nBut more than that, I believe I'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTEYER: Something happened. We should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400-plus years in America of African-Americans, of systematic legal injustice, discrimination, and cruelty, but also of 400-plus years of contribution in terms of building the United States of America and leading the United States of America from a moral standpoint.\n\nWHITAKER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, next question, new topic, new topic. Senator Klobuchar...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... for this whole campaign, I don't know where you got the impression...\n\nBRENNAN: If you could honor the rules of the debate, thank you.\n\nSenator Klobuchar, I'd like to change topics and ask you, rural areas have populations who are older, sicker, and poorer than non-rural communities. And they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. Expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to. So how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: People aren't always aware, I know you are in South Carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. So the answer is one size doesn't fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. And actually, I am leading -- the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered.\n\nThe other issue is we don't have enough personnel. And so that's where we get to this education plan.. And I don't want agree with some of my colleagues here about putting hard-earned taxpayer money into rich kids going to college. What I think we need to do instead is look at what our needs are in our economy.\n\nWe're going to have a million openings for home health care workers, particularly in rural areas, that we don't know how to fill. We're going to have over 100,000 openings for nursing assistants. We're not going to have a shortage of sports marketing degrees. We're going to have a shortage of plumbers and nurses.\n\nSo putting incentives in place with how we do loan payback, making one- and two-year degrees free, and then of course creating loan payback programs if people will go, especially medical students, into rural areas.\n\nFinal thing is comprehensive immigration reform. I have passed...\n\nBRENNAN: Senator, time.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. We need to expand that.\n\nBRENNAN: Mayor Buttigieg, the floor is yours, would you like -- same question.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Yes, so, when I was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city. Now the gap is the biggest it has been in a generation, and that is particularly affecting black rural families in places like South Carolina. We're seeing hospital closures right and left. And we're seeing them, in particular, in states where Medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression.\n\nSee, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. And that harms everyone.\n\nBRENNAN: You're out of time, sir.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: It's why in my Frederick Douglass plan for comprehensively dealing with these issues, part of the core of it is a 21st Century Voting Rights Act.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: Yes, I'm very proud working with Congressman Jim Clyburn, South Carolina, that we increased funding for the Community Health Center Program by $11 billion as part of the Affordable Care Act, which now provides for 9 million Americans access to primary health care, dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs, in that bill.\n\nWe also put $2 billion into a program which would provide debt forgiveness for doctors, nurses, dentists, we have a major dental affordable crisis in this country, to make sure that they are practicing in underserved areas.\n\nThe advantage of a Medicare for All health care program, because it's not driven by profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies, we will have health care for all people in all parts of this country.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: But in order for any of that to happen it has to pass. And we're talking about a plan that...\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you. Next topic. Gayle?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... even goes beyond even what they do...\n\nKING: I'm sorry, we're going to go to Mayor Bloomberg. We're going to change topics.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, as mayor of New York, you declared war on obesity, you banned trans-fats from restaurants and you tried to do the same thing with large surgary drinks. So if you become president, will you push those policies on the national level as well?\n\nBLOOMBERG: Well, I think what's right for New York City isn't necessarily right for all the other cities, otherwise you would have a naked cowboy in every city. So let's get serious here.\n\nBut I do think it's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. The -- we are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that. But just a look what happened with smoking.\n\nWe did ban smoking in New York City in public places, restaurants, offices, and that sort of thing. And it has spread across America, across Europe, across Latin America, even into places in the Middle East and into the Far East. It has saved an enormous number of lives.\n\nSo it just goes to show, if you have good public health, then you can do things. And one of the great problems today, you read about the virus, what's really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago. So there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLOOMBERG: And he has defunded -- he had defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing. As you see, the stock market is falling apart because people are really worried and they should be.\n\nKING: We're going to talk about that.\n\nBLOOMBERG: We don't have anybody to respond. I'm sorry.\n\nKING: We're going to talk about that in our next segment. Before I leave you, are New Yorkers living longer because of your policies?\n\nBLOOMBERG: There's no question about that.\n\nKING: All right.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Before I left, life expectancy in New York City had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that, when I left, it was three years greater than the national average.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right. Vice President Biden, please. Vice President Biden.\n\nBIDEN: Look, one of the things we have to do, we have a thing in the Defense Department called DARPA, a special operation thing to find out all the things we have to deal to make us safer. They came up with the internet, I mean, they came up with the internet, they came up with the whole idea of stealth technology.\n\nI'm going to do the same thing at the National Institute of Health. We're going to focus at least $50 billion over the first five years on -- focusing on obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and cancer. And we're going to make that investment because no one else is willing to make that investment.\n\nWe can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. The American people support it. Even Republicans will support it. We have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKING: All right, Senator (sic) Biden, thank you.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Klobuchar, Senator Sanders wants to legalize marijuana on day one of his presidency...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nO'DONNELL: ... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. As a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, I want to do that, too. And I also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. I think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs.\n\nI think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. And it's not necessarily because of marijuana. It is because of things like opioids and the like. And that's why one of the first plans I put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs.\n\nAnd the way you do that is with drug courts. The way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the White House so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the Justice Department, and while getting their advice.\n\nKING: All right, thank you, Senator Klobuchar.\n\nSANDERS: Norah, can I respond?\n\nKING: Mayor Bloomberg...\n\nBIDEN: Can I respond to that, as well?\n\nSANDERS: Can I respond? I was mentioned...\n\nKING: I'd like to get your thoughts on this, because you have called marijuana another addictive drug that we've never done research on.\n\nBLOOMBERG: Look, the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNumber two, we're not going to take it away from states that have already done it.\n\nBut, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. They say go very slowly. They haven't done enough research. And the evidence so far is worrisome, before we get all our kids, particularly kids in their late teens, boys even more than girls, where this may be damaging their brains.\n\nUntil we know the science, it's just nonsensical to push ahead. But the cat's out of the bag. So some states have it, you're not going to take it away. Get rid of the -- decriminalize the possession.\n\nKING: All right, thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders, you were name checked.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you. All right, look, you're right. We have a criminal justice system today that is not only broken, it is racist, got more people in jail than any other country on Earth, including China. And one of the reasons for that is a horrific war on drugs.\n\nSo I do believe that, on day one, we will change the Federal Controlled Substance Act, which, if you can believe it, now equates heroin with marijuana. That's insane. We're going to take marijuana out of that and effectively legalize marijuana in every state in the country.\n\nWhat we are also going to do is move to expunge the records of those people who were arrested for possession of marijuana.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I'll tell you what else we're going to do. We're going to provide help to the African-American, Latino, Native American community to start businesses to sell legal marijuana, rather than let a few corporations control the legalized marijuana market.\n\nKING: All right, Senator Sanders, thank you...\n\nBIDEN: I wrote the drug court bill.\n\nKING: We passed the halfway mark.\n\nBIDEN: Can I respond to this? I wrote the -- I wrote the bill that set up drug courts.\n\nKING: All right. Thank you, Vice President Biden. We will get back to you.\n\nThe CBS News Democratic presidential debate will continue right after the break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nO'DONNELL: Welcome back, the CBS News Democratic debate. Each of you is campaigning for the role as commander-in-chief, where you will command 1.3 million U.S. troops and be responsible for protecting America's national security. There are also 53,000 here in South Carolina.\n\nYou said, Senator Warren, you said you wanted to bring home all troops from the Middle East and then you walked that back to say you want to bring home combat troops.\n\nWARREN: I do.\n\nO'DONNELL: How does that protect America's national security?\n\nWARREN: Look, a president's job, first job, is to keep America safe, and an important part of that is to have a strong military. All three of my brothers served in the military, and I understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line.\n\nThat means that we have a sacred responsibility to them, and that is not to use our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We are not winning in Afghanistan. We are not winning in the Middle East.\n\nWhat we need to do is we need to use all of the tools in our toolbox. We need a strong military. We also need a strong State Department. Those are our eyes and ears on the ground. They are our frontlines in diplomacy.\n\nWe need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy, and we need strong alliances. We need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm. And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators. We need not to cut and run on our allies.\n\nAnd we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators.\n\nWe need not to cut and run on our allies. We need an approach that keeps us safe by using all of the tools in a measured way.\n\nO'DONNELL: Mayor Bloomberg, voters have not heard much about your foreign policy views. Would you pull all combat troops out of the Middle East?\n\nBLOOMBERG: No. You want to cut it back as much as you can, but I think, if we learned something from 9/11, people plan things overseas and execute them here. We have to be able to stop terrorism. And there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible.\n\nWe shouldn't be fighting wars that we can't win. We should go to war only as a last resort. Nobody argues with that.\n\nBut this is a dangerous world. And if we haven't learnt that after 9/11, I don't know what's going to teach us what to. This -- we have to do something, and I think the budget that we -- the things that I've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time, and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last, a common mistake that they're not making now.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nBLOOMBERG: They're doing a good job.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nGayle?\n\nKING: Mayor Buttigieg, I'd like to go to you as the only veteran on stage. Can you weigh in on this?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, the first time I ever set foot in South Carolina, it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near Fort Jackson. And that was to get ready to go to Afghanistan, where I saw that one of the things that kept me safe, just as sure as my body armor, was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word. Our allies and our adversaries knew it.\n\nThe president has torn that to shreds. And so the first thing we've got to do is restore the credibility of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe second thing we've got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities -- and I guess I disagree with the mayor; I don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather, because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world. But we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground.\n\nBut what good is that if you have a president who won't listen to them?\n\nRight now, some of the biggest threats that we face are not only things like counter-terrorism but issues like global health security and the Coronavirus, that rely on the ability to listen to scientists...\n\nKING: Time, Mr. Mayor.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... listen to your own intelligence and coordinate with an international community that this president has alienated because his idea of a security strategy is a big wall.\n\nKING: I know it goes fast...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... but a minute-fifteen is really a long time.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo we'd ask respectfully if you would all please try to keep to the time.\n\nBIDEN: Good idea.\n\nKING: Senator Klobuchar -- good idea, right, Mr. Vice President?\n\nSenator Klobuchar, today -- as we were coming over here today...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI promise, Mr. Vice President, we are going to get to you today. I promise.\n\nBIDEN: You keep promising me that, but you haven't done it yet.\n\nKING: I've never broken a promise.\n\nBIDEN: Well, let's get to it.\n\nKING: Senator Klobuchar...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Why don't you let me answer, OK?\n\nKING: There was breaking news from the CDC about the Coronavirus. And so far there have been 2,700 deaths globally, and so far in this country there have been no deaths. But the CDC says this. It's not a matter of if the virus will spread here but when.\n\nThe question to you is this, would you close the borders to Americans who have been exposed to the Coronavirus in order to prevent an outbreak here in this country?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, what we have to do is make sure that we have treatment for those Americans and that they are in a quarantine situation. We don't want to expose people, but we want to give them help.\n\nAnd I would agree, when Mayor Bloomberg said that this president has not invested like he should have in his budget -- he tried to cut back on the CDC; he tried to cut back on the international organization that would coordinate with the rest of the world; he hasn't yet really addressed the nation on this topic, I would do all of that.\n\nBut I want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the American people because this is so serious. I'm not going to give my website right now. I'm going to give the CDC's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. Because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here.\n\nAnd I think the answers, as president, what would I do, I would better coordinate throughout my presidency to be ready for the next pandemic and to prepare for this one.\n\nKING: Thank you, Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I would have better relations with our allies and I would support, because I know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school, in Columbia, South Carolina, or Houston, Texas, and it's investing in education, so we are ready to lead, again, in the world.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator, thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMr. Vice President, we reached a turning point today with the CDC, warning schools that they must prepare that they might have to close, members of the Trump administration saying we don't have enough medical masks if necessary.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nBIDEN: What we did with Ebola -- I was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the United States, saved millions of lives. And what we did, we set up, I helped set up that office in the presidency, in the president's office, on -- on diseases that are pandemic diseases.\n\nWe increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. We should -- and our president today -- and he's wiped all that out. We did it. We stopped it.\n\nAnd the second thing I'd point out to you is that what I would do immediately is restore the funding. He cut the funding for CDC. He tried to cut the funding for NIH. He cut the funding for the entire effort.\n\nAnd here's the deal. I would be on the phone with China and making it clear, we are going to need to be in your country; you have to be open; you have to be clear; we have to know what's going on; we have to be there with you, and insist on it and insist, insist, insist.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nBIDEN: I could get that done. No one up here has ever dealt internationally with any of these world leaders. I'm the only one that has.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator Sanders?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: In the White House today -- in the White House today, we have a self-described great genius -- self-described -- and this great genius has told us that this Coronavirus is going to end in two months. April is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined -- I wish I was kidding; that is what he said.\n\nWhat do we have to do? Whether or not the issue is climate change, which is clearly a global crisis requiring international cooperation, or infectious diseases like Coronavirus, requiring international cooperation, we have to work and expand the World Health Organization. Obviously, we have to make sure the CDC, the NIH, our infectious departments, are fully funded.\n\nThis is a global problem.\n\nO'DONNELL: Thank you.\n\nSANDERS: We've got to work with countries all the over the world to solve it.\n\nO'DONNELL: Senator, we're going to stay on the topic of foreign affairs. Margaret Brennan?\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you, Norah.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, you've said that President Xi Jinping of China is not a dictator and that he is responsive to his constituents, and that the U.S. must cooperate with Beijing.\n\nHow far does that go? Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure?\n\nBLOOMBERG: No, I would not. And I think the Chinese government has not been open. Their press -- the freedom of press does not exist there. They -- their human rights record is abominable, and we should make a fuss, which we have been doing, I suppose.\n\nBut we -- make no mistake about it, we have to deal with China, if we're ever going to solve the climate crisis. We have to deal with them because our economies are inextricably linked. We would be -- not be able to sell or buy the products that we need.\n\nAnd, in terms of whether he's a dictator, he does serve at the behest of the Politboro, of their group of people, but there's no question he has an enormous amount of power. And he -- but he does play to his constituency. You can negotiate with him. That's exactly what we have to do, make it seem that it's in his interest and in his people's interest to do what we want to do, follow the rules, particularly no stealing of intellectual property; follow the rules in terms of the trade agreements that we have are reciprocal and go equally in both directions.\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you, Mr. Mayor.\n\nVice President Biden?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nVice President Biden, same question to you. Would you allow Chinese firms to build critical U.S. infrastructure?\n\nBIDEN: No, I would not. And I spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had by the time we left office. This is a guy who is -- doesn't have a democratic, with a small D, bone in his body.\n\nThis is a guy who is a thug, who in fact has a million Uighurs in reconstruction camps, meaning concentration camps. This is a guy who you see what's happening right now in -- in Hong Kong, and this is a guy who I was able to convince should join the international agreement at the Paris agreement because, guess what, they need to be involved.\n\nYou can cooperate and you can also dictate exactly what they are, when in fact they said We're going to set up a no-fly zone, that you can't fly through our zone.\n\nHe said, What do you expect me to do, when I was over there.\n\nI said, We're going to fly right through it. We flew B-1 bombers through it. We've got to make it clear. They must play by the rules...\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.\n\nBIDEN: ... period, period, period.\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Warren, same question. Would you allow Chinese firms to build infrastructure?\n\nWARREN: We -- we have to be able to trust our president, because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can't follow every part of that. And that's one of the reasons that we need to see any candidate's taxes.\n\nWe know that Mayor Bloomberg has been doing business with China for a long time, and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes.\n\nHe plans to release them after Super Tuesday. It is not enough to be able to say, just trust me on this. We have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this.\n\nBRENNAN: Was that a yes or no?\n\nWARREN: No, I would not.\n\nBRENNAN: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond?\n\nBLOOMBERG: I got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago, we have been working on our tax returns, I've said they will be out. We probably have another couple of weeks left to go. We're doing it as fast we can. We've complied with every single requirement for disclosure. And when I was mayor of New York, we had our tax returns out twelve years in a row and we will do that in the White House.\n\nWARREN: No, actually...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: My tax return is online light now.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: I released my tax returns.\n\nWARREN: Yes.\n\nSTEYER: That was easy to do. But I want to say something about foreign policy...\n\nBIDEN: How many years?\n\nSTEYER: Ten years.\n\nI want to say something about foreign policy, which is this, we keep acting as if we're in the 20th Century or the 19th Century. If you look at the biggest threats to the United States, we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the United States. We're talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need U.S. leadership for countries around the world.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Trump's policy of us going it alone, of America first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. The biggest threat to America right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. And it's time for us to deal with it that way. Every single foreign policy issue is about American leadership and coalition.\n\nBRENNAN: New topic. Senator Sanders.\n\nSANDERS: Can I say one word on...\n\nBRENNAN: You praised -- it's in the same theme, sir. You've praised the Chinese Communist Party for lifting more people out of extreme poverty than any other country. You also have a track record of expressing sympathy for socialist governments in Cuba and in Nicaragua. Can Americans trust that a democratic socialist president will not give authoritarians a free pass?\n\nSANDERS: I have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg just said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have got a real dictatorship there. Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba.\n\nWhat I said is what Barack Obama said in terms of Cuba, that Cuba made progress on education. Yes, I think...\n\n(BOOING)\n\nSANDERS: Really? Really? Literacy programs are bad?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Yes, because there's no comparing those two commentaries (ph).\n\nSANDERS: What Barack Obama said is they made great progress on education and health care. That was Barack Obama. Occasionally...\n\nBIDEN: I talked to Barack Obama...\n\nSANDERS: Excuse me, occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran. And when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans do something good, you acknowledge that. But you don't have to trade love letters with them.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: Mr. Vice President.\n\nBIDEN: Barack Obama was abroad, he was in a town meeting, he did not in any way suggest that there was anything positive about the Cuban government. He acknowledged that they did increase life expectancy. But he went on and condemned the dictatorship. He went on and condemned the people who, in fact, had run that committee.\n\nHe also made sure to make it clear -- and by the way, I called to make sure that I was prepared to -- I never say (INAUDIBLE) my private conversations with him, but the fact of the matter is he, in fact, does not, did not, has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: This man said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did.\n\nSANDERS: That is untrue, categorically untrue.\n\nBIDEN: What did you tell them?\n\nSANDERS: I have condemned authoritarianism, whether it is the people in Saudi Arabia that the United States government...\n\nBIDEN: How about Cuba or Nicaragua?\n\nSANDERS: ... has loved for years. Cuba, Nicaragua, authoritarianism of any stripe is bad.\n\nBIDEN: Period.\n\nSANDERS: But that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good. That's what Barack Obama said.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Margaret, Margaret, could I...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: The only way we're going to restore...\n\nBRENNAN: Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... American credibility, the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency. And I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump, with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s, and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. This is about 2020. We are not going to survive or succeed, and we're certainly not going to win by reliving the Cold War. And we're not going to win these critical, critical House and Senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the Democratic Party is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime. We've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Sanders, your response.\n\nSANDERS: Let us be clear, do we think health care for all, Pete, is some kind of radical communist idea?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, you brought this up, let's talk about that.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: Do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I'm happy to respond to the question because this is really important...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: ... do we think building the millions of units of affordable housing that we need...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: If you're going to ask that rhetorical question, let's...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: ... do we think raising taxes on billionaires is a radical idea?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about this. Let's talk about what's radical about that plan.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: Do you think criminal justice reform is a radical idea?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: The things you just named are things...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: Do you think immigration reform? The truth is, Pete...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: One at a time.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: ... the American people support my agenda.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: The way you're talking about doing it is radical by...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSANDERS: That is why I am beating Trump in virtually every poll that is done, and why I will defeat him.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We've got to open this up. Universal health care, for example...\n\nBRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Donald Trump's worst nightmare is having someone that the people in the middle who are tired of the insults and the extremes in our politics have someone to vote for. And I was going to comment on Cuba policy because I actually lead the bill to lift the embargo. I went with Barack Obama when he went to Cuba. And I've seen firsthand how the Cuban are way in front of our -- their leaders.\n\nThey like America. They want to be entrepreneurs. And the way that we embrace them, and not the socialist regime, is by opening up Cuba and starting to do business with them.\n\nBut to get at what we were just talking about, I just think we have a huge choice. Super Tuesday states, one-third of America will vote. Do you want to have someone...\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you, Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... in charge of this ticket -- could I finish, Margaret?\n\nBRENNAN: Well, you're out of time. Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: You want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward $60 trillion in spending, three times the American economy.\n\nBRENNAN: Bill Whitaker?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I don't think we do. I think that we can get all those bold progressive things done without having someone that is so alienating that we're going to turn off the voters that we need to bring with us.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBRENNAN: You have to allow the senator to respond. Senator Sanders.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: I want to respond to the question that Senator Sanders...\n\nSANDERS: Can I respond? Amy used the word alienating. Hey, Amy, my favorability nationally I believe are the highest up here, as a matter of fact.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSANDERS: All right. But the point is -- the point is the way we are going to beat Trump, which is what everybody up here wants, is we need a campaign of energy and excitement. We need to have the largest voter turnout in the history of the United States. We need to bring working people back in to the Democratic Party. We need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before. That is what our campaign is about.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBRENNAN: Bill Whitaker has the floor.\n\nWHITAKER: Vice President Biden.\n\nBIDEN: Yes.\n\nWHITAKER: The bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report concluded Russia interfered in our last presidential election, and the Obama administration failed to respond forcefully. U.S. intelligence says Russia is at it again. If it is proven that Russia has interfered in the 2020 elections, would you, as president, launch a retaliatory cyber attack?\n\nBIDEN: I would make them pay for it, and I would make them pay for it economically. They are engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our elections. They were engaged, and when we -- when, in fact, we were -- the last election in 2016 against Hillary, they were. There's no question.\n\nThis man stood before the whole world, turned to the Russian leader and said, why in God's name would this man ever interfere in our elections? Give me a break. Seventeen intelligence agencies said he did. When we got the information, we went to the committee in the Senate that's responsible for knowing these issues and dealing with them.\n\nWe went to Mitch McConnell and said join us and point out what is happening here. He said, no, we want no part of it. And if we had moved -- we didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over. And, so, the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more, theoretically that's true, but the fact of the matter is we didn't have the information until the end. And so, look, we, in fact, should be imposing sanctions on Russia now for their interference.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWHITAKER: Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: Look, 21st Century warfare is cyber warfare. What we're having is an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now. The question you have to ask is, where is the commander-in-chief? And let me say this...\n\nBIDEN: We don't have one.\n\nSTEYER: ... this isn't news, what Vice President Biden said is true, he did stand next to Vladimir Putin. There was a hostile, foreign attack on our election last time and the president sided with the hostile foreign power. That's why I started Need to Impeach.\n\nThat's what we have to do. We have to oppose a president who sides with a hostile foreign power that commits cyber warfare against the United States of America. That's where we are. Where are all these patriotic Republicans who wave the flag, but when we're actually under attack, they side with our enemies? It's outrageous.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat's why he should have been impeached. They covered it up. And I was years before these people. There's something wrong here. We're under attack, and they're not doing a darn thing about it.\n\nGARRETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Look, the way to deter a cyber attack...\n\nGARRETT: Senator Sanders -- no, Senator Sanders, I have a question for you, sir. You're the frontrunner in this race. You're on the ballot in South Carolina. Mayor Bloomberg, you'll understand that preamble in just a second.\n\nIf elected, Senator Sanders, you would be America's first Jewish president. You recently called a very prominent, well-known American Israel lobby a platform for, quote, bigotry. What would you say to American Jews who might be concerned you're not, from their perspective, supportive enough of Israel? And specifically, sir, would you move the U.S. embassy back to Tel Aviv?\n\nSANDERS: Let me just -- the answer is, it's something that we would take into consideration.\n\nGARRETT: Which would...\n\nSANDERS: But here -- excuse me. But here is the point. I am very proud of being Jewish. I actually lived in Israel for some months. But what I happen to believe is that,
DENVER -- Christopher Watts, who is charged with killing his family and dumping their bodies at an oil worksite, taped a video presentation six years ago about saving or abandoning relationships. A YouTube video posted in April 2012 shows Watts giving a PowerPoint presentation that he titled, Communication Speech, Relationship Deterioration and Repair.\n\nHe opened the presentation by saying it is for a course he was taking. He then speaks of infidelity — possibly with someone at work — as a reason that relationships fail.\n\nPolice in suburban Denver say Watts was having an affair with a co-worker before he was arrested last week in the slayings of his wife, Shanann Watts, and their two young daughters, Bella, 3, and Celeste, 4. He has not entered a plea to murder and other felony charges.\n\nAccording to court documents, Watts told police in Frederick, a Colorado community in the oil and gas fields north of Denver, that he told his wife on August 13 that he wanted to separate. A police investigation determined that Watts was actively involved in an affair with a co-worker, the documents state.\n\nWatts worked at Anadarko Petroleum and was fired on August 15, the day he was arrested. He told investigators that he killed his wife but claimed that she had strangled their two daughters after he told her he wanted to separate.\n\nIn the 2012 video posted online about six months before the couple wed, Watts said he was in suburban Broomfield, where the Watts family once lived.\n\nSometimes you find your partner no longer attractive physically or in their personality, he said in the presentation. When you are in a relationship you have to show desire, lust toward your partner. Sometimes when you get married that the lust and the desire kind of fall by the wayside a little bit.\n\nAt another point, Watts said: Even at the job, you might meet a new person and (it) could strengthen into something else and could weaken the bond you have with the partner you have.\n\nAnd you feel that you might be better with someone else that you've met, he declared. You think that you can no longer do — that your partner is someone that you can't be with.\n\nKrista Henery, a spokeswoman for the Weld County district attorney's office, declined comment about the video Wednesday. Watts' public defender, James Merson, did not immediately return a phone message.\n\nWatts in the video cites various experts in recommending steps to strengthen and salvage relationships, including listening attentively, thinking before speaking, and openly expressing support and affection.\n\nSometimes when you have children and your relationship starts to deteriorate a child could help repair it, he said.\n\nHe also listed three questions to ask when a relationship is in jeopardy:\n\nDo I have the desire to keep this relationship going? Do I have a moral obligation to stay in this relationship? Or is it a necessity for me to stay in this relationship?\n\nAs Watts ended the presentation, he received a round of applause from two women and two men seated on a sofa across the room. One of the women said, Good job.\n\nShanann Watts is not seen in the video. Under a last name she had from an earlier marriage, Shanann King posted a comment to the video that said: Great job Christopher! Good information!\n\nNorth Carolina court records show she divorced around 2009, several years before she and Christopher Watts married.\n\nWatts was charged this week with first-degree murder and other felony counts. Shanann's body was discovered in a shallow grave about 40 miles from the family's Frederick home, and the two girls' bodies were recovered from nearby oil tanks, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.\n\nOn Tuesday, Christopher Watts appeared in court for an arraignment. Shanann Watts' father, Frank Rzucek Sr., cried and shook visibly as District Judge Marcelo Kopcow read the formal charges.\n\nShanann's brother, Frank Rzucek Jr., rubbed his father's shoulders and glared unflinchingly at his brother-in-law. A bailiff stood between them.\n\nWatts, handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, didn't show emotion. He said Yes, sir, when the judge asked if he understood the murder and other felony charges against him and the penalties they carry, including the death penalty. Prosecutors have not yet decided whether to seek death.\n\nWatts waived his right to have a preliminary hearing within 35 days. A judge set a status hearing for November 19.
After reportedly being interrupted several times during a campaign stop in Texas, presidential contender Pete Buttigieg got some support from one of his 2020 challengers: Beto O'Rourke. The former Texas Congressman tweeted in support of Buttigieg Friday night after the South Bend, Indiana, mayor was interrupted by protesters during a speech at the Dallas County Democratic Party dinner.\n\nAccording to CNN reporter DJ Judd, one demonstrator yelled, Repent! and another said, Marriage is between a man and a woman!\n\nTexans don't stand for this kind of homophobia and hatred, O'Rourke wrote Friday, tweeting a video of a demonstrator shouting during Buttigieg's event.\n\nMayor Pete, we are grateful you came to Texas and hope to see you and Chasten back again soon, O'Rourke added.\n\nTexans don't stand for this kind of homophobia and hatred. Mayor Pete, we are grateful you came to Texas and hope to see you and Chasten back again soon. https://t.co/IhRDtIBREb — Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) May 4, 2019\n\nThe message was retweeted more than 4,000 times and had over 30,000 likes by Saturday morning, with many followers calling O'Rourke classy for reaching out to his competition in a moment of sincerity on the campaign trail.\n\nProtests have become somewhat of a common occurrence at Buttigieg's campaign stops. During a two-day swing through Iowa last month, Buttigieg was interrupted by protesters at two events with Iowa Democrats, with demonstrators questioning the openly-gay mayor's Episcopalian faith.\n\nButtigieg, meanwhile, has not been shy about addressing his sexuality or his devout faith on the campaign trail. The mayor has called marriage equality a moral issue, and said his marriage of two years to his husband Chasten has made him a better human being and moved him closer to God.
South Bend, Indiana Mayor and presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg opens up about his thoughts on the presidency, his marriage and more, in a wide-ranging interview with John Dickerson for CBS Sunday Morning, to be broadcast April 21.\n\nButtigieg, 37, is a veteran of the Afghanistan war and is one of many vying for the Democratic nomination for president. If elected, he would be America's youngest president ever.\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., with CBS News' John Dickerson. CBS News\n\nOne of his missions, he has said, is to improve the symbolism of the office. Because the presidency is also a moral office, Buttigieg tells Dickerson, co-host of CBS This Morning. It calls this nation to its highest values. And it sets the tone for the story that we tell ourselves. Narrative is a very powerful thing, and we need to make sure that everybody in America understands where they fit in this country's story.\n\nIn terms of experience for the job, Buttigieg says one of the toughest decisions he's had to make was a moment in Afghanistan when he needed to make a split-second decision whether to abandon a vehicle that might be ready to explode and risk being killed, or continue on with his mission.\n\nDickerson visits South Bend with Buttigieg to see his home, and the city he runs. Dickerson also talks with Buttigieg's husband, Chasten Buttigieg, a junior-high schoolteacher.\n\nDo you feel your marriage is campaigning as well, because you're doing something that is new in American politics? Dickerson asks Chasten Buttigieg.\n\nI think I'd argue I don't have to answer for it, Chasten replies. I mean, we passed marriage equality. I don't think I have to answer for my marriage anymore. But I do enjoy going out there with Pete and showing people that, you know, gay marriage is just like a straight marriage.\n\nSunday Morning, hosted by Jane Pauley, broadcasts on CBS Sundays beginning at 9 a.m. ET.

Jada Pinkett Smith is revealing secrets from her pre-fame past.\n\nThe Girls Trip star recently visited the Sway in the Morning show on SiriusXM, where she explained the origins of her friendship with late rapper Tupac Shakur.\n\nIt's kind of hard because I haven't really told the whole story, she said. One of the things that's very interesting that I've never really said before is that when I first met Pac, I was a drug dealer.\n\nThat's how we started, she said. Then as I was coming out, something very bad happened to me. As I was coming out of the life, he was coming more into the life.\n\nPinkett Smith also revealed that when Shakus was killed in 1996, they hadn't been speaking because of an argument.\n\nPac and I's relationship was about survival, she said. That's how it started. I know that most people want to always connect it in this romance thing, and that's just because they don't have the story. It was based in survival -- how we held each other down -- and when you have somebody that has your back when you feel like you're nothing, that's everything. There's a lot of components to our story that we've never shared for a very specific reason. I just decided that this one little piece was important to share finally because it gives more insight to who we were. It was about survival and it's always been about survival between us.\n\nLast month, Smith took to Twitter to express her frustrations about the Shakur biopic, All Eyez on Me.\n\nForgive me... my relationship to Pac is too precious to me for the scenes in All Eyez On Me to stand as truth. — Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017\n\nPac never read me that poem. I didn't know that poem existed until it was printed in his book. — Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017\n\nPac never said goodbye to me before leaving for LA. He had to leave abruptly and it wasn't to pursue his career. — Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017\n\nI've never been to any of Pac's shows by his request. We never had an argument backstage. — Jada Pinkett Smith (@jadapsmith) June 16, 2017
Pete Buttigieg likes to start off his stump speech by asking the crowd to envision the day when the sun comes up and Donald Trump is no longer president. The first potentially concrete development on this front takes place in two weeks, when Iowans go to caucus in the first Democratic voting contest on February 3.\n\nHe has been hitting the trail hard, reminding Iowa caucus goers that it is decision time.\n\nFour presidential contenders — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet — will be off the trail for most days over at least the next two weeks because they're sitting senators who are required to be present for President Trump's Senate impeachment trial. Though the trial has not yet begun, their obligations in Washington have already meant that Buttigieg has had Iowa to himself for a couple of days after the presidential debate last week.\n\nIn that time, he's been giving some thought to his closing argument, about why I'll be the right nominee to take on and defeat Donald Trump. He's leaning into moderation, presenting himself as an alternative to progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are both polling strongly in Iowa. Where they focus on ideological purity, he's explaining why I'm focused on bringing together, not just our party but our country when the time comes.\n\nHis stump speech revolves largely around faith, freedom and democracy. He's also consistent about stressing that his campaign aims to build a sense of belonging, and he has a collection of anecdotes about how his campaign has emphasized that idea to its supporters.\n\nA campaign aide told CBS News that the former South Bend mayor will continue to emphasize his belief in the importance of building a broad coalition. He often mentions his campaign is reaching out to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, moderates and future former Republicans.\n\nThe latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed that Buttigieg is third among likely Democratic caucus goers behind Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The poll showed that 40% of Democrats in Iowa have decided who they will support, compared to 45% who said they can be persuaded to support another candidate.\n\nAt multiple campaign stops in Iowa, Buttigieg has acknowledged Iowa has a thumb on the scale in selecting the party's nominee — its winner has been the Democratic nominee 7 out of 10 times — but he also talks about how Iowa has been a leader in political and social issues that are personal to him.\n\nIowa has a way of surprising America and leading it forward — 2008, Iowa made it possible for a candidate whose very name made his campaign extremely improbable to arrive on the scene as a front running presidential candidate and eventually president of the United States, Buttigieg said at a town hall in Mason City, of Barack Obama.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Iowa led the way in making it possible for a marriage like mine to exist, he noted. Iowa has recognized same-sex marriages since 2009.\n\nMaryland Congressman Anthony Brown, who is a national campaign co-chair and the first Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) member to endorse Buttigieg, told CBS News in an interview that Buttigieg needs to convey his practical solutions to governing, his mayoral record, his military service and his faith in the final weeks to the caucus to convince undecided caucus goers.\n\nI think sharing his experiences, framing it in the values that we all share, demonstrating a strategic approach to our issues — I think that will set him apart from the other candidates, Brown added.\n\nBut some undecided voters who attended his events his past week still harbor misgivings about the 38-year-old candidate's experience.\n\nI think he needs to prove, other than say that 'it doesn't matter,' that he has the experience to lead, said Runal A. Patel, a 20-year-old college student who also volunteered for New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign. I really hate that whenever he gets asked that question, he sort of just deflects and says, 'Well, you know the last president didn't have any experience.' I always think well, look how that presidency is going. You know, I don't think that that's a good answer.\n\nClaire Schaefer, a 21-year-old college student whose first choice is Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, also seems dubious that he has the experience to lead — or at least remains unconvinced by the argument he sometimes makes that experience doesn't matter so much. On the debate stage, he has argued that the decades of experience of his competitors have led the country nowhere.\n\nI guess in some ways his inexperience like makes me a little doubtful, and that's probably the only thing —and maybe his performance with voters of color, Schaefer said.\n\nOn the ground, national caucus director Travis Brock is planning to stay in Iowa until Caucus Day. While he usually splits his time between Nevada, which also holds a caucus, and Iowa, Brock recently embarked on a 19-stop tour around the state training volunteers and precinct captains across Iowa.\n\nWhile Buttigieg held five events last Thursday, Brock spent nearly two hours training over 250 people in Polk County, the largest in the state. It's part of a broader effort to teach volunteers and caucus goers the delegate math and persuasion methods in order to convince undecided caucus goers.\n\nButtigieg is keenly aware that he'll need a strong finish in Iowa in order to build momentum heading into the other nominating contests.\n\nIt continues to be the case that Iowa is very important because it's our opportunity to demonstrate our strength for a lot of voters who I think are very pragmatic in places like South Carolina and Nevada, who above all, want to see a candidate who can win, Buttigieg told reporters at a campaign stop in Nevada on January 11.
Actress Meagan Good met her filmmaker husband, DeVon Franklin, on set filming for the movie, Jumping the Broom.\n\nThe couple is out with a new book called, The Wait: A Powerful Practice for Finding Love of Your Life and the Life You Love, which explains why saving sex for marriage is the key to success. The couple committed to celibacy until they tied the knot in 2012.\n\nFranklin, who is also a preacher, said his decision to remain celibate starting ten years before marriage was inspired by his spiritual practice.\n\nI didn't want to live two lives. At the time I wasn't practicing celibacy, but I was still talking about it, and I said, 'You know, I have to be the man that God called me to be,' and part of that was taking this vow and waiting until marriage and when I stared doing that it gave me discipline that helped me in every other area of my life, Franklin told CBS This Morning Monday.\n\nThe couple said the wait was important because sex can cloud people's judgment when dating.\n\nWhen you take that out of the equation, you actually get to know the person across the board in every other way except the physical which, which comes later, Good said.\n\nGood said she decided to take the vow of celibacy after filming Jumping the Broom because she felt that she had hit rock bottom emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIt was in that prayer time that I came to the conclusion that I needed to be celibate, I needed to do something different than what I had been doing all the years before, Good said. I decided this is what I need to do for me, because I need to heal and I need to focus on myself and I need to advance myself in every area of my life without the distraction of feeling... that I need this man.\n\nThe couple also drew a distinction between abstinence, and celibacy.\n\nAbstinence is just, 'Hey I'm not doing it.' And we say, well, sometimes you can be abstinent because you don't have options, Good said. But we define celibacy as abstaining from sex because there's a higher purpose and a higher calling and we believe that it is specifically related to marriage.
Jason Lee is no longer a practicing Scientologist.\n\nThe 46-year-old actor and his family moved to Denton, Texas, last year, and he recently quietly shared the news with local outlet, The Dentonite. When asked what businesses he owns in Denton, Lee took the opportunity to clear up rumors about himself.\n\nIf [my wife] Ceren and I had an idea for a business, it certainly wouldn't happen at the cost of someone else's, Lee said. And being that we don't practice Scientology, and that we aren't particularly interested in opening religious centers in general, we have no plans to open a Scientology center.\n\nQuite a few rumors about me/us floating around but none of it's true, he continued. We're not here to buy up or change or take over Denton, put some kind of personal stamp on it. We're just here like anyone else who wants to be a part of Denton's very cool creative community, and to be involved and perhaps help where we can.\n\nLee and wife Ceren Alkac married in 2008 and have two children together -- 9-year-old Casper and 4-year-old Sonny. Lee also has a son with his ex, Beth Riesgraf, 12-year-old Pilot Inspektor.\n\nThe former My Name Is Earl actor had been practicing Scientology since the '90s. Last June, Lee's ex-wife, Carmen Llywelyn, wrote an essay for the now defunct Gawker blaming the controversial religion for their split. Lee and Llywelyn married in 1995, and divorced in 2001.\n\nWhen I think back, I believe a part of me knew if I didn't accept Scientology the marriage would be over before it even started, Llywelyn wrote. That may sound somewhat superficial and at that age, maybe it was. But in truth, regardless of how different I feel about Jason and Scientology today, I was very much in love with the guy and wanted our marriage to work. I did what I thought was right.\n\nLee isn't the only celeb who has parted ways with the Church of Scientology. Lisa Marie Presley left the religion in 2012, as did Crash director Paul Haggis, in 2009.\n\nActress Leah Remini, who left the Church in 2013 after being a member for 36 years, has been the most openly critical of the religion, penning her book,Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology, last November. In June, Tony Ortega, who worked on the HBO documentary Going Clear, told ET the former King of Queens star is working on a new show spotlighting Scientology and its effects on family life.\n\nThe Church has previously denied all of Remini's allegations and released a statement claiming that bitterness and anger are common threads in her life.\n\nLeah Remini knows the truth she conveniently rewrites in her revisionist history, the statement reads in part. The real story is that she desperately tried to remain a Scientologist in 2013, knowing full well she was on the verge of being expelled for refusing to abide by the high level of ethics and decency Scientologists are expected to maintain.
Los Angeles -- A federal judge in California ruled Thursday that a twin son of a gay married couple has been an American citizen since birth, handing a defeat to the U.S. government, which had only granted the status to his brother. The State Department was wrong to deny citizenship to 2-year-old Ethan Dvash-Banks because U.S. law does not require a child to show a biological relationship with their parents if their parents were married at the time of their birth, District Judge John F. Walter found.\n\nA lawsuit filed by the boys' parents, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, sought the same rights for Ethan that his brother, Aiden, has as a citizen.\n\nEach boy was conceived with donor eggs and the sperm from a different father — one an American, the other an Israeli citizen — but born by the same surrogate mother minutes apart.\n\nElad Dvash-Banks, left, and his partner, Andrew, pose for photos with their twin sons, Ethan, center right, and Aiden in their apartment Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2018, in Los Angeles. AP\n\nThe government had only granted citizenship to Aiden, who DNA tests showed was the biological son of Andrew, a U.S. citizen. Ethan was conceived from the sperm of Elad Dvash-Banks, an Israeli citizen.\n\nThe suit was one of two filed last year by an LGBTQ immigrant rights group that said the State Department is discriminating against same-sex binational couples by denying their children citizenship at birth. The cases filed in Los Angeles and Washington by Immigration Equality said the children of a U.S. citizen who marries abroad are entitled to U.S. citizenship at birth no matter where they are born, even if the other parent is a foreigner. Only the Los Angeles case was decided Thursday.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling. Previously the department pointed to guidance on its website that said there must be a biological connection to a U.S. citizen to become a citizen at birth.\n\nThis family was shocked and appalled and angry when they were told their family wasn't legal, said Aaron Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality. They wanted their twin boys to be treated exactly the same.\n\nMorris said the government wrongly applied a policy for children born out of wedlock to married same-sex couples.\n\nWalter agreed, writing that the State Department statute does not contain language requiring a 'blood relationship between the person and the father' in order for citizenship to be acquired at birth.\n\nThis is justice! We are hopeful that no other family will ever have to go through this again. It's like a giant rock has been removed from our hearts, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks said in a statement provided by Immigration Equality.\n\nAndrew Dvash-Banks was studying in Israel when he met his future husband, Elad, an Israeli citizen. Because they couldn't marry at the time in the U.S. or in Israel, they moved to Canada, where they wed in 2010. The children were born by a surrogate in September 2016.\n\nEverything seemed fine until the couple brought their cranky infants to the American consulate in Toronto a few months later to apply for citizenship and the woman at the counter began asking probing questions they found shocking and humiliating.\n\nThe consular official told them she had discretion to require a DNA test to show who the biological father was of each boy and without those tests neither son would get citizenship. The men knew that Andrew was Aiden's biological father and Elad was Ethan's but they had kept it a secret and hadn't planned on telling anyone.\n\nAfter submitting the DNA test results that proved who fathered each boy, the couple received a large and small envelope from the U.S. on March 2. The big one included Aiden's passport. The other was a letter notifying Andrew that Ethan's application had been denied.\n\nThe family has since moved to Los Angeles to be closer to Andrew Dvash-Banks' family.\n\nThe other case involves two women, one from the U.S., and one from Italy, who met in New York, wed in London and each gave birth to a son. The State Department didn't recognize the couple's marriage, the lawsuit said, and only granted citizenship to the boy whose biological mother was born and raised in the U.S.
ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers backed a bill on Tuesday preventing businesses from discriminating based on race, nationality, religion or sex, after Republicans rejected Democrats' efforts to add gay and transgender people to those protected by the measure.\n\nThe change would catch Georgia up to federal standards set by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Georgia is one of five states without a so-called public accommodation law.\n\nRep. Taylor Bennett, a Brookhaven Democrat, tried to amend the bill to also prevent discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, veteran status or disability. But his proposal was altered by Rep. Beth Beskin, an Atlanta Republican, who eliminated all of Bennett's additions except gender.\n\nAfter Democrats on the committee questioned Beskin about whether she intended to excuse discrimination against other groups, Beskin said local governments can decide to provide protections beyond the proposed bill. Some municipalities, including the city of Atlanta, already have such laws.\n\nIt was what I could do, she said. And I'm certainly not intending to enlarge any discriminatory actions or rights (of) employers.\n\nA number have states have gone beyond the federal law, preventing discrimination based on marital status, sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodation laws.\n\nBennett said he was disappointed that the bill is headed toward a floor vote without protecting more people from discrimination but still called it a significant step.\n\nThis is something that should have been done a long time ago, he said.\n\nThe committee also passed a bill known as the Pastor Protection Act, stating that religious officials aren't required to perform same-sex marriages. Nothing in state or federal law would require them to perform the ceremonies, but lawmakers said the bill would reassure officials concerned by the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nHouse Speaker David Ralston, the chamber's top Republican, supports the Pastor Protection Act.\n\nGeorgia lawmakers have filed at least eight bills to grant a variety of legal exemptions to religious opponents of same-sex marriage. The push has gay-rights advocates in Georgia on guard; around 200 people held a rally opposing the measures Tuesday outside the state Capitol.\n\nBoth bills approved Tuesday now go to the House Rules committee, which determines the daily schedule of bills receiving a full vote on the floor. The bills could receive a vote as soon as Thursday.\n\nJeff Graham, executive director of the gay-rights advocacy group Georgia Equality, said adding more protected groups to the civil rights bill would solve the broader disagreement between those seeking religious exemptions and the LGBT community.\n\nWe can solve this problem this year for everyone, Graham said. It's an opportunity for the legislature as a whole to be on the right side of history.
In this episode of Intelligence Matters, host Michael Morell speaks with Judd Devermont, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior analyst in the intelligence community. Devermont discusses areas of instability on the continent and the areas where the U.S. has an opportunity to pursue national interests. He reviews areas of progress and setbacks in governance and security, and explains why he believes there has been a 'democratization of leadership' in Africa. Devermont also reviews Chinese and Russian investments and operations on the continent, and explains why they each have significant long-term implications for U.S. security.\n\n\n\nDownload, rate and subscribe here: iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher.\n\nINTELLIGENCE MATTERS - JUDD DEVERMONT\n\nCORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELL\n\nPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nJudd, welcome to the show. It's great to have you on Intelligence Matters.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThank you for having me.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo maybe the place to start is a little bit about your career. And I'd be interested in a couple things. One is, your interest in Africa, where did that come from? And then, your interest in C.I.A. and where did that come from and how did you end up there?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYou mean why did someone who grew up in Southern California end up spending a career working in Africa?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\n(LAUGH) Exactly, exactly.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nI love history and in high school, all you can take is U.S. and European. And when I got to college, I just went all over the world: Latin America and Southeast Asia, East Asia. But I took a class on the Arab Revolt, actually, and this seminar class was so incredible, the way in which they talked about how Arab nationalism and agency mixed with geo politics.\n\nAnd so, I kind of knew that's what I wanted, but I still didn't know what the region was. I didn't really want to go in the Middle East. And one day, I didn't go to class, I never miss class, but one day I decided with a friend, we walked around campus and we got in front of a study abroad kiosk.\n\nAnd only two pamphlets jumped at me: Ghana and South Africa. And I don't know, Michael, it was this moment where I could see my entire future. I knew all of those things that I liked in that Arab Spring course or Arab Revolt course were going to be in Africa. I moved to South Africa, I did a year there and I never looked back.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd what was that year in South Africa like?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nIt was incredible. I studied at the University of Cape Town. I traveled all over Southern Africa. I lived in the dorms and have great South African friends. And I just found on the continent, history, I had a professor who said, History lies heavy on the continent's present and future. And so, it was everything that I wanted and it's been incredibly fulfilling, 20 years now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, for those listeners who haven't been to Cape Town, I've been there twice, you are just absolutely surrounded by history.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, it's gorgeous.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt is amazing. And then the C.I.A., how did you end up at the C.I.A.?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThis is kind of a funny story. It actually has a lot to do with a Tom Clancy novel, but not because I related to Jack Ryan. I mean, yeah, he's an analyst, but the guy is on operation almost immediately, right?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nI mean, he's never at his desk. And so, I wanted, as I said, a job, I love history, I wanted a job that had a lot to do with history. And in this one Jack Ryan novel, he's not even in the agency anymore, he's like the national security advisor. And he calls up the Department of State to talk to their senior desk officer for Japan.\n\nAnd the way I remembered this passage, I tried to find it recently and I can't, the senior desk officer in Japan knows everything about history, politics, culture, economics. And I said, I'm going to be a desk officer. That's my goal. Applied for the State Department as an intern, I got in. I was going to be in the Bureau of West African Affairs and just before I left for Washington, my father grabs the intern guide book that I had and says, C.I.A. You should apply to C.I.A. I said, listen, Pops--\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhy did he say that?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nI think he loves the operation. He continues to tell me he could be a great operational officer. He's 77 years old. But he was really fascinated with the lifestyle and he encouraged me to apply. I said, I'm going to be a desk officer, I don't need this. He said, You should apply. So I did. I get to Washington. First day at the Department of State, it's like two hours of paperwork, they say, Come back tomorrow for your first full day. It's September 11th, 2011.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWow.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThat was my first day working for the U.S. Government.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWow.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nAnd I know where you were and I know you were briefing the President and I was just an intern in West Africa, but I felt a sense of privilege that I was there. It was a great experience. And a couple of weeks later the C.I.A. calls and said, We'd like to offer you a grad fellowship.\n\nSo now I'm at a place where C.I.A. seems really interesting, my fantasy desk officer job seems really interesting, I'm very lucky to sort of go to Cote d'Ivoire, work in our embassy for a longer internship and I meet an analyst from INR, State Department's Analytic Wing. She's retired now, but she was phenomenal.\n\nI mean, she wasn't even the senior analyst for this country and she had everyone in the palm of her hands. And that was the moment that I said, I know exactly where I want to go. It's going to\n\nbe an analyst.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. So in laymen's terms, can you tell folks what it's like to be an analyst at C.I.A.?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. You know, there wasn't a day that I didn't have a smile on my face walking in that door. I came in on the weekends and not because I had a task there, but because I had a paper that I really wanted to write, research. But every day you are immersed in all this information about the country or issue that you work.\n\nYou have these great colleagues that you are engaging with. Every morning, there's a 9:00 morning meeting and you sort of report up what's interesting, what's happened, what should we be writing about, what do senior policy makers need to know. And then, you spend your day writing those papers or going to briefings or spending time around a table and trying to figure out what's going to happen next and why does it matter.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo you become the National Intelligence Officer for Africa, what does that mean? What does a National Intelligence Officer do?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nIt's the best job I've ever had, Michael. It really has three functions. You are the U.S. Government's senior analyst on a country or an issue. You represent all the 17 intelligence agencies, in all policy meetings. C.I.A. might have a seat at the table, but I represented the DNI. And I would do the briefing that usually kicked off these policy meetings. So that was sort of one of the responsibilities.\n\nThe second is that I oversaw all of the strategic analysis that the intelligence community had, national intelligence estimates, et cetera. C.I.A. might have their view, DIA may have their view, but what was written under my auspices was a community view.\n\nAnd sometimes the community may disagree and we would represent that, as well. And then the third part of the job which I really loved which is I felt responsible for helping to develop our analytic cadre. I would host conferences, I would bring people together, I used to have a product of the month that I would send out, so people could see analytic excellence.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThat's great.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nIt was a fantastic job. Three years, great.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd you also served on the NSC staff on Africa.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nTalk about that.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nI worked in the Obama Administration, I was the Director for Nigeria, Somalia, the Sahel and the African Union. These countries aren't next to each other, but my boss just said, All of your\n\nexperiences, we're just going to put them into one account.\n\nAnd my job was to coordinate U.S. policy. It was a pretty interesting time. We ended up recognizing the Government of Somalia for the first time since 1991. I contributed to the Obama strategy towards Africa. And my job was really to make sure that we were all marching in the same direction. I wrote all the papers for the deputy's committees and other senior meetings so that we could figure out where we're going to go.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo how many countries are in sub Saharan Africa?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\n49.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo how is it possible to keep up with what's going on in 49 countries?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYou know, when I was telling you the story about why I joined, what I wanted to be, it was to be an expert. And I think it's taken me to this point in my career to realize I may never be an expert on 49 countries. So you do a lot of triaging, you work with a lot of smart people. But I find each and every one of them fascinating.\n\nAnd I've had the fortune of working first in West African issues and then I moved to East African and Central African, so I've sort of moved around enough, and then my academic work was on southern. But you have to go into these meetings and present to policy makers real insights into these countries that they may have worked and traveled to together. So it's a lifelong challenge.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd this is a big place, right?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nThe continent is huge.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, I have a map next to me right now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nBecause I have to reference it.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd just the Congo itself is roughly the size of half the United States, right?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes, right, yeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt's a massive continent.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nMassive continent.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo this great job that you had in the intelligence community you left in 2018?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhy?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nWell, I always think it's important to say it has nothing to do with politics. I spent 18 months as the National Intelligence Officer under President Obama and then 18 months under President Trump, and I actually really liked working and trying to support this administration. It forced me to challenge my assumptions.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo you were the National Intelligence Officer during the Trump [administration]?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes, for 18 months.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOkay.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nAnd I had to meet them where they were, which they didn't have the kind of depth that President Obama and his team had on Africa and they had different views and I really enjoyed trying to find ways to communicate the continent's significance and why it matters.\n\nBut the NIO job was the pinnacle for me. That's the best job you can have in my career of service. I thought maybe in 30 years I would be able to get to that point, and I was about halfway through in my career and I didn't see a job in the community that would sort of push me forward. I wanted a new challenge.\n\nAnd quite honestly, I wanted to do policy again. I really liked being at the NSC, and I wanted to think about what our policy should be. And you know, one of the things you can't do as an analyst is give policy prescriptive.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nSo it just seemed like a time to leave at a high point at this incredible position to engage with new people and think about where we should go next.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd as CSIS, you are able to do both the analysis and policies, right?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. It's actually a lot like my old job. I read a lot, I write a lot, but then I have recommendations on what I think we should do. Plus, I get to do things, like I have a podcast, that's fun. I talk to journalists.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nPodcasts are the best. (LAUGH)\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nPodcasts are the best. You know, I travel a lot. I meet with African and European and other government officials and get to interact with them in a different way, speaking for myself, not for my government.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Intelligence Matters has now been around for a couple of years, we have never had anybody on talking about Africa. So I think the key question is: How does Africa matter to our national security? And how much does it matter?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nHow do you answer that question?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThis is a difficult question because as we've just talked about, there are 49 countries in sub Saharan Africa, 54, if you include the North African countries. 55 if you're the African Union because you include Western Sahara. And as our interests evolved, the way we look at Africa changes. And if you would just allow me a quick tangent, because this is very nerdy, but if it's going to be successful, it's going to be successful on Intelligence Matters.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWell, you're talking to a nerd, so we're in good shape here.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes. I teach a class at George Washington University on the History of U.S. Intelligence Analysis in Africa, and I found this piece, a National Intelligence Estimate from 1971 in East Africa, and there's a line in it, maybe you've seen this before, I've never seen it before, the analyst said, The significance for the United States of developments in East Africa depends on what the U.S. says is important.\n\nRight? It sounds circular, but it's true. And then, the analysts go further than that, right? They say if you're going to look at this in a narrow perspective, we don't have many interests, 1971 in East Africa. There's not a product that we get there, we don't have economic investment.\n\nBut if you step back, and I'm paraphrasing here, if you step back, these are countries that could be models, open societies. These leaders have influence, both in Africa and globally. And if they should go south, if there should be instability, it would affect our interests.\n\nAnd I like to use that story because it tells me don't undersell and don't oversell. Look at all the angles and present all the arguments. So the way that I think about Africa right now is in three ways: First, the future is African, demographically. The continent will double in size. It will go from 1.2 billion people to 2.4 billion people by 2050. That means a quarter of the world's population will be Africa. Nigeria is going to be larger than the United States.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo fastest growth by any continent?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, fastest growth, youngest continent. Nigeria is going to be the third-largest country in the world, it's going to surpass us. And so, every global problem is going to have an African dimension to it. What is going to be the norms around Internet privacy? How are we going to deal with climate change?\n\nThere's going to be an African component to that and we need to be mindful of that. Two, and this has been something that I've learned in my career, Africa's problems and opportunities don't stop at the water's edge. What happens in Africa changes the way the world works. African migration crisis changed European politics. The Ebola crisis changes the way we think about global health security. You may remember the piracy off the coast of the Horn of Africa, it changed actually how maritime commerce worked in the shipping industry.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nSo I think that it's really important to be mindful of these events in these different countries because they do change the way people and systems work. And then finally, our allies and adversaries understand those first two points really well and I think they understand it probably better than we do.\n\nWe are seeing this dramatic increase in engagement by allies and adversaries. Between 2010 and 2015, 150 foreign embassies were built in sub Saharan Africa. Trade is up for most countries, 65 countries have increased their trade. And military bases all across Africa. Indian Ocean, the Horn of Africa and Western Saharan, I'm sorry, Western Africa.\n\nSo I think that we have to recognize that if we are not there to shape what is happening on the continent, to referee, to make sure that we are not blocked out by opportunities, it is going to affect our national interests.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo talk a little bit about kind of the state of Africa today. You know, what's going on there? What are the challenges these countries face? And what are some of the positive things that are happening?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nChinua Achebe, the author of Things Fall Apart, said when talking about Nigeria, The problem with Nigeria is leadership. And I think for many of these countries, leadership and governance and sort of the economic problems that flow from that are still probably the biggest challenges these countries face. There is instability.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIt's true. It's true of a lot of countries.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nIt's true of a lot of the countries, right? But you know, instability in the Sahel, challenges in Eastern Congo with Ebola, we have been talking for so many years about urbanization and greater connectivity and youth bulge and climate change. And I would argue right now, those things are really coming together.\n\nGovernance has been hard in Africa, but it's become really complex. And I think some governments are failing in the way they respond to that. And I think it's making conflicts more protracted, more deadly, and I think it is denying people the ability to live their lives. And these all, as we have said, have all these effects for us.\n\nBut there's some good news stories. And I always like the opportunity to talk about good news because the U.S. media on Africa, it's all negative. I mean, it's disproportionately negative. And\n\nAfrica is doing some things that are really interesting.\n\nThey're going in a different direction than the rest of the world in some cases. So while there's this global recession in democracy, there are people who have less confidence in it. Africans really strongly believe in democracy. 68% of Africans support democratic principles.\n\nIn some countries, it's like in the 80s. There's been 28 transfers of power since 2015, peaceful, more than half. That's historic. While the rest of the world has become protectionist and imposing tariffs, Africans have created a new continental trade arrangements.\n\nIt's the largest trading block since the W2O was founded. And finally, while the rest of the world or at least the United States are thinking about pulling out, the Africans are stepping up and they're working together to deal with trans-national threats. So I think those are really good stories.\n\nAnd just the last thing that I think maybe your audience hasn't thought about that is really exciting to me is African soft power. Africa, Africans are changing our global entertainment and cultural trends in ways that I think are unprecedented. Our music, our films, our sports, Africans are shaping it at the lead.\n\nAnd I'd love to see African governments take advantage of their soft power and I'd like to think of ways that our government could be more effective in navigating it.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo find this, you know, cutting against the trend on democracy and trade to be fascinating.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhy is that happening?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nWell, let me start with trade first. For the Africans, their economies are too fractured, fragmented. No one's going to invest in the small little Gambia, which just covers the river within Senegal. Inter trade within Africa has been historically low.\n\nAnd the Africans under the leadership of Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, realized that if they are going to increase inter-African trade, if they were going to become a better investment destination, they had to remove some of these barriers.\n\nSo I think that's what explains the integration, economic integration. On the democracy side, I think it's a number of trend lines that are coming together. First, as I said, still strong support for democracy, but I think there are new ways in which people can organize and mobilize that has changed politics in Africa. As it's become more urban, you've been able to communicate with each other in new ways through telephones and mobile phones.\n\nWe're seeing more protests on the streets. We're seeing more people push for change. And so, whether it's the uprising in Sudan that ended President Al Bashir's rule or it is the remarkable changes in Ethiopia or just increasingly cyclical transfers of power, I think a number of things are happening that really cut against the grain in both the global trends, as you've talked about, but even the way people think about sub Saharan Africa.\n\nBecause you can always pull out the autocracy or the democracy that is in recession or is regressing. But if you step back and look at the picture, it's actually very exciting. And what I tell people is, let's not look at this about democracy as up or down, let's look at the forces that have sort of created a status quo around governance are changing. And I expect a lot of volatility.\n\nWe'll come to you and have these really big surprises and we'll have these setbacks. But I think that people, the governed and the governing, are working on the new rules of the game. And so, it's a really interesting time right now.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAre there countries, and I'm thinking of South Africa, I'm thinking of Nigeria, I'm thinking of Kenya, are there countries that kind of lead the continent? Or is that not a right way of thinking about it?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nU.S. policy has always thought about sort of anchor states: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia. They have outsized military forces, they are loud and vocal globally and on the continent. I don't think that is as true as much anymore. Nigeria has been dealing with its own internal security problems.\n\nTheir President isn't the most dynamic. Ethiopia is in the middle of a transition; South Africa is way down by economic problems. And so, what I think you've seen is a democratization of leadership in Africa. Different countries step up at different times.\n\nSo there's not one single voice. You can't as you did under the Bush Administration or under the Obama Administration say, Well, Nigeria is going to carry our water in West Africa. It just doesn't happen anymore. You've got to, I think, build these coalitions with the Senegals and the Ghanas in some regions and still rely on South Africa and Kenya for other things.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYou, Judd, you mentioned earlier that other countries are paying attention to what's going on in Africa.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd seeing some of the opportunities that you talked about. So can you talk a little about what third party actors, namely China and Russia, are doing on the continent? And if there are others, to, that are interesting, please mention those.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. Let me start with China. I think it's really important to say that China poses some threats to the U.S. in what it's doing. But I've been really disappointed with our policy, because we haven't been precise about what we're trying to counter when it comes to China.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWith China?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nWith China. We seem to want to focus on blocking them at every turn in sub Saharan Africa. And I don't know, it's like mad libs right now. It's we are worried about activity, fill in the blank, in country, fill in the blank, because of China. And I don't even think we have articulated at least publicly what is the end state that we are looking for.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd it's that because of China that is the driver, right?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, it's the because of China. And I think that if we are going to be effective at managing what China is doing in sub Saharan Africa, we need to be specific about what the threats are. So I would say, first of all, it's Chinese investment in critical infrastructure. Ports. We just did a paper at CSIS, 46 ports the Chinese are invested in, operating or building in Africa.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd that's a risk because--?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThat's a risk because it can limit our mobility, our access to these countries, our ability for our military, our ability for our private sector to get involved.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd the Chinese port could eventually become a Chinese military base?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nAbsolutely. That's what we saw in Djibouti.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nSo I worry about ports. I worry about cyber and telecoms. The Chinese have built about 70% of Africa's 4G, it will be 100% of their 5G. Even satellites, Africa is starting to launch more and more satellites and the Chinese are behind it. So we should focus on that.\n\nWe should focus on the people-to-people investment that China is doing. They're actually focusing on winning hearts and minds. More African students study in China than they do in the United States. China has a program now where they're trying to provide satellite television to 10,000 villages.\n\nI think that's decadal, the impacts of that. But the thing about China that gets the most oxygen in Washington is economics. And here is where I think we need to be a lot more nuanced. China is addressing the needs of Africans. This is a region that has the lowest railroad density in the world.\n\nThey need between $130 billion and $170 billion of infrastructure investments per year, according to the African Development Bank, and China is doing a lot of that stuff. So what we need to do with China in my view is we can't tell Africans not to take the money, because our private sector is not providing that.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nChina does $200 billion a year and we do $40 billion. But we can help them to make sure the deals are better, that they don't discriminate against the U.S. private sector, that they have the environmental regulations. So that's how I think about China.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Russia.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, Russia is an easier conversation that China, right? I don't need much nuance. There is very few upsides to what Russia is doing. Essentially, President Putin needs permissive environments for his companies to invest in after the sanctions were imposed on his government and he's looking to score points.\n\nAfrica is a place where he can work asymmetrically. They don't do much that helps African economies. They sell arms. They're the largest exporter of arms to Africa in the world. They are involved in oil and gas industries, in energy. But often, that comes with a side of corruption. What they're really doing is being fairly disruptive to politics.\n\nIf they have an opportunity to side with an autocrat to provide technical expertise to help Al Bashir stay in power, that's what they'll do. So they are looking to sell themselves as returning to the glory days of the Soviet Union in Africa.\n\nAnd I think one of the things that we need to be careful about is not call them a great power. They're not. And I think when we call them a great power in Africa, we do Putin's bidding. They're a minnow. At least compared to us, the Chinese and Europe.\n\nSo I think that we need to do a better job at isolating and not elevating Russia. We need to close some of the loops that make it permissive for their companies to work in this area. And we need to be better about gauging Africans to inoculate them from these kinds of intrusions.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAre there big European players?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, France is still very involved. And in fact, President Macron just recently had a summit where he talked about what his government is doing on the Sahel. The U.K., the week of this recording, just had its first U.K. Africa Investment Summit. Malta, I don't know why I'm sharing this, but Malta just came out with their own Africa strategy, just to give you a sense of the diversity here.\n\nThe other region that I should spend just a second talking about is the Gulf. The Gulf is very active in Africa and Turkey is very active in Africa. In some cases, that's not bad, they're doing some of the investments. DP Ports is investing in lots of places all over the continent.\n\nBut what they've done that has been really negative is they have exported their political riffs to the region and it's been problematic for Somalia and countries that don't want to choose between the UAE on one side and Qatar on the other side. Turkey has also been involved on the commerce commercial side. They are doing some security assistance. As I said, it's a crowded space.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo extremist, Jihadist extremism, seems to be to be a growing problem on the continent.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nIs that right? And if so, why is it happening and how much of a threat is it to Europe, to us?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. We have to remember that Al-Qaeda's major attack was in Africa, right, against our embassies in Tanzania, in Kenya. But in the last couple decades, I think the problem has become more diverse, more geographically dispersed and more deadly.\n\nThere are Al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates in West and East Africa and Southern Africa. We are seeing unaligned extremist groups like Boko Haram. The number of attacks that they are doing are increasing and I think the lethality of them are increasing.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nPrimarily against local targets?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nPrimarily against local targets. So in Nigeria, for example, according to a Council on Foreign Relations Database, 35,000 have died from Boko Haram in ISIS West Africa attacks or in conflict between those groups and the Nigerian military. In the Sahel, there's been a fivefold increase in deaths since 2016, 4,000 people.\n\nSo it's primarily African targets. But I just testified in front of the House, and what I said is that it's probably a low probability that they are going to attack the U.S. directly, but I think it has some significant impacts for us. First of all, it endangers our citizens that live in Africa and our economic investments. There was an attack by Al-Shabaab earlier this year, where they hit a Kenya military base, where the U.S. trains Kenyans and an American service person died and two contractors.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nThey tried to attack our base in Somalia, as well. And Americans have been caught up in the hotel attacks and the mall attacks. There is a group affiliated with ISIS right near a huge L&G find in Mozambique. So it does threaten our interests about the people who live in Africa, our facilities and our economic investments.\n\nIt also, as it continues to fester, entangles us in very expensive peace keeping and humanitarian operations. So I think we need to be proactive when we think about that there is the secondary effects. And the last one is the more that extremist deepens and we are seen as less responsive, I think we lose the trust of our partners.\n\nI mean, Macron made a very clear pitch that he felt like the U.S. wasn't there helping. Our African partners have said the same. And Russia, particularly, has rushed in to kind of find an opportunity here. So it's not a direct threat to the homeland, but a huge amount of sort of impacts downstream.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nWhat's behind the expansion of extremism on the continent?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah, I think partly it's a matter of governance and poor governance. And I think the affiliates, Al-Qaeda and ISIS have been sort of shopping for partners. I try to be very careful about talking about ISIS and AQ as if they're drivers because we don't want to lose the local elements. It's just as helpful for the local extremist group to work with Al-Qaeda and ISIS as it is vice versa.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo in a lot of cases, these groups existed already with local grievances and then they took on the name?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYes, yes, yeah. They take on the name and there is a back and forth between the network and the local group and the network doesn't always get what it wants. But I think that those relationships have improved recruitment, have improved some of the tactical and strategic efforts maybe even to help them, like, IEDs and other things.\n\nSo I think poor governance, the attraction of networking with these groups and then the most important part is government mistakes. There is a study by UNDP that looked at sort of extremists in Africa and 71% of militants, former militants, said they joined an extremist group because a family member or friend was abused, detained by the security forces.\n\nSo many of these African militaries make the wrong moves that push people further into the arms of the extremists. So those are a couple of the things that I would highlight is why we keep seeing this proliferation of these groups.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYou talked earlier about the expansion of democracy. You talked earlier about poor governance, extremism now being a consequence of that poor governance. Is there a correlation or causation between a state being more democratic and the quality of its governance in Africa?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. Oh, sorry, I thought you were going to go in a different direction. I thought you were going to as whether or not correlation between democracy and extremist activity, which there is actually some good evidence. On the democracy and the governance, I don't have the numbers. But my experience says that it depends, right? I mean, if you are a democratic state and you are being responsive to your citizens, then in theory, the governance will improve over time.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right, right.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nBut in some cases, what happens is because the democracy, people are elected through (UNINTEL) networks, that you can actually use corruption to sort of focus on your own personal constituents, as opposed to the betterment of your total population. So you really have to go case by case to talk about, you know, where are all people benefiting versus people who are sort of in the circle of the President and the ruling party?\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo Judd, I think this is a good place to switch to U.S. policy and maybe we'll finish up on this. U.S. policy toward the region. How would you characterize it? What's working? What's not? If\n\nyou could advise the President, what would you tell him?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nYeah. You know, I think that our policy makers on Africa are stuck with the challenge of being asked to do less with less. And it's taken them a while to I think figure out how they are going to push policy. And I want to give them some credit because it's taken a little while, but I've been happy with some of the results, but just to kind of go back a little bit.\n\nLike in many other parts of the world, we didn't have policy makers on Africa for a long time in Washington or in the field. And so, there was this period where it was really this unhappy marriage between Obama policies they weren't sure they were going to dismantle and Trump policies that hadn't been constructed yet. And so, you've got a lot of contractions. And then you had Tweets and other sorts of, you know, travel bans that made things worse.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nRight, right, right.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nAnd then President Trump's national security advisor, John Bolton, unveils the strategy, and this doesn't go off very well either because it's almost entirely about Russia and China. The Africans felt like they were not part of the strategy.\n\nBut in the last year, I've been pleased with the bureaucracy finding a way. They launched an economic initiative called Prosper Africa, it's a lot to go still, but it's a good step, right? It's addressing some of the challenges that the U.S. private sectors had in investing in Africa. They've kind of found their footing on democracy and governance, which isn't really in any of the strategy documents or speeches.\n\nBut sanctions now on election spoilers in Nigeria, on corrupt officials in Kenya, on people who are stopping the peace process in South Sudan. So those are positive. The big question in year four is: Where is the DOD going? And you may know there is a proposal in front of Secretary of Defense Esper about withdrawing maybe even completely our troops in Africa, about 6,000 people. They already had reduced West African forces about 10%. I think this is a really dangerous policy. I think it's reckless.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nAnd they are there supporting local forces who are fighting extremists?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nLocal forces, yeah. And it's not just sort of the CT side of the house, they're building capacity for Africans to deal with security challenges and they're there at the request of African governments. And we are there in partnership with our European friends.\n\nAnd this has caused great anxiety amongst the global community that we may walk away from the continent. We have done this before and it wasn't very good. So you may know, Michael, that in the '90s, we dramatically reduced our presence in Africa. And then after 9/11 and the growing CT threat, we realized, actually, we need to be back. So reset those relationships.\n\nRebuild capacity. Reinvest in infrastructure. A lack of DOD presence is going to not only, you know, make us seem less committed to these challenges, but there are the other effects. Our\n\ndiplomats and our development officers depend on the military to get out to these hard-to-reach places.\n\nI think our analysts are going to have a harder time understanding dynamics in Africa if there is less U.S. presence in these places. So I'm really concerned. I'm elated that the Hill has stepped up. Senator Graham, Senator Coons, a number of people on the House side have said this is a bad idea. And hopefully, Secretary Esper will decide not to do this.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nYeah. And if we're not there, who fills the vacuum?\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nRight, exactly. Our adversaries.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nJudd, thank you so much for joining us.\n\nJUDD DEVERMONT:\n\nMy pleasure. Thank you.\n\n* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *
Produced by Chuck Stevenson, Lucy Scott and Asena Basak\n\n[This story originally aired on Feb. 7, 2015. It was updated on April 2, 2016.]\n\nIt's just about a 45-minute drive from the refineries of the Texas coast to the high rises of downtown Houston. And in 2000, 20-year-old Michelle Warner moved to the big city. She was a new mom looking to make a fresh start.\n\nMichelle did have the small-town girl in her, but Michelle always desired to go to the big city, Michelle's mom, Donna Malone, said. She loved to talk to people... she never met a stranger.\n\nWe were really, really close when we were young kids, I mean really close, her brother, David Chaffin added. From the time we were born we did pretty much everything together ... from the time I was born I was her child, not theirs.\n\nMichelle Warner Donna Malone\n\n\n\n\n\nShe just grew into this beautiful swan ... she had the long pretty hair and a beautiful smile, Malone continued. ...she started going to college ... and started studying criminal justice.\n\nBut things didn't exactly work out. Michelle may have been a saint, but she was also a sinner.\n\nShe married right after high school and, in 2001, and had a daughter, Hayley.\n\nWhen that marriage went south in 2003, little Hayley went to live with the ex-husband and Michelle was on her own.\n\nMichelle was a great mom, Malone explained, but she ran into some tough times in her life.\n\nShe fell in with a bad crowd and she even disappeared a couple of times. And she was arrested for possession of cocaine.\n\nBut that was eight years ago. Her family says Michelle's dark days were behind her.\n\nShe was finally turning around ... She was no longer on any kind of drugs, Malone said. She was going to work every day.\n\nIn 2008, she also began a relationship with a man she met at work -- a man named Mark Castellano.\n\nMy impression of Mark from the very beginning was, 'what an odd duck, what a strange little man,' said Malone.\n\nMichelle Warner and Mark Castellano Donna Malone\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Castellano and Michelle Warner had met on the job. She was a secretary at a medical firm; he was the IT guy -- the person who fixed computers.\n\nI absolutely do not know what Michelle saw in Mark, said Malone.\n\nHe's always been a little off, said Chaffin.\n\nIn 2009, Michelle and Mark had a son, Cayden.\n\nMichelle was very excited when Cayden was born, Malone said. I did have some reservations about Cayden's dad. ...Not so sure about Mark at all, no.\n\nMalone says Castellano wasn't much of a dad.\n\nCayden was about 2 months old and Mark just went away. Just, ' Ugh, I can't handle this; it's too stressful for me.' Everything was always about me - me, me, me, me, me.\n\nIn those early days, life was tough for Michelle as a single mom bouncing from job to job.\n\nNo child support, he did not pay any child support. Michelle was doing it on her own -- struggling to do it on her own. It was very difficult for her, said Malone.\n\nThen, in the summer of 2012, Michelle got a break -- a new job at a law firm in Houston. All she needed was a place for her and Cayden, now 3 years old, to stay. She reached out to the one person she knew there: Mark Castellano.\n\nHe agreed to let them stay at his Houston apartment, but Michelle set down some rules.\n\nWhen Michelle moved back in with Mark ... the agreement between them was that they would live together, raise the child together, but not as a romantically involved couple, said Malone.\n\nBut just three months after moving in with Castellano -- on Saturday, Sept 22, 2012 --Michelle was gone.\n\nWhen Chaffin couldn't get a hold of his sister, he called Castellano and confronted him.\n\nDo you have any idea where she may be? I've exhausted every lead that I have about Michelle and I can't find a f-----g thing, anybody who knows anything about where she might be. And you're the last person I know of that's seen her, Chaffin asked Castellano.\n\nYeah, yeah, I am, I am. But like I said, I don't know where the hell she went, Castellano replied.\n\nCastellano told Chaffin that he and Michelle had had a fight. She'd walked out and left her car and her toddler behind.\n\nChaffin was surprised to learn that on the night his sister disappeared, Castellano took Michelle's car and drove Cayden more than 500 miles -- over eight hours -- to his parent's house in West Texas.\n\nMark's story did not make any sense, said Malone.\n\nHouston Police Department\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost immediately, Michelle's family filed a missing persons report. They heard nothing. Five days later, veteran Houston homicide Detective Fil Waters and Sergeant Brian Harris got the case.\n\nWhen you first came here, you went in and what'd you do? 48 Hours correspondent Tracy Smith asked the investigators of the apartment where Castellano and Michelle lived together.\n\nWent to the apartment, the family was there, Det. Waters said. Actually, it was interesting that Mark's story was what happened, you know, I mean in terms of the story that he was telling everyone.\n\nCastellano had told Chaffin in that phone call that he and Michelle had been arguing over Cayden when she walked out.\n\nAll of the events leading up to it, the fight, all the stuff that happened here, Smith noted.\n\nAccurate, at least what he is telling us Waters said. The only people in the scenario who were casting any kind of suspicion on Mark are Michelle's family, that's where all that's coming from. And they're not saying things like, 'You know what? Michelle told me yesterday that if anything ever happened to me it's Mark.'\n\nWe were getting, 'We don't like Mark ... Marks a bad guy,' Waters continued. It's more personality dislikes about Mark.\n\nBut back at the apartment, cops did find something strange.\n\nWe knew that Mark was an IT guy. He's a techie nerd, Waters said. So then, what becomes noticeable in the apartment ... there are computers ... but all the hard drives are gone.\n\nThe homicide detectives wanted to talk with Castellano, so they called him at his parent's house in West Texas. It turns out Castellano had an unusual question for them.\n\nHe said, 'Can I ask you a question, though? I need some advice.' And I said, 'Sure.' And he said, 'Do you think I ought to let Dr Phil interview me?' said Waters.\n\nWhat'd you say? Smith asked.\n\nWell, I was a little stunned - I said, 'Dr. Phil?' Waters said of the host of the top-rated daytime talk show. And I said, 'Absolutely, let Dr. Phil interview you.'\n\nAs the week passed, the search for Michelle Warner expanded quickly from Houston, to west Texas and all the way to Los Angeles and the Dr. Phil show.\n\nDr. Phil: Today we will take you inside a national news story as it unfolded in front of our cameras in real time.\n\nIt was Dr. Phil McGraw -- not the police - who would first interrogate Castellano about Michelle's mysterious disappearance:\n\nDr. Phil: Let's talk about the night she disappeared. You had a fight? Was this a physical fight? Or an argument? Or both? Mark Castellano: Basically, I come home. Umm, she's in her room. First thing she does is start yelling at me. Cayden has made a big mess ... and we start fighting ... she walks up to me and gives me this kind of sucker punch while I'm on the floor. I mean she hits me all the time and I don't retaliate. She hit me and said, and clean it up right expletive, expletive, and she goes in and slams her door.\n\nWhat was your first impression of him? Smith asked.\n\nThat he was a game player, my first impression of him was that he thought he was the smartest guy in the room and he wanted everybody to know it, McGraw replied.\n\nDr. Phil: So you say she goes in, slams the door ... but you go back in to resume the argument, frankly. Mark Castellano: Right, yes. Dr. Phil: And... Mark Castellano: She's gone Dr. Phil: She's gone.\n\nI would take her pictures out and say out loud, 'Michelle where are you? You know just call me, text me please,' said Malone.\n\nCRACKING CASTELLANO\n\nFrom the very beginning, Dr. Phil McGraw felt there was something suspicious about Mark Castellano.\n\nWhy do you think Mark Castellano wanted to come on your show? Tracy Smith asked McGraw, whose show is distributed by CBS Television Distribution.\n\nI think this guy is a narcissist. I mean I really do, he replied.\n\nMark Castellano to Dr. Phil: She basically owns me in a lot of way and I admit that. I caved to Michelle nine-tenths of the time.\n\nCastellano was on the defensive.\n\nHe said to you, 'She could have just disappeared again,' Smith commented to McGraw. That was a possibility.\n\nRight, McGraw replied. He says it was a possibility ... she could have gone in the bedroom, locked the door, gone out the door and left. But, her car's still there.\n\nAnd her son is still there, Smith noted.\n\nHer son is still there, her car is still there, but she's gone off the grid, said McGraw.\n\nMeantime, in Houston -- 500 miles to the east -- the cops were searching the grid trying to find Michelle.\n\nWe do something called a psychological autopsy. We start breaking down a person's life, and so that's what we were having to do with Michelle, Sgt. Harris explained.\n\nBack in West Texas, McGraw continued his interview with Castellano. He had a hunch that those missing hard drives might be connected to Michelle's disappearance, so he grilled Mark:\n\nDr. Phil: You said you would show 'em to me. Do you have 'em here? Can we look at 'em? Mark Castellano[gets up from his seat]: Yeah I'll bring 'em to you, one second. Oh, no I don't have 'em -- he's still copying 'em. Dr. Phil: OK. You can come back. Mark Castellano: Sorry, I thought he brought them back but he didn't. Dr. Phil: You said you were gonna show those to us and you got up and walked to the door -- and then said, Oh, that's right, they're not here. But not 15 minutes before we got here, you told my producer they weren't here. You already knew they weren't here when you got up to get 'em. Mark Castellano: My mind is scatterbrained right now. I mean I forgot.\n\nI forgot? said Smith.\n\nBells are going off right now. I'm talking to him and watching ... the theatre of what's going on, McGraw said. He's playing games here. To him, it's a manipulation ... and I'm wondering why he's not putting all of his effort, all of his emphasis, on finding Michelle?\n\nMy dad used to say for every rat you see there's 50 you don't. When he tells you that lie, there's 50 more, McGraw continued.\n\nMcGraw relentlessly peeled back Castellano's story.\n\nHe also admits throwing her cat down the hallway, throwing her cat into a wall. And that is very troubling to me, said McGraw.\n\nEach revelation led him closer to the conclusion that Castellano killed Michelle:\n\nDr. Phil: Was there violence at this point? Mark Castellano: There was violence ... She and I would wrestle ... push each other around. There was one time I choked her.\n\nHe admits to being violent with her, said Smith.\n\nHe admits to being violent with her to the point of choking her. Now think about this: if he, in fact, is culpable in her disappearance, why in the world would he admit that? said McGraw.\n\nMark Castellano during his interview on Dr. Phil\n\nSo let's look at the moment when you asked him the big question, Smith said as she and McGraw watched more of the TV interview:\n\nDr. Phil: It's really odd for a mother to just not check on, find out anything about a child. If you think something has happened to her, why aren't you looking for her? Mark Castellano: I mean, as far as everybody has exhausted the leads that I have. I don't know where else to go. The police are looking for her. They're professionals. Dr. Phil: Did you do anything to her that would be considered foul play or criminal? Mark Castellano: No, no. Dr. Phil: Did you kill her? Mark Castellano: No, sir.\n\nSo as you left, where did you stand with Mark Castellano? What did you think? Smith asked McGraw.\n\nIt is clear in my mind that I'm not believing a word he is saying, he replied. When I walked out the door ... I said, 'He killed her, no doubt about it.'\n\nYou said it then? Smith asked.\n\nHe killed her, said McGraw.\n\nBut Castellano hadn't confessed to anything. After McGraw returned to Los Angeles to get his show ready for broadcast, detectives brought Castellano in and turned up the heat.\n\nIt all happened in an interview room at the Houston homicide division. There was no tough guy posturing, no rolled up shirtsleeves or guns on the hip, and no raised voices -- it was pure psychology.\n\nI was like, Fil, when you go in there, it's like walking into a minefield, because one, you don't wanna upset him and make him angry where all of sudden he says the L word - lawyer, or he says, I wanna leave, said Sgt. Harris.\n\nDetective Fil Waters takes the lead:\n\nDet. Waters: OK, so the first thing, you're not under arrest. Mark Castellano: Right. Det. Waters: Again, I told ya I certainly appreciate you coming here and talking to us, spending a lot of time here. Mark Castellano: Well I want Michelle to be found.\n\nI want Michelle to be found. That's what Castellano just said. That's his story and he's sticking to it:\n\nDet. Waters: Have you tried to call her? Mark Castellano: At this point? No, I don't want to call her.\n\nThis was it. This was it, Waters told Smith. We had no evidence, we had nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Detective Waters started looking for motive. If Castellano was a killer, did something push him over the edge?\n\nDet. Waters: Pressure's building? Mark Castellano: The pressure's building on me, yes. When she gets mad, she's violent. She'll hit you, she thinks she has the right to ... you know, the man has to take up crap. She's a pretty girl and she gets everything she wants. She has that princess attitude.\n\nThat princess attitude phrase was a flag for detectives -- an insight into how Castellano viewed the relationship:\n\nDet. Waters: We kind of get a flavor of your relationship. And this is my impression -- is that when it's good, it's like intensely good. But when it is bad, it is intensely bad. Mark Castellano: Right.\n\nDetective Waters' approach? No tough questions - yet. He is trying to get Castellano to trust him:\n\nDet. Waters: Let's get to last Saturday, the 22nd. Mark Castellano: OK, she walks out and slams the door to her room ... and about, 10, 15 minutes later I open the door to say, Well, you know what and she's gone.\n\nShe's gone.\n\nOnce that narrative was complete, and he felt like he had told his story, it was at that point that - I'm now gonna confront you, Waters told Smith.\n\nThis is a dance, Waters continued. And I'm letting Mark play the music. And then at one point, another song comes on and it's mine, and now the dance changes.\n\nWaters tells Castellano: I need you to explain to me what happened. ... We both know, we both know, Michelle did not walk out of that apartment.\n\nTHE CONFESSION\n\nDetective Fil Waters sat for hours talking to Mark Castellano, gaining his trust:\n\nMark Castellano: I don't love her. I'm not in love her. I don't want anything to happen to her. I wish Michelle would pop up right now. When she gets mad she's violent I don't care what anybody she says, she is. I said something about you take too many pills, you can't watch Cayden or something. She's like, I can't tolerate Cayden. She's like, I need help with him. She's like, he's driving me nuts.\n\nWaters finally discovered a way to bring out the truth about what happened that night: he brought up Cayden.\n\nDet. Waters: So your concern for Cayden is mainly centered on when Michelle is the primary - caregiver. Mark Castellano: Right.\n\nCayden was the most important part of his life, Waters told Smith, so I knew that I was going to have to frame whatever he did in that apartment in that context.\n\nThat context -- getting Castellano to admit his actions that night were to protect Cayden:\n\nDet. Waters: It wasn't about hurting Michelle. It was about the love and the strength of that love that you have for Cayden and protecting him from anybody that would threaten to hurt him. And that's what you're gonna have to explain now.\n\nThe strategy worked.\n\nDet. Waters: So I want you to be honest with me and tell me what happened.\n\nWhen he took off his glasses, I went -- here it comes, Waters told Smith. I just knew it.\n\nMark Castellano: She's getting dressed. And she's finishing up and she's still yelling and Cayden's hiding. I grabbed her and I broke her neck.\n\nBoom. There he comes with it, Waters told Smith.\n\nMark Castellano [in tears]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. F-----g give me the death penalty, that's fine. I deserve it. Det. Waters: Mark, Mark look, I'm proud of you. Mark Castellano: My life's over with anyway. Det. Waters: Your life's not over with, Mark.\n\nSergeant Harris came into the room and Castellano physically demonstrated how he killed Michelle:\n\nMark Castellano: Then I grab her, and then at about that I'm facing the bed and then I fall on top of her and crush her windpipe.\n\nCastellano demonstrated several times how he strangled Michelle Warner, even pushing Sgt. Harris onto the tabletop to show how he spent one-and-a-half to two minutes choking her.\n\nMark Castellano demonstrates what happened the night Michelle Warner died. Houston Police Department\n\n\n\n\n\nCastellano claimed Michelle's erratic and abusive behavior pushed him over the edge.\n\nMark Castellano: She'll hit you; she thinks she has the right to.\n\nHe painted this picture of Michelle as an abusive woman, Smith said. When you talk to other people did they say that she was volatile? She had a temper? She was abusive?\n\nEveryone we talked to, not just family members, described her as a loving mother, said Harris.\n\nWas there any evidence that Michelle was abusive to Mark?\n\nNot anything that was documented ... other than Marks story, Waters replied.\n\nAfter his confession, Castellano is left alone with his phone. Instead of calling a lawyer, he called his parents: Hey Mom. Well, I confessed. I did it.\n\nHe called his brother: I'm sorry for all he façade I put up for a week, but I can't take the guilt anymore.\n\nHe called a friend: And I wanted you to know that she's dead.\n\nHe even talked with Dr. Phil's producer: It was a moment of rage, I just - I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nMark Castellano to Det. Waters: I pretty much confessed to everybody I could think of.\n\nCastellano had also told Detective Waters what happened moments after he killed Michelle -- as he stood over her body, lying on the bed.\n\nHe said that Cayden walked in and said, 'What's wrong with Mommy?' Waters said. And he turned around and his response was, 'Mommy's taking a nap.'\n\nCastellano put Cayden in a bath, and then dragged Michelle's body into the closet.\n\nSoon after, he loaded Cayden into Michelle's car and drove through the night, over 500 miles, to West Texas.\n\nHe left Cayden with his parents, turned around and drove all the way back to Houston -- back to the apartment where he had left Michelle.\n\nHow did he get her out of the building? Smith asked Waters.\n\nHe packaged her up in a large container, plastic container, and duct taped her hands and feet, put a bag over her head, he replied. He explained he put a bag over her head 'cause he was tired of looking at her.\n\nWith the container loaded in the backseat of Michelle's car, Castellano once again made that long drive back to West Texas. Outside of Midland, he buried Michelle in a shallow grave.\n\nIt turned out Michelle's body was somewhere out in the endless West Texas oil fields. Castellano had drawn a map and given police a rough idea of where the grave was. But it wasn't a good enough description. The key to finding Michelle's body was as close as an iPhone.\n\nHarris and Walters stayed in Houston with Castellano, while local police and FBI agents tried to locate Michelle's body with the map. But it only got them in the general vicinity.\n\nSo they called us in the interview room and we decided to try the FaceTime, said Harris.\n\nFaceTime is the Apple iPhone's video phone app. You can see and hear whatever the person on the other end of the line wants to show you.\n\nMark was actually speaking to the detectives and they were holding their phone out, Harris explained via FaceTime. They tried to follow it like a treasure map.\n\nJust walking around aiming it, said Smith.\n\nCorrect. And so they panned the area and then he told them to stop and he directed 'em towards - it was like more of a big scrub brush, Harris said. When they got closer, that's when the FBI agent -- we could hear her say, 'I found her, I found her.'\n\nWith the discovery of Michelle's body, Castellano was finally arrested and charged with murder eight days after she went missing.\n\nDr. Phil McGraw's show went on TV a few days later.\n\nUntil Castellano's confession, Cayden had been staying with his relatives. But now, authorities moved him in with Michelle's family.\n\nWhen 48 Hours caught up with Castellano behind bars, there were a few other things he wanted us to know, including a brand new version of what happened that night -- a 180-degree turnaround.\n\nCASTELLANO'S OTHER STORY\n\nFrom the start, Mark Castellano had told everyone lies. So 48 Hours' Correspondent Tracy Smith wanted to set the ground rules before their interview.\n\nSo here's the thing Mark. You lied to the cops, you lied to Dr. Phil, you lied to your parents ... why should we believe you now? Smith asked.\n\nWhat's the -- there's no point to lie about anything, Castellano replied. I don't like lying. I don't like lying at all. It's not me. I'd rather just go ahead and tell the truth and get it over with.\n\nAre you telling me the truth now? Smith asked.\n\nYes. Of course I'm telling you the truth, he said.\n\nThe first thing Castellano wanted to tell 48 Hours was that he was not a murderer.\n\nWe got into a fight it just - it just happened all wrong, he told Smith. It wasn't, you know, not my finest hour.\n\nNot your finest hour?\n\nNo, said Castellano.\n\nWhy do you say that? Smith asked.\n\nWell, I mean the whole thing wasn't my finest hour, Castellano replied.\n\nHe says yes, it was true -- the couple had a fight that night, but he was the victim.\n\nAsked if it got violent, Castellano said, Oh yeah, they always get violent. She beats the hell out of me. ...I've been beaten by this woman for a long time.\n\nBut this time Castellano says he'd had enough. Remember - there's never been an official report of abuse in this case.\n\nSo, did you just snap? Smith asked.\n\n...to, to retaliate back from her swinging at me? Yeah, he replied. I snapped or hit her back ... this time I was tired of being hit ... and yeah, then I was gonna defend myself this time around.\n\nSo you threw stuff back and forth and then you grabbed her, said Smith.\n\nI didn't grab her yet. She threw another punch at me, Castellano said. That's when I grabbed her and lunged forward.\n\nThis is where Castellano's story changes from his confession to police:\n\nMark Castellano to Det. Waters: I grabbed her and I broke her neck.\n\nSo I want to go back to this confession. What actually happened that night? Smith asked.\n\nThat's what we're not going to talk about, Castellano's lawyer interrupted, telling him not to reveal all of what happened that night.\n\nStill, he did tell 48 Hours a few details. Castellano now says it was all an accident. In the struggle, he says, Michelle died when he ended up falling on top of her neck.\n\nMichelle's death was my fault because ... I'm the one that fell on her, said Castellano.\n\nThat fell on her, Smith repeated.\n\nYes, I did fall on her. I mean, she just, like that, I mean she was just lifeless, Castellano said, snapping his head back. And all of a sudden you know, her body let go ... and it was an accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle's mother, Donna Malone, can barely contain her disgust.\n\nFirst of all, I will never believe it was just an accident, she said. You just don't on accident murder someone and feel nothing.\n\nWhen you drive a car and you hit somebody, did you want to hit them, no. You're like, 'It was an accident. ...' You might be at someone's house and they just had brand new carpet put in and you're eating velvet cake and you dropped in on the floor. Did you want to do it, no. Do you feel bad about it, yes. But still, accidents are still accidents, they are not planned. That's why they're called accidents, Castellano went on, shedding a tear.\n\nThat tear was the only time during the interview that Castellano showed any emotion.\n\nHe's a liar, Malone said. Comparing it to spilling cake on someone's floor? To murder someone, that's a violent act.\n\nDid you choke her? Smith asked Castellano.\n\nNo, I didn't choke her, he replied.\n\nBut you said you were angry.\n\nOh, I was very angry.\n\nYou said you snapped, Smith continued.\n\nYeah, and to go ahead and actually raise my hands against her, Castellano said. I had a gun. I've always had a 9mm. If I really wanted to kill Michelle, I would have shot her. ...I would have taken my gun and shot her.\n\nThat he could just have shot her if he wanted to kill her, that's just nonsense talk. It's nonsense, said Malone.\n\nWhat did you do with Michelle's body, Smith asked.\n\nUmmm, it stayed, it stayed, ummm, it stayed in the closet. You know ... I looked at her and it was just like 'Oh, my god.' So that's when I put the bag over her head and I put her in the closet.\n\nWhy the bag over her head? Smith asked.\n\nBecause, just her face -- the way it was frozen, Castellano told Smith. I knew I messed up.\n\nDid it occur to you as you were handling her body that this was the woman that you loved? That this was the mother of your child? Smith pressed.\n\nI did I did. And I also know I couldn't bring her back, he said.\n\nThree days later, Castellano would dump Michelle's lifeless body in that shallow grave.\n\nAsked how he feels about misleading people for so long, Castellano told Smith, Well, it was a tough call. ...It was a very tough call. ...I didn't plan on getting away with this. If I had planned on getting away with this, I would have gotten away with it.\n\nI feel very angry about the fact that Mark lied to all of us. He could have just told the truth from the beginning. It was obvious that everyone was onto him -- family, law enforcement. Why not just tell the truth, get it over with, said Malone.\n\nShe did attack me first, Castellano told Smith.\n\nThe more Mark Castellano talked, the more it seemed he was angry with women.\n\nI mean that's just a fact. Women are now -- y'all are replacing men in a lot of aspects. Ya'll are becoming big time aggressors, he said. Women are now the new aggressors.\n\nShe was beautiful, and you're a beautiful woman yourself. Life's a little easier for women like you, because people can't put bad things with pretty people, Castellano continued.\n\nIt sounds like you resent that a little bit, Mark, Smith commented.\n\nWell, when you sit there and have been told that when you're are not a pretty person, that, ya know, life's gonna suck for you... he replied.\n\nMark Castellano's bizarre answers during 48 Hours' jailhouse interview raised more questions about what makes him tick. So we wanted to talk more about it with Dr. Phil McGraw.\n\nMark Castellano to Tracy Smith: I gotta say I really screwed myself over the way I confessed everything. And because, first of all, I didn't really describe everything accurately, and second of all, I didn't really think every word was going to be used completely out of context, which it was in a lot of ways.\n\nHe's criticizing the process. Things were taken out of context. Here's the context: did you kill her? Or did you not? I think this guy has such an inferiority complex and that's one of the things about narcissism. There's a false sense of superiority, but it's a false sense of superiority, McGraw said as he and Smith watched the interview.\n\nThe truth is, they really feel inferior, said Smith.\n\nThey really feel very inferior, very put upon. And he felt very much that he had reached above his level with Michelle, said McGraw.\n\nThat she was out of his league, so to speak, Smith noted.\n\nOut of his league. She was way over his head. In this instance, she did not reject him. He had the ultimate rejection of her, said McGraw.\n\nWhat do you think his motive was? Smith asked.\n\nI think this guy is very hedonistic, McGraw replied. I think this relationship was on the down slope. I think it was falling apart. And I think he felt her slipping away. ...I think it was one of those situations where, 'If I can't have you, nobody will.'\n\n\n\n\n\nAt his trial, Castellano's attorneys will present his new version of what he says is the truth. Will the jury buy it?\n\nFACING A JURY\n\nIt was very hard to wait on the trial. We wanted some form of justice for Michelle, Donna Malone, said. We felt that we were building up to this pinnacle ... that would bring us some sort of peace.\n\nMay 27, 2014. Mark Castellano is on trial for the murder of Michelle Warner, the mother of their son, Cayden.\n\nThis is a case about obsession, rage, and this defendant's calculated attempts to get away with murder, Assistant District Attorney Jamie Reyna told the court in her opening. He became so upset with Michelle, that he grabbed her by the neck ... that he started to choke her, he started to squeeze her neck. You'll hear him tell those officers he choked her for one-and-a-half to two minutes.\n\nAt the center of the prosecution's case - Castellano's own words -- that videotaped confession to Detective Waters:\n\nDet. Waters[interrogation]: We both know Michelle didn't walk out of that apartment. So I want you to be honest with me, and tell me what happened... Mark Castellano: I grabbed her and I broke her neck.\n\nThe state medical examiner testifies Michelle was strangled. Her hyoid bone, just beneath her jaw, was broken.\n\nMark Castellano does not take the stand. Instead, his lawyer presents that very different story: Michelle's death was an accident.\n\n...she comes at him, he grabs her, he's controlling her and he falls down with his weight on hers and hears a pop. When he reached out to defend himself to protect himself. He didn't anticipate that she would fall down and break her neck, defense attorney Eric Davis told jurors.\n\nAn expert for the defense, a forensic engineer, testifies Castellano's accident story was a possibility.\n\nI didn't find any real evidence that the throat was disturbed, John Charles Laughlin testified. There's no physical evidence that shows any type of squeezing or sideways forces. All of the physical evidence shows is forces applied from the front.\n\nSo what's the detectives' reaction to Castellano's defense?\n\nIs that possible that he fell on her and that's how her neck snapped? Smith asked Sgt. Brian Harris.\n\nNo, he replied.\n\nThe problem is that you cannot accidentally strangle someone for a minute-and-a half to two minutes, said Det. Fil Waters.\n\nShow me what you think he did, what he told you he did to Michelle. What did he do? Smith asked Harris.\n\nHe's so mad he follows her in the bedroom and he goes and whatever takes place, he reaches out and he's just grabbing her, for a minute-and-a-half or two. He's grabbing her, grabbing her, and she has nowhere to go, said Harris.\n\nIf Castellano thought the jury might take pity on him, prosecutors would present more evidence that shows the actions of a cold, callous killer.\n\nWeeks after Castellano's confession, detectives discovered a chilling piece of surveillance video taken by a camera on a building located across from his apartment.\n\nThe video showed a shadowy view of the back stairs of Castellano's apartment.\n\nSo he drags her body in a bin down the stairs, Smith said of the video, which shows a figure dragging something.\n\nYou see him stop. He has worn himself out, Waters explained. He even says when he's on the phone with people he's confessing to, 'You know, Michelle had gained a lot of weight.' So it was really an exercise to bring her down the steps and put her in the car.\n\nAs for those hard drives that seemed to be so important in the early days of the investigation? It turns out they weren't relevant to the case.\n\nAfter more than a week of testimony, 19 witnesses and six hours of deliberations, there's a verdict, ending an anxious wait for Michelle's family.\n\nMark Castellano is found guilty in the strangling death of Michelle Warner.\n\nI was very pleased with the fact that he was declared guilty, Malone said. I said, 'OK, good. They did this quickly... so I believe that this is in the hands of a good, solid jury and they'll do the right thing.'\n\nThe next day, Michelle's loved ones are back in court for Castellano's sentencing. Ironically, it's also Michelle's birthday. She would have turned 33.\n\nMark Castellano's attorney begs for mercy and argues his client's much-talked-about confession was a show of remorse.\n\nThe crime was solved because of a man's conscious. ...In fact, if Mr. Castellano had kept his mouth shut, we wouldn't be here ... But he did what most criminals don't do. He told on himself, Davis told the court. No matter what you do, he is going to the penitentiary. The question is how long?\n\nMichelle's family wants to see Castellano receive the harshest penalty: life in prison.\n\nI do not think that he has any sense of remorse. None, Malone said. I hear nothing but excuses that it was Michelle's fault that he did what he did and we all have free choice and he chose to kill her.\n\nThe jurors spend four hours debating his fate. Finally, a decision: Castellano is sentenced to 27 years.\n\nWhile Castellano mouths thank you to the jury, the sentence feels like a slap in the face for Michelle's family.\n\nOne word went through my mind when I heard 27 years -- seriously? Malone said following the decision.\n\nAfter several months, it is still impossible for the family to understand the jury's decision.\n\nI don't know what happened in the room while the deliberation was going on, because I've not -- had not one juror come forward and speak to me, Malone said. I do not feel that I got closure for my daughter's death, and neither does any of the rest of her family. None of us do.\n\nNow it is up to Michelle's family to explain to two kids -- a daughter living with her ex-husband and little Cayden -- why their mother is gone.\n\nIt's like taking your entire world and flipping it over, David Chaffin said of his sister's murder. You don't expect anything like that to ever hit that close to home for you ... and it's turmoil.\n\nMichelle Warner and her mother, Donna Malone Donna Malone\n\n\n\n\n\nI miss the laughter that I shared with her. ...And I just miss the conversation. I can't have that any more, Malone said. And that's very sad. It's very lonely. ... It makes me feel lonely. So it's an empty hole that will always be there, for the rest of my life. And that's a hard thing to swallow.\n\nMark Castellano will be eligible for parole in 2026, He will be 51 years old.
Produced by Josh Yager\n\n[This story first aired on March 30. It was updated on Aug. 17.]\n\nIn July 2008, Colonel Michael Stahlman was about to come home from Iraq for R&R with his family when the military lawyer and former flight officer was found in his quarters with a gunshot wound to the head. He died about two months later.\n\nAuthorities called it a suicide. But Stahlman's wife Kim and daughter MacKenna say the man they loved would never have killed himself.\n\nMy dad … devoted his life to his country. He was a patriot, said MacKenna.\n\nSomeone shot him, Kim told 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant.\n\nAre you certain of that? Van Sant asked.\n\nI have no doubt, she replied.\n\nKim Stahlman says her husband was right-handed, but his wound was on the left side -- and his job helping rebuild Iraq's legal system could easily have made him enemies.\n\nI just feel like it was somebody Mike knew, she said.\n\nAt the heart of the mystery: an email that was sent just hours before the gunshot:\n\nKim, sorry about what you are about the [sic] find out. I love you and always will. You and the girls are the best thing that ever happened to me. Love, Mike.\n\nBut was it really a suicide note?\n\nThe evidence shows there's no way he could have done what they said he did, Kim told Van Sant.\n\nAsked if she's in denial, Kim told Van Sant, No, no.\n\nKim started pushing the investigating agency, NCIS, for more information. And she soon enlisted some important allies: Cilla McCain, is an author and advocate for bereaved military families.\n\nI just do not believe that he pulled that trigger, said McCain.\n\nAnd Michael Maloney, is a forensic consultant who had once worked for NCIS.\n\nThis is a homicide. There was someone else in that room, he said.\n\nMaloney had left NCIS before the Stahlman incident, but NCIS hired blood stain expert Mark Reynolds.\n\nI see no evidence of homicide in the materials provided to me whatsoever, he told Van Sant.\n\nReynolds says Michael Maloney is guessing, or just plain wrong.\n\nThere's no evidence to support anything other than a suicide, Reynolds said.\n\nTwo experts, two very different views.\n\nIf this was a suicide, I would have to accept it Kim said. But it's hard when you know that that's not what it was. … the truth needs to come out.\n\nFIGHTING FOR THE TRUTH\n\nKim Stahlman: You have to be strong as a military wife.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Kim Stahlman has been at war. With a small group of allies, she is targeting the toughest hill in Washington D.C.—Capitol Hill\n\nKim Stahlman: All I've ever done is tell them that I want the truth.\n\nShe says she's trying to honor the legacy of her husband, Col. Michael Stahlman, one of the highest-ranking American fatalities in the Iraq War.\n\nKim Stahlman: This is a guy that gave his all.\n\nColonel Stahlman was a decorated Marine; a flight officer and a military lawyer. In July 2008, just weeks from going home for R&R, he was found with a gunshot wound to the head on a Ramadi military base. The Armed Forces Medical Examiner ruled it a suicide, but Kim has never believed her husband shot himself.\n\nKim Stahlman: It was not self-inflicted. Absolutely not. Someone shot him.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Someone shot him?\n\nKim Stahlman [affirms]: Mm-hmm.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Are you certain of that?\n\nKim Stahlman: I have no doubt.\n\nKim says her ultimate goal is to get that manner of death changed on the death certificate.\n\nKim Stahlman It's important to have the truth on that document … because of the man that Mike was.\n\nSuzanna Andrews | Reporter: He was just this all-American guy. … very confident, very decent.\n\nSuzanna Andrews and Mike Stahlman lived on the same block in Chevy Chase, Maryland, as teenagers.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: My mother still remembers him as the most polite child any of us ever brought home.\n\nDecades later, she wrote about his death as a contributing editor for More magazine.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: I started out wanting to know what had really happened.\n\nMike Stahlman, son of a U.S. diplomat, had lived in India, Jordan and Panama as a boy before returning home to become one of a few good men.\n\nMichael Stahlman, a decorated Marine, a flight officer and a military lawyer, was described as an All-American guy and poster boy for the Marines Kim Stahlman\n\nPeter Van Sant: Was there a pride there and a sense of I really wanna serve my country?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh yeah. … I mean, he's the one that elected to go to a Marine … military academy in the 9th grade.\n\nAs a cadet, Stahlman was a Marine recruiter's dream. He appeared in a promotional video.\n\nBy April of 1987, Michael Stahlman was in flight school in Pensacola, Florida, when he landed in a bar in Florence, South Carolina, and boldly approached a striking woman across the room.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what did you think when you looked at this guy?\n\nKim Stahlman: To be honest with you? … I didn't think anything, you know?\n\nBut she admits something about the swashbuckling young flight officer struck a chord - especially after they ran into each other again the next day at an air show.\n\nKim Stahlman: He came up to me, he said, You remember me? And I'm like ah, Yeah.\n\nStahlman offered to show her around, but she says he was quickly distracted by the triplet baby boys of someone she knew.\n\nKim Stahlman: And he stopped, and he got down on his knee and he was talking to the -- these triplets … And I thought, Oh, my God. That's someone special right there. And that's when I knew. I knew!\n\nIn less than three weeks, Kim and Mike's relationship took off.\n\nThis was my soulmate, Kim Stahlman said of her husband Michael. He'd done so much. He was worldly. He was kind. Kim Stahlman\n\nKim Stahlman: He rode his motorcycle up and that's when he proposed to me.\n\nPeter Van Sant: The guy has Hollywood good looks. He's a pilot. And he's riding a motorcycle. This is like Top Gun.\n\nKim Stahlman: He sold his motorcycle for my -- first ring, too. He was a gem.\n\nThey married six months later. Two daughters followed: MacKenna in 1997, and Piper in 2004.\n\nMacKenna is 21 now and still remembers her father's kind heart.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: During Christmas it was his duty -- was the cameraman. … We'd wake up and we're, like, Don't go in the room until Dad has the camera ready. And -- that was probably one of the earliest memories I have.\n\nLike many military families, the Stahlmans moved around the world: South Carolina, California, and Japan, where Kim says she co-founded a counseling program on the base.\n\nKim Stahlman: We worked specifically with rape victims and spousal abuse victims.\n\nMike's career was on the move, too. By the early 1990s, he'd traded in his wings for a law degree. Kim says all the work and travel took a toll.\n\nKim Stahlman: We moved every two -- sometimes every year.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is it fair to say there was some trouble in the marriage?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh, yeah. We have ups and downs like everybody else.\n\nAfter about 20 years of high-stress military life, Mike Stahlman had risen through the ranks to become a full colonel.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: He was about to retire.\n\nBut there still was one thing Col. Stahlman wanted to do. He'd never been deployed to a combat zone.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: He volunteered.\n\nKim Stahlman: This is his last hurrah, you know. He wants to do this.\n\nAbout three months after he arrived in Iraq, something happened to Michael Stahlman – something that even a Marine's family could never have expected.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: My mom … sat me down. And she was, like, Something's happened to your father.\n\nA CRYPTIC EMAIL\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: We would receive incoming every now and then. There'd be shots fired.\n\nIn July 2008, Gary Morrell was a Marine gunnery sergeant in Iraq when he picked Col. Michael Stahlman up at the airport.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Good guy?\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Good -- oh, awesome, outstanding.\n\nColonel Stahlman would be stationed at Camp Ramadi. The area had seen some of the fiercest fighting earlier in the war.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: The front gate is still getting shot at, vehicles getting hit … it's still a rough area.\n\nDay-to-day life was tough. But Morell says Col. Stahlman, who was working to help rebuild Iraq's legal system, stood strong.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you ever sense that he was depressed?\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Oh, never.\n\nA triathlete, Stahlman was known to work out every morning.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: He was always such a happy man. I don't ever recall him being upset or sad. I don't remember him crying, ever.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did Mike have any history of depression?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\nCol. Michael Stahlman Kim Stahlman\n\nBy the summer of 2008, Kim says Mike was looking forward to coming home for R&R to spend time with her and the girls.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: We were so close. I mean it was the home stretch.\n\nIn June, he emailed: …just 2 more months until I come home. Missing you terribly!!! and in late July, the day before the shooting: …everything is great!\n\nSgt. Morell saw Stahlman the night before the shooting.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: He was anxious to go home, he was ready.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: In the morning he wakes up. He goes running, we believe.\n\nDave Fuentes: I was … talking to some of the other medics, when the call came in.\n\nArmy Medic Dave Fuentes says he was just coming off shift at about 8 a.m., when he responded to a shooting scene.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What condition was Colonel Stahlman in when you first laid eyes on him?\n\nDave Fuentes: He was in very rough shape.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Critical condition?\n\nDave Fuentes: Absolutely 100 percent critical.\n\nIt was still the previous night back in Connecticut, where Kim and the kids were visiting her parents. At about 11 p.m., she says she found a cryptic email in her inbox – apparently from her husband. The email became central to this case.\n\nKim Stahlman [reading email]: Kim, sorry about … what you are about to find out. I love you and always will. You and the girls are the best thing that ever happened to me. Love Mike.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did you think?\n\nKim Stahlman: Honestly, I immediately thought one of our close friends had been killed.\n\nThe next morning, Kim got a devastating phone call.\n\nKim Stahlman: They said -- We're calling … to inform you that your husband, Colonel Michael Ross Stahlman, was found this morning … with a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his left temple.\n\nHer husband was still alive, but unconscious.\n\nKim Stahlman: It was like they took my past, my present and my future from me in that one phone call.\n\nKim says she was in shock. To some, that last email to her read like a suicide note. Kim had the email examined by a linguist.\n\nKim Stahlman: She said, This is not a suicide note.\n\nSgt. Morell says he doesn't see it as a suicide note, either. He says Marines are trained to avoid divulging too much information when writing home from war zones.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You gotta talk in code … This is something that I could see me sending my wife and I felt I've sent her that letter before.\n\nHe says the email could have been a reference to any number of things, including a dangerous or classified military operation or personal finances.\n\nKim Stahlman: All I could think of, his eyes. His beautiful eyes.\n\nA few days later, Kim and her daughters arrived at Mike's bedside at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, where he'd been flown for treatment.\n\nKim Stahlman: And I walked in the room and it didn't even look like him. His face was so swollen.\n\nDays turned into weeks with no improvement. Slowly Michael Stahlman was slipping away.\n\nAfter Mike had been in the hospital about two months, Kim decided to sit 11-year-old MacKenna down to say her father would be taken off life support.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: And she was like … we're not detecting any more brain waves … and that's when I had to lay in bed with him and say goodbye for the last time. … I just remember, like, the lights being dimmed, and I can still smell the hospital room [cries].\n\nThe Stahlman family Kim Stahlman\n\nColonel Michael Stahlman died on Oct. 5, 2008, the day before his 21st wedding anniversary and the month before his 46th birthday.\n\nKim Stahlman: I've never seen anyone die before. … I literally saw his spirit leave his body.\n\nHis funeral was at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: It was a closed casket. I just was hysterical pretty much the whole day.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Kim says she was still troubled by the information authorities had given her -- beginning with the detail that Mike, a righty, had been shot on the left side of his head.\n\nKim Stahlman: Mike did nothing with his left hand.\n\nAs time went on, her skepticism turned to anger and determination to find the truth.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You became an investigator.\n\nKim Stahlman: Yeah.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Kim said right away, I wanna do my own investigation.\n\nWriter Suzanna Andrews says Col. Stahlman's job easily could have made him a murder target.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Mike was in Iraq at a time when we were trying to sort of put the country back on its feet after the war.\n\nColonel Stahlman's work notes suggest he was aware of local officials on the take. He wrote: We want to stop IP's [Iraqi Police] from taking bribes. And Andrews says some U.S. contractors were corrupt.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: I think it would be really … hard to … have not stumbled across some kind of corruption there.\n\nSgt. Morell says Marines were vulnerable everywhere -- even on base.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You know, our perimeter was very open.\n\nHe says the security fences were a joke.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You could get on and get off.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, somebody from the outside could just come onto base.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Correct.\n\nKim says it's also possible Col. Stahlman had enemies closer than he thought.\n\nPeter Van Sant: If Mike did not take his own life, who did?\n\nKim Stahlman: Gut instinct is … it was somebody Mike knew and close in rank.\n\nPeter Van Sant: If you believe it's a homicide … somebody had to pull that trigger.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Right.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Give me a sense of the banter that was going' around.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: That it was somebody inside. You know, strictly all rumors.\n\nMedic Dave Fuentes says he remembers hearing rumors, too, about a crime at a nearby facility – a crime he heard Michael Stahlman may have been investigating.\n\nDave Fuentes: A couple other high-ranking personnel … had been relieved of duty due to -- stealing fuel from post and selling it to the locals.\n\nBy a year after the shooting, Kim Stahlman had decided to go on the offensive. And before long, she had some very influential allies.\n\nMike Maloney | Former NCIS: All of the evidence that I have, and all of the reconstruction I've done, point to this being a homicide, and absolutely not to being a suicide.\n\nA QUEST BEGINS\n\nAfter her husband's death, Kim Stahlman was paralyzed by grief.\n\nKim Stahlman: It's like a punch in the stomach…\n\nKim Stahlman: … he loved his girls. He wouldn't have left 'em\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: She was basically a recluse. She never left the house. And it was really rough seeing her like that.\n\nKim emerged from her fog of grief and began a quest for the facts about her husband's death. In October 2008, she filed a Freedom of Information request with NCIS, which had arrived at the scene some hours after Stahlman was found. Kim says she received about 1,500 documents and a small batch of photos.\n\nThe military says that my husband committed suicide, but I know it was murder, Kim Stahlman told 48 Hours. CBS News\n\nKim Stahlman: They didn't really show you anything. You know? And they were copies of copies. Like the photocopies.\n\nScouring the reports, Kim says she learned her husband had been found in bed, lying on his back, next to a bloodstained nightstand. A bloodied sheet was hanging from the top bunk obscuring his body. A Bible and family photo lay next to him. Stahlman's 9 mm Beretta was on the bed, too. One first responder noted the gun appeared wedged between him and the mattress.\n\nInvestigators took photos of Michael Stahlman's quarters in Ramadi, Iraq, after he was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Responders found Stahlman in his bed [bottom bunk] with a sheet hanging down from the top bunk, obscuring him from view. Evidence photo\n\nSuzanna Andrews: The gun is half under him around his waist but pointed down.\n\nAccording to NCIS documents, a bullet from his gun traveled through his head, then through a wall and came to rest on the floor of a storage locker in the housing unit next door. An earwitness had reported hearing a loud noise around sunrise. The information did not satisfy Kim.\n\nKim Stahlman: There were little flags, things that jumped out at me.\n\nBelieving the suicide determination had been made in haste, Kim says she wanted a closer investigation of the case. In the coming years, she would contact the military, members of Congress, and even the White House.\n\nKim Stahlman: I was looking … for anything any – any help I could get.\n\nSince the shooting, Kim had been fighting her war alone. But in 2009, she met an important ally: author Cilla McCain.\n\nCilla McCain: She was grieving, totally grief stricken, but fighting.\n\nMcCain has a special interest in mysterious military deaths. She supports the families with a website and advocates for them with lawmakers.\n\nCilla McCain: I know of 166 families who believe that their loved one was murdered and it has been labeled a suicide.\n\nTogether, Kim and McCain say they took on the U.S. military.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Here was this duo, these Southern women … up against this brass wall. You know, all these officers and soldiers and institutions who just didn't take them seriously at all.\n\nBefore long, word of their war would win them another important ally. This one had a worldwide reputation investigating cases at, of all places, NCIS itself.\n\nMike Maloney | Former NCIS: If it bled, if it blew up, if it caught fire … generally, we were involved in handling the forensic issues of that.\n\nOver a long career at NCIS, Michael Maloney investigated some of their highest-profile cases. He'd left NCIS and was teaching forensics when a student told him about the Stahlman case. He offered to take an initial look pro bono, but gave Kim a warning.\n\nMichael Maloney: Almost 100 percent of the time the death is exactly what it's reported to be.\n\nMaloney wanted better quality photos and thought authorities might have them. So, he helped Kim file another Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nKim Stahlman: There were almost 200 photos on that disc. If I hadn't asked for those, they woulda never volunteered 'em.\n\nMaloney says those photos led to a breakthrough.\n\nMichael Maloney: It changed the whole game.\n\nPoring over the new photos, Maloney reached a startling conclusion.\n\nMichael Maloney: This is a homicide … There was someone else in that room.\n\nHe believes an assailant probably fired two shots: one missed and the other went through Stahlman's head. He also believes the scene then could have been made to look like Stahlman had been alone and shot himself with his own gun.\n\nKim Stahlman: All I remember is him sayin', We've got a problem. This was staged.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And when you heard those words?\n\nKim Stahlman: It was like, Oh, holy Jesus. I'm right.\n\nMaloney set up a simulation for 48 Hours to help illustrate his theory: the trajectory of the bullet authorities recovered in the locker does not account for Col. Stahlman's injury.\n\nWhy is the trajectory of the bullet way up here and his injury is here? Michael Maloney asked, pointing to a diagram. They should overlap each other. Because the bullet has to cause the injury. CBS News\n\nMichael Maloney [pointing to top of a graph]: Why is the trajectory of the bullet way up here and his injury is here? [pointing to bottom area of graph]. They should overlap each other. Because the bullet has to cause the injury.\n\nIn his theory, Maloney says the bullet hole in the wall likely came from the assailant's first shot -- a shot that Maloney believes missed Col. Stahlman. Evidence photo\n\nMaloney says the bullet hole in the wall, as seen in the investigator's photo, likely came from the assailant's first shot.\n\nMichael Maloney: For the first shot, he's going to fire and he's going to miss. That explains the hole in the wall.\n\nHe says what he sees around that hole is a telltale sign that the bullet never went through Stahlman's head.\n\nMichael Maloney: It has the appearance of gunshot residue.\n\nPeter Van Sant: All these little dots\n\nMichael Maloney: All those little dots --\n\nPeter Van Sant: This could be gunshot residue –\n\nMichael Maloney: Burned … and unburned particles of gunpowder coming out of the muzzle of the weapon.\n\nMichael Maloney points to what he believe is gunshot residue in a photo taken by investigators CBS News\n\nIn his interpretation, those particles would be unlikely to have hit that area of the wall, if Col. Stahlman's head had been in the way of the bullet.\n\nMichael Maloney: This is when I began to believe that, perhaps, this wasn't the shot. This wasn't the fatal shot.\n\nThe fatal shot, says Maloney, would have been the second one.\n\nMichael Maloney: And as he [Stahlman] starts to move, the shooter is going to rock up as well and right in here, the shooter can fire as well.\n\nHe believes the bullet may have come to rest in the mattress, though that alleged second bullet has never been found. Maloney thinks he knows why.\n\nPeter Van Sant: All of this was destroyed, correct?\n\nMichael Maloney: All of this was burned as a biohazard, yes.\n\nMichael Maloney: Now let's look at that nightstand.\n\nThe bloody nightstand, says Maloney, supports his theory, too, because he says the stains only cover certain areas --\n\nMichael Maloney [pointing to evidence photo]: But we have none in this area or this area.\n\n-- leaving unstained sections called voids.\n\nMichael Maloney: There was something blocking the blood from hitting this surface of the nightstand.\n\nThat something, he says, could have been the assailant's body.\n\nMichael Maloney: Someone sitting on the nightstand, facing his bed.\n\nAnd Maloney says there's more evidence Stahlman may not have been alone. He says it looks to him like a woman could have been in the room.\n\nMichael Maloney: Well, there was a … tampon found on the floor.\n\nThere also was a dirty strip of fabric nearby.\n\nMichael Maloney: It … certainly would have the appearance of a sheer bathrobe tie or something like that.\n\nPeter Van Sant: There has been speculation that … Mike Stahlman perhaps had a girlfriend there.\n\nMichael Maloney: Well … what you propose is well within the realm of possibility.\n\nKim Stahlman [negates]: No. Uh-uh.\n\nPeter Van Sant: A one-night stand with someone?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. I would have known, I think.\n\nBut either way, Maloney says the strongest evidence supporting his theory of homicide is that sheet hanging over Stahlman's bed. It had blood on both sides. But, he says, what's most important is a particular type of stain called misting.\n\nMichael Maloney [looking at a photo of the bloody sheet ]: Look at this misting … The problem is, this on the outside of the sheet. … this tells me that this side of the sheet had to be facing or oriented towards his injuries at the time they occurred.\n\nHe says if the sheet was hanging down during the shooting, as it was found by first responders, the misting stains would have been on the inside. Maloney demonstrated for 48 Hours.\n\nMichael Maloney: A lot of times when you are over there, you do drop a sheet … It blocks the light coming in from the windows. But, if you want to talk to someone, you can just pull the sheet back, and tuck it up.\n\nMaloney demonstrated by tucking the sheet into the springs of the overhead bunk.\n\nThe bloodstains at the scene, he says, strongly suggest the sheet was tucked up, out of the way, when the fatal shot was fired.\n\nMichael Maloney [demonstrating in simulation]: …and it causes the bloodstain up here, the bloodstain pattern here, the misting stain, and the rest of the bloodstain from the exit wound goes down into the pillow and into the mattress.\n\nRemember, the mattress was destroyed.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How about the sheets and the blood?\n\nKim Stahlman: Burnt. Everything.\n\nKim Stahlman filed a lawsuit in 2013, alleging authorities conducted little or no investigation into various aspects of the scene.\n\nCilla McCain: They did not follow their own protocols, and that's why this has happened.\n\nA federal judge dismissed the case saying the court had no jurisdiction. So, Kim filed again with a military review board. Her lawyer says the board offered no assistance either.\n\nMichael Maloney: This required a thorough investigation. It didn't get one.\n\nMichael Maloney says he sent his 2011 report to his old employer, NCIS, and says they refused to meet with him about his findings. They declined to give 48 Hours an on-camera interview.\n\nBut there is another side to this story.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Kim, it turns out that NCIS did do a forensic investigation … We have some clips … that we would like you to listen to.\n\nTWO EXPERTS, TWO CONCLUSIONS\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you believe that NCIS ever did a proper forensic examination of the shooting scene?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. No.\n\n48 Hours submitted its own Freedom of Information Act request, and we discovered it's not quite that simple.\n\nMark Reynolds: My name is Dr. Mark Reynolds. I'm a forensic consultant and I investigated the, ah, death of Colonel Stahlman.\n\nDr. Mark Reynolds was brought on by NCIS in 2012 to review the case more than three years after the shooting, including Michael Maloney's report.\n\nNCIS gave the veteran homicide investigator and bloodstain pattern expert permission to speak with 48 Hours.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you have everything you needed?\n\nMark Reynolds: I -- the short answer is no. … I was quite critical of the response by NCIS in my report about the scene.\n\nReynolds told 48 Hours he concurs with Michael Maloney that the shooting scene should have been handled differently.\n\nMark Reynolds: A better documentation of the scene and better exhibit collection would've been helpful … and it wasn't done.\n\nHe says that's partly because Col. Stahlman was still alive when he was found. So, first responders rightly were focused more on stabilizing him than preserving evidence. But Reynolds disagrees with Maloney on just about everything else.\n\nMark Reynolds: All the scene indicators that Mr. Maloney has raised -- are either equivocal or wrong.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Mike Maloney has a great reputation. … So, we're supposed to believe, in this particular case, the man doesn't know what he's talking about?\n\nMark Reynolds: In this particular case, believe the science. And the science is there.\n\nReynolds says Maloney based many of his conclusions on speculation. He says his own analysis of photos of the bloodstains, the nightstand, the sheet, the bullet hole and the trajectory, yielded no evidence anyone else was involved in Stahlman's death. Reynolds says the unstained area on the nightstand is too narrow to be meaningful.\n\nMark Reynolds [looking at a photo of the nightstand]: If Mr. Maloney is suggesting that that … might've been the leg of the attacker … it's three inches … That's a fairly thin leg.\n\nAnd what about that sheet hanging from the bunk above Stahlman's bed, the one that Michael Maloney claims has bloodstain misting on the wrong side?\n\nMark Reynolds: Transfer bloodstains look like spatter even under the microscope.\n\nReynolds says the bloodstains could have been transferred there by first responders.\n\nPeter Van Sant: In your opinion, there's nothing conclusive about this blood issue on the sheet?\n\nMark Reynolds: No.\n\nAnd he says the same is true of the gray spots near the bullet hole, which Maloney suspects are gunshot residue.\n\nMark Reynolds: It was never determined. There was no sampling ever done. To go from a grayish particulate matter on a wall … to extrapolate that as being gunshot residue I think is very dangerous leap. It could've been anything on that wall.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You don't even go to this potential two-shot scenario?\n\nMark Reynolds: There's no scientific evidence to say two shots were fired.\n\nDocuments indicate authorities did check the mattress for a bullet and didn't find one. And Mark Reynolds says Michael Maloney made miscalculations in analyzing photos of the scene. He says when those errors are corrected, the path of the bullet that went through the wall does line up with Col. Stahlman's head wound.\n\nMark Reynolds believes Michael Maloney made miscalculations in analyzing photos of the scene. Reynolds says when those errors are corrected, the path of the bullet that went through the wall does line up with Col. Stahlman's head wound.\n\nMark Reynolds [showing the diagram]: Did you get that?\n\nPeter Van Sant: That matches.\n\nMark Reynolds: That matches.\n\nBut what about the curious items on the floor? Like that piece of fabric that Maloney feels could have belonged to a woman?\n\nMark Reynolds: Pure speculation.\n\nAnd that tampon?\n\nMark Reynolds: Many soldiers around the world carry tampons in case they get shot because they put the tampon in the bullet hole and it stems the flow of blood.\n\nReynold's conclusion?\n\nMark Reynolds: There is no obvious scientific evidence to indicate that it was a homicide.\n\n48 Hours informed Michael Maloney about Mark Reynolds' findings. Maloney insists Reynolds is wrong.\n\nMichael Maloney: I stand by my assertion that the best explanation given the evidence that I've examined, does not indicate suicide.\n\nTwo experts, two very different conclusions.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Have you ever heard of a man by the name of Mark Reynolds?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Never?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\n48 Hours wanted to see what Kim Stahlman thought of Mark Reynolds' findings.\n\nPeter Van Sant [with Kim]: We have some clips from the interview that we did with Mark Reynolds that we would like you to listen to.\n\n48 Hours showed Kim Van Sant's interviews with Reynolds on an iPad:\n\nPETER VAN SANT [looking at a photo of Col. Stahlman's bunk]: Mike Maloney says at best, this is an ambiguous death scene. MARK REYNOLDS: My interpretation of this is there's strong contextual and scientific support for it being self-inflicted. There is no contextual or scientific support in my opinion for it being a homicide.\n\nPETER VAN SANT: And the fact that it's on the outside of the sheet, when the shooting occurred on the inside ... is an indication that someone pulled the sheet down. MARK REYNOLDS: I think he doesn't understand how difficult it is to classify bloodstains on fabrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Stahlman [reacting to the video]: Yeah, I mean, I guess he's got his opinion. I don't know what to say.\n\nKim says she brought the case to other experts who supported Maloney's findings, and she still stands by Maloney.\n\nKim Stahlman: I know that Maloney broke down the room pixel by pixel -- that's all I know.\n\nAnd Kim is furious. She says authorities should have showed her the Reynolds report years ago.\n\nKim Stahlman [emotional]: Why didn't they show me that? Or tell me so that I could at least know. I don't understand why NCIS did not bring that to my attention, ever.\n\nKim says she has never felt authorities have respected her. In fact, in 2012, she says she discovered an email showing someone at NCIS appears to have blamed her for her husband's death.\n\nPeter Van Sant [reading the email]: It was a tragic suicide contributed by the pressures he was under to include stress piled on by his wife, who now believes/pretends it was a storybook marriage …\n\nKim Stahlman: I never said it was a storybook marriage. Never. … I have said it was a marriage with ups and downs.\n\nAs 48 Hours discovered in his emails, Col. Michael Stahlman may have been battling an enemy within.\n\nWHAT IS THE TRUTH?\n\nKim Stahlman has always accused NCIS of not conducting a thorough investigation.\n\nKim Stahlman: I think … they thought they could get away with their mistakes.\n\nBut NCIS documents suggest otherwise -- that evidence was collected, people were questioned, and many of Kim's concerns were answered.\n\nThey also provided her with all those photos and thousands of documents, many of which were passed on to 48 Hours. Among them, emails between Kim and Mike in the final months of his life. Some are loving and upbeat. But there are others that raise troubling questions about Mike and the marriage, like one from Kim sent about two weeks before the shooting:\n\nI just can't keep putting myself on a guilt trip anymore and blame myself for our problems.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What problems are you talking about in this?\n\nKim Stahlman: We had gotten to the point where we really didn't communicate. … and so we were talking about seeing a counselor for that.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You went on to say, after that, I can't make any promises because at this point, I feel it is about life and death for me. I can't stay in an unhealthy relationship.\n\nKim Stahlman: Right.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Here's the next quote: I know I've done some terrible, hurtful things to you and vica versa. … What's the terrible thing?\n\nKim Stahlman: Well to me -- I can't think of a specific thing, but ...\n\nPeter Van Sant: It sounds like your relationship is almost at the end of the line here.\n\nKim Stahlman: I'm a bit of a drama queen. … But it didn't -- that's not where it ended. And it doesn't show the conversations we had on the phone.\n\nIt's that last email Mike Stahlman apparently wrote to his wife not long before the shooting that strikes some as the strongest proof of suicide.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is this in your opinion a suicide note?\n\nStuart Bowen: No. Clearly not.\n\nStuart Bowen may be Kim Stahlman's best hope of getting authorities to listen. Bowen was the George W. Bush administration's Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Kim first contacted him in 2011. He says he reviewed her legal filings and Michael Maloney's report and discussed the report with Maloney extensively.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What have you concluded?\n\nStuart Bowen: It was not a suicide. I believe that he was murdered.\n\nBowen says authorities may have cut corners early on.\n\nStuart Bowen: It might be the case that the rush to judgment … led to practices that departed from best practices.\n\nThough in 2017 Bowen resigned from a government job in Texas amid unrelated ethics allegations which he denies, he has become one of Kim's most important supporters.\n\nStuart Bowen: She's committed to the truth about what happened.\n\nBowen and Kim have helped Cilla McCain and others push Congress for a bill of rights for bereaved families. McCain says many have nowhere else to turn.\n\nKim Stahman and supporters for a bill of rights for bereaved families take on Capitol Hill CBS News\n\nCilla McCain: There's no court in which they can say, Hey … let's hear this fairly with unbiased eyes and ears. It doesn't exist for military families.\n\nRecently, another significant step forward. Bowen says he convinced the military's new chief medical examiner to take another look at the official findings in the case.\n\nStuart Bowen: He assured me that he's going to review it closely and discuss it widely.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is that a big deal?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh, God. Yeah.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Because what can that medical examiner do?\n\nKim Stahlman: Change … the death certificate.\n\nAfter spending about 10 years looking into this case, Cilla McCain is writing a book about it with Kim.\n\nCilla McCain: I have pored over thousands -- thousands of documents. I have talked to anybody that I could find.\n\nMcCain says in her experience, authorities rarely change their findings. And last summer, NCIS sent 48 Hours a statement saying:\n\nNCIS has thoroughly investigated this case and we continue to stand by our investigative findings.\n\nNCIS's independent expert Mark Reynolds insists the science strongly suggests how Col. Stahlman sustained his fatal wound. But Reynolds also surprised 48 Hours.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you feel 100-percent certain that this is a suicide?\n\nMark Reynolds: No. I think that -- if it was a hidden ... homicide, it was sophisticated and ... it won't be determined forensically. It'll be determined investigatively.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Would you be professionally troubled … if this this case was changed to undetermined?\n\nMark Reynolds: Would I be professionally troubled? No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Can you live with undetermined?\n\nKim Stahlman: That's like saying, Eh, it can be this, it can be that. No. I may have to live with it, however I don't want to. I don't think it's fair to my children.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You've been described as a woman in denial about all of this.\n\nKim Stahlman [affirms]: Mm-hmm.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You're not in denial?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. No.\n\nFar from it, she insists.\n\nKim Stahlman: It would have been easier for me if it had been a suicide. At least I could move on with my freakin' life.\n\nKim recently visited her husband's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. She's now thinking of moving his remains closer to home.\n\nKim Stahlman: A man gave his entire life to his country, and for what? They didn't support him in the end.\n\nAs for the man they loved, Col. Stahlman's family knows they may never prove how he died, but they will always be proud of how he lived.\n\nIt's my duty to carry on his legacy, MacKenna Stahlman, now 21, said. My father … was probably the best man that I have ever met and might ever will meet. Kim Stahlman\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: It's my duty to carry on his legacy and do great things so he'll be proud of me in whatever I end up doing in my life. ... My father … was probably the best man that I have ever met and might ever will meet.\n\nHe's a man she still sometimes meets when she closes her eyes at night.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: … all of a sudden there's like, a knock on the door, and the door opens and it's Dad. … And then … I wake up and I'm, like, Nope, that was just a dream.\n\nKim Stahlman: There's no other man I've ever loved...\n\nKim Stahlman: I know I'll never meet another Mike Stahlman.
SALT LAKE CITY -- The Mormon church said Tuesday it will sever all ties with the Boy Scouts of America at the end of next year and place its remaining 425,000 boys into a gospel-focused youth program it is developing. The move ends a nearly century-old relationship that was based on their shared values.\n\nThe announcement by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Boy Scouts didn't come as a complete surprise after the religion last year removed 185,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 18, signaling that an end to the long-time alliance was near.\n\nJoining the Boy Scouts is practically automatic among Mormon boys, and the religion has long been the biggest sponsor of Boy Scout troops in the United States. The Mormon boys who will be leaving represent about 18.5 percent of the 2.3 million youths in the organization.\n\nThe Mormon church said in a statement that the move is about creating its own youth program that it can use for its increasingly global membership, but the two organizations' values clearly have been diverging in recent years.\n\nThe Boy Scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. Last week, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to Scouts BSA to account for the inclusion of girls.\n\nLike other conservative faiths, the Mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. The church initially said it was deeply troubled by the Boy Scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nThe religion has also traditionally used separate youth programs for boys and girls.\n\nThe Mormon church said in a statement the new program that will start in 2020 will help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of God.\n\nThe still to be developed program will likely include outdoor activities and character building similar to Boy Scouts, but it won't be modeled after Boy Scouts or use ranks. The 14-to-18-year-old boys that left the Boy Scouts already focus on church-related activities and community service.\n\nMore than half of the church's 16 million members live outside the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America in a statement thanked the thousands of Mormons who have served as scout leaders and wished the religion well on its new program. The organization said individual Mormons who wish to stay in Boy Scouts would be integrated into other troops.\n\nThe Boy Scouts' move to allow girls, announced last October, marked the organization's latest momentous policy shift.\n\nThe organization already has started allowing girls into the Cub Scouts. So far, nearly 4,000 girls have joined roughly 170 Cub Scout packs participating in the first phase of the new policy, and the pace is expected to intensify this summer under a nationwide multimedia recruitment campaign titled Scout Me In.\n\nThough the flagship program's name is changing, the parent organization will remain the Boy Scouts of America, and the Cub Scouts - its program serving children from kindergarten through fifth grade - will keep its title, as well.\n\nThe Boy Scout movement had been entrenched in Mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nIn 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of its alliance with the Boy Scouts.\n\nA Boy Scout training complex in West Virginia is named after former Mormon church President Thomas S. Monson, a longtime member of the Boy Scouts' executive board and a major supporter who died earlier this year.
KNOX COUNTY, Indiana -- We came to Indiana looking for one of life's most elusive secrets.\n\nWe'd heard that deep within Knox County, Indiana -- back among cornfields -- there was a cluster of people who had all unlocked the mystery of a long and happy marriage.\n\nBut here's what's even more remarkable: they're all related.\n\nTogether, the eight Clinkenbeard siblings have amassed nearly half a millennia of marriage -- 449 years in total. So I figured if anyone had the secret to wedded bliss, it would have to be these couples.\n\nThe Clinkenbeards and their spouses CBS News\n\nI gathered them for a series of interviews, and here's what I learned: If you want to stay married forever, women, you need to speak your minds.\n\nI could tell when she was ticked, said Jim Clinkenbeard.\n\nOr not.\n\nI usually keep my mouth shut, said Barbara Kirk.\n\nAnd men, you need to be deferential.\n\nYou treat a lady like a lady, said Bruce Clinkenbeard.\n\nOr not.\n\nI said, 'I love to fish and I'm not going to change that,' said Paul Clinkenbeard.\n\nUnfortunately, almost everything I got was a contradiction.\n\nDorothy Clinkenbeard, right Clinkenbeard family\n\nReally, the only thing the Clinkenbeards could agree on was what their mother Dorothy taught them and told them repeatedly -- that, except in very rare circumstances, divorce should not be an option.\n\nShe instilled that in us kids, you know, Bruce said.\n\nMy mom was pretty stickler about that, said Bill Clinkenbeard.\n\nWhen we said 'I do,' to me that meant however long we lived, said Dan Yagle.\n\nIt meant suffering through some bumpy times, but the oldest brother John says it's well worth it in the end.\n\nWe've been married 65 years, he said.\n\nJohn Clinkenbeard, holding a picture of him and his wife Lillian CBS News\n\nJohn sat on the couch alone because his wife, Lillian, is in the hospital.\n\nI don't know how I'd get along without her.\n\nI never got my easy answer to what makes a happy marriage.\n\nWe love one another, Paul said.\n\nBut I did get eight solid reasons -- to never give up looking.\n\nAs Ed Kirk put it, I couldn't imagine life without her.\n\nTo contact On the Road, or to send us a story idea, email us: OnTheRoad@cbsnews.com
Love and marriage may go together like a horse and carriage, but personal finances can often un-hitch a couple.\n\nValentine's Day may be a celebration of romance, but it's also a day when would-be Romeos and Juliets get tripped up by financial pitfalls, such as misjudging how much to spend on that candle-lit dinner. But it also underscores a deeper problem that many encounter in their relationships -- when partners have different approaches to handling their money.\n\nFinancial stress is a leading source of relationship trouble, often coming when one partner is a saver and the other is a spender. Yet more than half of Americans say they don't consider whether their potential partner is good at handling their money before they jump into an exclusive relationship, according to a new study from lender Affirm. That could spell problems later on.\n\nMost Americans in committed relationships say financial mistakes made by their partners as a result of bad money management are what upsets them most, said Elizabeth Allin, vice president of communications at Affirm. There's a disconnect between what we're prioritizing when we date someone versus the expectations we have once we're committed.\n\nOne place to start: your potential partner's credit score. Americans with higher credit scores are 14 percent more likely to find love within the next year compared with singles who have scores 100 points lower, the Federal Reserve found in a 2015 study.\n\nPerhaps more important for long-lasting love, couples with similar credit scores are more likely to stick together, the Fed found. That could reflect a shared outlook about financial management and obligations.\n\nBut many Americans aren't honest with their partners about their financial details, a trait that can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. Men are more secretive, with only about half telling their partners how much they earn, according to a survey from financial firm Aspiration. About sixty percent of women spill the beans about their finances to their partners, it found.\n\nIt's better to be upfront with your partner, said Affirm's Allin.\n\nAccording to our research, talking about financial goals and habits transparently can be a factor in a long partnership -- only 4 percent of couples who have been married for over 20 years say it's hard to discuss finances, she noted.\n\nHere are five money mistakes that could doom your romance.\n\nSpending too much on a first date. On Valentine's Day, it might be better to ease up on lavish spending, at least if it's a first date. Only one out of 10 women surveyed by Affirm said it was reasonable for their date to spend more than $100, although one-quarter of men said they thought it was the right amount to spend. Women tend to be more aware of expenses and concerned about unnecessary spending than men, despite the assumption by some men that they must spend a lot to impress right out of the gate, Allin said.\n\nIncurring bank fees -- and library fines. Bank fees such as overdraft charges are considered turnoffs by potential partners, Affirm found. That's because these fees can signal a lack of financial control and result in charges that could have typically been avoided. But respondents said other types of avoidable fees were also red flags -- including parking tickets, credit card late fees and even library fines.\n\nWhen it comes to small mistakes, men and women agreed they would be most upset about a bank account overdraft fee, but nearly half of women ranked this as No. 1 compared to 37 percent of men, Allin said.\n\nNot being financially transparent. Most Americans want to know the nitty-gritty of their partner's financial situation before they tie the knot, including sharing their credit scores and how much they spend on bills. Almost one-third of married millennials said they later regretted not finding out more about their partner's finances before getting hitched, compared with 14 percent of boomers.\n\nHaving a lousy credit score. Men and women agree that a low credit score is a turnoff, according to Affirm. A majority of those with scores above 750 -- considered to be a good score -- take responsibility for paying bills, compared with only 37 percent of those in the subprime range.\n\nHiding credit cards or assets from your partner. It's not uncommon for Americans to hide assets, credit cards or bank accounts from their significant others, an action that can lead to relationship stress. About 15 million U.S. adults who are currently in live-in relationship say they're guilty of such financial infidelity, according to CreditCards.com. Such secrecy can add stress to a relationship -- as well as emotional devastation if the partner discovers the hidden financial activity.
Target's (TGT) policy of letting transgender customers and employees use the bathroom of their choice is now drawing fire from Texas officials. The state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, wants the retailer to spell out how it will protect customers who he suggested could be endangered by the policy.\n\nRegardless of whether Texas legislates on this topic, it is possible that allowing men in women's restrooms could lead to criminal and otherwise unwanted activity, he said in a May 3 letter to Target CEO Brian Cornell. As chief lawyer and law enforcement officer for the State of Texas, I ask that you provide the full text of Target's safety policies regarding the protection of women and children from those who would use the cover of Target's restroom policy for nefarious purposes.\n\nThe move by Texas to pressure Target comes as North Carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding for passing related legislation that the Justice Department says violates civil rights law.\n\nAfter states including North Carolina and Mississippi recently enacted anti-gay laws, Target last month reaffirmed its commitment to protecting gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. The retailer's public stance drew a boycott effort by a conservative Christian group, along with a rebuke from an Alabama city that is home to a Target.\n\nThe national debate over LGBT rights is unlikely to abate anytime soon, but experts say the Target brand is unlikely to face any long-term damage.\n\nTarget's policy is consistent with the message and core values that it's been projecting for years, Melissa Arnoff, senior vice president at Levick, a communications firm specializing in crisis and issues management, said, noting the company's past support of same-sex marriage and parenting, and its decision last year to stop labeling toy aisles by gender.\n\nTarget is doing the right thing to what it has been as a brand, Arnoff said. I'm sure they are looking at the data and sales. As a smart company they will pay more attention to that kind of data than the number of names on a petition.\n\nThe move by Texas to pressure Target comes as North Carolina faces the loss of billions of dollars in federal funding for passing related legislation that the Justice Department says violates civil rights law.\n\nThis topic is not going away, added Ted Marzilli, chief executive officer at YouGov BrandIndex, which conducts daily surveys to monitor public views of 1,500 brands.\n\nTarget has been pretty balanced in terms of how they've been communicating with the media, he said. They are not being combative, they are just saying look, this is our policy, I don't think they are stirring up the pot, or trying to pick a bigger fight.\n\nStill, while consumers' perception of Target fell to an eight-month low after the retailer found itself in the headlines, it's doubtful the company will remain a focus of the story, Marzilli said. Any negative impact is likely to pale in comparison to the retailer's effort to regain consumers' trust after a security breach compromised customer information in late 2013. That was a much, much bigger deal, he said.\n\nTarget spokeswoman Molly Snyder acknowledged getting the Texas attorney general's request to spell out its safety practices. The company has robust procedures, policies and training in place to ensure that our stores are safe places to work and shop, she said, declining further comment.\n\nMarc Rylander, Paxton's communications director, said Target had not yet responded to the attorney general's request. We asked them for safety policies, and we hope to hear from them.\n\nPaxton on Monday voiced support for North Carolina in its legal fight with the U.S. Department of Justice, saying in a statement that he backs the principle that persons should use restrooms and other intimate facilities that correspond with their biological sex.\n\nThe Equal Opportunity Employment Commission last year called equal access to restrooms a significant, basic condition of employment and said that denying access to transgender individuals was discriminatory.\n\nThe federal government and North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory sued each other on Monday, the deadline McCory had been given to confirm his state would not implement the law he signed in March.\n\nNorth Carolina stands to pass up $4.8 billion in funds, mostly educational grants, if it refuses to reverse course, according to an analysis by lawyers at the University of California, Los Angeles Law School, who estimated 37,800 transgender people live in the state.\n\nAs for the financial hit Target may or may not take as a result of its policy, Marzilli said he thinks it's likely the retailer would suffer a one-to-two month impact on its bottom line, and quickly recover.\n\nWhile there a lot of people who are very vocal saying they won't shop at Target, some may shop more at Target, he said. A year from now, Target may be remembered for being one of the first to step up to the plate, which history might prove was the right stance to take.
Kelly Clarkson is officially a mother-of-two!\n\nThe 33-year-old singer gave birth to her second child, a boy, on Tuesday, April 12, confirming the news herself later in the week.\n\nOur little baby boy has arrived!! Remington Alexander Blackstock was born 4/12/16 & he is healthy & we couldn't be happier or more in love! Clarkson tweeted on Thursday morning.\n\nThis is Clarkson's second child with her husband, talent manager Brandon Blackstock. Clarkson is already a mother to her 1-year-old daughter River Rose, and is a stepmom to Blackstock's two children from a previous marriage.\n\nMerry Christmas from the Blackstock clan! @gameofthrones #gameofthrones #winteriscoming #riverisnotworried A photo posted by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson) on Dec 8, 2015 at 2:28pm PST\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say the American Idol champ has been eager to give birth leading up to the big day. Responding to a Trisha Yearwood tweet earlier this month of a coffee mug reading, I can't even, Clarkson wrote, Girl, this describes my day. I feel like Rachel on Friends w/this baby #getoutgetoutgetout hahaha.\n\nShe's also made it no secret that she's had extremely difficult pregnancieswith both River and her newborn son.\n\nHonestly, the first one was really rough, and I was like, 'Oh, it can't happen again,' and no it happened, like, way worse this time, Clarkson shared in a radio interview with Australia's KIIS FM last month, explaining that her ailment is 100 times worse than morning sickness. I just get hospitalized, and I have to get fluids. It's just, like, my body was not made to be pregnant.\n\nI wish I was like the girl that ... it's beautiful, but it's not, she added.\n\nAnd if all goes according to plan, this will be her last pregnancy.\n\nOh, no, we are done, she laughed. Oh good Lord, yes, I can't be pregnant again. This will be our number four total, so we're good.\n\nOne thing she can definitely count on is her husband of two years being a great father to their kids.\n\nWatching my husband love on his daughter all the time, you know, go to her events and just be there and, like, be present is, like, hard to watch but beautiful to watch, Clarkson told Ryan Seacrest during a radio interview in February, fighting back tears. But it's awesome because I know that my kids are going to have that.\n\nI cannot imagine not seeing this kid to his or her full potential and just seeing what she's going to do, what she's going to be like, she continued.
During the 2016 presidential race, Donald Trump famously said I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters.\n\nAnd if he fired that shot in an evangelical church, he could probably get the pastor to help steady his aim.\n\nDespite the titillating details from Stormy Daniels on 60 Minutes this week and the mounting evidence of his infidelity to third wife, Melania, the GOP's so-called values voters—people who loudly condemned Bill Clinton for his infidelity—are standing by President Trump. As one-time Clinton critic Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council said regarding Trump's Stormy sexual misbehavior: We gave him a mulligan.\n\nAs a graduate of Oral Roberts University myself, I don't recall exactly which book of the Bible mentions the mulligan (Proverbs, maybe? It has a Solomonic sound). But the need for forgiveness is certainly a Biblical principle, and the willingness of Christians to forgive human failings is nothing new. Nor is it a symptom of hypocrisy.\n\nBut to receive forgiveness, one must confess the sin first. And President Trump has yet to admit his relationship with Ms. Daniels, much less ask forgiveness for it.\n\nAnd it appears he doesn't need to. After a short-lived 14-point dip in net approval among social conservatives after the Stormy Daniels story broke, President Trump's support among these voters is back around 80 percent, according to Morning Consult. Evangelicals are so willing to support President Trump, they've abandoned their principles on character and morality in order to make room for him.\n\nConsider these numbers:\n\nIn 2011, just 30 percent of evangelical voters believed that an elected official who committed an immoral act in their personal life had the ethical character to hold public office. By October 2016—on the eve of their massive turnout on behalf of p***y-grabbing Donald Trump, that number was up to 72 percent, according to a survey conducted by PRRI and the Brookings Institution.\n\nPerhaps most astonishing, a recent YouGov poll found only half of Trump voters said Trump cheating on his wife with Stormy Daniels would be immoral, even if it did happen. After everything they've learned about him, 56 percent of Trump supporters believe the phrase moral leader describes the president either very well or extremely well.\n\nHow did the same Americans who clamored for Bill Clinton to be impeached for lying about his affairs turn into voters who aren't even sure cheating is immoral at all? It's that magic word:\n\nClinton.\n\nEvangelicals remember how feminists and liberals who claimed to care deeply about the treatment of women in the workplace rallied around Bill Clinton, despite his behavior with a White House intern. Bring up Stormy Daniels to politically active social conservatives and they're likely to bring up Nina Burleigh, the former Time reporter who said during the Clinton scandal that she would be willing to engage in the same activity as Monica Lewinsky to thank him for keeping abortion legal.\n\nAs conservative Townhall.com columnist and Trump supporter Kurt Schlichter puts it: I see no reason not to play by [Democrats'] rules…not allowing the other side to gain an advantage by weaponizing morality against us.\n\nTrump's affairs are a side show, Schlichter tweeted.\n\nI see no reason not to play by the new rules. I don't have to like them, but I refused to unilaterally disarm. If that makes me a terrible person, so be it, and I'll be a terrible person not under a liberal fascist dictatorship. — Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) March 26, 2018\n\nThen there's the other Clinton argument Christians use: Hillary.\n\nEvangelical voters felt under siege during the Obama years, from nuns hit with government mandates regarding birth control to Christian business owners forced to participate in same-sex marriage ceremonies. Many believed a Hillary Clinton presidency would bring even more government assaults against people of faith.\n\nThey note that during a 2015 speech addressing the issue of abortion, for example, candidate Hillary Clinton said deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.\n\nPeople of faith were looking for a politician who would champion their religious faith, not change it.And while an exceptionally profane, likely unfaithful, thrice-married braggart who once publicly supported abortion (as Mark Hemingway calls him in the conservative Weekly Standard magazine this week) doesn't seem like the obvious candidate, Trump got the job.\n\nAs Tony Perkins told Politico.com, the relationship between evangelicals and Trump is transactional. They give the president their loyalty, and he gives them political support.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, he has delivered more than any other president in my lifetime.\n\nIs the transaction worth it? In the Gospel of Mark, Jesus asks For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\n\nThen again, Jesus never voted in a Republican primary.
LOS ANGELES -- Michael C. Hall is a newlywed.\n\nA spokesman for Hall says the former Dexter star married writer Morgan MacGregor on Monday morning at New York City Hall. Publicist Craig Bankey released no other details.\n\nHall and MacGregor first appeared publicly as a couple in 2012.\n\nHall has been performing onstage in New York stage since wrapping Dexter in 2013. MacGregor is a Los Angeles-based book critic.\n\nThis is the 45-year-old actor's third marriage. He was previously wed to actresses Amy Spanger and Jennifer Carpenter.
All the Democratic candidates who ran for president in 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind Joe Biden's search for a running mate 02:04 More Democratic candidates jumped into the presidential race in 2019 than America has seen since the inception of the modern primary system. Here's a look at all the Democrats who campaigned for a chance to take on President Trump in November 2020.\n\nEric Swalwell Biography Although he was born in Iowa in 1980, Swalwell moved with his family to attend middle school and high school in California. He was recruited to play soccer for North Carolina's Campbell University. After suffering an injury, however, he transferred to the University of Maryland. After completing his undergraduate studies, Swalwell earned his J.D. from the University of Maryland and was a congressional intern for former California Rep. Ellen Tauscher. In 2012, while a council member in Dublin City, in California's Alameda County, Swalwell mounted a primary challenge against fellow Democrat and 20-term incumbent Pete Stark in the state's 15th Congressional District, located in the outer suburbs of San Francisco. Although Stark bested him in the primary election, Swalwell beat the incumbent in the general election, which he qualified for because of California's top two primary system. Swalwell says he's running for president 01:40 Since he was sworn-in in 2013, Swalwell has won reelection three times. Although he has been a rank-and-file member of the House Democratic caucus during his congressional tenure, he has raised his profile during the Trump administration as a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, frequently rebuking the president in cable news appearances. On the Intelligence Committee, Swalwell has also strongly defended special counsel Robert Mueller's now-concluded investigation and voiced his concerns about the Trump campaign's contacts with people affiliated with the Russian government, including the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton during the summer of 2016. Issues Swalwell will look to make gun safety reform an integral part of his presidential campaign. He has been strongly critical of the National Rifle Association's (NRA) sway in Congress and has repeatedly lambasted Republicans for not supporting gun control measures. He is hosting a town hall on gun control in Florida Tuesday alongside survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, in which 17 students and staff members were killed by a gunman. Last week, the California Democrat shared a voicemail his office received in which an individual is heard making a death threat against him because of his stance on gun rights. We're going to war. And you're going to be the first motherf***ing casualty, the person in the voicemail posted by Swalwell on Twitter is heard saying. In his post, Swalwell wrote, I'm not afraid of this guy. I'm not afraid of the NRA. I'm not afraid. No fear. #EndGunViolence. Controversy While Swalwell has not been embroiled in any major scandal or controversy during his tenure in Congress, the California Democrat will surely face criticism from Mr. Trump and Republicans on the campaign trail, especially if he secures the party's nomination, because of his staunch defense of the Mueller probe. What Trump says The president has yet to tweet about Swalwell, but his 2020 campaign has strongly criticized the congressman since the release of the Justice Department's summary of the Mueller report. In a memorandum, Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications of the president's campaign, urged television news outlets to challenge Swalwell and other prominent Democrats who said there was evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\n\nTim Ryan Biography Ryan was born and raised in northeastern Ohio in 1973. He played football in high school and was recruited to play for Youngstown State University. Because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to Bowling Green State University, near Toledo. After graduating from college, Ryan earned a J.D. from the University of New Hampshire and worked in the office of longtime Ohio Congressman James Traficant, who was expelled from the House after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. At age 26, Ryan was elected to Ohio's state senate. When his old boss Tradicant became embroiled in scandal, Ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. At 29, he was the youngest member of Congress when he was sworn in 2003. Although he has served eight terms in the House, Ryan gained notoriety following Mr. Trump's unexpected election in November 2016. Citing Democrats' loss of Midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- Ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy Pelosi, then House Minority Leader. After Democrats retook control of the House during the 2018 November midterm elections, the Ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace Pelosi. Ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel. Rep. Tim Ryan announces 2020 run 03:08 Issues Ryan has not staked out a clear ideological agenda during his 15 years in Congress. He is not a member of any of the major Democratic caucuses in the House, like the pro-business New Democrat Coalition or the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He once earned an A rating from the National Rife Association (NRA) and has broken with his party to support fracking measures favored by Republicans. But Ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like Medicare for all. Controversy Ryan's tenure in Congress has largely been scandal-free, but his repeated challenges to Pelosi's leadership are likely to alienate some Democratic primary voters. What Trump says Although Ryan has been a fierce critic of the president, Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about the Ohio congressman.\n\nWayne Messam Screenshot from Wayne Messam's 2020 campaign video Wayne for America Biography Born in Pahokee, Florida and raised in South Bay, Mayor Wayne Messam became the first African American mayor of the city of Miramar after unseating a 16-year incumbent in 2015. Messam's parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica. His father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. Messam earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship Team under legendary coach Bobby Bowden. He would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. Wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, Angela, more than 20 years ago. They have three children, Wayne II, and twin daughters, Kayla and Kyla. Issues While lacking name recognition outside Florida, Messam told CNN that under his leadership, the city of Miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from Hurricane Irma. He has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities. These are issues that have national implications and I'm looking forward to be that agent of change for the American people and I'm so excited to launch my candidacy to be the president of the United States, he said. In his campaign announcement video, the Democrat claimed that Washington is broken, listing problems like rising prescription drug prices, the effects of climate change and crippling student debt. What Trump says Messam has not yet been a target for President Trump.\n\nBeto O'Rourke Beto O'Rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 Biography O'Rourke was born and raised in the Texas border city of El Paso. Although his legal first name is Robert, he has been known as Beto, the nickname Spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like Roberto and Alberto, since childhood. He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities. He managed to topple eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the primary and defeated his Republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. While in Congress, the Texas Democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees. On immigration, O'Rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. In 2014, he called President Obama's executive action creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed Congress. He also backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's leadership challenge against then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016. O'Rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust Cruz in 2018. His robust Senate bid in Texas -- along with his Obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas -- including the state's large and growing Latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. No Democrat had come that close to winning a Senate race in Texas since 1988. Despite the loss, O'Rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. Although he told 60 Minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, O'Rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. Issues In his six years in Congress, O'Rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, LGBT rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights. He often called for improvements to the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. During and after his senate campaign, O'Rourke made immigration a central issue. He has routinely denounced the White House for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the U.S.-Mexico border. He also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship. During a fiery speech in El Paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, O'Rourke condemned Mr. Turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. We know that walls do not save lives. Walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of Mr. Trump's nearby rallies. In the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. Controversy In addition to the scrutiny O'Rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a Senate race, the Texas Democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in Congress and personal life. Although he had a generally liberal voting record in Congress, O'Rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left. In the House, he was a member of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the Democratic Party to support more audacious efforts, like the Green New Deal, to mitigate climate change. During his Senate campaign, O'Rourke refused to back Medicare for all, a proposal many 2020 Democrats have vouched their support for. Medicare for All emerges as first litmus test for 2020 Democratic contenders\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduces 2020 policy test with Green New Deal Some candidness may also follow the lead of O'Rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. In 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a DWI program the following year. O'Rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the Houston Chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. What Trump says Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an O'Rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the Texas Democrat's unsuccessful Senate bid. I thought you were supposed to win before you run for president, Mr. Trump told reporters in December. When the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed O'Rourke's great defeat in November.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper John Hickenlooper joins crowded 2020 race 04:09 Biography Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper grew up outside of Philadelphia, the youngest of four children. He attended Wesleyan University and received a bachelor's in English and a master's degree in Geology. Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery with 15 brewpubs and restaurants, was a success, and it made him a millionaire. In 2003, Hickenlooper ran for Mayor of Denver, in his first ever campaign. Considered a bit of a dark horse candidate who never ran a negative ad, he shocked many and won in a landslide. In 2010, Hickenlooper became the first Denver Mayor elected Governor in 120 years. He was re-elected in 2014, running on another entirely positive campaign Hickenlooper is the second governor or former governor to announce a Democratic presidential bid this cycle, following Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Issues Finishing his second term in the statehouse, Hickenlooper was a popular, pro-business governor. He left Colorado with a strong economy and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building. It's that record that he touted in h is campaign video. I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington but we also need to get things done, Hickenlooper says in the video. I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver. As governor, Hickenlooper also signed an expansion of Medicaid in 2013. He has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. Hickenlooper has opposed a number of Trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. Over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Hickenlooper so far.\n\nJay Inslee Jay Inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 Biography Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1973 and a J.D. from Willamette University College of Law in Oregon three years later. After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values. During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free. However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward, Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure\n\nBernie Sanders Bernie Sanders on 2020: We're going to win 04:49 Biography Although he has spent most of his adult life in Vermont, Bernie Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant Jewish family. He attended one year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating in 1964. At the University of Chicago, Sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He moved to Vermont in 1968. Sanders ran for governor of Vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent Liberty Union Party. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. He was elected to the House of Representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 2006. Although technically still an independent, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. However, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign. His campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Since the 2016 campaign, some of Sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, such as his Medicare-for-All proposal. Issues Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. Sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. Sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the Medicare-for-All bill with 15 other senators in 2017. He also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they American worker. He opposed NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, trade deals which President Trump renegotiated or withdrew from. Sanders opposed the U.S. war in Iraq, and remains a critic of American military interventionism. Controversy More than two dozen of Sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of December seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. A New York Times story in early January reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which Sanders apologized. Politico also reported in early January that his former Iowa campaign manager, Robert Becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees. Sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with Becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. What Trump says President Trump has alternated between praising Sanders and insulting him as crazy. As some of Mr. Trump and Sanders' populist ideas overlap, Mr. Trump often said during the 2016 campaign that Sanders voters would defect to him over Hillary Clinton in the general election. Mr. Trump also accused Clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from Sanders, and criticized Sanders for eventually endorsing Clinton. While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, Mr. Trump tweeted in July 2016. Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary, he wrote in another July tweet. In several subsequent tweets, Mr. Trump has called Sanders Crazy Bernie. He has often referred to the 2016 Democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.\n\nAmy Klobuchar Klobuchar announces 2020 presidential bid 25:20 Biography Amy Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis. Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an F rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light. I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.\n\nCory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,' Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration. After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system. Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his Spartacus moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has no chance in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: Because I know him. He has no chance. In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker ran Newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself, Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year.\n\nPete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg explores presidential bid 06:09 Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing. The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different. Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.\n\nKamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 run 05:19 Biography Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat. In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail. Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does. Harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nElizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 202... 02:18 Biography Warren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office. Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice. During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. The problem is Washington works great for those with influence. Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. We make our campaigns work through the people. Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn't work out too well, Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her. Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.\n\nKirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her. Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate. Issues Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the Don't ask, don't tell policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 Minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate. The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct. She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors, including billionaire George Soros, have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken. She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017, she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public. What Trump says President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! Mr. Trump tweeted. Critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office, Gillibrand wrote on Twitter in response.\n\nJulián Castro Julián Castro launches 2020 campaign 08:32 Biography Julián Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating him and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman. Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues. In his exit memo from the agency, Castro said that HUD had stabilized the housing market and preserved affordable housing through public-private partnerships. Under the Obama administration, he wrote, HUD invested $18 billion in communities recovering from natural disasters and initiated a $1 billion competition for resilient housing and infrastructure projects. Views on LGBT issues and abortion rights He supports LGBT rights and was the first San Antonio mayor to serve as the grand marshal of the city's Pride Parade in 2009 and joined mayors across the country in signing the Mayors for the Freedom to Marry petition for same-sex marriage equality in 2012. Castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. He spoke at the annual luncheon for Planned Parenthood South Texas in May. Controversy In 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues. Castro apologized and ordered his team improve training on the Hatch Act in his department. What Trump says Castro has not yet been a target for President Trump. Unlike some of the other potential presidential candidates, Mr. Trump has never personally disparaged Castro on Twitter. Issues In his video announcing his exploratory committee in December, Castro said he is focused on affordable college, care for seniors, universal health care and welcoming immigrants. No matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, Castro said.\n\nTulsi Gabbard Rep. Tulsi Gabbard launches 2020 campaign 05:28 Biography Tulsi Gabbard was born in American Samoa in 1981, and her family moved to Hawaii when she was 2 years old. Her mother, Carol, is a practicing Hindu, a religion Gabbard adopted. Her father, Mike, is a member of the Hawaii state Senate. After growing up in a politically active family, Gabbard became a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. While serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. She deployed in Iraq and returned in 2006. After returning from her second deployment in 2009, Gabbard ran for Honolulu City Council. She served on the council from 2011 until 2012, when she resigned to focus on her congressional campaign. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2012. She was the first practicing Hindu in Congress. Issues Gabbard is very progressive, and one of the few members of Congress to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary. She resigned her position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee to endorse him. Gabbard is a supporter of a woman's right to an abortion and received a 100 percent rating from NARAL. She has emphasized environmental and economic issues during her tenure, and supports a $15 minimum wage. She also supports Medicare for All. Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians. In November, she said in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What Trump says Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Gabbard. The two met briefly shortly after Mr. Trump was elected.
I Do … Until I Don't is very personal for Lake Bell, who wrote, directed and produced the romantic comedy.\n\nBell started working on the screenplay nine years ago. The plot revolves around three couples who are taking part in a documentary about marriage, directed by an eccentric and cynical filmmaker who believes marriage should be a renewable seven-year contract. Bell stars as Alice, a woman who runs a blinds store with her husband, Noah, played by Ed Helms, in Vero Beach, Florida, where Bell spent part of her childhood.\n\nBell told CBS News when she started writing the film, she had a therapeutic need to investigate the institution of marriage.\n\nI really felt that marriage was archaic, she said. I did share the ideology and theories that the documentarian, Vivian, depicted in the movie. I was sort of more of a Vivian to start with, and during the writing of this film I met my husband, Scott Campbell, so it was kind of a beautiful lesson and continues to be.\n\nBell said her cynicism of stems from the fact that she was one and a half when her parents divorced.\n\nI was part of a pretty difficult divorce and I grew up with other family members and friends who were all kind of getting divorced, so it just felt like a doomed concept, and when I was starting to write the movie, I believed 'if it ain't broke, why fix it?' she said. So if you're with someone you love, why not just be with them, which is the Fanny and Xander ideology. Every character in this movie does feel deeply personal in my unpacking of the subject matter. Fanny and Xander, played by Amber Heard and Wyatt Cenac, respectively, play a carefree hippie couple in an open relationship.\n\nWyatt Cenac and Amber Heard play a couple in an open relationship in I Do ... Until I Don't. The Film Arcade\n\nBut Bell said in the process of the film, she started to change her mind about marriage.\n\nI fell madly in love with my husband and even though he's covered head to toe in tattoos, he's more traditional -- he's from the south -- and I remember being really afraid to take on this thing that I had never really understood, she explained. I did tell him, 'Well, I am afraid, but I can't think of anyone else I'd rather be afraid with.'\n\nBell and Campbell have been married for four years and together for seven, and she said what she appreciates about marriage is how much she has evolved.\n\nIt's harder to grow if you're living in a single vortex, where no one is calling you out on your [expletive] and when the going gets tough, you don't fail, but when you're in a committed relationship, you're constantly looking in the mirror and at your flaws by way of your partner and vice versa, said Bell. And we love therapy. You don't have to be a raging lunatic to go to therapy to improve. It's just self-love, and taking care of thyself is what really inspires you to take care of each other.\n\nBell said that to write the script, she envisioned herself as each character, but she was especially excited to play Alice.\n\nIt's really fun to take on characters who are not an obvious casting choice for me, she said. Alice sort of apologizes for the space she takes up in the world and she's extremely low-status and she's repressed and that's just something I haven't gotten to do in my career.\n\nBell admitted she has an agenda in making this film.\n\nIt has a happy ending and it's built that way and I always wanted it that way, she said. I really wanted this story and investigation to end with hope, because I think ultimately as a previous unromantic, I was hoping deep down to be proven wrong.
BALTIMORE -- The Maryland parents behind a controversial YouTube channel featuring videos of them playing pranks on their children were sentenced to five years of supervised probation, CBS station WJZ-TV reports.\n\nHeather and Mike Martin each entered Alford pleas to two counts of child neglect of their two youngest kids. Their pleas mean they did not admit to any abuse but acknowledged prosecutors had enough evidence to prove it.\n\nProsecutors say a psychologist determined the kids were traumatized by these pranks. The judge didn't think they were funny either.\n\nThis was far beyond corporal punishment, Frederick County State's Attorney Charlie Smith said. This was egregious, abusive conduct, and I didn't think it was funny from the beginning, and, obviously, the judge didn't either.\n\nHundreds of videos on the couple's DaddyOFive YouTube channel showed everything from smashing electronics to a fake robbery and other elaborate pranks where they appear to terrify their five children. The Martins quickly reached 800,000 followers after launching the channel.\n\nWe were just messing around one day, having fun, joking around, and we ended up doing the prank, and we put it on YouTube, and it blew up, Mike Martin told WJZ in the spring.\n\nBut one video in particular, posted in April, changed everything for the family. It showed their son sobbing as they were screaming at him for spilling ink, which they actually did for the prank.\n\nThe video went viral, and outraged fans went on the attack, accusing the couple of exploiting their children. It triggered an international firestorm and an investigation by Child Protective Services. Eventually, they were charged.\n\nAfter the controversy began, the couple removed most of their videos from the DaddyOFive channel. One of only two videos remaining is a public apology, which they posted on April 22.\n\nWe have made some terrible parenting decisions, Heather Martin said in the video.\n\nMike Martin is the biological father of the two children at the center of the charges, and Heather Martin is their stepmother. The other three children in the videos are from Heather Martin's previous marriage.\n\nThe couple is not allowed to contact the two allegedly neglected children in any way without a judge's approval. They're back with their biological mother.\n\nThe couple claimed they made the videos to help provide a better life for their kids. They had hundreds of thousands of followers and made hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe couple has launched two new YouTube channels since the controversy began, called MommyOFive and DaddyOFive Gaming.
On this Valentine's Day, new research shows a revolution is in the works when it comes to finding love that lasts. The concept is called slow love. Marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship. Now it's the finale, biological anthropologist Helen Fisher said Thursday on CBS This Morning.\n\nIn her annual study with Match.com, Fisher saw signs of a new approach to the courtship process. From a national sample of more than 35,000 single adults, 66 percent said they've had one-night stands, 54 percent have had uncommitted friends-with-benefits relationships, and 56 percent said they've lived together with a partner before marriage.\n\nWhat's really happening is we're seeing an extension of the pre-commitment stage of love, Fisher said. And Americans seem to think that this is reckless, and it began to occur to me it's caution. These people want to know every single thing about a person before they tie the knot.\n\nOne of the main strategies is they first start out with just friends. And then they move into friends with benefits. Don't tell anybody. Secretive. Non-committal. And then have the official first date, she added.\n\nFisher said singles today are terrified of divorce and want to make a solid partnership.\n\nSo I began to think, with this long pre-commitment stage, maybe you're learning a lot, you're getting rid of what you don't want, so that by the time you walk down the aisle, you got what you want. You can keep what you want, she said.\n\nFisher has also done research with people who have been married for an average of 21 years. She said through brain scans, she was able to see three parts of the brain that become active in a long-term and happy marriage: [A] brain region linked with empathy, a brain region linked with controlling your own stress and your own emotions, and a brain region linked with overlooking the negative and focusing on the positive. What we call the positive illusions.
Adele confirmed her marriage to partner Simon Konecki at the Grammys on Sunday.\n\nThe singer, who picked up five awards at the Grammys, said during her acceptance speech for Album of the Year, My husband and my son -- you're the only reason I do it.\n\nAdele and Konecki have been in a long-term relationship; Konecki is the father of Adele's 4-year-old son, Angelo.\n\nBritish tabloids reported rumors that the two married over Christmas, but Adele never confirmed the marriage until Grammys night. Her rep did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday.\n\nAdele had an eventful night on Sunday, winning trophies for Album, Song and Record of the Year, beating out Beyonce.\n\nShe also said as she accepted Album of the Year: Winning this, it really feels full circle but I can't possilby accept this award. My life is Beyonce and the 'Lemonade' album, Beyonce was so monumental and so well thought-out and beautiful and soul-baring ... the way you made me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel is empowering.\n\nThe Hello singer also had a flub on Grammys night during a surprise tribute to George Michael. A few seconds into the song she stopped and said, I'm sorry for swearing and I'm sorry for starting again … I can't mess this up for him and started from the top. Adele finished the song without a hitch; she faced the crowd with tears in her eyes and received a standing ovation.
For 32 years, movie star Annette Bening has always stood out, in films such as Valmont, Bugsy, The American President, The Women and 20th Century Women, earning four Oscar nominations along the way (for her performances in The Grifters, American Beauty, Being Julia and The Kids Are All Right).\n\nI've been asked to do really interesting characters in the midst of great stories with great writing, Bening said. And great writing usually involves flaws. It's not about playing people who are strong. It's about trying to find the humanity in people.\n\nAnd she's at it again, this time on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's All My Sons. For Bening, being on stage has been a kind of homecoming. My family's from the Midwest. I was born in Kansas. So, many of my relatives in Iowa had this very backyard, she said of the play's setting.\n\nActress Annette Bening with correspondent Serena Altschul on the stage for All My Sons. CBS News\n\nBoth she and the production have been nominated for Tonys this year.\n\nSet in 1947, All My Sons centers on the Keller family, whose two sons were in World War II. After one, a pilot, was reported missing, their mom, Kate, can't accept even the possibility he could be dead.\n\nCorrespondent Serena Altschul asked, How do you feel about Kate?\n\nI love her, Bening replied. That's the pleasure we have as actors. We get to love the characters because we don't have to judge them.\n\nAnnette Bening and Tracy Letts in the Broadway revival of All My Sons. CBS News\n\nBening said it's a role she always wanted to play, in part because the story mirrors events in her own history: My mom's family had two sons that went to the war, my Uncle Russell and my Uncle Roy. They both enlisted after Pearl Harbor. They were both in their late twenties.\n\nRoy became a Marine, Russell a pilot. His plane crashed from mechanical failure. The body of his copilot was found, but my Uncle Russell's body was never found. So, there's a lot of personal connection in my family to the world that Arthur Miller was writing about.\n\nThe actress, a Tony nominee for the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's classic drama, has an emotional connection to its story of a family's loss during World War II. CBS News\n\nAnd, she says, she draws on that connection each night.\n\nAltschul asked, Do you get a certain catharsis when you relive what Kate goes through every night? Are you working through that loss, in a way?\n\nI have a theory that maybe if you're working in the right way, it is a cathartic experience. So afterwards, you feel unburdened, she replied.\n\nHer first and only other time on Broadway was in 1987's Coastal Disturbances. She earned a Tony nomination then, too, and soon Hollywood beckoned.\n\nI was lucky, she said of the great opportunities in her film career. And I also didn't start doing movies 'til I was almost 30. I wasn't a kid.\n\nIn 1990, she met actor and heartthrob Warren Beatty on the set of the film Bugsy. They married in 1992.\n\nAltschul asked, How does one make a marriage work for 27 years?\n\nWell, I think mutual respect, and that we very much want the same things, Bening replied. So, he's very tolerant of living with me!\n\nAnd you of him, right?\n\nYes. I would say yes, she laughed.\n\nThere were skeptics in the beginning; what do you say to them?\n\nWhat can I say? I don't know, we've been married 27 years. We have four children. I think that sorta says it all, doesn't it? Bening laughed.\n\nAnnette Bening and Warren Beatty arrive at the Academy Awards in this 2011 file photo. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nAnd, she says, together they created the life she dreamed of. I always wanted children, from when I was really little, like a little girl, seven or eight years old. And my children, who are now adults, they're in the stage of their lives where they're getting their education and they're working and falling in love. And it's also a very cool stage of parenting that I'm really enjoying.\n\nBening prefers to let her kids speak for themselves. For instance, her oldest, Stephen, is outspoken as an advocate in the transgender community.\n\nAltschul asked, What can you say to other moms wanting to help their children find themselves and be exactly what they feel they are?\n\nBening replied, Well, it's what we all want to do as parents. And I think that the tricky part is, that your kids have to go through difficulties and pain. And I didn't even know it, but there was a part of me that thought, if I got it right, I could maybe parent my kids in such a way that they wouldn't have to experience pain, she laughed. Which is, of course, ridiculous! You want to shield them.\n\nBut what you learn is how powerless you are. You have a lot that you can do to help and love your kids. And of course, you do anything you can to support them and love them. But they go through what they're gonna go through. And they have a right to do that. And there's a dignity to that.\n\nAs her children move on, she says, for Beatty and herself it seems like old times. My husband and I now, we have more time just for each other, and for work. And I can come and do this play in New York.\n\nHas he come yet?\n\nYes. An dhe's been incredibly supportive and enthusiastic.\n\nAnd he's not the only one. Critics, audiences and, of course, the Tony Awards nominating committee are raving about Bening's performance.\n\nBut, Bening said, We don't talk about it.\n\nYou don't? No, we don't talk about it. We just focus on the work.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nArthur Miller's All My Sons at the American Airlines Theatre (through June 30) | Ticket Info\n\n\n\nStory produced by Mary Raffalli.\n\n\n\nSee also:
Whatever happened to Grammy's Best New Artists?\n\n\n\n\n\nGABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/Getty Images Esperanza Spalding poses with her award for Best New Artist at the 53nd annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Over the past half-century many of the performers honored in the Best New Artist category have gone on to stellar careers. Others failed to match their early success; groups disbanded; and some left the recording industry entirely. There were also tragic stories of bankruptcy, jail and lives cut short. Click through our gallery to see every winner of Best New Artist since 1959, and how they followed their Grammy victories. By CBS News.com senior editors Lauren Moraski and David Morgan\n\n1959: Bobby Darin CBS News Nominees: Edd Byrnes, Mark Murphy, Johnny Restivo and Mavis Rivers In 1958-59 pop singer/crooner Bobby Darin had six singles on the U.S. charts, including Splish Splash, Early in the Morning, Dream Lover and Mack the Knife. Over the next decade-and-a-half, Darin recorded 32 albums; started a label (Direction Records) to release folk music and protest songs; and acted in films such as State Fair, Captain Newman, M.D., and Hell Is for Heroes. Darin died in 1973 at the age of 37, after surgery to correct a heart problem failed.\n\n1960: Bob Newhart Warner Records Nominees: The Brothers Four, Miriam Makeba, Leontyne Price and Joanie Sommers With The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart - the first comedy album to hit Number 1 on the Billboard chart - the comedian became the first artist to win Grammys in both the Album of the Year and Best New Artist categories. [Only three others have achieved that feat: Christopher Cross, Lauryn Hill and Norah Jones.] Newhart would release several more albums, and would star in a variety show and three sit-coms (including the classics The Bob Newhart Show and Newhart). He also made appearances in films such as Catch-22, Cold Turkey, In & Out and Elf.\n\n1961: Peter Nero CBS News Nominees: Ann-Margret, Dick Gregory, The Lettermen and Timi Yuro The pianist released his first easy-listening album, Piano Forte (RCA), in 1961. Nearly 70 more Peter Nero albums would follow, in a career that has spanned classical, jazz and American standards. Nero also help found the Philly Pops Orchestra.\n\n1962: Robert Goulet Columbia Records Nominees: The Four Seasons, Vaughn Meader, The New Christy Minstrels, Peter, Paul and Mary, and Allan Sherman Born in Massachusetts, Robert Goulet spent his adolescence in Canada, and eventually studied at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. In 1960 he debuted on Broadway as Lancelot in the Lerner & Loewe musical Camelot, and quickly built a music, TV and film career. His biggest recordings included If Ever I Would Leave You, My Love, Forgive Me, and Come Back To Me, My Love. Suffering from lung disease, Goulet died on October 20, 2007 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\n1963: The Swingle Singers CBS News Nominees: Vikki Carr, John Gary, The J's with Jamie, and Trini Lopez Formed by Ward Swingle in Paris, the Swingle Singers was comprised of French session artists who joined to perform jazz vocals. Their renditions of J.S. Bach fugues and The Well-Tempered Clavier as vocals, Jazz Sébastien Bach (released in the U.S. as Bach's Greatest Hits), won a Grammy for Best Performance by a Chorus, and also won the group Best New Artist. In the early 1970s the singers disbanded, but Ward Swingle re-formed the group in England with a new cast. Over the past half-century the Swingles' various iterations have released more than 50 recordings, won five Grammys, and had their music used in such disparate programs as Wedding Crashers and Sex and the City. The group also curates the London A Cappella Festival. Ward Swingle died on Jan. 19, 2015, in Eastbourne, England. He was 87.\n\n1964: The Beatles Capitol Records The world knows what became of John, Paul, George and Ringo - probably the easiest choice for Best New Artist the Grammy membership ever had to make. So what happened to their fellow nominees? Petula Clark, whose hits included Downtown and Don't Sleep in the Subway, also starred in the musical films Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Finian's Rainbow, and on Broadway in Blood Brothers, with David and Shaun Cassidy. Brazilian Astrud Gilberto, best known for The Girl from Ipanema, has recorded 16 albums, and performed with such artists as João Gilberto, Stan Getz and George Michael. Bossa nova musician and composer Antonio Carlos Jobim won the 1995 Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Performance for Antonio Brasileiro. Jobim died in 1994. Singer Morgana King's four-octave range graced cabarets and concert hall for more than three decades. She released 30 albums, but probably received the most exposure from her debut film role, as Carmela Corleone, wife of Don Corleone, in The Godfather. King sang Luna Mezz'o Mare during the wedding reception scene.\n\n1965: Tom Jones CBS News Nominees: The Byrds, Herman's Hermits, Horst Jankowski, Marilyn Maye, Sonny & Cher and Glenn Yarbrough The son of a Welsh coal miner, Tom Jones avoided a life destined in the mines thanks to a case of tuberculosis when he was 12. Instead, he trained his voice, played the pubs, and cut a demo record that launched an international career singing blues, pop, country and gospel music. His first album, Along Came Jones (a.k.a. It's Not Unusual), hit No. 11 on the U.S. charts. More records followed, with such hits as What's New Pussycat, Delilah, Green, Green Grass of Home, She's a Lady, Kiss and Sex Bomb, as well as a TV series (This Is Tom Jones), and even a self-parodying film appearance (Mars Attacks!).\n\n1967: Bobbie Gentry Capitol Records Nominees: Lana Cantrell, The 5th Dimension, Harpers Bizarre and Jefferson Airplane After skipping a year, the Grammy's Best New Artist Award went to one of the first female country artists to write and produce her own material. Bobbie Gentry became a star with her ballad, Ode to Billie Joe (which had actually been the B-side of her debut single, Mississippi Delta). It spent four weeks at Number 1 on the Billboard charts in 1967. In addition to Best New Artist, Gentry won Grammys for Best Vocal Performance (Female) and Best Contemporary Group Performance (Vocal or Instrumental) for Ode to Billie Joe. Her follow-up recordings include the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song I'll Never Fall in Love Again, Let It Be Me and All I Have to Do Is Dream (both with Glen Campbell), Fancy, and But I Can't Get Back. In the '70s Gentry retired from performing.\n\n1968: José Feliciano RCA Records Nominees: Cream, Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, Jeannie C. Riley and O. C. Smith The Puerto Rican guitarist and singer's 1968 album Feliciano!, an Album of the Year nominee that reached Number 2 on the Billboard charts, featured his seminal cover of The Doors' Light My Fire. Feliciano, who was born blind, mixes various musical styles - flamenco, Latin pop, jazz, bolero - in recordings that have earned him 19 Grammy nominations and nine awards, including the Latin Recording Academy's Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\n1969: Crosby, Stills & Nash Atlantic Records Nominees: Chicago, Led Zeppelin, The Neon Philharmonic and Oliver Call it one of the first super groups. David Crosby (The Byrds), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield) and Graham Nash (The Hollies) were all part of popular bands before teaming to create the harmonies that make up CS&N. The trio's self-titled debut album, released in 1969, featured the songs Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Marrakesh Express. A spot at Woodstock that year helped cement their place in history -- leading to the subsequent Best New Artist Grammy win. The trio would go on to perform with Neil Young as CSN&Y, and each member ended up pursuing solo careers over the years. Crosby, Stills & Nash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. You can still catch these guys on the road, as they tour fairly regularly.\n\n1970: The Carpenters A&M Records Nominees: Elton John, Melba Moore, Anne Murray and The Partridge Family After a disappointing debut with the 1969 album Ticket to Ride, keyboardist Richard Carpenter and his sister, drummer Karen Carpenter, hit the big time with their second album, Close to You. Karen's mellow voice and Richard's arrangements produced such hits as the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song (They Long to Be) Close to You, We've Only Just Begun, and I'll Never Fall in Love Again. The Carpenters were nominated for eight Grammys in 1970 and won two (for Best New Artist and Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus). Eight more albums followed, before Karen's tragic death in 1983, from complications arising from anorexia nervosa. Richard Carpenter continued as a solo artist, with the 1987 album, Time, and 1998's Pianist - Arranger - Composer - Conductor.\n\n1971: Carly Simon Elektra Records Nominees: Chase, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds, and Bill Withers Carly Simon's 1971 self-titled debut featured the hit recording That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be, which earned her a Best Pop Female Vocalist Grammy nomination as well as the Best New Artist award. She recorded 24 more albums, and her repertoire included such classics as Anticipation, You Belong to Me, Coming Around Again, Jesse, Mockingbird (with James Taylor), You're So Vain, and Nobody Does It Better (from the James Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me). Simon also won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Let the River Run from the Mike Nichols comedy, Working Girl.\n\n1972: America Warner Brothers Nominees: Harry Chapin, the Eagles, Loggins and Messina, and John Prine Dewey Bunnell, Dan Peek and Gerry Beckley are the voices behind America and the 1971 smash hit Horse With No Name. The track appeared on America's self-titled debut, and marked the first of a few hits for the trio. Later on came Ventura Highway and I Need You, followed by a return to the charts in the early '80s with You Can Do Magic. America continues to tour and release albums. In 2007 a host of musicians, who cite America as a big influence, recorded a tribute album to the group, Here & Now.\n\n1973: Bette Midler Atlantic Records Nominees: Eumir Deodato, Maureen McGovern, Marie Osmond and Barry White Born in Honolulu, Midler's stage career included the Broadway run of Fiddler on the Roof. But it was her performances in cabarets and gay bathhouses in the early 1970s, as well as in The Who's Tommy, that rocketed her to stardom as The Divine Miss M. Her hits included Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, From a Distance, The Rose, and Wind Beneath My Wings (the latter two of which won her Grammys). Midler also starred in such films as The Rose, Outrageous Fortune, Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Beaches, Ruthless People, For the Boys, and The First Wives Club. In 2013 she returned to Broadway in the one-woman play, I'll Eat You Last: A Chat with Sue Mengers, and won a Tony for Best Actress in a Musical for the 2017 revival of Hello, Dolly!\n\n1974: Marvin Hamlisch CBS News Nominees: Bad Company, Johnny Bristol, David Essex, Graham Central Station and Phoebe Snow Composer and arranger Marvin Hamlisch began his career as a rehearsal pianist for Barbra Streisand for the Broadway musical Funny Girl. In 1974 he won three Academy Awards, for The Way We Were (Best Original Song and Best Original Dramatic Score) and The Sting (Best Adaptation, for translating Scott Joplin's ragtime music). It wasn't long before he had even greater success, with the 1975 Broadway production A Chorus Line. Hamlisch's other music for film includes The Spy Who Loved Me, Ice Castles, Sophie's Choice, and The Mirror Has Two Faces. His Broadways scores include They're Playing Our Song, Smile and The Goodbye Girl. Hamlisch died in Los Angeles on August 6, 2012. He was 68.\n\n1975: Natalie Cole Capitol Records Nominees: Morris Albert, Amazing Rhythm Aces, Brecker Brothers, and KC and the Sunshine Band The daughter of singer Nat King Cole and Maria Hawkins Ellington (who had sung with the Duke Ellington Orchestra), Natalie's Cole's debut album, Inseparable, introduced her Top 10 hit, This Will Be, for which she won a Grammy for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, as well as Best New Artist. Cole was later nominated for another 19 Grammy Awards, and won seven, for her recordings of Sophisticated Lady, Unforgettable... with Love (in which she dueted with her late father), Take a Look, When I Fall in Love (also with Nat King Cole), and Still Unforgettable.\n\n1976: Starland Vocal Band Windsong/RCA Nominees: Boston, Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, The Brothers Johnson and Wild Cherry Starland Vocal Band (from left: Jon Carroll, Margot Chapman, Taffy Danoff and Bill Danoff) copped two Grammys in 1976, for Best New Artist and for Best Arrangement for Voices (Duo, Group Or Chorus) for their Afternoon Delight. It was the first song the group had ever recorded, and it hit Number One. The band starred in a 1977 summer replacement series on CBS, The Starland Vocal Band Show, a variety series whose cast included David Letterman (Yes, I can hear sets being clicked off all over this great land of ours!). The band dis-banded in 1981 and went on to solo careers.\n\n1977: Debby Boone Warner Brothers Nominees: Stephen Bishop, Shaun Cassidy, Foreigner and Andy Gibb Debby Boone's pop single You Light Up My Life, was perched at Number 1 on the Billboard charts for 10 weeks in 1977. Having won Best New Artist, her recording career would encompass country and inspirational, winning Grammys for With My Song and Keep The Flame Burning (with Phil Driscoll). After bowing out of recording to raise her family, Boone returned with 2005's Reflections if Rosemary, a tribute album dedicated to her mother-in-law, singer Rosemary Clooney, who'd died in 2002. In 2011 Boone recorded an album of standards, Swing This!\n\n1978: A Taste of Honey Capitol Records Nominees: The Cars, Elvis Costello, Chris Rea and Toto It would be several years before Janice M. Johnson, Perry Kibble, Donald R. Johnson and Hazel Payne (who had first played together in 1971) would find success with Capitol Records and their disco hit, Boogie Oogie Oogie. Renamed A Taste of Honey, the band sold two million copies of their debut album, which hit Number 1 on the charts. With new members the band failed to score another big hit with their follow-up albums, Another Taste and Twice As Sweet, and within two years, only vocalists Janice Johnson and Hazel Payne remained. In 1984 Johnson released a solo album, One Taste of Honey, and a second in 2000, Hiatus of the Heart. Hazel Payne left the group to pursue an acting career, but performed with Janice Johnson on two PBS reunion specials. Drummer/vocalist Donald Ray Johnson continues to perform blues in Calgary, Canada, and has toured with such artists as Teddy Pendergrass, Smokey Wilson and The Isley Brothers. Perry Kibble, who became a music producer in Canada, died of congestive heart failure in 1999 at age 49.\n\n1979: Rickie Lee Jones Warner Brothers Nominees: The Blues Brothers, Dire Straits, The Knack and Robin Williams Chuck E's In Love was just one of the songs on Rickie Lee Jones' debut album, a captivating blend of folk, R&B and jazz. The 21-year-old singer-songwriter, hailing from a long line of performers, was joined on her album by Dr. John, Michael McDonald and Randy Newman. An appearance on Saturday Night Live and an article in Time Magazine that labeled her The Duchess of Coolsville burnished her reputation. Nominated for five Grammys (including Record of the Year and Song of the Year), Jones won Best New Artist. Jones would record 20 more studio and live albums, her most recent being the 2012 folk rock album, The Devil You Know. In 1989 Jones shared a second Grammy with Dr. John for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group, for Makin' Whoopee. She has a new album due out in Spring 2015.\n\n1980: Christopher Cross Warner Brothers Nominees: Irene Cara, Robbie Dupree, Amy Holland and The Pretenders The singer-songwriter from San Antonio, Texas, whose eponymous 1979 album featured such classics as Ride Like the Wind and Sailing, is the only artist ever to sweep the Big Four Grammy categories (Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist) in a single year. His follow-ups included the chart-topping theme song from the Dudley Moore comedy, Arthur, and the 1983 album, Another Page.\n\n1981: Sheena Easton MGM/UA Nominees: Adam and the Ants, The Go-Go's, James Ingram and Luther Vandross The Scottish singer made a splash with her hit singles Modern Girl and 9 to 5 (released in the U.S. as Morning Train). With the 1981 James Bond film, For Your Eyes Only, Easton became the first singer to appear on screen performing the title song amid Maurice Binder's evocative visuals. Easton later shared the 1984 Best Mexican-American Performance Grammy for her duet with Luis Miguel, Me Gustas Tal Como Eres.\n\n1982: Men At Work Columbia Records Nominees: Asia, Jennifer Holliday, The Human League and Stray Cats Australian pop-rock group Men At Work, fronted by Colin Hay (with Russell Deppeler, Greg Ham, John Rees, Jerry Speiser, Ron Strykert), was formed in 1978, but it wasn't until 1982 that their first album reached the United States, featuring the hits Down Under and Who Could It Be Now? Two more albums followed, yet by 1986 Hay decided to call it quits and record a solo album. They reformed 10 years later -- only to disband again in 2002.\n\n1983: Culture Club Virgin Records Nominees: Big Country, Eurythmics, Men Without Hats and Musical Youth This English act made a big impact in the early '80s with the international hit Do You Really Want to Hurt Me. Led by singer Boy George, Culture Club (also featuring Michael Craig, Roy Hay and Jon Moss) released its debut album, Kissing to Be Clever, in 1982, and didn't waste much time with the next effort: 1983's Colour By Numbers, which featured the single Karma Chameleon. It was all enough to snag Culture Club the Best New Artist win in 1983. The band went on to release three more albums throughout the '80s and '90s. During that time, though, George's drug addiction and relationship with Culture Club drummer Moss took a toll on the band. Throughout the years Culture Club has broken up, staged reunions and found themselves on hiatus once again. A 2014 reunion tour -- with the original lineup -- was scrapped after George came down with a serious throat condition.\n\n1984: Cyndi Lauper Portrait Records; Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Nominees: Sheila E., Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Corey Hart, and The Judds Cyndi Lauper got her start performing in cover bands before branching out in 1983 with her debut solo effort, She's So Unusual, which featured the hits Girls Just Want to Have Fun, Time After Time, She Bop, and All Through the Night. The success catapulted the Queens, N.Y., native to fame and earned her the Best New Artist award at the 27th Grammys. She's since gone on to win a Tony and an Emmy -- now all Lauper needs is an Oscar to join the exclusive EGOT Club. Lauper has continued to experiment with her sound; her most recent studio set, 2010's Memphis Blues, was nominated for a Best Traditional Blues Album Grammy, and her 2012 Broadway musical, Kinky Boots, earned her a Best Musical Theater Album Grammy (left).\n\n1985: Sade Epic Records Nominees: a-ha, Freddie Jackson, Katrina and the Waves, and Julian Lennon As Best New Artist, the Nigerian-born British singer Sade Adu actually shared her Best New Artist Grammy with the fellow members of her band, also called Sade - Paul S. Denman, Andrew Hale and Stuart Matthewman. Their 1985 album Promise(their second released in the U.S.), featured such smooth tunes as The Sweetest Taboo, Is It a Crime, and Never As Good As the First Time. Sade later received three more Grammys - for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal (No Ordinary Love, 1993; and Soldier of Love, 2010), and Best Pop Vocal Album (Lovers Rock, 2010).\n\n1986: Bruce Hornsby & the Range RCA Records Nominees: Glass Tiger, Nu Shooz, Simply Red and Timbuk3 Prior to launching his solo career, singer-pianist Bruce Hornsby played clubs and bars, served as a session musician, and toured with Sheena Easton's band. In 1986 he released The Way It Is, the debut album from Bruce Hornsby & the Range (the Range included David Mansfield, George Marinelli, John Molo, Joe Puerta). The album's title track, with its references to the civil rights movement, hit the top of the charts and has since been sampled by various hip-hop artists. The success of the album, which also featured singles Mandolin Rain and Every Little Kiss, landed them the Best New Artist Grammy. Since then, Hornsby has put out albums with and without the Range; toured with the Grateful Dead; and formed the band, the Noisemakers. The Virginia native received another Grammy in 1990 for his reworking of The Valley Road with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and his track (Song H) was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental at the 2007 Grammy Awards.\n\n1987: Jody Watley MCA Records Nominees: Breakfast Club, Cutting Crew, Terence Trent D'Arby and Swing Out Sister A dance music pioneer, Jody Watley began her professional career as a teenager on the TV show Soul Train, and became a member of the group Shalamar. Among their albums was Uptown Festival, Big Fun, Three For Love, Friends, and The Look. Watley then signed a solo contract with MCA, which released Jody Watley in 1987. Among its hits were Looking for a New Love, Still a Thrill and Don't You Want Me. Her 2006 album, The Makeover, paid tribute to the styles of Karen Carpenter, Chic and Diana Ross. Watley received the Billboard Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008.\n\n1988: Tracy Chapman Elektra Records Nominees: Rick Astley, Toni Childs, Take 6 and Vanessa L. Williams The singer-songwriter best known for the songs Talkin' 'bout a Revolution and Fast Car won three Grammys for her 1988 eponymous acoustic album, including Best New Artist. Tracy Chapman sold six million copies on the U.S., and hit Number One on the Billboard charts. Chapman has released seven more albums, most recently 2008's Our Bright Future (a Grammy nominee for Best Contemporary Folk Album).\n\n1989: Milli Vanilli Arista Records Nominees: Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Soul II Soul and Tone Lōc Milli Vanilli rose to fame in the late '80s and early '90s following the release of the hit album, Girl You Know It's True. Rob Morvan and Rob Pilatus served as the faces of the popular German duo, though the world would soon learn that they did not provide vocals on any of their recordings -- but not before Milli Vanilli swooped up the Best New Artist honor at the Grammys. The award was later revoked -- the only time a Grammy win has ever been vacated -- and several lawsuits followed. Morvan and Pilatus attempted to make music on their own, under a different group name, but it failed to gain any traction. Years later, in 1998, Milli Vanilli started prepping a comeback album, called Back and In Attack, but the set never saw the light of day. Pilatus died on April 2, 1998 at the age of 32 of a suspected alcohol and prescription pill overdose -- right before the launch of a promotional tour for the LP.\n\n1990: Mariah Carey Columbia Records Nominees: The Black Crowes, The Kentucky Headhunters, Wilson Phillips and Lisa Stansfield Mariah Carey's killer voice (with a five-octave vocal range) burst onto the music scene in 1990 with her self-titled debut album.

Carey ended up winning Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for Vision of Love, along with the Best New Artist honor. She would win three more Grammys, out of 29 nominations. She's also dabbled in acting (in the ill-fated Glitter in 2001), and sat at the judges' table on Fox's American Idol. In May 2015, she set up shop in Las Vegas for a residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace.\n\n1991: Marc Cohn Atlantic Records Nominees: Boyz II Men, C+C Music Factory, Color Me Badd and Seal Folk-rock singer-songwriter Marc Cohn is best known for Walking in Memphis, the single off his 1991 self-titled debut album. The Cleveland, Ohio-born singer has said the track, which helped land him the Best New Artist Grammy, was mostly autobiographical. Walking in Memphis also received nominations for Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance at the 34th annual Grammy Awards. Cohn has continually released albums and toured over the years, but has yet to score another radio hit like he did with Walking in Memphis.\n\n1992: Arrested Development Chrysalis Records/EMI Nominees: Billy Ray Cyrus, Sophie B. Hawkins, Kris Kross and Jon Secada Before Arrested Development became the name of a cult TV show, it was actually the name of an alternative hip-hop group formed in Atlanta in 1988. Arrested Development won two Grammy Awards in 1993 for Best New Artist and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Rolling Stone also named Arrested Development Band of the Year in 1993, thanks to the group's debut album, 3 Years, 5 Months & 2 Days in the Life Of..., which spawned the catchy singles Tennessee, People Everyday and Mr. Wendel. The band is still together and has consistently released albums over the years, but none as successful as that first one.\n\n1993: Toni Braxton LaFace Nominees: Belly, Blind Melon, Digable Planets and SWV Toni Braxton and her sisters (Tamar, Towanda, Traci and Trina) were signed to Arista in the late 1980s as The Braxtons.

Toni Braxton, the R&B singer-songwriter's first album (which included the hits Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again), hit Number 1 on the Billboard chart, and sold 10 million copies worldwide. Seven more albums followed, including Secrets (15 million copies sold). Her Number 1 hit singles include You're Making Me High, Let It Flow and Un-Break My Heart. In addition to her two 1993 Grammys, Braxton would win four more awards in the category of Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (Breathe Again, You're Makin' Me High,  Un-Break My Heart and He Wasn't Man Enough), and one for Best R&B Album, for Love, Marriage & Divorce (with Babyface). Financial difficulties led to her declaring bankruptcy in 1996, but she rebounded. Outside of recording, Braxton appeared on Broadway in Beauty and the Beast, competed in season seven of Dancing With the Stars, and starred in the reality TV series, Braxton Family Values. Her memoir, Unbreak My Heart, was published in 2014. Braxton earned three more Grammy nominations in 2018, for Long As I Live and the album, Sex & Cigarettes.\n\n1994: Sheryl Crow DAN GROSHONG/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: Ace of Base, Blind Melon, Digable Planets and SWV Sheryl Crow sang backing vocals for some high-profile singers (Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Don Henley) before launching a solo career and releasing her debut album Tuesday Night Music Club in 1993, with the hits All I Wanna Do and Strong Enough. The single Leaving Las Vegas also found some chart success. It was all enough to earn Crow the Best New Artist win shortly after coming on the scene. That wouldn't be her last Grammy win. At the same Grammy ceremony she also nabbed Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year for All I Wanna Do. In total, she's received nine Grammys. Crow went on to release eight more albums and nab a big radio hit with Kid Rock on Picture.

With radio hits Hold My Hand, Let Her Cry and Only Wanna Be with You, it was difficult to avoid this band in the mid-'90s. Hootie & the Blowfish (Mark Bryan, Dean Felber, Darius Rucker, Jim Soni Sonefeld) took home the Best New Artist 1995 Grammy and continued putting out music until 2005. Frontman Darius Rucker continued to tour with the band over the years, but more recently has found success as a country artist. His version of Wagon Wheel won Best Country Solo Performance at the 56th Grammy Awards.\n\n1996: LeAnn Rimes Curb Records Nominees: Garbage, Jewel, No Doubt and The Tony Rich Project At age 14, LeAnn Rimes not only beat out fellow nominees Garbage, Jewel, No Doubt and The Tony Rich Project; she also became the youngest Grammy winner in history, a title she holds to this day.

She was the first woman to receive 10 Grammy nominations in a single year, and the first to win five in one night. She won another as co-producer of the 1999 Album of the Year, Supernatural by Santana. She bowed out of public life following her last album, MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, in 2001, though she continued to record. Hill rejoined the Fugees for a tour in 2005, but split yet again.

But it wasn't until her 1999 album, I Am Shelby Lynne, that the singer-songwriter broke out of the pack, with confessional songs told with an eclectic country sound.

Correspondent Erin Moriarty investigates the disappearance of Jennifer Dulos, a Connecticut mother of five, and the case against Fotis Dulos and Michelle Troconis in What Does The Other Woman Know? The Disappearance of Jennifer Dulos airing Saturday, February 13 at 10/9c on CBS.\n\nWhat does 46-year-old Michelle Troconis know? Does she know what happened to Jennifer Dulos, the Connecticut mother who vanished without a trace from her home on May 24, 2019? And if Jennifer Dulos was murdered, does Troconis know how and where Dulos' killer put her body? Connecticut authorities believe Troconis may hold the key to the mystery of the missing mom and can lead them to Jennifer Dulos' remains. They have charged her with conspiracy to commit murder and tampering with evidence in the case.\n\nIn newly released portions of interrogation videos, Troconis, the former girlfriend of Jennifer's estranged husband, is seen answering questions, at times pleading with investigators. Her attorney says he has seen no evidence that Troconis knows what happened to Jennifer and says she is simply a victim of overzealous investigators desperate to solve the case.\n\nMichelle Troconis and Fotis Dulos Sotiria Kontouli\n\nMichelle Troconis has a lot in common with the woman she is accused of helping to kill: tall, willowy, and talented, both women fell hard for the same man, Fotis Dulos, a handsome, charismatic home developer and daring athlete. By the time Troconis met Fotis Dulos in 2016, his 12-year marriage to Jennifer had run out of steam. They were essentially living separate lives in a huge home Fotis had built in Farmington, Connecticut. Fotis Dulos thrived on excitement and athletic competition while Jennifer mainly focused her energies into the day-to-day caring of five young children. Once a playwright and co-founder of a theatre troupe, Jennifer put her passions into loving and writing about her children, all under the age of 13.\n\nFotis, a waterskiing champion, hoped the same for his children and traveled with them to competitions. During his travels, he met and fell for Troconis, who was also a talented athlete. He met her in Miami and it was serious, says his sister, Rena Dulos Kyrimi. He was very much in love. The problem was Fotis Dulos was still very much married and living with Jennifer.\n\nTroconis never intended to become the other woman says her family. She thought the couple was already divorcing and didn't know the truth, they say, until long after she uprooted her life and moved with her daughter to Connecticut.\n\nJennifer Dulos Carrie Luft\n\nAfter Jennifer Dulos learned of her husband's affair in early 2017, she left him and moved their children into a rented home 70 miles away in New Canaan, Connecticut. The once-happy union became a bitter, contentious divorce and custody battle that drained Fotis Dulos of much of what mattered to him: money, work and, when he defied a court order and allowed his girlfriend to have contact with his children, he also lost shared physical custody.\n\nOn Friday morning, May 24, 2019, Jennifer, 50, vanished after taking her children to school. Her Suburban SUV was later found abandoned a little over three miles from her home. Soon after police found evidence of blood inside Jennifer's garage, the missing person case became a homicide investigation. What investigators discovered next put Jennifer's estranged 51-year-old husband on the top of the list of suspects. That's when his girlfriend Michelle Troconis became a person of interest as well.\n\nAfter Fotis Dulos gave investigators his cellphone, they discovered that he had been on Albany Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut, the night that Jennifer went missing. As they collected surveillance footage of the area, they saw a man who looked like Fotis Dulos dropping off black bags in trash cans on the street. And a woman seen leaning out of his truck appeared to be Michelle Troconis. What investigators later found in those bags convinced them they had Jennifer's killer: zip ties coated with human blood and Jennifer Dulos' DNA, two ponchos covered with copious amounts of blood and more DNA belonging to Jennifer Dulos. As lead investigator Sergeant Ken Ventresca of the Connecticut State police later said, It's not every day someone throws out bloody evidence, bloody clothes, you know, cut up. I mean who does that?\n\nThe next day, both Fotis Dulos and Michelle Troconis were arrested and charged with tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. Seven months later, in January 2020, when investigators still could not locate Jennifer Dulos, they charged her husband with murder and upgraded Troconis' charges to conspiracy to commit murder. Kent Mawhinney, a friend and sometime lawyer for Fotis Dulos, was also charged with conspiracy to commit murder. All three pleaded not guilty. Just weeks later, Fotis Dulos was dead after taking his own life.\n\nThe death of Fotis Dulos left Michelle Troconis in a precarious legal position, says her attorney, Jon Schoenhorn. I think the right expression here is, 'she's left holding the bag.' Authorities still plan on pursuing charges including conspiracy to commit murder against Troconis, leaving her facing the possibility of years in prison for the death of a woman she never met and whose body has never been found.\n\nLate last year, Michelle Troconis, two of her sisters and her father met with 48 Hours in Connecticut. Troconis is very thin, with the weight of the past year etched in her eyes and face. Although she declined to answer questions, her attorney and family answered an array of questions ranging from why Troconis moved to Connecticut in the first place to what she knew about Jennifer Dulos' disappearance.\n\nThey say that when Michelle Troconis moved with her young daughter to Connecticut, she knew nothing about the difficulties in the Dulos marriage. Attorney Schoenhorn says Fotis lied to Michelle, telling her that the couple was amicably divorcing.\n\nWell, hindsight, of course, is 20/20, right? Schoenhorn said. ...Had she even known about how contentious the relationship became between Jennifer and Fotis, she never would have moved up here. And Fotis Dulos didn't just lie to Michelle, says her family. He lied to all of them as well.\n\nMichelle's youngest sister, Claudia, insists Michelle had no involvement in Jennifer Dulos' disappearance. She's never been a violent person, Claudia says. She's never been revengeful, you know. ... She's a mother herself.\n\nBut what about the surveillance footage that appears to show Michelle inside Fotis Dulos' truck as he is discarding that incriminating trash on Albany Avenue in Hartford? Schoenhorn says he knows of no evidence that Michelle knew Jennifer Dulos was missing at that point or that she had any idea what was inside the black bags.\n\nSchoenhorn says no physical evidence ties Michelle to any of the evidence recovered from that night and points to those police videos that, he says, show Michelle cooperating with police. She not only did not know what was in those bags, says Schoenhorn, ...she told police this multiple times, she had no idea what he was actually doing.\n\nBut Connecticut investigators say Michelle Troconis changed her stories over the course of three interviews and they believe she knows more than what she is saying.\n\nDoes Michelle Troconis know what happened to Jennifer Dulos? If she doesn't, it's just possible that Fotis Dulos took that secret to his grave, leaving his own children a terrible legacy of loss.
President Trump and Vice President Pence met with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House Thursday during Varadkar's annual trip ahead of St. Patrick's Day. Varadkar brought a very special guest to breakfast at Pence's residence at the Naval Observatory — his partner, Dr. Matthew Barrett.\n\nLast year you and Karen said that my partner, Matthew, would be welcome to join us, and we're both really honored to accept the invitation this year, Varadkar said during the Friends of Ireland breakfast.\n\nVice President Mike Pence invited me and Matt to his home at the Naval Observatory this morning. It's great to be back here for a really warm reception. pic.twitter.com/Wkh2Ic8lWP — Leo Varadkar (@campaignforleo) March 14, 2019\n\nVaradkar — one of only a handful of openly gay world leaders — spoke about the changes he's seen in his country on LGBTQ issues and his desire for other places around the world to follow Ireland's lead. In 2015, Ireland's citizens voted in a landslide to legalize same-sex marriage — the first country to do so in a national popular vote.\n\nI lived in a country where, if I'd tried to be myself at the time, it would have ended up breaking laws, the Irish prime minister said Thursday. But today, that is all changed. I stand here, leader of my country, flawed and human, but judged by my political actions, and not by my sexual orientation, my skin tone, gender or religious beliefs.\n\nThanks to the Vice President and his sister for a lovely morning at his home. What a great way to start this St Patrick's weekend pic.twitter.com/2tzLEOTTpt — Leo Varadkar (@campaignforleo) March 14, 2019\n\nPence, a conservative Christian, has opposed same-sex marriage throughout his career, as well as the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy. He's received harsh criticism from social activists for pursuing anti-LGBTQ policies during his time as governor of Indiana. In January, his wife, Karen Pence, faced criticism for taking a teaching job at a Christian school that bans LGBTQ students and faculty. She did not attend the breakfast Thursday.\n\nPence called Varadkar's remarks at the breakfast inspiring. We're also really honored to be joined by your partner, Dr. Matthew Barrett. He does great work at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the vice president said.
GOLDEN, Colo. - A Colorado man being re-tried in his wife's murder denies any involvement in her death or their daughter's disappearance.\n\nMichael Blagg took the stand Tuesday, something he didn't do during his first trial, CBS Denver reports.\n\nHe told jurors in Golden that he came home from work in November 2001, and was very distressed that something horrible had happened when he found a blood-soaked mattress in the couple's bedroom.\n\nThere were no signs of his wife, Jennifer Blagg, or their 6-year-old daughter, Abby.\n\nBlagg said he called 911 to report Jennifer and Abby missing, but said on cross-examination that he didn't search for them in the house first.\n\nSeveral months later, Jennifer Blagg's body was found in a landfill near refuse from the company where Michael Blagg worked. Abby was never found.\n\nBlagg testified that he had attempted suicide a few months after his wife and daughter disappeared, because he was told there was no hope of finding them alive, and because he was being targeted by investigators.\n\nBlagg also said that he and his wife had arguments over their use of pornography to aid their sex life-- but that there was no reason for the marriage to end, reports CBS Denver.\n\nOn Monday, Blagg's defense team said hairs were found in the couple's bed that did not belong to either Michael or Jennifer.\n\nBlagg was found guilty of murder in 2004 in Mesa County but his conviction was later overturned because a juror concealed her experience with domestic violence.
MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A publishing house has canceled plans to publish a book by a Tennessee pastor who has been accused of sexual assault. The Commercial Appeal and The New York Times report Christian publisher Bethany House announced Monday that it canceled publication of The Ridiculously Good Marriage by Andy Savage. The publisher said the book may remain on retail websites for a short time until those are updated.\n\nThe move comes after allegations by a woman who said Savage sexually assaulted her while she was a 17-year-old high school senior in Texas in 1998.\n\nSavage made a confession this past Sunday at Highpoint Church in Memphis, Tennessee, CBS News' Jericka Duncan reported.\n\nAs a college student on staff at a church in Texas more than 20 years ago, I regretfully had a sexual incident with a female high school senior in the church, he said.\n\nHis request for forgiveness got a standing ovation from the congregation.\n\nJules Woodson was 17 years old when she says she was sexually assaulted by Savage during a ride home from church. At the time, Savage was a 22-year-old youth minister at a Houston church. Woodson recently went public about her story on a Christian blog.\n\nI did it because I was scared and I was in shock and I didn't understand what was happening, Woodson said.\n\nShe said she notified a different pastor, who told her to keep quiet. She said Savage left the church weeks later.\n\nIn the wake of the Me Too movement, Woodson felt the need to speak up. She sent Savage an email last month. He didn't respond until Monday, and she said he apologized.
Queen Elizabeth's eldest grandson Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn Phillips have decided to divorce, according to a statement issued on their behalf. Phillips — the son of Princess Anne and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips — and his wife are ending their marriage after nearly 12 years.\n\nThe couple married in 2008 at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, the same castle where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wed 10 years later. Phillips met his wife, who then went by Autumn Kelly, a Canadian, at Canada's Grand Prix in Montreal in 2003, according to the BBC.\n\nAccording to their statement, the couple first notified the royal family of their split last year.\n\nPeter Phillips and Autumn Phillips attend Royal Ascot at Ascot Racecourse on June 22, 2019 in Ascot, England. Getty Images\n\nAfter informing HM The Queen and members of both families last year, Peter and Autumn jointly agreed to separate, reads the statement.\n\nPhillips, 42, is a member of the royal family, but does not have an official title and is not a working royal, the BBC reports. His mother, Princess Anne, rejected the queen's offer of royal titles for her two children, Peter and Zara Phillips.\n\nThe couple's statement says they reached the conclusion that divorce was the best course of action for their two children and ongoing friendship.\n\nThe couple has two young daughters, Savannah, 9, and Isla, 7, whom they raised in Gloucestershire, England.\n\nThe decision to divorce and share custody came about after many months of discussions and although sad, is an amicable one, reads the statement. The couple's first priority will remain the continued well being and upbringing of their wonderful daughters.\n\nBoth families were naturally sad at the announcement, but fully supportive of Peter and Autumn in the joint decision to co parent their children, according to the statement.\n\nThe royal family has had a tumultuous start to the year, beginning with the announcement that Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, would step back from their senior royal roles, and no longer be official working members of the royal family.\n\nHarry and Meghan have said they plan to split their time between the United Kingdom and North America. Since their announcement, the couple has been spotted in Vancouver, Canada, where Meghan previously lived.
First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a whole bunch of made-for-reality TV drama, and then comes a baby in a baby carriage.\n\n\n\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna may not be doing it in that exact order, but TMZ reports that the 29-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and his fiancée of one month are expecting their first child together.\n\nThe couple seemingly confirmed the news themselves when they Instagrammed a pregnant avatar of Chyna and tagged each other over her belly.\n\n👶🏽🎉 A photo posted by www.Lashedbar.co (@blacchyna) on May 6, 2016 at 11:14am PDT\n\n\n\nThis will be Rob's first child and the 27-year-old model's second -- as you surely already know, she has a 3-year-old song, King, with Tyga. As you surely also know, Tyga is now dating Rob's younger sister, Kylie Jenner. Which makes the family tree very ... complicated.\n\nWhile Rob's sisters previously called their engagement f**ked up, it seems the family has since come around to the new couple.\n\nKylie is over the relationship, a source previously told ET. It was tough for her in the beginning. But she sees how happy he is and all she wants is for him to be happy. The general consensus in the house is 'Praise Chyna! Don't go!' They finally got the brother they always knew back.\n\nFind out more in the video below.

A 35-year retrospective featuring 72 of his works is now at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. His figures aren't just black; they are jet black -- bold, proud, undeniably black. And while his work may deal with grief, injustice and loss, for the most part Marshall focuses on everyday life: picnics and street scenes, daily rituals, and quiet moments -- a window into a world rarely represented in fine art.\n\nWe're used to hearing narratives of trauma, tragedy, disenfranchisement, pain, suffering, Marshall told correspondent Alex Wagner. Few of the stories that normalize the everyday life of people who are not always experiencing trauma 24/7. And I think those things need to be represented as well as anything else that we read about in the newspaper or we see on the news.\n\nGALLERY: The art of Kerry James Marshall\n\nFor more info:\n\nJayne Houdyshell and Laurie Metcalf in A Doll's House, Part 2.

The smartest advice I've gotten about betting on the Oscars is: Don't put your money on what you like best. You're just begging to lose.\n\nKEEP SCORE: Download our Academy Awards nominations ballot for your office pool or Oscar party (pdf)\n\nThe trick is to project yourself into the head of the average Academy voter, who – wanting you to keep buying tickets – is trying to project him- or herself into your (the average moviegoer's) head. So, it's a nutty feedback loop.\n\nSome people have said, Why would they nominate junk like 'Joker'? No one has a clue, especially me! But I do know Joker won't win Best Picture, which is fine. I thought it was one unpleasant note hit harder and harder. But Joaquin Phoenix will take Best Actor, because he's the best unhinged movie actor in the world, and he's never had a part with fewer hinges.\n\nCementing the idea that borderline personalities are in is the lock for Renée Zellweger in Judy. She nails Judy Garland who in the end was torn between sashaying onstage or jumping out the nearest window.\n\nThe best supporting turn was by Joe Pesci in The Irishman in a non-Joe Pesci role – conflict-averse. But I'll still be thrilled when Brad Pitt wins for Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.\n\nLaura Dern has won every other award as a calculating divorce lawyer in Marriage Story. But the twice-nominated Scarlett Johannsen could sneak in as the classiest character in the slapstick Nazi weeper Jo Jo Rabbit, a hodgepodge that's well-liked in Hollywood.\n\nBest Director? I predict Bong Joon-Ho for Parasite, with its surreal metaphor for income inequality – beautiful people on top, underclass below – and underclass under the underclass waiting to pop out and say Boo!\n\nBut Best Picture? 1917, the kind of movie Hollywood adores: state-of-the-art, wedded to old-fashioned, lump-in-the-throat anti-war melodrama. New and old … that's what they like. That's what they think you'll like.\n\nI'll be watching for the edgier stuff – the complaints about lack of diversity, Netflix, the president (don't forget him!), and also to see how presenters address the legacy of Kirk Douglas.\n\nYou will see a longing for change, side-by-side with a dread of change. Bet on it!\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Robbyn McFadden.
Hilary Duff's divorce from her ex, retired NHL star Mike Comrie, has been finalized.\n\nThe Younger actress, who filed for divorce in February 2015 citing irreconcilable differences, will have to pay her ex $2,408,786.40. This specific number equals 50 percent of the value of the couple's Beverly Hills mansion, which Duff will keep.\n\nOn top of the money, Comrie will also get to keep a number of the couple's valuable vehicles, including a 2014 Bentley and a 2013 Mercedes SUV, as well as some jewelry and several joint possessions.\n\nThe couple signed an enforceable prenuptial agreement before tying the knot, meaning they share no community property. Anything either of them earned before, during, or after their marriage remains theirs. Additionally, neither Duff, 28, nor Comrie, 35, are on the hook for spousal support.\n\nAccording to legal documents obtained by ET, the couple have also been awarded joint custody of their 3-year-old son, Luca Cruz Comrie, even though Duff initially asked for primary custody in her February 2015 divorce filing. They will also evenly split all child-rearing expenses.\n\nDuff and Comrie began dating in 2007, got engaged in February 2010 and tied the knot later that year, in August, during a ceremony in Santa Barbara. The couple welcomed Luca, their only child, in March 2012.\n\nThe couple announced their amicable separation in January 2014, more than a year before Duff would officially file for divorce. The actress opened up about the split in Cosmopolitan last March.\n\nIt wasn't working well enough to stay together, but there was still a lot of love involved, she said. It was just a slow set-in of us not being the match that we used to be. I'm lucky for the person he is and I am, and how we decided to handle this.
Starbucks has crafted a brand focused not only on coffee, but also on living up to progressive ideals. Now, that brand image is taking a hit following a racial bias incident at one of its stores.\n\nFewer consumers say they're as likely to buy food or drinks at Starbucks (SBUX) following the incident, according to new data from YouGov BrandIndex, a service that tracks brand perception. Last week, a Philadelphia store manager had two black men arrested when they refused to leave after using the store's restroom without making a purchase.\n\nThe backlash from the incident -- which has sparked protests and apologies from its CEO -- caused the company's consumer perception to drop to its lowest since November 2015, when the chain got criticized for replacing a symbol-filled holiday cup with a simple red design. About 25 percent of consumers surveyed said they would consider making a purchase at Starbucks on Tuesday, compared with 28 percent on Friday.\n\nBuzz about Starbucks has also dropped into negative territory, YouGov found. Its Buzz score, which is based on whether consumers say they've heard anything positive or negative about a brand, fell from 13 to -8 on Tuesday.\n\nThere might be some people who are passing by a Starbucks and might keep going, whereas before they might have stopped in, said Ted Marzilli, chief executive officer of data products at YouGov.\n\nIt's possible the impact will be short-lived, especially if no other incidents occur that mirror the racial bias of the Philadelphia arrest. However, another alleged incident of racial bias emerged in Los Angeles, when a black man claimed he was denied access to a bathroom at a Los Angeles store in January, even though a white man was given the entry code. Neither were paying customers.\n\nIt's interesting and ironic this is happening at Starbucks, because it's been at the forefront of progressive causes, Marzilli noted. It was very same-sex-marriage friendly, and its customers tend to say they believe society is much better when people of different races live in the same neighborhood or community.\n\nBy hitching itself to a progressive image, Starbucks may cause consumers to be more critical of it because they're likely to expect actions that match its rhetoric. There's some sense of betrayal, Marzilli said.\n\nStarbucks said it will close all of its stores on May 29 for racial bias training, which could cost the company about $7 million in lost sales.\n\nThe onus is on Starbucks to follow through with things its CEO talked about, Marzilli said. The store closing is a manifestation of that, but the downside is the end of May is a long way away. That's a lot of time for people to fill out that space with another narrative before Starbucks can implement that day of training.
Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel may have been feeling groovy when they sang The 59th Street Bridge Song all those years ago, but they've had many a rough moment since. This morning, on Garfunkel's 76th birthday, Rita Braver talks with a rock music legend (This story was originally broadcast on November 5, 2017):\n\nCan you believe I'm still doing this?\n\nRandom House\n\nYes he is! More than 50 years after Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel first hit the pop charts, at 76 Art Garfunkel is touring solo.\n\nBraver asked, Do you ever get tired of singing these songs, the ones that everybody wants to hear?\n\nNot really, he replied. I wouldn't do them if I didn't love them. I don't need to do this job. I do it only for love now.\n\nGarfunkel grew up in Queens, N.Y., his dad a salesman, his mom a homemaker.\n\nYou had two brothers, Braver said. Must have been pretty rambunctious in there.\n\nYeah, we fought all the time. That's what you do. What else do brothers do? They put a pillow over each other's heads, then they pound the pillow!\n\nBut Garfunkel was the one with the special gift.\n\nI would sing what I heard on the radio -- 'They try to tell us we're too young,' Nat King Cole. And I observed about age five or six, I can sing. This is nice.\n\nDid you dream of becoming a professional singer? Braver asked.\n\nPaul Simon and Art Garfunkel as Tom & Jerry, 1957. Publicity Photo\n\nNot at all, he said. I never actually thought that way until I met Paul Simon, when we were 11 and we met each other and practiced.\n\nThat grade school friendship would lead to one of the most popular duos in American musical history, and one of the most complicated, then and now.\n\nGarfunkel was often the lead singer, as well as arranger. But it was Simon who wrote the songs that have become classics. And so, Art Garfunkel says, he had a purpose in writing his recent memoir, What Is It All but Luminous (Knopf).\n\nI suppose, if I examine my inner mind, I would say, 'Time to come out of the shadow of Paul Simon and establish yourself as a thinking artist who can sing.' I know myself to be a creative guy, and I think my profile out in show business is 'the guy over Paul Simon's right shoulder.'\n\nWEB EXTRA: Read an excerpt from What It Is All but Luminous\n\nIn high school, they performed as Tom and Jerry, but split during college, only to reunite in 1963 as Simon & Garfunkel.\n\nTwo years later they had a number one hit, The Sounds of Silence:\n\nThe hit songs and albums would keep on coming.\n\nTheir music was even used in the groundbreaking 1967 Mike Nichols film, The Graduate.\n\nAnd then, Nichols offered Garfunkel a role in another film. He knew I wasn't an actor, but he was clever, Garfunkel said. He drove by in his limo to my house on 68th Street, rolls down the window and hands me a script: 'Catch 22.' 'Read this, Artie, I see a part for you. Look at Nately, Captain Nately.'\n\nHe followed it up playing Jack Nicholson's best friend in Carnal Knowledge.\n\nLeft: Art Garfunkel, Alan Arkin and Martin Sheen in Catch-22. Right: Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel in Carnal Knowledge. Paramount/Avco Embassy\n\nBut as for Simon & Garfunkel? They would release their fifth and final album in 1970. As Garfunkel put it in his book, The end of S&G slipped in on me. There never was an ending.\n\nBraver asked, Do you have a better analysis now that you look back on it? Or do you just like to think of it that way?\n\nI think the laughs were used up, he replied. We were tired of each other. All that studio togetherness, and when you finish, you have to go on tour together. When do I get a break from my funny friend? The jokes are not happening now.\n\nGarfunkel would weather some tough times. He stopped performing for a while after a brief, unhappy marriage. And later, he lost a long-time girlfriend to a drug overdose. But taking long walks helped.\n\nSo did reading. I go from book to book, he said. I do about two books a month.\n\nHe's up to 1,160 books, all carefully arranged in his New York study. I told you, I'm a nutcase.\n\nArt Garfunkel with correspondent Rita Braver in the singer's library. CBS News\n\nThe study also holds photos of his family -- his two sons with second wife, Kathryn, an actress and singer. They have been married since 1988.\n\nBraver asked, How did meeting her change your life?\n\nI got comfortable with life, he laughed.\n\nBy then, he was also comfortable with his music again … and his old pal, Paul Simon. At their legendary 1981 concert in Central Park, half a million people cheered.\n\nTo watch Art Garfunkel perform Bridge Over Troubled Water in The Concert in Central Park click on the video player below:\n\nBut Garfunkel, who can be fussy, saw it differently. In his book, the workaholic voted himself a C+, because I didn't get it as right as I wanted to get it.\n\nHe would have plenty of chances to get it right … two more tours with Simon, and solo gigs, too.\n\nAnd then in February of 2010, he lost his voice.\n\nYeah, I finished touring with Paul, I came home, and a month later I lost my voice, he said. My speech was very erratic. My singing was just not there.\n\nIt would take four long, hard years to get it back. And today Art Garfunkel is savoring every moment.\n\nBut what about his relationship with his old friend? He says they are at one of their low points.\n\nYou think it'll get better? Braver asked.\n\nIs he watching this show? Garfunkel said. Paul, turn off the TV! Yeah, it might. I think so. It might. We never know the future. I believe life is a surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Kay Lim.
LONDON -- A treasure trove of history goes up for auction on Wednesday -- newly discovered letters to and from a former first lady.\n\nAn old, battered briefcase containing the secrets of two battered lives. A case full of letters between a former British ambassador to Washington and a widowed woman he knew well. A woman named Jackie Kennedy.\n\nThe minute we cracked open the boxes, I saw her loopy handwriting and her loopy Js and I immediately knew it was Jackie Kennedy, said Matthew Haley, Head of Books and Manuscripts, for Bonhams auction house in the U.K., where the items will hit the block.\n\nHaley found the letters locked away in a British country home when the house contents were put up for sale.\n\nTo understand them, you have to roll back the clock to the Camelot years when David Ormsby-Gore, an old friend of JFK's, was British ambassador to Washington and the Kennedys and the Ormsby-Gores were great friends.\n\nThen fate took over, a few years after JFK was killed, Ormsby-Gore's wife Sylvia died, too, in a car crash.\n\nMaybe it was their common tragedies -- or their friendship -- or mutual affection, but in the following years Jackie and David became an item -- vacationing together, including in Cambodia.\n\nJackie Kennedy and former British ambassador to Washington, David Ormsby-Gore, on vacation in Cambodia. CBS News\n\nThe salutations on the letters are Dear David, dear dear David, dearest David ... were these love letters going back and forth?\n\nI think they are. She -- particularly the way she signs off you know she says 'with all my love,' Haley said. I think this is a real warmth there.\n\nThe letters contain no marriage proposal, but there's a clear sign one was made -- and rejected.\n\nWhen Jackie decided to marry Aristotle Onassis instead, Ormsby-Gore writes as a bitter, heartbroken man.\n\nLetters between Jackie Kennedy and David Ormsby-Gore. CBS News\n\nAs for your photograph, I weep when I look at it, Ormsby-Gore wrote.\n\nHer last letter to him has a touch of finality and -- it must be said -- cruelty.\n\nShe's writing from Aristotle Onassis' yacht, Haley says. With a Greek stamp and the stationary of his yacht, the Christina.\n\nAnd that was that. Or was it?\n\nWhen David Ormsby-Gore died 17 years later -- also in a car crash -- Jackie went to his funeral.
President Trump's first wife, Ivana, called his third wife, Melania Trump family, in an interview that aired Tuesday.\n\nI sent Melania the text, that the last thing I would like to do is say something bad about you, you know because you are family. And I don't say anything bad or do anything back to the family member, she said in an interview on Fox News' Fox and Friends.\n\nAsked if she thinks she should be first lady, Ivana said, Not at all because she said, Washington is tough, tough town. I was asked to be American ambassador to Czech Republic. I told him, I said, you know, if he would ask me 10, 15 years ago I would do it.\n\nIvana said, I think Donald is a good man, and he is trying to do the best he can and he's going to run the country as his business. He will negotiate.\n\nDescribing what it was like to raise their children, Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr., she said that Mr. Trump was always on the phone and wasn't a classic father who would take them on walks through Central Park.\n\nI would take the kids to Europe for two months -- June and July -- and they would fly economy, and I would fly first class, you know? and Ivanka said, 'Can i be upgraded?' I said, 'When you can afford it, you get upgraded.'\n\nThe Fox News interview with Ivana Trump was recorded before an interview that aired over the weekend on CBS Sunday Morning interview, in which she said she gets along with Melania Trump. One is nobody. And the other one is first lady, she said, referring to but not naming Marla Maples, the model who broke up his marriage to Ivana Trump. On Monday, Ivana said in another interview that she is first lady.\n\nI don't really want to call him there because Melania is there, and I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, Ivana said on ABC's Good Morning America. Because I'm basically first Trump wife, okay? I'm first lady, okay?\n\nFirst lady spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham, dismissed Ivana Trump's remark as having no substance.\n\nMrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, DC and is honored by her role as First Lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books, Grisham said.\n\nCBS News' Emily Tillett contributed to this report.
LOS ANGELES -- Meryl Streep will star in the second season of Big Little Lies, HBO said Wednesday, adding yet another high-profile lead to the Nicole Kidman-Reese Witherspoon drama. In a statement Wednesday, HBO said Streep will play Mary Louise Wright, the mother-in-law of Kidman's character, Celeste.\n\nMary Louise comes seeking answers about last season's violent death of her son, Perry, played by Alexander Skarsgard.\n\nKidman and Witherspoon star in and produce the series, which reaped Emmy, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards as best series. Kidman, Skarsgard and Laura Dern also collected multiple trophies.\n\nStreep, the most-nominated actor in Oscar history, picked up her 21st nod for this year's awards for her role in the newspaper drama The Post.\n\nStreep snagged an Emmy statue for her leading role in HBO's Angels in America. Her move to Big Little Lies will be her next big TV gig since then.\n\nHBO says season two will focus on the the malignancy of lies, the durability of friendships, the fragility of marriage ... and, of course, the vicious ferocity of sound parenting.\n\nMajor film stars have been lured to TV by the cable and programming boon, but Streep is the biggest catch yet -- especially at a time in which the industry has been forced to pay heed to its treatment of women by the sexual misconduct scandal and pay parity criticism.\n\nNo air date has been set.
Father's Day is a holiday to spend a little extra time with dad and let him know how much you care. Many take to social media to express their thanks to the fathers in their lives — including the families of some of the world's most famous people.\n\nFrom former President Barack Obama to Prince Charles to Kanye West, this is how many families in the public eye are paying tribute to their beloved dads online.\n\nBarack Obama\n\nMichelle Obama posted a sweet Father's Day message to her husband, Mr. Obama, on social media on Sunday. Thank you for the way you love our girls—and all the young people in this country, no matter who they are or where they come from, she wrote, alongside a photo of him with their two daughters, Malia and Sasha. We feel your warmth and generosity today and everyday. Happy Father's Day, Barack!\n\nPrince Charles and Prince William\n\nThe official social media channels of Britain's Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, posted multiple images of some of the royal family's patriarchs.

Why are there no emojis that represent interracial couples?\n\nA group of advocates which include dating app Tinder, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian and the founder of Emojinotion, Jennifer 8, are asking Unicode Consortium to add interracial couple emoji into its mix. The Consortium is the nonprofit that reviews and develops emoji standards,\n\nIn a proposal made public on Tuesday, they ask for the addition of 21 different sequences with various skin tones for the existing emoji, couple with heart, for example.\n\nTinder also launched a Change.org petition to drum up support.\n\nAs the largest and most diverse platform for meeting new people, we are uniquely positioned and incredibly proud to petition for this update, said Rosette Pambakian, Tinder's head of brand, in an e-mail. Inclusivity is a core value at Tinder, and we believe in fighting for what our users believe in.\n\nPambakian said Tinder ideated the concept for the interracial couples and is an author of the proposal.\n\nMultiracial emojis only became available in 2015. In 2017, Microsoft's Windows 10.0 added interracial couple sequences. But those can only be accessed by copy and paste for now.\n\nRelated: 157 new emoji coming to iOS, Android\n\nThere's been a steady rise in interracial marriages since 1967, according to a Pew Research Study. In 2015, about 17% of all newlyweds were in interracial relationships.\n\nTinder recently paid for a study on interracial couples that it also released on Tuesday. Its findings reveal 61% of respondents say they're very open to the idea of interracial dating and marriage.\n\nThe interracial couple emojis proposal features photos of some of the authors and their biracial spouses.\n\nOhanian is pictured with his wife, professional tennis star Serena Williams. He said in the proposal that emojis should reflect current society.\n\nWe want our kids to have emojis that look like their parents, he said in a statement. Emojis are the universal language of the internet and should reflect the modern world where interracial relationships are normal.\n\nOhanian was one of the advocates who helped make the hijab emoji a reality in 2017, along with Emojination's Lee.\n\nLee, who has advocated for a number of emoji including the dumpling, is a coauthor of the interracial couple proposal.
Is your phone, tablet and laptop killing those in-flight entertainment screens at each seat? Not quite.\n\nIn-flight internet provider Gogo and Delta Air Lines on Tuesday announced it was unveiling a new kind of tablet that would be affixed to the seat-back. Rather than a wired, custom-designed screen, Delta would install standardized Android tablets at each seat that would wirelessly stream content from an on-board server.\n\nThat will not only reduce the weight of the system, but also opens a lot of new possibilities for airlines.\n\nGogo's new product is part of a major shift in how in-flight internet is transforming how we stay entertained in the sky.\n\nThe new screens will start rolling out on the first of 75 new Bombardier C Series aircraft arriving at Delta in the spring.\n\nEven as seats are smaller and planes more packed, your flying experience is going to be marked by improved technology. And increasingly the advancements represent a marriage between our personal devices and in-flight entertainment and connectivity.\n\nOur Airborne Living Room\n\nHow we use our devices on the ground is now how we expect to use them when we fly, airlines say.\n\nPeople are very accustomed to consuming multiple pieces of information at one time these days, said Joe Kiely, Managing Director, Customer Experience & Product Development at Delta in an interview. And having the seat back screen and having streaming...and wi-fi, which is getting faster and faster is what they're really accustomed to when they're at home.\n\nDelta has those individual screens on all its new planes and it spent $770 million to add them to most of its older jets. And the carrier announced Wednesday the airline was adding free texting to all its connected aircraft.\n\nAirlines have split on the future of seat back screens. Smaller jets that don't hop between continents aren't getting the same electronic amenities as bigger jets. Airbus says only about 30% of its smaller single-aisle jets are delivered with personal monitors, the number is estimated to be even lower for Boeing.\n\nRelated: This plane may vastly improve flying in the U.S., if it first doesn't start a trade war\n\nBut with more passengers coming aboard with a myriad of electronics, some airlines are questioning if the screens they provide still have a place in the sky. Nearly 80% of Americans now own a smartphone and half have a tablet, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nUnited Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have all steered away. Instead, phones, tablets and laptops can tap into high-speed internet or on-board streaming to deliver the same entertainment library or live TV.\n\nAnd the country's biggest carrier, American Airlines, said that its 100 new single-aisle 737 Max jets would arrive without seat back screens. The airline said Thursday it was removing them from its current 737s.\n\nIt makes sense for American to focus on giving customers the best entertainment and fast connection options rather than installing seatback monitors that will be obsolete within a few years, the company said in a statement.\n\nJonathan Norris, vice president of sales and marketing for Panasonic Avionics, which supplies about half of the world's in-flight screens, says American's attitude is understandable. Your [in-flight entertainment] screen is judged by your latest iPhone or your tablet, he said. Panasonic is developing a new generation of more easily upgradable screens that will be ready around 2020.\n\nGoing The Distance\n\nWhile airlines debate the future of those seat-back screens, the one place they aren't going away is on long-distance flights.\n\nAirbus says all its new long-range A350 jets and A380 superjumbos are fitted with the screens at each seat. And over the past three years about 95% of its smaller twin-aisle A330s have the same. Boeing declined to supply its figures, but a review by CNNMoney suggests its long-range jets have similarly tricked-out cabins.\n\nThe electronics ban on nine Middle Eastern airlines earlier in 2017 put the screens back in the spotlight. The ban forced travelers to check or leave behind their laptops and tablets. One airline declared: 'Let us entertain you,' a nod to the individual systems at each seat for movies, games and even a view outside.\n\nEven low-cost, long-haul carriers like Norwegian Air Shuttle are putting screens at each seat on its biggest jets.\n\nIn-flight entertainment has come a long way. The first in-flight movie dates back to the 1920s, but aerial cinema took its biggest leap in the 1990s with small personal screens at each seat. Airlines started adding sluggish wi-fi in 2004, but it wasn't until smartphones and tablets arrived a decade ago, that carriers started to think differently about aerial entertainment.\n\nDelta's move to improve the seatback screen is only the first step, says Gogo. By connecting the aircraft through a high-speed satellite internet connection, the seatback screen may open up a world of entertainment choices for airlines.\n\nHigh-speed services from Gogo, Honeywell, Panasonic and ViaSat can already stream video to a device you bring aboard, but it won't be long before airlines can enable streaming services like Hulu, HBO Now and Amazon Video directly to the seatback.\n\nAnd the big names in content streaming are taking notice. Netflix on Monday said it had developed a new type of encoding to shrink the amount of bandwidth used for in-flight streaming.\n\nAirlines are also merging on-board technology with the devices passengers have in their carry-on luggage.\n\nLufthansa's app now lets you make personal playlists of music, audio books and films that are ready on the screen when you take your seat. Singapore Airlines wirelessly pairs your phone or tablet with your screen to control a movie or follow the flight's progress.\n\nThis is about the internet of me, says Norris. This is about a passenger who walks on, synchronizes their phone with the seat back...to customize their experience on board.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nBritish lawmakers have soundly rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal, in the biggest defeat for any UK government in the modern parliamentary era.\n\nAfter 200 speeches across eight days of debate, members of the House of Commons ignored the Prime Minister's final pleas to support her plan and threw it out by 432 votes to 202.\n\nThe margin of defeat – greater than the previous record set in 1924 – means the Prime Minister now faces a deep political crisis with no clear way forward.\n\nThe opposition Labour party immediately triggered a vote of no-confidence in May's government, hoping to capitalize on a perilous moment to force a general election. Acknowledging the scale of the defeat, the Prime Minister said she would allow time for the House of Commons to debate the motion on Wednesday.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the defeat catastrophic and said a vote of no-confidence would allow the House of Commons to give its verdict on the sheer incompetence of this government.\n\nBut May urged lawmakers to listen to the British citizens who voted to leave the EU. I ask members on all sides of the house to listen to the British people, who want this issue settled, and to work with the government to do just that, May said.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nMay now has 24 hours to save her government. If she loses the vote of no-confidence, it makes a general election more likely.\n\nIf she survives, however, May said she would follow a two-stage process to break the Brexit impasse. First, she offered cross-party talks with lawmakers as an attempt to try and figure out a way forward. May promised the government would approach those talks in a constructive manner.\n\nThen, if a consensus emerges, she would take a revised plan to the European Union.\n\nBut there isn't much time: Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, whether a deal is in place or not. Every day that passes without this issue being resolved means more uncertainty, more bitterness and more rancor, May said.\n\nIt seems likely that May will survive the confidence vote. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) – the Northern Irish party that props up May's minority government – said it would work with the Prime Minister to secure a better deal.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster welcomed Tuesday's vote, saying the UK parliament had acted in the best interests of the entire United Kingdom.\n\nFoster added: Whilst some may wish to use this defeat to boost their political ambitions, we will give the government the space to set out a plan to secure a better deal.\n\nPHOTO: DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images Pro-Brexit supporters hold up placards outside the UK Parliament as MPs debated.\n\nEuropean response\n\nMoments after the vote, European Council President Donald Tusk demanded the UK clarify its intentions on its plan as soon as possible.\n\nIn a statement, Tusk said: We will continue our preparations for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario. The risk of a disorderly exit has increased with this vote and, while we do not want this to happen, we will be prepared for it.\n\nIn a tweet, Tusk also pointed out that the UK could unilaterally withdraw its notification to leave the EU: If a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is?\n\nIf a deal is impossible, and no one wants no deal, then who will finally have the courage to say what the only positive solution is? — Charles Michel (@eucopresident) January 15, 2019\n\nPresident of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, also warned of the ticking clock. I take note with regret of the outcome of the vote in the House of Commons this evening. I urge the UK to clarify its intentions as soon as possible. Time is almost up, Juncker wrote.\n\nHow the UK got here\n\nTuesday night's vote was the product of more than two and a half years of tortuous debate and negotiations, after 51.9% of British people voted to leave the EU in 2016.\n\nUntangling a 45-year marriage was not as easy as some Brexiteers claimed it would be. Particularly when it came the contentious Irish backstop – an insurance policy to prevent the return of border infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – which has been a thorn in the side of May's deal.\n\nMay's defeat seemed inevitable. Lawmakers were due to vote on her deal in December but the process was thrown into disarray after May pulled the plug, admitting she would lose the vote by a significant margin.\n\nThe biggest challenge came from hardline pro-Brexit lawmakers within her own Conservative party – their opposition to what they see as an overly soft exit has dogged her deal from the start.\n\nIt's hard to see an obvious way out of the mess. Even if a consensus can be reached in parliament, there's no guarantee the EU would agree to reopen negotiations.\n\nIf no agreement can be reached, and the UK edges towards crashing out of the EU without a deal, it's possible the government could collapse, or the Conservative party could replace May as leader.\n\nAnother possibility is that parliament could force a second referendum, or – least likely of all – scrap Brexit altogether.\n\nThe only certainty is that with just 73 days left before the country is due to leave the EU, the UK is no closer to knowing what will happen.

We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\n(CNN) There are men of character in the U.S. Congress, both House and Senate. There are women of character, too. But the evidence for 'character' needs to be something other than the iteration of the word itself, writes Marjorie Garber in her book Character: The History of a Cultural Obsession.\n\nThat is a useful frame for trying to make sense of the dramas that proliferated on Capitol Hill this week as Congress took up multiple nominations to President Joe Biden's Cabinet and held its first hearing on the January 6 insurrection. As Garber notes, the translation of individual traits into a national character most often occurs at times of stress, as a marker not so much of social progress as of social and cultural anxiety.\n\nWe saw this. Conviction and commitment (and the lack of same), and in darker terms, eccentricity, hypocrisy and excuses made for bad behavior were on full display on the nation's highest political stage.\n\nDismissing hypocrisy with a laugh is part of what has left America's political discourse vulnerable to infiltration by dangerous conspiracy theories, wrotereacting to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson's remarks during hearings about the violent Capitol riots. He suggested, citing multiple discredited claims, that the day had a jovial, festive tone and that the assault had been a false-flag operation. As Ghitis pointed out: That conspiracy theories exist and are spreading is not news, but hearing them uttered by a US senator during an official congressional hearing marks a new low, one that demands we sit up and take notice.  And because tens of millions of Americans believe the same thing[s]... by uttering that poisonous nonsense from the halls of Congress, Johnson is pumping more fuel into a dangerous fire.\n\nWhile no huge new revelations emerged during Tuesday's testimony about the US Capitol riots, the hearing sharpened the contours of the story, bringing into focus staggering security, defense and leadership failures,observed: There was no shortage of finger-pointing and blame-passing, but one big takeaway was clear: We've barely scratched the surface of what happened on one of the most ignominious days in American history.\n\nAndrea González-Ramírez, writing for Gen, noted of the nominees, all of whom would be history-making firsts in their positions if confirmed: I saw a familiar pattern develop.

Champagne corks pop in Berlin as gay rights supporters celebrate a historic vote to legalize same-sex marriage Photographs by Andrea Gjestvang for CNN Story by Laura Smith-Spark and Claudia Otto, CNN\n\nBerlin (CNN) — Pouring rain could do nothing to dampen the spirits of scores of people who gathered outside the Bundestag in Berlin on Friday morning, some clutching rainbow umbrellas, to await parliament's vote on a bill legalizing gay marriage in Germany.\n\nAs news came that the bill had passed — convincingly — they broke out into loud cheers, wept tears of joy and exchanged kisses. Some popped champagne corks in celebration despite the early hour.\n\nThis was the day that some had doubted would ever come. And now, in the space of a few days, an offer by Chancellor Angela Merkel to allow lawmakers a free vote on the issue has become all but law.\n\nPeople celebrate outside the Chancellery in Berlin after lawmakers voted to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nOnce Germany's Senate approves the bill next week, as expected, homosexual couples in Germany will have the same rights as heterosexual couples to marry and jointly adopt children — barring any legal challenge.\n\nIt is a very important moment for Germany and for the queer people in Germany, because we fought really long for equality in our rights and now it is time, project manager Andreas Reschke told CNN.\n\nAsked if he had any marriage plans, Reschke laughed and looked at his partner as he responded. Yeah, maybe.\n\nAndreas Reschke kisses his boyfriend after the result was announced.\n\nNico, a 20-year-old student who preferred to give only his first name, said he had traveled with his partner from Dresden, 120 miles away, to be part of the landmark moment and that he was now so happy.\n\nWe woke up very early and we knew it was raining in Berlin, but we thought it is so important we have to come here, he said. It is incredible, I can't believe it. I think (Merkel) said it on Monday and today is Friday and we have a new law.\n\nThe change means his dream of marriage is now possible, he said, as is his hope of one day adopting children.\n\nNico and Jan came to Berlin from Dresden to witness the historic moment.\n\nHannah Klaubert, 26, said it was important to be visible on such a significant day — and that the fight for equality was not over.\n\nThere are still 200 people who voted against (the bill) today, so I think it's going to be important still, said Klaubert, who works for an international non-profit organization.\n\nAnd there are so many other issues like trans-rights and all other kinds of things that are not okay here and that we need to keep on fighting for.\n\nHannah Klabuert hugs her partner.\n\nSpeaking after the bill passed, Merkel — who had until Monday opposed the holding of a free vote on the issue — said she had voted no, but that it had been important to put it to a vote of conscience.\n\nKlaubert said she was unimpressed by the way the Chancellor handled the issue. I think it was just a political, cold-hearted strategy and I really don't like it.\n\nFor Torsten Benzin, a lawyer, the change in the law is hugely significant.\n\nTorsten Benzin said Friday's vote was as monumental a moment as the fall of the USSR.\n\nIt took almost 30 years in Germany, we fought for it and today is the day. For me personally, because I'm from the former GDR, this is as important as the Berlin Wall falling, he said.\n\nI'm already in a partnership and of course, I will now finally change it into a real marriage. This means no longer having to tick boxes on forms to say that he is partnered rather than married, Benzin said, adding: My sexuality is nobody's business.\n\nHe said Merkel had delayed on the issue until her hand was finally forced by pressure from rival political parties ahead of September's elections. I believe that it was a tactical maneuver because she knew, if she didn't do it now, it would be an ever-lasting thing for the next coalition negotiations.\n\nRainy weather didn't stop people from gathering outside the Bundestag in Berlin.\n\nSoftware developer Sebastian Vetter told CNN he had braved the downpour to be part of the historic moment.\n\nIt is important to show we are here, we support gay marriage, marriage equality, marriage for everyone — so that the people there who are giving their vote know we are here and we are proud to be part of the community, he said.\n\nMerkel could have acted on the issue far sooner, Vetter said, but no matter how it happened it just happened. Now we got the chance and we have to use it.\n\nIt is a historical day and yes let's celebrate the whole weekend, said Sebastian Vetter.\n\nWhile he has no immediate plans to get married, Vetter is very happy to now have that option.\n\nLet's see what the future brings, but as we saw in other countries, if there is gender equality people are more aware that people love people and that has nothing to do with their sex or gender.\n\nIt is a step in the right direction to end discrimination.
Atlanta (CNN) I live alone in my home surrounded by my family who live here, too... it's corona-complicated.\n\nI haven't seen them in weeks. Not in person. I hear them, their footsteps, and my wife's voice as she talks on the phone to others. The creak of the floor, the open and close of a door. The TV. The shower.\n\nI am haunted by living ghosts.\n\nWeeks ago my wife, Blis, and I planned what we'd do if someone in our family got sick, including how we would divvy up living space to isolate the patient. It's a concern because my wife has an autoimmune disease.\n\nWe had already stocked up. Being a journalist, you are pretty up on the information, and the virus writing was on the wall some time ago. But events have unraveled in ways I hadn't fully considered.\n\nI had been on the road about two weeks, in Alabama for an execution, then on the trail of the coronavirus, hopping flights to hot spots in Florida, Boston and New York.\n\nUsually my family is thrilled when I tell them I'm headed home. This time I could hear the hesitation in my wife's voice when I called with the news.\n\nYou can keep going, she said It's OK.\n\nI said CNN had told us we all were now going to be based and working from home.\n\nOh, was the reply.\n\nIt wasn't that she didn't love me. But for the first time in 30 years she wasn't sure she wanted me... home.\n\nI knew why. I was a threat.\n\nThe rest of the family had been sheltering in place. I was waltzing back with who knows what. And though I had no symptoms, I had to be treated like that patient we had hypothesized weeks ago.\n\nOnce at my house, in the garage, over the phone, I was told what my life would be.\n\nYou will go up to the master bedroom she said. She had already hurriedly evacuated her things. That is where you live, eat and work.\n\nMy heart said, This seems pretty extreme. My head said, She's exactly right.\n\nSavidge has quarantined himself in a bedroom to protect the rest of his family.\n\nTwo weeks is what they recommend, she added, referring to the self-quarantine guidelines. And every time you go off on another story... the clock resets.\n\nSo, in the bathroom, I have a cooler full of drinks, a coffee maker and sanitizing wipes.\n\nIn the bedroom, I have three computers for work, another to watch Netflix, and two phones that serve as communications and camera for video links to CNN and my team.\n\nIf I need anything, I call my wife or son and it materializes outside my door. There's a knock, they retreat, I retrieve once they have vanished again.\n\nI do leave the house each day to exercise. I call down. The rest of the family shelters in place till I'm out the door. We do the same in reverse when I come back.\n\nSavidge used a tablet to continue his tradition of making a birthday card for his wife.\n\nMy biggest challenge so far has been a birthday card. I have made one for my wife every year of our marriage. Today, her birthday, I struggled. I managed some crude drawings using a tablet.\n\nThe hard part was getting it to print remotely downstairs when I couldn't see if anything was coming out. It took several tries coordinating over the phone with my son, who was at the printer.\n\nFinally, success.\n\nOn his wife's birthday, a slice of cake was left for Savidge outside his self-imposed quarantine room.\n\nThen tonight over FaceTime, I joined my family singing Happy Birthday. Instead of blowing out the candles, my wife extinguished them with a wave of a magazine.\n\nMoments later came a knock and a slice at my door. I never saw who delivered it.\n\nThese are the times in which we live.

She slammed the complete lack of empathy from President Trump and made clear that she would support those who have trouble stretching their paychecks to pay for rent. To highlight the contrast between her and Trump, Klobuchar continually repeated, I know you and will fight for you.\n\nBut it wasn't just her final answer. Senator Klobuchar was solid on her defense of voting for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and why big money, voter purges, and gerrymandering are hurting the political process. Finally, Klobuchar pointed to the popularity of the Affordable Care Act, and delivered an excellent defense of keeping it in favor of Medicare for All.\n\nJoe Biden: A-\n\nBiden defended the politics of the past with more vigor than in any previous debate. He began by mentioning many of the policies he supported, from fighting domestic violence, to banning chemical weapons, and allowing same sex marriage, going on to say, I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad.\n\nBiden also effectively highlighted his record on gun control and slammed Senator Bernie Sanders for voting to protect gun manufacturers against lawsuits from victims of gun violence.\n\nFinally, in a uniting stance, Biden asked the audience members to stand and applaud the actions of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, only to be fired on Friday by President Trump.\n\nBiden should reiterate his commitment to African-American voters, instead of simply repeating poll numbers that point to their strong support for his candidacy. Finally, Biden should try to remember that his newly found energetic anger isn't appropriate for every answer in the debate.\n\nBernie Sanders: B+\n\nSenator Sanders was effective in his overall message about corruption, taking on drug companies, and price fixing. And toward the end of the debate, Sanders was persuasive when he brought up the climate crisis and argued that military spending around the world could be better used to fight our common enemy, which is climate change..\n\nSenator Sanders took some shots at Pete Buttigieg for courting wealthy donors, which would have been more effective if the Senator had been able to provide clear examples of how campaign money might have influenced specific policy decisions. Sanders also had a bit more trouble on issues like the cost of his health care plan, and gun control, but ultimately came out with decent defenses.\n\nElizabeth Warren: B+\n\nEven though Warren may not have stood out in the first half of the debate, she set up her answers with a clever theme and reiterated the values of the party by stating: We are Democrats. This played well with her indictment of the overarching corruption in the political system that favors corporations and the wealthy.\n\nPerhaps her best moment came when she criticized Pete Buttigieg's answer on racial disparity in policing, and easily pivoted to the broader topic of why we need race-conscious laws in all areas, including housing, education, employment.\n\nFinally, while I like that Warren seemingly stood her ground on the need to withdraw troops from the Middle East, she then hedged her answer when she was pressed on whether she would maintain a US military presence in the region if her generals advised her to do so by saying, I want to hear the plan. In the end, I wasn't sure precisely what her position was.\n\nPete Buttigieg: C+\n\nButtigieg's best moments came when he talked about his own experiences. As a veteran, Buttigieg was excellent when talking about Trump being unfit to serve as a commander-in-chief. He argued that Trump has no regard for the military when he does things like refusing to read the intelligence reports or pardoning war criminals.\n\nButtigieg had trouble answering a question about why marijuana arrests of African-Americans increased while he was mayor of South Bend, Indiana. And Buttigieg missed his moment when he was criticized for accepting big money donors. His defense -- that Democrats needed to bring everybody into the fold -- fell flat. Buttigieg delivered a stronger answer in the previous debate when he said that Democrats needed all the financial help they could get in order to beat Trump.\n\nTom Steyer: C\n\nSteyer's theme was that the Democratic nominee must be able to hit Trump on Trump's best talking point: the economy. Over three different questions, Steyer mentioned how the economy must be central if a Democrat wants to beat Trump. This strong use of repetition played to his strength.\n\nWhile Steyer's eye contact with moderators, other debaters, and audience members was much better than in previous debates, he still made a basic debating error by bringing up a point without explaining it. Steyer claimed one of Biden's campaign surrogates made a racist remark. Steyer refused to drop this point but did not clearly explain the situation. What happened? I don't know -- because Tom Steyer didn't offer an explanation. Steyer's attack left viewers confused, and Biden went on to brag about his support among the Black Caucus.\n\nAndrew Yang: C\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nI liked that Yang went back to his Freedom Dividend -- a $1,000 a month stipend -- as his theme. What hurt Yang in this debate was his inability to tie the idea of a universal basic income to solid evidence that it will help issues from social justice to employment and even addiction. When Klobuchar pressed him, Yang should have interjected and spoken up about how he'd pay for his addiction treatment centers.\n\nOverall, I thought Yang was a bit off in his delivery last night with misplaced pauses, a lackluster speaking style and a rare inability to focus on presenting his most persuasive answers. To be honest, I think not being in the Iowa debate might have thrown off his timing. Both in substance and in style, I've heard Yang give better answers in previous debates.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n\n\nERIN BURNETT, HOST: OUTFRONT next, the losses at JPMorgan, the number getting bigger today. The Dow took a hit and a high level executive lost her job.\n\n\n\nAnd possible new evidence of Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. Today there's a diagram. We show it to the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein OUTFRONT tonight.\n\n\n\nAnd new details just released about the case against George Zimmerman, the man charged with killing Trayvon Martin. Let's go OUTFRONT.\n\n\n\nGood evening, everyone and OUTFRONT tonight we have breaking news. The market today dropped about 125 points, thanks to Greece and JPMorgan. Deepening trading losses at the bank today. The total losses for America's biggest bank, at this moment we can tell you could now be $4 billion. Just on Friday we were telling you it was only three billion and you may have seen reports the day before that it was two billion. And JPMorgan is about to face a firing squad here in Washington. At the bank today heads started to roll.\n\n\n\nThe first out was the woman at the top of the chief investment officer, Ina Drew (ph). She made $30 million in compensation in the past two years. It's unclear at this time how much of that may be clawed back related to recent competition reform. We're also just hours away from a more public showdown. CEO Jamie Dimon will be facing shareholder fire in person at the company's annual meeting in Tampa.\n\n\n\nJamie likes a fight but you can bet that he is not thrilled about the timing of this. There will be a lot of tough questions from shareholders and here in the halls of the Senate there's an investigation in the works. Senator Bob Corker, Republican from Tennessee, is the man who called for the hearings and he's OUTFRONT tonight. And good to see you, Senator.\n\n\n\nSEN. BOB CORKER (R-TN), SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE: Good to be with you, Erin.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right, so what do you want to find out?\n\n\n\nCORKER: Well I mean this is an interesting point in time. Rules are being promulgated right now that affect all of these things. And the question is under current laws that have been passed, if they're fully in place, was this in fact a proprietary trade or not, which is something we don't want to see happening in these institutions, or was this really a legitimate hedge that would take place within an institution. We've been getting a lot of, you know, this has evolved.\n\n\n\nWe had a lot of conversations this weekend with the examiner in charge at the OCC that oversees JPMorgan. And we got one piece of input that's evolved, that sort of walked back away from that and I guess at the end of the day this is very complex. This is certainly no threat whatsoever to JPMorgan as far as it being --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Well it's small relative to their assets.\n\n\n\nCORKER: Yes, this is two months worth of earnings to them, but the issue is there are a lot of rules that are being created right now and whenever you have especially something this high profile it's going to affect the outcome --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: -- of what's actually happening right now in Washington.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: But you're saying looking at the top accountants and auditors who are looking at this right now they still are not able to determine whether it was proprietary, i.e., should not be happening under the new rules --\n\n\n\nCORKER: Right.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: -- or legitimate?\n\n\n\nCORKER: And those rules aren't in effect yet.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: The question is what's really happened here and do we have laws that affect what's been happening. There's some very specific language in the Volcker Rule that really -- that talks about hedging and it talks about aggregate, it talks about unique trades and the fact is nobody yet has been able to determine whether this is something that could stay in place or not.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: So -- but JPMorgan itself, I mean is it possible you could do something about the bank? I mean you talk about it being small for that bank, and it is. And some people say, oh, well that's a sign that the system is strong. But then you could look at it and say why is the bank so big. It's 45 percent bigger in terms of assets, 2.3 trillion in assets. That's 15 percent of the U.S. economy, JPMorgan and it's 45 percent bigger now than it was right before the financial crisis, just to be clear.\n\n\n\nCORKER: Yes.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: I mean is that OK?\n\n\n\nCORKER: Well I mean that is a whole different issue. And you know there was resolution language that I actually spent a lot of time on myself that you know you create the opportunity to wind -- you have the ability to wind down an institution that fails. But again, that's a whole separate issue --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right. But you could make the argument it isn't because you could say well if it were smaller, Jamie Dimon would have known what was going on opposed to --\n\n\n\nCORKER: (INAUDIBLE) so here's the question. Under Volcker --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: -- is this something that is legitimate after Volcker is fully implemented? A lot of people are saying yes. Secondly, there are people who say that this couldn't have happened if you had the Glass-Steagall (ph) regime in place.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCORKER: The OCC -- the OCC has categorically said that's not true, this could have still occurred. And if you had -- if you downsize the institutions, this kind of trade could still occur.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: So I think what we need to do is understand you know how this -- how this occurred. It was all on the banking side, not on the investment bank side. And do we have policies that appropriately deal with this? So this is, again, very unique, very specific, very complex.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nCORKER: And we only had one hearing on the Volcker Rule prior to making it law.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Although -- I hear you, but I mean unique and specific, I feel like we hear that every time there's a big trading loss. They are all unique and specific. That's why they keep happening.\n\n\n\nCORKER: Yes. No, no, no, look --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: That's the problem.\n\n\n\nCORKER: I mean and let's think about it. I mean human beings do bone-headed things. In a business like this, things like this are going to occur. We need to make sure we try to regulate properly. But the best antidote to this is to have capital requirements that are sufficient. And as we mentioned earlier, this is a very large institution.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes.\n\n\n\nCORKER: The riskiest thing they do is to make a loan. And what we need to ensure is that capital requirements are strong enough. And in this case, obviously, way beyond that.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Now, you're speaking for reform so I don't mean to imply that you're not. But your top contributor was JPMorgan Chase. Individual and PAC (ph) donations, $61,000. You're up for re- election.\n\n\n\nCORKER: Yes.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Do you feel conflicted? Do you feel that you're more likely to be sympathetic listening to Jamie Dimon because he gives you a lot of money?\n\n\n\nCORKER: I mean -- you know my race last time was a national race that was huge. There were people who contributed from all walks of life and the same is true this time. I was the first person who called for a hearing here, so I don't think that's the case at all and I know it's not the case. And, no, I don't feel conflicted at all. Look, I tell these guys when they come in, I just had this same conversation with Jamie Dimon recently and a group of other people here I'm not a friend of banking.\n\n\n\nI'm not a foe of banking. What I want to see is that we have capital markets -- that we have capital markets in this country that function appropriately, that we have a financial system that meets the needs of an economy like we have in the U.S. and I just want to see it work in the appropriate way. One of the biggest setbacks we've had to our economy is the crisis in this financial system that sets us back years.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nCORKER: So look I just want to make us -- I want to make sure that we have good outcomes here. And what -- and senators are not basing judgments on this or things that they believe to be perceptions, but the reality of what's actually happened in this case and hopefully a hearing will help us do that.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right, well Senator, thank you very much. Senator Corker of course joining me here in Washington. Now let's check in with John Avlon in New York. John, what are your thoughts? I'm curious just overall about your thoughts about lobbying dollars going from industries to committees that regulate those industries.\n\n\n\nJOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well look the growth of lobbying over the past decade in particular has been a real problem. Many people point to it as a cause for not just the increased spending we've seen but things like the lobbying that has watered down the Volcker Rule. Much of it was pursued by JPMorgan Chase. So lobbyists do have their thumb on the scale and it's a growing problem in Washington. And it's contributed to a lot of the frustration that people feel at home, the sense that Washington isn't working. Lobbyists are an important reason -- part of the reason why.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: So do you think, John that we'll be able to get reforms or what's your sense?\n\n\n\nAVLON: Well, look, follow the money. That's one of the tougher things to do, but certainly in this specific case calling for a hearing is a step in the right direction. The question is, is it not just about asking regulators what went wrong but bringing members of JPMorgan Chase and of course this is all complicated by the fact that JPMorgan Chase has been the responsible bank and they've been powerfully arguing against regulation, against the Volcker Rule. Well, that argument is going to be a lot tougher to make going forward as we find out this loss isn't two billion as they said last week, but now four billion perhaps or higher. This is a complicated position they find themselves in of their own making.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes, absolutely of their own making and as we said completely avoidable as well. John Avlon thank you.\n\n\n\nAnd ahead, Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, joins me to talk about evidence of a possible weapons test, explosive test for a nuclear weapon in Iran.\n\n\n\nAnd President Obama slamming Mitt Romney for his time at Bain Capital, calling the Republican a job-killing vampire on the same day he well had lunch with a private equity titan to raise money. Tonight Romney fires back.\n\n\n\nAnd hangings and decapitations. We're going to take a look at what could be the biggest threat to this country. It's not in the Middle East. It's across our southern border. We'll be back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Our second story OUTFRONT, countdown to an Iran showdown. There is new evidence today that Iran is moving forward with a nuclear weapons program, just as talks are getting under way to convince the country to stop its suspected program. Negotiators from the International Atomic Energy Agency today left the Iranian mission in Vienna in silence. Usually you know they'll take the opportunity -- you see the cameras there -- to talk to them to say something. They said nothing.\n\n\n\nThe IAEA is in the middle of its first talks with Iran in three months. The latest report from the agency, of course you may recall, said there were quote strong indications of possible nuclear weapons development. Indications like this picture from The Associated Press in today's Washington Post. Now let me just explain exactly what you're looking at here because I looked at this and said what is this? Something that could be in my backyard. It's a drawing of what's believed to be a nuclear explosion containment chamber hidden at a secret Iranian military base perhaps near a site called Parshan (ph) that the government in Iran has refused weapons inspectors access to.\n\n\n\nExperts say a chamber like this is what you use to test a nuclear weapon. And we talked to them. They confirmed that. Important to say, though, that this picture is not a picture that we have confirmed the authenticity of. There are, though, new signs that the economic sanctions against Iran are working. Take this story on the front page of today's Washington Post. Quote Iran unable to sell oil stores it on tankers. Literally they're storing it on tankers, turning off the GPS on the tankers so that -- because it's against maritime law to do so because they don't want anyone to know where the tankers are (INAUDIBLE) they're trying to sail into ports and just find anyone to buy their oil. So earlier today I spoke to Senator Dianne Feinstein. She is a key leader in the Senate on national security issues, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and I began by asking her what it will take to reach an agreement with Iran.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nSEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN: I think all of us pretty much know what the parameters of an agreement are. And I think we also know the window is closing, that Israel is quite adamant that this is an existential threat, that she will not let Iran achieve a nuclear warhead and that means all kinds of unpredictable military actions.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: When you say everyone is on the same page about a deal, I was talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu a couple of weeks ago and he said he would allow no enrichment, none at all, not even the three percent that you would be using if you were using nuclear power for medical use or things like that. That doesn't really seem to be the same page as the United States, though, right? I mean would --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: The United States would accept a little bit more, right?\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: I don't think that's the United States' position. I think its confined enrichment to five percent, limited to the medical isotopes. Move anything above five percent out of the country or secure it --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: -- have full transparency and 24/7/365 day-a-year access for the IAEA to all these sites. And then be willing to also talk about other things, which is what the Iranians have wanted to do. I am hopeful. In my view it's the best chance of a solution. Of course this is the P-5 (ph) plus one, so it's a unique bargaining agent, you might say.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: When you talk about access, I want to ask you about Israel in a second, Israel issue, but access. I have this picture which I know is -- it looks a little strange. The Associated Press obtained this from a government that is skeptical of Iran's honesty in its nuclear program and they say this is a chamber used for testing explosives for nuclear weapons. We did make some calls today and experts said indeed this would be consistent with that, but we haven't independently verified the source government. Supposedly it's at the Parshan (ph) site though, which is the site the IAEA has not been able to --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: -- get access to after repeated requests. How big of a problem is this?\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, number one, I've never seen that picture. It could be from anywhere so I don't know where it's from, so a comment would be useless. I can say this. The decision as far as our intelligence is concerned is that Iran has not made the decision to enrich to military grade uranium. Now, having said that, there's no comment on whether they have speeded things up so they could get to that position --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: So that if a decision was made, it could go more quickly.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: So I mean I think that's what's out there. There's one other thing. The sanctions are biting. They're biting deeply. Additional sanctions will go into play with the Central Bank. And so by June or July, the sanctions should be approximately full tilt.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Iran is going to ask for the sanctions to be rolled back. Don't put those really tough sanctions that Europe was going to be putting on this summer, don't do it, because we've made progress. That's what they're going to ask for. Is there any way you think that the United States at least would say, OK, we don't have to put that extra round of sanctions on, or is that something that must go forward to get the final deal done.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, this is just my view.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: My view is that sanctions should not be lessened until and if there is a final deal concurred in by all.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: And that leads me to Israel where you said the U.S. and Israel aren't necessarily on the same page in terms of what level of enrichment to allow. Prime Minister Netanyahu telling me nothing. You're saying the U.S. would allow up to five percent. How is the U.S. and Israel going to bridge that gap? Because if they say zero we say five and they strike, we're going to be involved.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Well, there is a strong difference between the United States and Israel. There also is a strong likelihood that if Israel were to attack, the United States would be drawn into what would become rapidly another war with Iran that could have catastrophic consequences throughout the Middle East. And one of the things that we don't do well is follow through on figuring out if you do this and they do that, then what happens? Do we support Israel? Israel is close to us. Obviously we're going to back up Israel.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Right.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Then, is it war? And then what do the rest of the Middle East do?\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE) BURNETT: Is it war, the big question that everyone has to be thinking very much about here in the Senate and Washington and in this country over the next few months.\n\n\n\nNext on OUTFRONT prosecutors filing new evidence just this afternoon. (INAUDIBLE) actually crossing right now, regarding the shooting of Trayvon Martin and the case against George Zimmerman. And the president goes after Mitt Romney and his record at Bain Capital. Plus, we're going to go inside the drug wars from Mexico. And amazing statistic, did you know that 90 percent of the cocaine in this country comes from Mexico, and 70 percent of the guns that are used in Mexican drug crime come from right here in the U.S.? We'll be back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: New evidence coming to light tonight in the murder case against George Zimmerman. He of course is the neighborhood watchman who's admitted to shooting Trayvon Martin. Now, the Orlando Sentinel reported late this afternoon that the special prosecutor's office filed an eight-page preview of their case with the county clerk. Now, in it nearly two dozen primary witnesses are listed.\n\n\n\nThere's also some never-before-seen video and more than 50 recorded audio statements that the state plans to use at the trial. Coming OUTFRONT on this story, our legal analyst, Mark Nejame and Mark obviously I know you know a lot about this. Can you tell us who are some of the witnesses and obviously everyone is going to go what, a new video, I feel like we've all seen these videos so many times. What is this new video?\n\n\n\nMARK NEJAME, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, we have a lot of things coming out but it's just the beginning. You're going to see a lot more coming out over time. I think there's about 18 police officers from the Sanford Police Department who are on the witness list. There are 67 CDs coming out that will have a lot of information on it. And there's two videos, as I understand it, one from the 7-Eleven and one from the clubhouse. So we're going to be getting a whole bunch of new information.\n\n\n\nI'm not sure if some of the most important information is coming out in this first wave though. The autopsy reports I think are going to be extremely relevant. An enhancement of the 911-tapes is extremely relevant. And knowing where everybody was, the proximity of where the shooting occurred, the clubhouse, the car, where he was staying, all those are important pieces that I don't know if those are going to come out in the first wave. I'm anxious to see if they do.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: And why would they come out in waves? Why would you wait -- just because literally they don't have it all together or is this standard procedure? I mean how much more do you think there is and when will we get it?\n\n\n\nNEJAME: Well, it's entirely possible that they're just not completed -- they have not completed everything yet and they're not going to turn it over until in fact they are. And if I could, you had indicated earlier that all this was information they were planning on using. Not necessarily, in Florida we have very open discovery laws. And if in fact there's something that's favorable or unfavorable, it still needs to be turned over to the defense and then a determination will be made if one side or the other plans on using it and if it's even admissible in court. So there's a very open discovery --\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Oh OK.\n\n\n\nNEJAME: And everything has to be turned over.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right I didn't know that and we just found out that Zimmerman's lawyer got the discovery package, you know, late tonight, so presumably he's just going through it, presumably going to try to block all of this, the video for example, something that the American public would want to see. But to block it from going public. Will he succeed?\n\n\n\nNEJAME: He'll have an uphill battle, that's for sure. We have very -- as I said, very open not only discovery, but sunshine laws in Florida. So he'll have to make an argument that the public's right to know is far outweighed by the public policy of protecting the safety of some of these witnesses because of the possibility of some death threats or injury or harm coming to some of these witnesses, to possibly being harassed and witness tampering. One would imagine that he would try to bring that out to show that some public safety outweighs the public's right to know. It will be an uphill battle.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes. Mark, how in the world are they going to find a jury that isn't full of people that have opinions on this case? I mean everyone in this country has an opinion on this case.\n\n\n\nNEJAME: Well everybody who's watching CNN has an opinion on the case but that doesn't necessarily mean that everybody is in fact watching it. It's interesting to find that those of us who follow matters such as this, it's water cooler talk, and we all follow this and are interested in it. But there's many people who in fact don't follow these matters, then the challenge becomes are those really people you want to have on a jury who really remains so utterly misinformed, but that's what happens.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right especially when they live in the area. All right thanks very much to Mark. Appreciate it.\n\n\n\nAhead, 49 mutilated bodies dumped in Mexico, an absolutely horrific act. We're going to talk about that, tell you exactly why it's happening and why it could be the biggest threat to this country.\n\n\n\nAnd the president going negative, attacking Mitt Romney. We'll be back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nERIN BURNETT, HOST: We start the second half of our show with stories we care about, where we focus on our own reporting from the front lines.\n\n\n\nAnd, first, JPMorgan making some changes after taking a massive loss on trades. The chief investment officer, Ina Drew, the first person out. She made more than $30 million in the past two years. She headed the unit that has lost what could be now $4 billion.\n\n\n\nTomorrow, CEO Jamie Dimon will be answering shareholders at the company's annual meeting in Tampa.\n\n\n\nNumber two, a group representing Palestinian prisoners has reached a deal with Israel to end a hunger strike. That strike began all the way back April 17th. The announcement of the deal sent crowds to the streets of Gaza to celebrate.\n\n\n\nTwo thousand prisoners were protesting their treatment in Israeli prisons. The deal covers things like when a prisoner can be moved into solitary confinement and will allow family members to visit. There are over 4,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails tonight.\n\n\n\nSixteen billion dollars -- well, that's the size of California's deficit. And it's nearly twice as big as Governor Jerry Brown estimated four months ago. If he were running a bank, he'd be facing some problems right now.\n\n\n\nBut today, he said he wants to cut state payrolls by 5 percent and hike taxes on the wealthy.\n\n\n\nI asked the senior senator, Dianne Feinstein, about the crisis and she brought up one specific individual.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: I was reading about one high- tech executive that because of capital gains was going to leave his citizenship and move to -- or become a citizen of Singapore.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Yes, the Facebook guy.\n\n\n\nFEINSTEIN: Yes. Well, I say let him go. I can't think of anything more disloyal to do, candidly.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: The man's name is Eduardo Saverin. He's 30 years old and was the founder of Facebook. Reports say he'll save $60 million in taxes by becoming a citizen of Singapore, which has no capital gains tax.\n\n\n\nWell, Yahoo!'s CEO is out. Scott Thompson resigned over the weekend after it was revealed he didn't have the computer science degree that he claimed. We took a look through the latest SEC filings and here's what he'll get. No severance but he will get to keep the $7 million he recently collected in cash and stock.\n\n\n\nYahoo! has named Ross Levinsohn the interim CEO, currently the head of global media for Yahoo!\n\n\n\nWell, it's been 284 days since the U.S. lost its top credit rating. What are we doing to get it back? I asked (INAUDIBLE) in the air, I'm sitting here in the Senate, where is everybody?\n\n\n\nOur fourth story OUTFRONT: one of the biggest threats to this country and it's much closer than a lot of people think. You know, you think of, you know, the Middle East somewhere or you think of China. But, no, it's Mexico.\n\n\n\nAnd investigators are trying today to identify 49 bodies that were found mutilated beyond belief and recognition. Stuffed in plastic bags in a small town of San Juan, yesterday. That's less than 100 miles from the American border. The bodies are 43 men and six women were found headless with no feet and no hands. They are victims of Mexico's Los Zetas drug cartel.\n\n\n\nMore than 47,000 people -- 47,000 people, just think about that for a minute -- have been killed in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon launched an offensive against drug cartels in 2006. Ninety-nine have been killed in brutal fashion like what I just described in just the past month, as the two biggest cartels, Los Zetas and Sinaloa fight for control of Mexico's border with the United States.\n\n\n\nWhy do they fight for control of that border? Because the drug wars are continuing. Ninety percent of the cocaine that enters the American country and it comes through Mexico. It's also the main supplier of marijuana and meth in this country.\n\n\n\nSo the question is what else is getting into the United States that we don't know about?\n\n\n\nJay Ahern is former head of the border protection and now a principal at the Chertoff Group; Hipolito Acosta is a former undercover INS agent and author of The Shadow Catcher.\n\n\n\nAppreciate you both taking the time.\n\n\n\nJay, let me just ask you, it seems like the violence is getting much, much worse. What I just described with the heads and the feet cut off, this is brutality at a level that I think is very hard to imagine, but it appears to be at this point, dare I say common?\n\n\n\nJAY AHERN, FORMER HEAD OF U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Yes, I think when you actually take a look, Erin, the numbers may be closer to 50,000 since December of 2006 when President Calderon really started to take the fight to the cartels. We've seen it start to level a little bit in the last few months. Leveling is really a statement of choice here, that about 1,000 killings per month. But the gravity and the heinousness of the killings this past few days really shows as far as how aggressive and how ruthless these individuals are. Beyond just the beheadings, the cutting off the arms and legs sends a strong signal.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: It certainly does.\n\n\n\nPolly, how -- is this really about controlling -- who's controlling the drugs going into the United States? I mean, this is still a question of U.S. demand and supply that is not necessarily from Mexico but transiting through Mexico?\n\n\n\nHIPOLITO ACOSTA, FORMER UNDERCOVER INS AGENT: Yes to both of your questions.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Polly, sorry, go ahead.\n\n\n\nACOSTA: I think what you have -- I'm sorry. What you have are two cartels that are actually fighting for a very lucrative route, and I think this violence is going to continue. Jay was talking about sending a signal and I think it sends a strong signal to anybody who would oppose the cartels in that particular area.\n\n\n\nI think the violence is going to continue during the next few months. We have a presidential election coming up in Mexico and I think some of the cartels are positioning themselves to make sure that they control this particular areas for a number of reasons.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: And let me ask you, Jay, about something else. I don't know if everyone remembers but obviously there was a plot that the United States government alleges was put forth by the Iranian government using an Iranian-American in Texas who was hiring a Mexican drug cartel to commit an assassination that would have killed civilians right here in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nWe also, of course action heard from Air Force General Douglas Fraser, who testified on whether there was other terrorist activities going on in Mexico to get into the United States, and here's what he said.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nGEN. DOUGLAS FRASER, COMMANDER OF U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND: Those organizations are primarily focused on financial support to organizations back in the Middle East, but they are involved in illicit activity. And so that is the connection that we continue to look for, as we watch in the future, that connection between the illicit activity and the potential pathway into the United States.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Jay, how big of a risk is this, the Hezbollah or other terrorist activities could be working with drug cartels to get into the United States?\n\n\n\nAHERN: Well, I think one of the things that's important to recognize, these are criminal organizations and they certainly will diversify what their level of criminality is, whether drugs today, weapons tomorrow or a need to move high-valued targets across the border. Certainly, that was a great piece of work by the federal agencies specifically doing drug investigations and actually uncovered the individual who was contemplating an assassination attempt.\n\n\n\nBut, clearly, these are criminals, and they're going to do anything they can for a profit going forward. BURNETT: Polly, one thing I find hard to understand here, and especially with all the coverage in this country on the whole Fast and Furious controversy, there are 6,600 licensed gun dealers in the United States within 100 miles of the Mexican border, 70 percent of the guns recovered from Mexican drug activity had originated here in the United States.\n\n\n\nWe're the ones arming this whole problem, right?\n\n\n\nACOSTA: Well, you know, but let's understand one thing. The guns were going into Mexico way before Fast and Furious occurred, whether we would have had Fast and Furious or not. I think that the -- frankly, the Mexican government needs to stand up and stop blaming the United States for arming them.\n\n\n\nThey have -- they need to address the issue of the cartel that say they have in Mexico and certainly we work very closely with foreign governments to stop the illegal flow of weapons in any direction. But I think that weapons were long available in Mexico before Fast and Furious. I think that the efforts that our government is doing to stop that flow is commendable because our agents work very hard to stop that flow of weapons into Mexico.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Jay, do you think it's fair to say that the biggest threat to the United States could be from our southern border, whether from drug wars or from other terrorist organizations? You know, I was in Laos a year ago and a Mexican drug dealer had been with someone I was with doing a deal for drugs coming from southeast Asia, so it's certainly more than Colombian cocaine now.\n\n\n\nAHERN: Sure it is. But, I think, Erin, let's put a couple of things in perspective. Certainly when you aggregate the amount of cartel deaths, again action 47,000 or 50,000, it's more than any other loss of life anywhere else on the globe so that poses a significant threat.\n\n\n\nLet's also focus on some of the facts that occurred the last few years as well. When you take a look at the apprehensions along the Mexican border coming into the United States, last fiscal year was 340,000. That's down 53 percent from 2008, and one-fifth in 2000, when it reached the tied of 1.6 million coming across the border.\n\n\n\nSo when you actually take a look at the fence being built, the deployment of additional agents, personnel and technology, there's a higher degree of control on the border today. That's not to say that 300,000 is an adequate number to apprehend, we need to do better. But I think the key to continue to make sure we protect the country is to continue the strategy of not only controlling our own border, but Mexico needs to control the borders coming into their country from Central and South America where all of those drugs originate.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right. Thanks very much to both of you. This is going to be an issue we're going to cover a lot more of on this show.\n\n\n\nAnd coming up, President Obama's brand new attack ad accusing Mitt Romney of killing -- we'll tell you what.\n\n\n\nPlus, turmoil in Greece and the domino effect that might hit us right here at home.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Apple and Exxon are in bed together and we're going to explain exactly, well, why this marriage has occurred. That's coming up in just a couple of moments.\n\n\n\nBut now, our Outer Circle where we reach out to sources around the world.\n\n\n\nAnd we begin tonight in Greece. Talks to form a government failed, and that leaves the state of Greece's government and economy in complete and utter chaos. This is crucial for the rest of the world. New elections could happen in June but no one is sure.\n\n\n\nAnd with no government to manage the economy and no one to pay the debt or pay anybody that works for the government, there is a real possibility that Greece leaves the euro. You may say so?\n\n\n\nWell, Matthew Chance is in Athens and I asked him what the consequences would be for the rest of Europe and the world if Greece goes vamoose.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Erin, the truth is we're in uncharted waters. One of the main effects immediately it's going to have to Greece is that the country will run out of money. It won't be able to pay its bills, its pensions, its state workers' wages -- none of these things that a country needs to survive will be need to be paid.\n\n\n\nIt will have to print its own currency, the drachma. That currency is like to drop through the floor when it comes to its valuations against the euro. So, Greece would set itself on a path to a great deal of poverty and economic hard ship.\n\n\n\nThe other impact Greece crashing out of the euro may have is the impact of contagion. If Greece crashes out of the single currency, what's to stop other debt-laden economies like Ireland, like Spain, like Portugal, like Italy from doing exactly the same thing? Up until now, this big European project of getting all these countries together, these diverse countries together, diverse economies together and bringing them all under the umbrella of a single currency has been something that's really dominated European politics. If that ends, if Greece exits the euro, that whole project comes to an end and it potentially puts the European Union and the cohesion of the European Union under threat.\n\n\n\nAnd so, you can't really overstate the significance of what Greece is deciding right now, which direction it will go in -- Erin.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right. Thank you very much to Matthew Chance. Of course, Europe the biggest trading partner for America. So if it falls, major job losses and another deep recession would happen here.\n\n\n\nAnd now, let's check in with Anderson. Anderson is in a Turkish refugee camp near the Syrian border.\n\n\n\nAnderson, obviously, you're going to have a special show tonight. Tell us a little bit about it, Anderson.\n\n\n\nANDERSON COOPER, HOST, A.C. 360: Yes, Erin, we're in one of many refugee camps along the Turkish/Syrian border, now home to 23,000 Syrians -- men, women and children. The reason we came here is because for 14 months, the regime of Bashir al Assad has lied about what's happening in Syria. We came here because for 14 months, the regime of Bashir al Assad has tried to silence the voices of the people who are living in these camps and the people who have had to flee Syria.\n\n\n\nTonight, we want you to hear their voices. We want you to see their faces and hear their stories and hear what they have had to live through for the last 14 months. The children that they have seen arrested by the regime, tortured by the regime, parents who got the mangled bodies of their children return to them in the dead of night. Children who have seen their parents shot to death on the streets of Syria simply for asking for reforms, asking for basic freedom that we all take for granted.\n\n\n\nSo, tonight, we're going to be telling you their stories and you're going to hear their voices and see their faces to find the truth of what is happening inside Syria -- Erin.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right, Anderson, very much looking forward to seeing you in just a few moments there.\n\n\n\nOur fifth story OUTFRONT, it's the economy finally. Well, maybe. But at least in this ad.\n\n\n\nObama and Romney trading jabs on issue number one. First up, a new Obama ad rolling out in five battleground states which calls the private equity firm that Mitt Romney founded a job killer.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, OBAMA CAMPAIGN AD)\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They made as much money off it as they could, and they closed it down, they filed for bankruptcy without any concern for the families of the communities.\n\n\n\nJACK COBB: It was like a vampire. They came in and sucked the life out of us.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was like watching an old friend bleed to death.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: The Romney camp is not hanging back, rolling out its own video attacking the president's record on debt, announcing plans for a speech on the deficit tomorrow and, I have to say, sending e-mails and finding private phone numbers of members of the media to send or their P.R. people to send their stats on jobs. So, fighting back hard.\n\n\n\nCNN contributor David Frum, John Avlon in New York, and Michael Waldman, former head of speechwriting for President Clinton also joins us.\n\n\n\nOK, great to have all of you with us.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: You said that that's a pretty tough ad.\n\n\n\nDAVID FRUM, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: That is a pretty tough ad. But I wonder whether it really counts as a pivot to the economy. What exactly is President Obama proposing to do? I mean, if private equity really is bad, if it does more harm than good, it's free to operate in the Obama administration. President Obama isn't proposing to do anything to restrict private equity.\n\n\n\nSo, all he is saying is you are a bad man. He is not offering an economic critique. And he's not offering an economic alternative.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: OK. Do you buy that spin, Michael?\n\n\n\nMICHAEL WALDMAN, BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE, NYU: Well, I think that part of this is in a sense kind of a brush-back pitch. Romney is going to say I've run a big company, I have a successful record and so I can make the critique against President Obama and his record. And this is saying, you know, when one thing when Governor Romney talks, he talks about success and we ought not penalize success.\n\n\n\nAnd to a lot of people the way he says it sounds a little smug. I think there's a real unease that people have apart from the specifics of Bain, let alone the ad, an unease with the kind of the financialization of the economy that leads to manufacturing firms being hollowed out and that sort of thing.\n\n\n\nSo I think, look, it's certainly not subtle and it's not unexpected.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Not subtle and not unexpected. But John Avlon, certainly something the Romney campaign is afraid about.\n\n\n\nLet me just go back to emphasizing the point they literally called members of the media on their private cell phones and got their numbers to try to make the case for how Bain Capital and private equity creates jobs. So they're afraid.\n\n\n\nJOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, look, I mean, this attack left a mark back in the Republican primaries. Remember, you had Rick Perry saying this isn't venture capitalism, this is vulture capitalism.\n\n\n\nBut I think, you know, this is not even an economic ad. This is an attempt by the Obama camp to draw an early contrast to define the candidate further as a person. It is a personal attack, a personal characterization about values underlying the economy, rather than anything aiming to provide a prescription for how to solve this problem. BURNETT: Speaking of how the president wants to be seen. So, today, he gave the commencement address at Barnard College. And I watched it, and I watched the introduction to him. It's very laudatory. This is a women's college.\n\n\n\nSo, David, we know he's trying to build a case to get women's votes. But at best it split. CBS poll came out today, Mitt Romney is leading among women 46 to 44 percent. I want to emphasize that's within the margin of error, but still.\n\n\n\nFRUM: You know, it's kind of a screwy poll, I have to say. Among other things, one of the questions it asks, are you less likely to vote for the president because of his stance on same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\nWell, they have 43 percent of Americans saying I'm less likely, even though Republicans disapprove of the president 90-10. So, they've gone from saying, I will absolutely never vote for the president, too. I will double absolutely never vote for the president.\n\n\n\nI don't know how meaningful that is. I wonder the gender gap is usually about 10 points. So if it's shrunk to two, that is true. That would be colossal news. It's also possible the polls make mistakes.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: Well, and we have many polls coming out everyday.\n\n\n\nJohn, what's your case?\n\n\n\nAVLON: I do get the sense, as David does, that this is a bit of an outlier. That said, it could be on the leading ledge of the other shoe dropping with the regard to the political consequences of the president's decision to back gay marriage. We're seeing troubling gaps, not just among independent voters, but also self-identified centrists.\n\n\n\nThose trends should make the Obama camp very nervous as they look to future polls.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: And one thing that could make you very nervous, Michael Waldman, is what came out of this same poll in terms of independents. Mitt Romney now leads independents, according to the CBS poll, by 43 percent to 36 percent. That's well -- that's no margin of error.\n\n\n\nWALDMAN: Well, again, if the numbers for women or the numbers for independents on election day are on this poll, then it's president- elect Romney. But it is a bit of an outlier. The one bit of good news for President Obama in that poll, interestingly, was that independents and women and young people were more likely to be supportive of the president's stance on same-sex marriage than other voters.\n\n\n\nYou never know entirely -- it's true. This could play out in a bad way for him or in a good way. Remember during the 1960 campaign -- we all read about, I should stress, wasn't actually playing attention then. We read about John F. Kennedy's outreach to Martin Luther King's family and the kind of surprising impact that that had. These social issues are not as straight and linear and easy to predict as sometimes the economic indicators are. So this will have ripples. But we don't know in which direction the ripples will go.\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right. Thanks very much to all three of you. We appreciate it.\n\n\n\nAhead, Apple and Exxon sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G. Who does that upset more? Apple people or the Exxon people? But they are. And we'll tell you why, next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: So today while we were looking at the market selloff I checked out the two biggest companies in America. It used to be for years that there was one company and everybody else. And that one company was ExxonMobil. But now ExxonMobil, a company that many people love to hate, is a distant second.\n\n\n\nOne of the nation's most prestigious journalist has just written a book on Exxon called, Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power. It talks about the Valdez spill and deals with corrupt governments.\n\n\n\nI spoke to the book's author Steve Coll about what we as Americans should like about Exxon.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSTEVE COLL, AUTHOR, PRIVATE EMPIRE: I do think they bring out the rule of law wherever they go. They want a world that is stable and safe for oil and gas drilling. One of the ways they promote that is by evangelizing about the importance of the rule of law. And they enforce a universal system of contract.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBURNETT: All right. So those are pretty good things -- probably not good enough.\n\n\n\nBrings me to a company that everybody loves to love, Apple. Nine months ago, it was the second biggest company in America. It is now number one, and by a huge margin.\n\n\n\nMeasured by market cap, Apple is more than 1/3 bigger than Exxon, worth more than half a trillion dollars, half a trillion dollars. Look at the iPad in your hand, half a trillion dollars.\n\n\n\nWith the surge has come scrutiny of keeping money off shore to avoid U.S. taxes, of offshoring too many jobs, of using materials like, which is sometimes mind by children. Apple said it's working to address some of these things. And it is a company seen as the best of America to children around the world.\n\n\n\nBut you know what's interesting? I asked Steve Coll about whether Apple and Exxon had anything in common. He said absolutely. And let me list to you what he said. They're both closed systems. Neither of them like to be written about. They don't have an open door policy for the press. And they have a culture that's strong but set directly from the top.\n\n\n\nI thought he might have laughed. But it seems there's a lot alike about Exxon and Apple.\n\n\n\nSo, here's to being proud that American companies are the leaders in their fields and they hope to continue to become better companies not just bigger ones.\n\n\n\nWell, tomorrow, I'm spending the day here in Washington at the 2012 fiscal summit. It's an issue that will define the power and greatness of our country. This year, the Bush cuts expire, the $1.2 trillion in super cut takes effect. The debt ceiling needs to be raised. These are just a few of the things that could send like lemmings off a clief.\n\n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, Treasury Secretary, Alan Simpson, Congressman Paul Ryan, and speaker of the House, John Boehner, are all going to be together. You'll see Speaker Boehner tomorrow at 7:00 p.m., because I'll be with them. We've been looking very much forward to that.\n\n\n\nThanks for watching, look forward to seeing you again live from Washington tomorrow.\n\n\n\nA.C.360 starts now.
Concord, New Hampshire (CNN) Jill Biden isn't a stranger to the presidential campaign trail, having stumped for her husband's bid for president and vice president.\n\nShe's now logging grueling hours advocating for Joe Biden's 2020 bid\n\nThe pace of the campaign often keeps Joe and Jill Biden, a married couple of 42 years, apart. Jill Biden spoke with CNN in Concord, New Hampshire, where she shared how she stays handles the pressures of the trail.\n\nHe came home the other night, I hadn't seen him, probably for a week. And so I think it's important in a marriage that you keep that spark going, she told CNN in an interview in Concord, New Hampshire. Before I saw him, I lit the candles. I put on the fire. We sat down and we started talking. And like always, it's always about the kids and what's this person doing or that person doing, or the grandkids. But after 20 minutes, we were like, 'God, we're exhausted.' So we went to bed.\n\nI'm telling you we have very few moments together, so I tried to make the most of those moments, and I don't talk politics, she said.\n\nRead More
Protestors attend a demonstration in Stockholm, Sweden, in November 2017, against slavery in Libya,\n\nStory highlights The overall number of reported trafficking victims has increased globally Girls account for 23% of all trafficking victims, says report Human trafficking worsens in conflict zones\n\n(CNN) —\n\nA growing number of girls are being reported as victims of human trafficking, according to a new UN report.\n\nGirls account for 23% of all trafficking victims detected globally, according to the 2018 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, produced by the UN Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n\nThe figure, which is based on data from 2016, is up from 21% in 2014, and 10% in 2004, the year when the UNODC began collecting data on children.\n\nBoys account for 7% of reported trafficking victims, down from 8% in 2014, and up from 3% in 2004.\n\nIn the profile of identified victims, we are seeing more and more children, an increase particularly in girls, says Angela Me, chief of the UNODC's research and trend analysis branch.\n\nMore on human trafficking\n\nBut the UN says that this rise could be due to better detection of victims globally.\n\nMe explains that trafficked girls are typically victims of sexual exploitation, while boys are more often exploited for forced labor.\n\nThe UN defines girls and boys as being aged less than 18, but Me says some member states use different definitions.\n\nThe report shows that women and girls account for almost three quarters of all detected victims of trafficking in 2016. Females make up 94% of the total victims trafficked for sexual exploitation, and 35% of those trafficked for forced labor.\n\nArmed conflict\n\nIt also finds that armed conflict in some regions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia is likely to increase vulnerability to trafficking.\n\nIt says that areas with weak rule of law and lack of resources provide traffickers with fertile terrain to carry out operations, adding that armed groups take advantage of people in a desperate situation to traffic victims for sexual exploitation, forced marriage, armed combat and various forms of forced labor.\n\nPopulations fleeing conflict, such as Syrian, Iraqi and Rohingya refugees are also targeted by traffickers.\n\nIn migration flows, you have a dispersion of families and then you have many children who travel alone, who definitely become more vulnerable to be trapped into exploitative situations, says Me.\n\nThe report also indicates that the overall number of reported trafficking victims has increased. In 2016, about 40% more victims were detected compared to 2011.\n\nBut the UN says that this rise could be due to an increase in trafficking globally, or it could be a result of enhanced national capacities to detect, record and report data on trafficking.\n\nIn 2009, only 26 countries had an institution which systematically collected data on trafficking cases, whereas in 2018, the number had risen to 65.\n\nThere are now a whole bunch of countries that have new legislation so are more equipped from a legislative point of view to criminalize and to prosecute and at the same time to protect the victims, says Me.\n\nSuch anti-trafficking policies have not only led to increasing numbers of detected victims, but also to more trafficking convictions in Asia, the Americas, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nHowever, the report cautions that the absolute numbers of convictions remain very low, adding that globally There appears to be hardly any risk for traffickers to face justice.
Gwyneth Paltrow's marriage to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin seemed to be unshakeable (she even had great relationship advice!). But in March 2014, the A-list couple announced that they were undergoing a conscious uncoupling. The pair may be better friends than spouses. Martin went on the honeymoon with Paltrow and her new husband, producer Brad Falchuk.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nOne of Hollywood's happiest divorced couple, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore split in 1998 after a 10-year relationship. The pair, who knew each other for three months before wedlock, have three daughters. Moore was married to Ashton Kutcher from 2005 to 2013. Wilis married Emma Heming in 2009 and Moore attended their vow renewal in March 2019.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nWith Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom being the type to write love letters to one another -- and Bloom being the kind of romantic who would frame them -- we definitely did not see their 2013 breakup coming. Yet according to Bloom, he and Kerr -- whom he married in 2010 after a three-year courtship -- still love each other, even if it's only as parents to their young son, Flynn. Kerr married Snapchat chief executive officer Evan Spiegel in 2017 and Bloom got engaged to singer Katy Perry on Valentine's Day 2019.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nWill Arnett shocked fans when he ended his marriage to Amy Poehler. According to People magazine, Arnett filed for divorce in April 2014. The couple, who tied the knot in 2003, first announced their separation in 2012.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nJustin Bieber swept the slightly older Selena Gomez off her feet, and the two were on and off for a while. Although their relationship appeared to end for good in 2013, they spent an awful lot of quality time together in 2014 and then reconnected in 2016 before finally going their separate ways. Bieber married model Hailey Baldwin in 2018, but that hasn't stopped people from thinking about Jelena.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nKhloe Kardashian's whirlwind romance with basketball player Lamar Odom made us skeptical at first, but once we saw them in action we believed love really can be found in a month. Kardashian eventually filed for divorce after nearly five years of marriage. It's definitely not anything I'm through, she said of her breakup in March 2014. I'm going through it, but I'm not (over) it. And while she put the divorce proceedings on hold in 2015 to support him through his health crisis, she refiled in July 2016. Kardashian now has a daughter with NBA player Tristan Thomas.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nThe reason we're wistful for the days when Ryan Gosling was dating Rachel McAdams is simple: If the two people who starred in The Notebook can't make it work, who can? So far Gosling has been making it work with actress Eva Mendes and the pair have two daughters. McAdams has been in a relationship with screenwriter Jamie Linden since 2016.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nFrom their first screen test for 2008's Twilight, Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart were the perfect match. According to director Catherine Hardwicke, Stewart felt connected to (Pattinson) from the first moment. That electricity or love at first sight or whatever it is. Whatever it was, it didn't survive a cheating scandal in 2012, when Stewart admitted that she'd had a momentary indiscretion with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders. She went public with her relationship with screenwriter Dylan Meyer in 2019.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nDavid Arquette and Courteney Cox were so adorable together, they could be endearing in a horror movie, as they were in 1996's Scream. It was a shock when, after 11 years of marriage, the two announced they were breaking up in 2010. The couple, who have one daughter, Coco, have remained friends.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nOne of our other favorite '90s couples again includes Depp, who dated model Kate Moss from 1994 to 1998. A pairing with that much heat and great hair should never fall apart.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nLenny Kravitz and former Cosby Show star Lisa Bonet seemed tailor-made for each other, right down to their love of hippie style. The pair met at a New Edition concert in 1985 and married in 1987, welcoming daughter Zoe a year later. We were very young, and it was wonderful, Kravitz recalled in 2013. Now, Zoe's mom and I are best friends, Kravitz said. It's interesting because that's how the relationship started. Bonet is now married to actor Jason Momoa.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nMadonna's four-year marriage to Sean Penn was one of the wildest rides of the '80s, and that's saying something, but we agree with her words after their divorce in 1989: I do believe we all have soul mates, she told People magazine. I don't believe that we necessarily end up with them. After their split, both Madonna and Penn moved on to new relationships (several times).\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nCountry stars Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert stunned fans when they announced in July that they were divorcing after four years of marriage. There was much sadness on social media over the split. She married police officer Brendan McLoughlin in 2019 and Shelton has been dating singer and fellow The Voice coach Gwen Stefani since 2015.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nJohnny Depp and Winona Ryder had amazing chemistry on- and off-screen, from Edward Scissorhands to the tattoo parlor, where Depp had Winona Forever inked on his arm. Alas, although we adored their courtship, Depp and Ryder weren't meant to be.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nIn 2001, every teenager with access to MTV and Teen People wanted to find the Britney Spears to their Justin Timberlake (or vice versa). With those two ruling pop music, not even their questionable fashion sense could mar the public's love for their romance. Sadly, matching denim outfits wasn't enough to make this last: The couple broke up in 2002, and many listeners believe Timberlake's Cry Me a River is about his relationship with Spears. Spears had a super brief marriage to friend Jason Alexander in 2004 and was married to backup dancer Kevin Federline from 2004 to 2007. Timberlake married actress Jessica Biel in 2014.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nOnce upon a time in 1999, a young blonde pop star named Jessica Simpson met another young blond-ish pop star, Nick Lachey, at a Teen People party, and they immediately fell in love. Lachey even wrote a song about their passion -- that would be My Everything -- and then he and his new bride signed up to film their love for an MTV reality show called Newlyweds. But instead of finding happily ever after, Lachey and Simpson found grounds for divorce in 2005 after three years of marriage. They both are now parents and married to others.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nJennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt called it quits in 2005, but fans couldn't help but hold out hope for a reunion in 2018 after the actress announced her separation from Justin Theroux. Now every time they are in the same time zone (let alone the same room like at the 2020 Screen Actors Guild Awards) people start longing for a reconciliation.\n\nPhotos: Celebrity breakups we have never gotten over\n\nStory highlights The couple split in 2002 Timberlake said he didn't know she wanted to work with him\n\n(CNN) —\n\nJustin Timberlake and Britney Spears are so far from ever getting back together, but that doesn't mean they can't still make beautiful music together.\n\nThe pair dated from 1999-2002 and there was much mourning by fans when they split. And sad as it was, some great music came out of it (cue Timberlake's hit Cry Me A River).\n\nDuring a recent Q & A with the radio show Most Requested Live with Romeo, Spears rattled off a few artists she'd like to collaborate with and noted, Justin Timberlake is very good.\n\nApparently, Timberlake has been busy with both his toddler and his Netflix concert film Justin Timberlake + the Tennessee Kids and had not heard.\n\nBut when E! News asked him about it at the Toronto International Film Festival premiere, he sounded surprised and delighted.\n\nShe did? Timberlake asked. Sure! Absolutely, absolutely, I apologize for not being in the know.\n\nAnd he added, I'm accessible, give us a call!
(CNN) — The term Indian cuisine covers a lot of ground. From the Himalayan peaks in the northern state of Uttarakhand, to the tropical southwestern coast of Kerala, each landscape comes with its own climate, history, trade links and religious customs. And each has a unique food culture.\n\nAs a culinary destination, India offers an epic food bucket list . But the past year has been tough for travel, with most of the world's holiday plans put on hold because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIndia's cuisine, at least, can still journey far beyond the country's borders. According to the United Nations , people from India make up the world's largest diaspora community -- and they have brought their delicious food with them.\n\nIn the UK, for instance, tens of thousands of Indian immigrants arrived in the early 20th century, followed by an influx of Bangladeshi immigrants in the 1970s -- many setting up restaurants that tailored Indian curries to local tastes. As a result, curry has become a firm fixture and Anglo-Indian inventions, such as chicken tikka masala, are among the nation's favorite dishes.\n\nWhile curry houses with standard menus are still popular, the world's taste for Indian fine dining is evolving to encompass lesser known regional delicacies and bolder experimentation.\n\nIndian chefs living around the world are feeding this growing movement, with menus that celebrate their family heritage, while bringing new dimensions to traditional cooking techniques and recipes.\n\nCNN spoke to five of these culinary ambassadors about the dishes that -- for them -- capture the delicious diversity of India.\n\nChef Jessi Singh: Buffalo milk kebab, Punjab\n\nChef Jessi Singh was born in Punjab, India, and grew up between Australia and America. He brings his unique culinary journey to modern Indian cuisine, including his signature buffalo milk kebabs.\n\nWhen it comes to making a kebab, milk curd probably isn't the first ingredient that springs to mind. But for Punjab-born chef and restaurateur, Jessi Singh, this is the ultimate taste of home.\n\nCrispy on the outside, with a soft, creamy center, kebabs made with curd, yogurt or paneer cheese are a popular appetizer in restaurants across northern India.\n\nBorn in a farming village outside of Punjab's capital, Chandigarh, Singh encountered the dish -- and its key ingredients -- at source.\n\nBefore I even turned 10, I knew how to milk the buffaloes, he says.\n\nSingh takes charge of fermenting the milk for the kebabs in his restaurants in Australia, including Melbourne's Daughter in Law and Don't Tell Aunty in Sydney. Served with an orchid and bright pink beetroot sauce, his kebabs might not look like the meals he ate as a child, but the vivid colors represent Singh's Punjab heritage in other ways.\n\nBack home, color doesn't associate with a gender, or a certain people, or a class, he says. Color belongs to everyone. You will see men wearing pink turbans, a red shirt ... We are a very, very colorful culture. So that's what I put in my food.\n\nDaughter in Law , 37 Little Bourke Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; +61 (03) 9242 0814\n\nDon't Tell Aunty , Shop-2, 414 Bourke Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; +61 (02) 9331 5399\n\nChef Garima Arora: Millet roti, Telangana\n\nGarima Arora is the first and only female Indian chef to earn a Michelin star for her restaurant in Bangkok, Thailand. Now she's putting the spotlight back on India, starting with Telangana -- the southern Indian state she was born in.\n\nThailand-based chef and restaurant owner Garima Arora has attracted a lot of attention for her pioneering take on Indian cuisine. A former pupil of world-famous Indian chef Gaggan Anand , she is the first and only Indian female chef to earn a Michelin star for her Bangkok restaurant, Gaa, while The World's 50 Best Restaurants rated her as Asia's best female chef in 2019\n\nNot content with her own trailblazing accolades, Arora is taking another approach to rewrite this narrative around Indian cooking.\n\nIn 2019, she launched Food Forward India , a traveling non-profit initiative that aims to map out the cuisines of every Indian state, starting with the one Arora was born in -- Telangana.\n\nFood in this southern Indian state is most often associated with the refined dishes of Telangana's capital, Hyderabad, developed over centuries in the Mughal and Nizam royal courts. But Arora was interested in highlighting food customs beyond the metropolis.\n\nThere was a big difference between the way urban Telangana eats to the rural Telangana to the tribal Telangana, Arora says. The idea was to take that and show it to the world.\n\nOne rustic ingredient Arora hopes to spotlight is millet. Among the world's earliest cultivated grains, it's a historic staple in Telangana's rural communities.\n\nArora is giving millet a fine-dining update as a roti tartlet, filled with creamy, chilled crab and fresh coconut. She says her cold curry gives the sensation of eating something fresh, cool, earthy -- but in one bite.\n\nGaa , 46 Sukhumvit 53 Alley, Khlong Tan Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok, Thailand; +66 (0)63 987 4747\n\nChef Deepanker Khosla: Mutton biryani, Uttar Pradesh\n\nBiryani is one of the most popular Indian dishes of all time. Chef Deepanker Khosla is adding a new chapter to biryani's layered history in his zero-waste restaurant in Thailand.\n\nChef Deepanker Khosla is making waves with his award-winning sustainable restaurant, Haoma, in Bangkok, Thailand. He says the zero-waste farm-to-table concept is a prototype for restaurants in the future, inspired by his upbringing in the Uttar Pradesh city of Prayagraj, formerly called Allahabad.\n\nMy dad has this beautiful kitchen garden, Khosla says, So harvesting our own produce, eating fresh, sustainable ... this is tradition.\n\nA hydroponic system on the restaurant terrace recycles rainwater to grow plants and tilapia fish, while all waste from the kitchen is recycled back into fish food and compost.\n\nThe restaurant farm supplies almost all the produce for Khosla's neo-Indian menu, a modern, high-end take on centuries-old Indian dishes.\n\nThat includes biryani; a fragrant mix of meat or vegetables, rice and spices, the meal is universally loved across the Indian subcontinent. Many historians believe biryani originated in Persia and was brought to India by the Mughals, who controlled the area from the 16th to 18th century.\n\nIt made its way into the cuisine of almost every region, each suffusing the dish with its own flavors and techniques.\n\nKhosla makes a version known as Awadhi biryani -- a beloved dish back home in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nLightly spiced pieces of mutton and rice are layered into a pot, sealed with dough, and slowly steamed for hours, in dum pukht style.\n\nDum pukht means slow breathing, so you let the food breathe in its own juices, Khosla says.\n\nWith an ever-evolving menu that adapts to the seasonal produce that can be grown on the farm, Khosla is excited to spotlight authentic, regional recipes.\n\nWhat we know about Indian cuisine is not even the tip of the iceberg, he says. India has 22 distinct cuisines with more than 5,000 different dishes ... that is what I take pride in.\n\nHaoma , 231 3 Soi Sukhumvit 31, Khlong Toei Nuea, Watthana, Bangkok, Thailand; +66 (0)2 258 4744\n\nChef Palash Mitra: Fish curry, West Bengal\n\nChef Palash Mitra has mastered a range of South Asian delicacies in his Hong Kong restaurants. But for the West Bengal-born chef, one dish is closer to the heart: Bengali fish curry.\n\nTo call Bengali fish curry, or macher jhol, a classic West Bengal meal would be an understatement. As the local saying goes: mache bhate bangali, which roughly translates as 'fish and rice is what makes a Bengali'.\n\nFish is a staple in West Bengal's cuisine largely because of geography. Crisscrossed by rivers that flow into the Bay of Bengal, the east Indian state boasts a huge variety of fish. And the importance of fish carries into ritual life too.\n\nWhether it's a funeral or if it's a marriage, fish is an integral part of it, says Palash Mitra, a chef born in West Bengal's capital, Kolkata. Fish is the symbol of a new life, the end of life. It's entwined.\n\nAs culinary director of South Asian cuisine for Hong Kong's Black Sheep restaurant group, Palash supervises four restaurants, which offer fish dishes that span the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe tandoori cobia ... or the salmon ... these are really, really popular dishes, he says.\n\nBut Bengali fish curry is the dish that's very close to my heart, he says. Mitra cooks his mother's recipe: chunks of rui, a South Asian carp, slowly simmered in a light broth, enriched with spices, potatoes, cauliflower and tomatoes, and served with rice. He plans to put it on the menu at his restaurant, Rajasthan Rifles on Hong Kong's Victoria Peak, this summer.\n\nRajasthan Rifles , The Peak Galleria, Shop G01 G/F, 118 Peak Road, Central, Hong Kong; +852 2388 8874\n\nChef Kuldeep Negi: Tandoori prawns, Delhi\n\nSpices are at the heart of all Indian food and Chef Kuldeep Negi understands them better than most. In his Singapore restaurant, Negi serves up a bite of his Delhi heritage -- with a kick.\n\nOf course, there's one thing that defines India's culinary legacy more than any dish. Spices are at the heart of all Indian food, with India using, buying and selling more spices than any other country, according to the government's spices board\n\nKuldeep Negi, Chef de Cuisine of Singapore's Tiffin Room restaurant inside the historic Raffles hotel, understands India's spices better than most. Growing up in Delhi, he had Asia's biggest spice bazaar on his doorstep: Khari Baoli, in Old Delhi's Chandni Chowk market. This maze of stalls, bursting with color and heady aromas, has been supplying kitchens in India's capital since the 17th century\n\nAs a child, Negi's mother brought him to the market, and taught him how to select and blend the spices.\n\nShe is very particular about choosing the spices because India is a country of different seasons. So each season has different spices, says Negi. How to use them, when to add into the dish, how long you're going to cook (them) -- that's very important.\n\nThe art of blending spices is still an important part of Negi's cooking today. Though you're more likely to find chicken or lamb grilling in the tandoors of landlocked Delhi, Negi wants to make the most of the seafood available in Southeast Asia.\n\nFor his signature dish, tandoori prawns, he brings out the succulent, smoky flavors of the jumbo prawns with his unique spice mix: saffron, turmeric and red chili powder, blended with rose petal, bleached cardamom and green cardamom.\n\nWhen you go to bite that, you will feel it, the freshness of the powders, he says. It's all about the spices.
Rhae Lynn Barnes is an Assistant Professor of American Cultural History at Princeton University. Keri Leigh Merritt is a historian, writer, and filmmaker from Atlanta. They are at work on a new Civil War documentary. The views expressed here are the authors' own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nOver the last four years, many have warned the public about the flagrant threat to democracy that President Donald Trump poses. Wednesday's failed coup proved that MAGA, or Trumpism, is not over simply because Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. Trumpism is far from dead. Instead, it is now their New Lost Cause\n\nThe Lost Cause, also known as the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, is America's most successful disinformation campaign. It was an ahistorical theory advocating the erroneous belief that all White southerners valiantly fought for the Confederacy to save true American (read: White supremacist) values. It centers on the delusion that slavery, known as the peculiar institution, was often benign and even welcomed by the enslaved.\n\nThis postwar mythology exploded nationally in the late 19th and early 20th century through popular culture vehicles like the films The Birth of a Nation and Gone With the Wind and White supremacist laced textbooks that argued the American Civil War hinged on the protection of states rights from an aggressive North or federal government -- not the expansion of slavery -- and the promise that the South would rise again.\n\nA New Lost Cause raised the Confederate flag\n\nDuring Tuesday's Georgia runoff election , the South did rise to meet our historical moment and elected two Democrats, further spurring Trump's New Lost Cause, a dangerous delusion of election fraud spread rampantly by social media algorithms proven to spread disinformation faster than fact, Russian bot farms and far-right media.\n\nBut the main perpetrator and beneficiary of the myth is Trump himself, who claimed even before the election took place that it would be stolen through rigged election practices, hacked voter machines and by fraudulent ballots. Much like the perpetrators of the Confederate Lost Cause, the proponents of the New Lost Cause claim to be patriotic defenders of the real America or authentic (White) America.\n\nMuch of Wednesday's melee was more reminiscent of both the triumphs and the tribulations of the historical era that created the Lost Cause : Reconstruction. Its distorted representations in popular culture, with its brilliantly hopeful beginnings, its progressive ideals, and its attempts at racial justice unbearably gave way to an unrelenting violent, deadly white backlash that had no repercussions or consequences for home-grown terrorists.\n\nWednesday, for the first time in American history, White supremacists treasonously raised a Confederate flag inside the United States Capitol, disrupting America's peaceful transfer of power and invoking tangled memories of our nation's Civil War.\n\nLive on CNN, Washington, DC's former Chief of Police said the national guard needed to take back the Capitol, a structure built by enslaved Black laborers , making it clear that the bedrock of our nation's legislative body was under siege.\n\nReconstruction is more than a punch line\n\nAs historian Heather Cox Richardson argued Thursday , Yesterday the Executive Branch of our government tried to destroy the Legislative Branch. Perhaps realizing this, Sen. Lindsay Graham , one of Trump's most ardent defenders, finally spoke out against the violent attempts to avenge Trump. Invoking the 1876 election that essentially ended Reconstruction, Graham quipped that for people looking for historical guidance, this is not the one to pick. As a White Senator from the state that launched the Civil War, his aside about Reconstruction served to historically distance himself from the bloody violence and racist terror of his Confederate and segregationist forefathers.\n\nJUST WATCHED Keilar on GOP: When you sell your soul, there's a debt to settle Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Keilar on GOP: When you sell your soul, there's a debt to settle 13:12\n\nSen. Ted Cruz , advocating for a third option, also hearkened to the 1876 compromise to call for an electoral commission to examine claims of voter fraud, urging Congress to create a committee of House Members, Senators, and Supreme Court Justices to conduct a 10-day emergency audit.\n\nLike Graham and Cruz, Sen. Dick Durbin also compared the Trumpist objections to the 2020 election results to the 1876 election. Durbin stressed the cataclysmic ramifications of ending Reconstruction too early: It was a commission that killed Reconstruction, that established Jim Crow ... (that) re-enslaved African Americans, Durbin said. Relating the 1876 compromise to modern-day voter suppression, he blamed Trump for inciting the attempted coup.\n\nRep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Michigan, connected the day's events to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, tweeted that politicians who supported the coup have put their name on a list with Orval Faubus, George Wallace and Bull Connor. Faubus, Wallace and Connor all used the Confederate flag as a rallying cry to White supremacists to join in Lost Cause ideology and maintain Jim Crow segregation.\n\nSupporters of US President Donald Trump protest in the US Capitol Rotunda on January 6, 2021, in Washington, DC.\n\nAs rioters, incited by the President and with some carrying White supremacist imagery descended upon the Capitol , scaled its walls, planted pipe bombs, and dangled from its railings, the pictures and videos were simultaneously stunning and revolting: The bright reds of the Confederate and Nazi flags and matching MAGA hats simmered against a sea of Trump flags now sold on street corner popup shops that outnumbered American flags, a noose, a raised wooden cross reminiscent of Klan lynchings, and a sweater reading Camp Auschwitz. The lineage between the slaveholding secessionists and the modern insurrectionists could not have been more clear: Both groups were willing to destroy the union and both used violence to deflect their own racial fantasies of power and privilege slipping away.\n\nA scene -- literal and figurative -- from 'The Birth of a Nation'\n\nMany historians have feared, and some have warned of the possibility of this day for months, some for years. Trump even campaigned in the style of the Jim Crow South's White supremacist demagogues, running on hatred and grievance, and cashing in on racism and xenophobia.\n\nNow, in the same moment as the historic election of Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who will respectively be the first Black and Jewish senators to represent Georgia , White supremacists armed with equipment ideal for taking hostages staged the nation's first real coup attempt while seeking to burn the Electoral College ballots. Just like their Confederate forebears, they angrily rejected legitimate election results, vowing vengeance and inciting racist violence.\n\nTo be sure, the chaos and uncertainty from the attempted coup and their defiling antics were jarring but not without precedent - the entire scene could have been lifted out of the 1915 White supremacist film  The Birth of a Nation . As the first major motion picture screened in the White House, the blackface epic rife with disinformation and Lost Cause sentiment had been based on the bestselling novel  The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan .\n\nFormer President Woodrow Wilson, a historian and architect of federal segregation, was rumored to have deemed The Birth of a Nation like writing history with lightning. In one of the most pivotal scenes in the saga, set in 1871, former slaveholding Confederates watched in horror from the Capitol's gallery -- the exact place where Reps. Jason Crow and Susan Wild were pinned to the floor beneath chairs yesterday -- and gawked at America's newly-elected Black congressmen and the first (fictional) Black speaker of the House.\n\nLike the domestic terrorists who vandalized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, defiantly putting their feet on her desk with the American flag prostrate, the Black congressmen in The Birth of a Nation (White actors in blackface) were admonished to keep their shoes on, with their feet off desks.\n\nFrom The Birth of a Nation (1915)\n\nThe blackface congressmen snuck liquor into the Capitol. They devoured fried chicken while wildly gesturing as they argued in favor of interracial marriage. They openly brandished guns and knives, gambled, and leered lasciviously at cowering white women in the gallery. As a silent movie, a title card on screen explained it all: The helpless white minority.\n\nThe lie of the 'helpless white minority'\n\nThe helpless white minority.\n\nThat simple lie lays bare so much of America's misery and suffering. The far-right and White supremacists' purported fear of losing status, wealth and most importantly, political power, in the face of mass Black voter turnout has always been part of what animated racial violence in this country, from riots to lynchings to police brutality.\n\nIt's no coincidence that the infamous The Birth of a Nation scene that perverts and degrades Black leadership supposedly occurs in 1871, one of the most tumultuous years in Reconstruction. Hiram Revels , America's first Black Senator and a preacher like Warnock, was in office, serving only a year. Union Army Generals founded the National Rifle Association, and Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act outlawing terrorist conspiracies by white supremacists. The act gave the President the power to suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus in regions prone to homegrown terrorism.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nDespite this act, and the formation of Black militias and voting blocs throughout the South, White supremacist violence accelerated unabated throughout the region for another 90 years with a legacy that still haunts us today. Slavery, Jim Crow and Reconstruction's failures to prosecute treasonous Americans materialized yesterday - in the plume of gun smoke inside the Capitol.\n\nThe task of peaceful unification is monumental, but it is imperative America upholds the Constitution and prosecutes those who commit treason to the full extent of the law -- for the stability of the nation and for the continuation of democracy. As the Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens aptly concluded just months after the bloody Civil War, If we fail in this great duty now, when we have the power, we shall deserve and receive the execration of history and of all future ages.
Sean Gardner/Getty Images\n\nLOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers' 2017-18 season might be considered an audition for the services of LeBron James, who can leave the Cleveland Cavaliers in July as a free agent.\n\nAfter the Cavaliers' 121-112 win over the Lakers on Dec. 14., James imparted private advice to rookie point guard Lonzo Ball.\n\nBrandon Ingram has begun to emerge as the team's primary scorer, as evidenced by his toe-to-toe battles with Kevin Durant in two overtime losses to the Golden State Warriors. Rookie Kyle Kuzma scored a career-high 38 points Wednesday in a road win over the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe Lakers (11-18) are showing impressive flashes of what they could be, but it's premature to consider Los Angeles a favorite for James' services. The hypothetical marriage is seen as a long shot, according to Ramona Shelburne and Brian Windhorst of ESPN.com.\n\nExecutives Earvin Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka need to have contingency plans in place.\n\nDarron Cummings/Associated Press\n\nAs the Oklahoma City Thunder (16-15) and New Orleans Pelicans (15-16) struggle to find their stride, the Lakers should keep close tabs on Paul George and DeMarcus Cousins. Like James, George has a $20.7 million player option with the Thunder for the 2018-19 season that he is likely to decline, while Cousins' deal with the Pelicans ends after the current season.\n\nVideo Play Button Videos you might like\n\nBased on the NBA's current salary-cap projection of $101 million for the 2018-19 season, both players will be eligible for contracts starting at around $30 million. The Lakers can afford to sign one of the two without breaking up their youthful core. They'd be able to re-sign pending restricted free agent Julius Randle with another $6.4 million to spend (less if they keep Ivica Zubac, Thomas Bryant and/or Tyler Ennis).\n\nInstead of Randle, Los Angeles could have $18 million to spend, perhaps to retain Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Brook Lopez or to acquire another team's free agent altogether.\n\nBoth Johnson and Pelinka have claimed the Lakers will have two max slots available next summer, but that currently isn't accurate, not without a move to open space that sheds the $36.8 million owed to Luol Deng and/or the $25.9 million to Jordan Clarkson over the next two seasons.\n\nThe Lakers could have the space to bring in both George and Cousins to play alongside Larry Nance Jr., Josh Hart, Ball, Ingram, Kuzma and even one of Clarkson or Randle, depending on how the team escapes Deng's contract.\n\nConsidering James will turn 33 on Dec. 30, George and Cousins—both of whom are 27—may give the Lakers more longevity on their dollar. Neither has LeBron's NBA Finals experience, but both would represent a significant upgrade in comparison to the incumbent talent.\n\nIf landing James and one of the two is plan A, George and Cousins without James might be plan B.\n\nDavid Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nAs the Feb. 8 trade deadline nears, the Lakers should consider making a play for their targets before free agency. The Cavaliers are going to ride or die with James, even if he leaves the franchise in July. The chance to win another title is worth that risk.\n\nCan the same be said of the Thunder and Pelicans, with both teams hovering around .500? What could the Lakers offer, knowing they may be able to lure George and/or Cousins in free agency?\n\nLos Angeles would be better off waiting if the price includes Ball, Ingram or Kuzma, but Randle would be the key piece the Lakers can afford to dangle.\n\nThat assumes New Orleans or Oklahoma City is interested in the Kentucky forward, who has blossomed this season as the team's backup center. Few teams will have much available cap space this summer, meaning Randle's restricted rights could be valuable to either franchise.\n\nTo make a deal with the Pelicans, the Lakers would need to send out at least $13 million in salary to acquire Cousins. Randle is earning just $4.1 million, which means they'd have to include other players with him, be it Caldwell-Pope or a bigger package with Corey Brewer, Tyler Ennis and Zubac. Roster space could be problematic for New Orleans in a four-for-one trade.\n\nA deal could expand to include a pair of bad contracts, with Omer Asik going to the Lakers and Deng to New Orleans. That wouldn't entirely erase the Deng mistake, but Asik's contract is more forgiving, with $23.3 million owed over the next two years (including only $3 million guaranteed for the 2019-20 season).\n\nCousins would still be an unrestricted free agent after the season with a cap hold of $27.1 million. That could give the Lakers $30-35 million left to spend, be it on George or even James in free agency. Trading for Cousins at the deadline essentially would give the Lakers an additional $3 million in cap space in July, before they re-sign him at the max of roughly $30 million.\n\nDavid Zalubowski/Associated Press\n\nGeorge has a higher salary, as he's earning $19.5 million with the Thunder this season. The Lakers would need to send out at least $14.5 million in salary to acquire him in a trade. As a free agent in July, George's cap hold would be $29.3 million, around $1 million below his maximum salary.\n\nCousins would be slightly friendlier from a salary-cap perspective, but it isn't as though the Lakers will have a friendly menu of choices before the trade deadline. The Pelicans and Thunder would much rather bolster their own rosters with hopes of retaining their respective All-Stars this summer.\n\nClarkson, who runs the point for the team's second unit while providing 14.1 points a game, might appeal to other teams as well. He's earning $11.6 million this season with two additional years left on his contract. The Lakers could trade him in lieu of or in conjunction with Randle.\n\nAs far as draft picks, the Lakers owe their 2018 first-rounder either to the Philadelphia 76ers or Boston Celtics. Los Angeles cannot trade its 2019 first-round pick until after the 2018 draft. In the meantime, the Lakers can freely trade away first-rounders starting with the 2020 draft.\n\nOther top potential free agents in 2018 include Kevin Durant, DeAndre Jordan, Chris Paul, Isaiah Thomas, Avery Bradley, Jabari Parker (restricted), Carmelo Anthony, Aaron Gordon (restricted), Clint Capela (restricted), Zach LaVine (restricted), Greg Monroe and Nerlens Noel.\n\nUltimately, the Lakers can afford to wait. If they miss out on James, Cousins and George, they still have spending power for one or two max contracts to go with a nice group of young, developing players.\n\nWhile the Lakers would love to have an All-Star on their roster before Los Angeles hosts the All-Star festivities at Staples Center in mid-February, they may have to wait until the summer for a blockbuster acquisition.\n\nAll quotes were obtained firsthand unless otherwise noted.

If you don't like the list, make your own! I love Thai and Japanese foods.\n\nLoveFoods was right. So we threw it open to a vote on a Facebook poll. And now, after more than 35,000 votes, it appears we got it all wrong. The world's most delicious food is not Massaman curry, as we suggested, but a meaty, spicy, gingery dish from west Sumatra.\n\nCouscous and lemon curd cake both took scores of votes, but didn't make the list. Some 439 people thought gelato deserved a place in online history. The world's 50 best foods according to CNN readers are below. Bon appetit.\n\n50. Goi cuon, Vietnam\n\nLittle packages of delightful food freshness. Courtesy Ducson Nguyen\n\nThis snack made from pork, shrimp, herbs, rice vermicelli and other ingredients wrapped in rice paper is served at room temperature. It's meat light, with the flavors of refreshing herbs erupting in your mouth. Dipped in a slightly sweet sauce laced with ground peanuts, it's wholesome, easy and the very definition of moreish.\n\n49. Lechon, Philippines\n\nGreat color, better taste. Courtesy Lemuel Cantos/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nYoung pigs, chosen for their tender meat, are rotated and roasted thoroughly over a fire pit for hours. The result is a thin layer of crispy skin on juicy, succulent meat. Every mouthful makes you wonder why you eat anything else. Great way to kick off this list.\n\n48. Parma ham, Italy\n\nParma ham, the most multi-faceted of treats. GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPossibly the most versatile and best food of all. You see it folded around melon, wrapped around grissini, placed over pizza, heaped over salad. There's good reason for that: these salty, paper-thin slices of air-dried ham lift the taste of everything they accompany to a higher level, following the same theory as the Italian guy who thinks carrying around a copy of Candide makes up for the tiny Speedos.\n\n47. Fettucini alfredo, Italy\n\nAn Italian dream. Courtesy shansby/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nSaying no to fettucini alfredo is like saying you don't find Monica Bellucci attractive. It's just wrong. The main ingredients are butter and Parmesan cheese; it's rich and creamy and it can be made in 15 minutes (consumption time included). A good serving of this can turn dinner with the family into something you actually look forward to.\n\n46. Maple syrup, Canada\n\nCanada's finest. Courtesy Raffi Asdourian/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nWith poutine and Montreal-style smoked meat not making the top 50, maple syrup becomes the sole Canadian representative in the list. But before selling you on its natural flavor and balanced sweetness, we must give credit to its mentor, the waffle, playing Batman to maple syrup's edgier, sexier Robin.\n\n45. Roti prata, Singapore\n\nA flipping great dish. Courtesy Alpha/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThe truth is curry wouldn't be curry if it wasn't for this dough-based pancake. Looks and tastes like Indian naan, roti prata is flipped and turned and flipped again before it's heated over a grill plate. Its preparation is so theatrical you'll feel like dancing a jig while you're eating it.\n\n44. Laksa, Singapore\n\nSingapore's glory. Courtesy LWYang/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nWhether it originates in Singapore Malaysia or Indonesia as reader Bob Haris Mandela claimed, an authentic bowl of laksa always comes with slippery vermicelli, a spicy broth (the spicier the better) and generous toppings of shredded chicken and fresh prawns. One whiff of its pungent curry-coconut aroma and you'll be transported to all three countries. Best way to travel ever.\n\n43. Fajitas, Mexico\n\nWho can resist fajitas? Courtesy Denis Dervisevic/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThis assembly kit of a dining experience is a thrill to DIY enthusiasts everywhere. Step 1: Behold the meat sizzling on a fiery griddle. Step 2: Along with the meat, throw side servings of capsicum, onion, guacamole, sour cream and salsa into a warm, flour tortilla. Step 3: Promise all within hearing range that you'll have just one more. Step 4: Repeat.\n\n42. Hamburger, Germany\n\nEveryone's favorite junk-food treat. PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen something tastes so good that people spend $20 billion each year in a single restaurant chain devoted to it, you know it has to fit into this list. McDonald's may not offer the best burgers, but that's the point -- it doesn't have to. The bread-meat-salad combination is so good that entire countries have ravaged their eco-systems just to produce more cows. A global best food contender.\n\n41. Galbi, Korea\n\nKorean grilled ribs. Courtesy egg (Hong, Yun Seon)/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nYeah, I would have thrown Kalbi Jim or something similar on there, wrote reader Nobody. Some Korean dishes are savagely good. We could forgive Nobody for opening 222 Facebook accounts to put Galbi in the list. But we're pretty sure the balance of sweet and savory in Korean short ribs means there's no underhand vote-rigging required.\n\n40. Bibimbap, Korea\n\nSee, healthy food can taste good. Courtesy Beyond Neon/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nMixed vegetables and beef, sitting atop steaming-hot rice, held together by a half-raw egg. The beauty of this Korean dish lies at least partially in the diner's DIY mixing of the ingredients. Bibimbap is best when served in a heated stone bowl, and eaten with metal chopsticks.\n\n39. Masala dosa, India\n\nBreakfast for one billion people. Courtesy McKay Savage/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nA crispy, rice-batter crepe encases a spicy mix of mashed potato, which is then dipped in coconut chutney, pickles, tomato-and-lentil-based sauces and other condiments. It's a fantastic breakfast food that'll keep you going till lunch, when you'll probably come back for another.\n\n38. Warm brownie and vanilla ice cream, Global\n\nThe dessert you can use to compare all the world's restaurants. Courtesy robin.norwood/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThere are some diners who will not frequent an establishment if it does not have brownie and ice cream on the dessert menu. You may call them fools. We do, too, but having done so we then happily leave the first restaurant after the main course to visit one we know has this perfect dessert on offer.\n\n37. Potato chips, United States\n\nThe world's cheapest delicacy? shutterstock\n\nDespite major criticisms suggesting that potato chips aren't real food, voters like Deepti Ravi believe that they rock. What started as a chef's trick on a fussy diner is now one of the world's most child-friendly foods. But think of them this way -- if a single chip cost, say, $5, it'd be a far greater (and more popular) delicacy than caviar, a prize worth fighting wars over.\n\n36. Moo nam tok, Thailand\n\nNeither soup nor salad -- but definitely delicious. Courtesy Dietrich Ayala/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nGrilled pork combined with lemon juice, green onions, chili, mint sprigs, fish sauce and toasted rice. Legend has it the blood from the meat along with the dressing inspired some happy carnivore to name this brilliant dish waterfall (nam tok moo) meat.\n\n35. Neapolitan pizza, Italy\n\nNeapolitan pizza isn't always so big -- but whatever its size it's delicious. MARIO LAPORTA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe best pizza was and still is the simple Neapolitan, an invention now protected by its own trade association that insists on sea salt, high-grade wheat flour, the use of only three types of fresh tomatoes, hand-rolled dough and the strict use of a wood-fired oven, among other quality stipulations.\n\nWith just a few ingredients -- dough, tomatoes, olive oil, salt and basil (the marinara pizza does not even contain cheese) -- the Neapolitans created a food that few make properly, but everyone enjoys thoroughly.\n\n34. Shrimp dumpling, Hong Kong\n\nSmall, but brilliant. Courtesy Stewart Butterfield/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nSucculent shrimps, steamed well but not overdone, wrapped inside translucent rice paper. This simple form of dim sum has been a must-eat dish for decades. Words on the street say the more pleat folds there are the more skillful the chef is.\n\n33. Seafood paella, Spain\n\nPaella, Spain's signature dish. Boca\n\nThe sea is lapping the shore by your feet, a warm breeze whips the tablecloth around your legs and a steamy pan of paella sits in front of you. Shrimp, lobster, mussels and cuttlefish combine with white rice and various herbs, oil and salt in this Valencian dish that will send you immediately into holiday mode. Though if you have it in Spain , you're probably there already.\n\n32. Lobster, Global\n\nIf you were on a million menus you'd have big claws too. Courtesy Chloe Media/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nForget all your fancy, contrived lobster dishes deployed by show-off chefs eager for Michelin endorsement. When you have something as naturally delicious as these little fellas, keep it simple. The best way to enjoy lobster is simply to boil it and serve with a side of melted butter and slice of lemon.\n\n31. Fried chicken, United States\n\nThe all-American classic. Courtesy Neil Conway/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nI have had almost everything. But they left off fried chicken...  reader Michelle Souza commented. Michelle: your fellow readers have made up for this unforgivable lapse. This all-time American favorite makes its entry with all the artery-choking goodness that made Colonel Sanders a very happy, if not healthy, man.\n\n30. Cheeseburger, United States\n\nCheese makes all the difference. Andrew Burton/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nThe power of cheese? Add it to an ordinary hamburger, the food gets pushed up 13 spots in the poll.\n\n29. Chili crab, Singapore\n\nWe've added it to the list, don't get crabby. Courtesy May Wong/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nReader ST suggested that chili crabs, contrary to popular beliefs, aren't difficult to make. Fantastic list of delicious food! Chilli Crabs are actually very easy to prepare. Here is an easy recipe for you :) ST forgot to mention, however, that it is difficult to stop eating this high-ranking best food.\n\n28. Barbecue pork, Hong Kong\n\nThe best pork comes barbecued and honey-drizzled. Courtesy City Foodsters/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nAlong with many comments left by reader Louis4, s/he wrote, TX bbq tastes like turds. Is that all you have beside that boring food? Here you go, Louis4. Your fellow readers suggested the Chinese version of barbecue pork. This honey-coated meat is sweet, tender and it goes well with everything -- rice, noodles or even by itself. Ask for the half-fat, half-lean barbecue pork to really indulge in this delicacy.\n\n27. Tacos, Mexico\n\nIt's taco time! Jake Lindeman\n\nA fresh, handmade tortilla stuffed with small chunks of grilled beef rubbed in oil and sea salt then covered with guacamole, salsa, onions, cilantro or anything else you want -- perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner. This is the reason few visitors leave Mexico weighing less than when they arrived.\n\n26. Penang assam laksa, Malaysia\n\nAs photogenic as the best food gets. Courtesy Pandora Voon/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nPoached, flaked mackerel, tamarind, chili, mint, lemongrass, onion, pineapple ... one of Malaysia's most popular dishes is an addictive spicy-sour fish broth with noodles (especially great when fused with ginger), that'll have your nose running before the spoon even hits your lips.\n\n25. Chocolate, Mexico\n\nChocolate -- the world's guilty pleasure. Courtesy LongitudeLatitude/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThe Mayans drank it, Lasse Hallström made a film about it and the rest of us get over the guilt of eating too much of it by eating more of it. The story of the humble cacao bean is a bona fide out-of-the-jungle, into-civilization tale of culinary wonder. Without this creamy, bitter-sweet confection, Valentine's Day would be all cards and flowers, Easter would turn back into another dull religious event and those halcyon days of gorging yourself to eruption point at Christmas would be fanciful imaginings.\n\n24. Fried rice, Thailand\n\nA tremendous Thai tradition. Courtesy marnalbano/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nIt's true, anyone can fry rice. But can you fry it as well as the Thais? We suspect not.\n\n23. Bulgogi, Korea\n\nThe messiest, meatiest food for champions. courtesy Korea Tourism Organization\n\nLiterally meaning fire and meat, this Korean dish has been in existence for nearly 1,000 years. A bowl of bulgogi gives everything you need in a balanced diet -- carbohydrate (rice), protein (beef and egg), vitamins and minerals (mixed vegetables), and fat (oil). Four good reasons to order a second bowl.\n\n22. Egg tart, Hong Kong\n\nEgg on your face can be a good thing. Courtesy City Foodsters/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nFlaky on the crust with a sweet and smooth egg custard in the middle, egg tarts are best eaten hot when they're fresh out of an oven. This dessert can be ordered in the most rundown bakeries and most glamorous hotels in Hong Kong . Former Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, declared eating egg tarts one of his favorite pastimes in the city.\n\n21. Fish 'n' chips, England\n\nA salty, vinegary homage to the basics. LEON NEAL/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnything that's been around since the 1860s can't be doing much wrong. The staple of the Victorian British working class is a crunchy-outside, soft-inside dish of simple, un-adorned food fundamentals. Sprinkled with salt, vinegar and dollops of tartar sauce, it is to nouveau cuisine what Meat Loaf is to Prince.\n\n20. Pho, Vietnam\n\nVietnam's answer to What should I eat today? Courtesy kaz k/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nThis oft-mispronounced national dish (fuh is correct) is just broth, fresh rice noodles, a few herbs and usually chicken or beef. But it's greater than the sum of its parts -- fragrant, tasty and balanced, the polar opposite of the moto rider who brought you to the little cafe where you find the best stuff.\n\n19. Green curry, Thailand\n\nIt's easy eating green. Courtesy pukekoblue/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nKermit got it wrong. It's not hard being green, it's delicious. For many this coconutty-creamy and spicy curry should have made the top 10. Goes with steamed rice like bikinis go with Thai beaches.\n\n18. Croissant, France\n\nA Parisian classic. Marie Hennechart\n\nFlaky pastry smothered in butter, a pile of raspberry jam smeared over the top and a soft, giving bite as you sink in your teeth; there's nothing not to love about this fatty, sweet breakfast food that must be married to a cup of strong coffee.\n\n17. Gelato, Italy\n\nSo many flavors to choose. Why bother? courtesy Salvatore Farina\n\nThanks to Eat, Pray, Love, the best dessert in Italy is more popular than ever. True gelato makers use only fresh ingredients and no artificial flavors or colors, and allow you to mix and match as many different flavors as you want. With a higher density and less fat than ice cream, gelato often tastes richer but healthier -- perfect for your own no-carb-left-behind experiment.\n\n16. Kebab, Turkey\n\nWhatever the kebab, its guaranteed to be tasty. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nFor keeping starvation at bay for the entire student population of the United Kingdom, the doner kebab should clearly be honored. But they are hardly the delicious prototype worthy of representing a region. Reader Elena Vorobyeva told us, There are so many forms and shapes of it: doner, iskender kebab, shish kebab, chop shish kebab, orman kebab, etc. So summon the shish kebab. Pick your meat, shove a stick through it, grill. Then wonder why you don't eat like this every day.\n\n15. Ice cream, United States\n\nThe fuel of the heart-broken across the world. David Paul Morris/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nSomehow there's always room for a tooth-rotting, U.S.-style pile of ice cream with nuts, marshmallows and chocolate sauce. Thank God for extra long spoons that allow you get at the real weight-gain stuff all mixed up and melted at the bottom of the glass. Other than a dietician, who wouldn't agree this is one of the best foods in the world?\n\n14. Satay, Indonesia\n\nStick it, soak it, eat it, lick it. Courtesy Marufish/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nReader Paul Peh wrote, I can make satay too but the prep will take at least half the day and [the eating will be done] in less than half hr. lol. Half an hour? What's the hold up? Last time we drowned some skewered meat with this peanut-based sauce we were ready for seconds before you could say mmmm.\n\n13. Chicken rice, Singapore\n\nSingapore's national dish. Courtesy Madeleine Deaton/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nOften called the national dish of Singapore, this steamed or boiled chicken is served atop fragrant oily rice, with sliced cucumber as the token vegetable. Variants include roasted chicken or soy sauce chicken. The dipping sauces -- premium dark soy sauce, chili with garlic and pounded ginger -- give it that little extra oomph to ensure whenever you're not actually in Singapore eating chicken rice, you're thinking of it.\n\n12. Kimchi, Korea\n\nHow much money have Korean restaurants lost out on by giving this away for free? Great Big Story\n\nIs South Korea the most generous nation or what? South Korean restaurants provide this starter dish of fermented vegetables for free. Perhaps because few South Koreans can last more than two days without it.\n\n11. Lasagna, Italy\n\nLasagna is right on so many levels. pinch of yum\n\nLasagna overtook pizza to become the most sought-after Italian food in this delicacy list. There's a reason this pasta-layered, tomato-sauce-infused, minced-meaty gift to kids and adults alike is so popular -- it just works. Dee Dodge wrote, I love Lasagna. The lack of exclamation marks tells you how seriously true fans take this dish.\n\n10. Massaman curry, Thailand\n\nStill a top 10 best foods entry. Courtesy Marita/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nAlthough not the world's most delicious food, it is still emphatically the king of curries. Spicy, coconutty, sweet and savory, its combination of flavors has more personality than a Thai election. Even the packet sauce you buy from the supermarket can make the most delinquent of cooks look like a Michelin potential. Thankfully, someone invented rice, with which diners can mop up the last drizzles of curry sauce. The Land of Smiles isn't just a marketing tag-line. It's a result of being born in a land where the best curry is sold on nearly every street corner.\n\n9. Peking duck, China\n\nThe only way to eat your duck. GREG BAKER/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPeking duck! its a wonder..... wrote Shan Cao on our Facebook page. We can only guess Shan Cao was in the middle of forking a piece of this maltose-syrup glazed duck dish into his/her mouth and forgot to finish the sentence. Slow-roasted in an oven, the crispy, syrup-coated skin is so good that authentic eateries will serve more skin than meat, and bring it with pancakes, onions and hoisin or sweet bean sauce. Other than flying or floating, this is the only way you want your duck.\n\n8. Ramen, Japan\n\nWorld's loudest food? Courtesy Jonathan Lin/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nJapanese protocol says the tastier your ramen is, the louder you should slurp it up to show respect to your chef. Not that they need more respect. One mouthful of this most Japanese of noodle broths will quickly tell you that either you have a ramen trigger in your brain, or Japanese chefs are geniuses.\n\n7. Dim sum, Hong Kong\n\nFamily lunches are fun again. Kate Springer\n\nEqually fun and delicious to eat, a trip to Hong Kong isn't complete without trying this traditional Cantonese lunch food. Popular with everyone from pass-through tourists to local kids and the elderly, most dim sum come in bite-size pieces so you don't have to waste time cutting the stuff up. Bring a few friends and wash the food down with the free-flow tea.\n\n6. Som tam (Papaya salad), Thailand\n\nThailand's best salad. Courtesy Jessica Spengler/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nAfter reading reader Kun Chotpakdeetrakul's comment, Papaya salad and som tam [are] the same thing. You should combine vote for these two together, we did just that, pushing som tam to just 80 votes shy of the top five. To prepare Thailand 's iconic salad, pound garlic and chilies with a mortar and pestle. Toss in tamarind juice, fish sauce, peanuts, dried shrimp, tomatoes, lime juice, sugar cane paste, string beans and a handful of grated green papaya.\n\n5. Pad thai, Thailand\n\nEven better when it's messy. Courtesy Steve Snodgrass/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nHere's a food Thai people can't live without. Similar to Bulgogi (see #22), pad thai is packed with nutrients stirred into one glorious fried-noodle dish. The secret's in the sauce -- tamarind paste. If anyone ever creates a Hall of Food Fame, that should be first on the list.\n\n4. Tom yam goong, Thailand\n\nDo you eat or drink soup? Either way just get it inside you. Courtesy amrufm/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nReader Supot Sakulwongtana made it clear that delicious includes a little bit hot. A little bit hot is right because you need room for a load more flavors too. This Thai masterpiece teems with shrimp, mushrooms, tomatoes, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime leaves. Usually loaded with coconut milk and cream, the hearty soup unifies a host of favorite Thai tastes: sour, salty, spicy and sweet. Best of all is the price: cheap.\n\n3. Sushi, Japan\n\nRice, salmon, wasabi -- world's best food trio? Tonic Photo Studios, LLC/ Photographers Choice RF/ Getty Images\n\nWhen Japan wants to build something right, it builds it really right. Brand giants such as Toyota, Nintendo, Sony, Nikon and Yamaha may have been created by people fueled by nothing more complicated than raw fish and rice, but it's how the fish and rice is put together that makes this a global first-date favorite. This perfect marriage between raw fish and rice has easily kept sushi in the top five. And like one reader, Nymayor, wrote, Now to be fair, DELICIOUS can be simple. The Japanese don't live practically forever for no reason -- they want to keep eating this stuff.\n\n2. Nasi goreng, Indonesia\n\nMore rice -- a common factor in many of these dishes. Courtesy Indi Samarajiva/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nI like rendang and nasi goreng, two of most popular food in Indonesia! Reader Rizky Ramadhika's got it. And thousands of other voters agreed. The wonder of combining rice with egg, chicken and prawns strikes again. The second fried rice to make the list, this Indonesian delight received more than 10 times the vote of its Thai counterpart (see #23), propelling the former from non-runner to runner-up.\n\n1. Rendang, Indonesia\n\nNo. 1 as voted by you. Courtesy stu_spivack/Creative Commons/Flickr\n\nReader Kamal F Chaniago showed great foresight when he wrote, Rendang is the best. A clear winner with a loyal following, this beefy dish can now rightfully claim the title of World's Most Delicious Food. Beef is slowly simmered with coconut milk and a mixture of lemongrass, galangal, garlic, turmeric, ginger and chilies, then left to stew for a few hours to create this dish of tender, flavorful bovine goodness.\n\nThe Indonesian dish is often served at ceremonial occasions and to honored guests. It's not only delicious but also comes with a simple recipe. If you haven't already, go ahead and take reader Isabela Desita's advice: Rendang should be the first! It's really nice, you should try!

Here, the pirate ship Jose Gasparilla celebrates the playoff game with an illuminated sign in Hillsborough Bay near downtown Tampa. Check out some highlights from the two teams' earlier games:\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe College Football Playoff National Championship game is coming up Monday. Other than being a mouthful to say – it needs something elegant, like Super Bowl – it should be a great game. Expect a clash, of both titans and colors, as the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Clemson Tigers vie for the title. Here's everything, and we mean everything, you need to know about the game.\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nKickoff is at 8 p.m. ET Monday.\n\nWhat channel is it on?\n\nThe game will be broadcast on ESPN, and if you don't have cable, you can catch it on WatchESPN, the channel's streaming service.\n\nWhere is it?\n\nThe game will be played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.\n\nWhat team usually plays there?\n\nThe stadium is home to the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which explains the giant pirate ship in it.\n\nWho's playing?\n\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide (in crimson, obviously) will take on the Clemson Tigers (in white, with orange helmets, according to Bleacher Report).\n\nWhat schools do they represent and where are they?\n\nThe University of Alabama is in Tuscaloosa, and Clemson University is in Clemson, South Carolina.\n\nDo these teams have history?\n\nBoy, do they ever. This game is a rematch of the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, which Alabama won 45-40.\n\nWho are the quarterbacks?\n\nKeep these names handy: The Alabama quarterback is Jalen Hurts, and Clemson's is Deshaun Watson.\n\nWho are the coaches?\n\nNick Saban coaches Alabama, and Dabo Swinney coaches Clemson. More on this later.\n\nWhat's the spread?\n\nAccording to Bleacher Report, Alabama is favored by six points (the same number as a touchdown), with the total points at 51. We told you this would be good.\n\nHow many championships has Alabama claimed?\n\n16, including four under current coach Nick Saban.\n\nThat's a lot.\n\nYeah, they're a pretty big deal.\n\nHow many championships has Clemson claimed?\n\nOne, in 1981.\n\nCan I get tickets, and how much will they set me back?\n\nIt's going to cost you – plenty: Tickets for the game start at $895 apiece on Stubhub.\n\nThe really baller sideline seats are going for as much as $50,000, which is about what it costs to get a four-year education at either Alabama or Clemson.\n\nEveryone keeps talking about the SEC. I don't know what that is and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask.\n\nDivision I FBS teams are divided into conferences. Think of them like leagues. Alabama belongs to the Southeastern Conference, or the SEC. It is the most powerful conference and one of the reasons it seems like everyone in the South is crazy about football.\n\nClemson is in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which is also pretty good.\n\nWhy is Alabama's mascot an elephant if the team is called the Crimson Tide?\n\nThis is actually a great story, as related by Alabama's athletics website. Basically, during a much-hyped 1930 game between Alabama and Ole Miss, the Alabama team came out with such strength and force, fans yelled, Hold your horses, the elephants are coming! and the name Red Elephants stuck amongst sportswriters.\n\nHow do you pronounce Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney's name?\n\nIt's DAB-oh SWEE-nee, as in doing the dab. Someone should call him The Dab. His real name is William Christopher Swinney.\n\nWho is Lane Kiffin, and why does anyone care?\n\nKiffin was the offensive coordinator for Alabama and was slated to leave the school at the end of the season to coach another team. However, Saban, Alabama's head coach and a god among football men, recently made the surprising announcement that Kiffin would not be sticking around to coach during the championship game. Drama ensued.\n\nWhat should I yell out the car window if I want to proclaim my allegiance to one of these teams?\n\nIf you're into Alabama, you only need to know two words: Roll Tide. This is suitable for any occasion, up to and including wills and marriage vows.\n\nIf you're rooting for Clemson, a hearty Go Tigers will suffice.\n\nWhat does the trophy look like, and is it better than the crystal football egg thing teams used to get?\n\nThe trophy looks like this:\n\nIt's not better than the old trophy, which looked like it belonged in the throne room of Buckingham Palace.\n\nHere's what the winning team used to receive. Pretty snazzy, right?\n\nWhat are some other fun facts I can use to sound smart?\n\nClemson had an undefeated 2015 season going into last year's championship game and then lost to Alabama. This year, it's Alabama that's been undefeated so far. Does that mean anything? Who knows?\n\nThis is also the first time two teams have met for a rematch of a Division I College Football Championship, made even more interesting (or boring, perhaps) because, well, they just played each other last year!\n\nNow you know everything there is to know about Monday night's game. Enjoy.
Written by Allyssia Alleyne, CNN\n\nFor football fans, the Super Bowl is the most important day of the season, the culmination of five months of National Football League competition. And for those less interested in the sport, there's the halftime show, when the world's most famous performers deliver 15 minutes of high-voltage entertainment.\n\nOn Sunday night, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira gave highly energetic performances which included crowd surfing and pole dancing . Throughout, J-Lo changed into multiple Versace outfits, including a silver mesh body suit and a feathered cape that dueled as Puerto Rican and American flags, to celebrate her heritage.\n\nSinger Jennifer Lopez performs during the Pepsi Super Bowl LIV Halftime Show at Hard Rock Stadium on February 02, 2020 in Miami, Florida.

Indeed, the most-watched halftime show, Katy Perry in 2015, attracted 118.5 million viewers , while the game itself drew an average audience of 114.4 million viewers.\n\nThis massive audience makes the halftime show a valuable platform for artists to promote designers and spread messages through their fashion choices -- sometimes courting controversy and backlash in the process.\n\nCNN Style looks back at some of the best fashion of halftime shows past.\n\n1993 - Michael Jackson rocks the military look\n\nMichael Jackson performs at Super Bowl XXVII in 1993 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Credit: Steve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nGiven its significance today, you'd think the Super Bowl halftime show has always been a prestige event. But it was only in 1993, when Michael Jackson brought his trademark pageantry to the event, that it took on its current reputation. Before then, the show had mostly been dominated by marching bands.\n\nJackson's performance -- introduced by no less than James Earl Jones -- opened with him springing eight feet into the air from underneath the stage (a trademark of his 1992 Dangerous World Tour), against a backdrop of pyrotechnics.\n\nHe then stood motionless for one-and-a-half minutes in a military-inspired black-and-gold ensemble, before launching into a medley of his hits.\n\nGiven Jackson's repertoire of songs against police violence, war and injustice, this look was subversive. Michael made (the uniform) his own by pushing the envelope, rebelling against the establishment the uniform is supposed to represent with all those badges and making it rock 'n' roll, Michael Bush, one of Jackson's costume designers, told Rolling Stone in 2012.\n\nBut it was also just fantastic theater for an audience that had previously settled for Disney characters and an Elvis-impersonating magician\n\n2004 - Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction\n\nJanet Jackson performs during the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXVIII at Houston's Reliant Stadium in 2004.

The Federal Communications Commission reportedly received more than 500,000 indecency complaints about 9/16 of a second of exposed flesh, and levied a $550,000 fine against CBS, the network airing the game, and its affiliates. (The fine was thrown out by the Supreme Court in 2012.)\n\n2007 - Prince's perfect timing\n\nPrince at Super Bowl XLI in 2007.

And there was a sneaky thrill in watching Prince steal the field from guys three times his size, if only for a few moments, opined music critic Kelefa Sanneh in the New York Times following the show.\n\n2012 - Madonna brings high fashion to halftime\n\nMadonna wears Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci at Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.

To add an extra veneer of dark glamour to her performance, Madonna enlisted designer Riccardo Tisci , then creative director of Givenchy, to design her costumes.\n\nFollowing my collaboration with Madonna on her last tour three years ago, it is a great honor for me to be a part of yet another historical and iconic moment, Tisci told Vogue after the performance. People say everything has a limit, but limits do not exist with Madonna.\n\nThe bespoke outfits, inspired by looks Tisci had designed for the French fashion house, included an embellished gold cape and a gladiatorial black mini skirt with a studded belt, each accessorized with an Egyptian-inspired headpiece by British milliner Philip Treacy.\n\n2015 - Katy Perry goes (more) pop with Jeremy Scott\n\nKaty Perry, wearing Jeremy Scott, performs her single Roar atop a metal lion during the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show.

The looks were a perfect marriage of Katy Perry's over-the-top cartoonish-ness and Scott's penchant for bedazzled Americana and pop culture.\n\nOne of the highlights? A metallic skirt-and-jacket combo covered in flames worn during the first number, inspired by a pair of shoes from the designer's archive. Perry wore it to perform her song Roar atop a metal lion.\n\nExclusive documentary: Around the world with Jeremy Scott\n\nI love pop culture, and for me that's one of the things that's so exciting about this opportunity, Scott told the now-defunct fashion news site Style.com. The audience is so vast, it's so much more outside our nuanced world of high-fashion lovers.\n\nThat vast audience ended up encompassing 118.5 million TV viewers -- the standing record for a Super Bowl halftime show.\n\n2016 - Beyoncé gets political\n\nSANTA CLARA, CA - FEBRUARY 07: Beyonce and Bruno Mars perform during the Pepsi Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show at Levi's Stadium on February 7, 2016 in Santa Clara, California.

On Saturday, she released the video for her new single, Formation, a visual exploration of southern black femininity and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which ripped through predominantly black New Orleans neighborhoods in 2005. On Sunday, she took to the stage to perform in one of the year's most-watched televised events.\n\nHer performance was unabashedly politically. She opened the show with an all-black dance troupe donning afros and black berets, an obvious reference to the way the way Black Panther Party members dressed in the '60s. (Forgoing the beret, Beyoncé tipped her hat to Michael Jackson with a black-and-gold military jacket recalling his own Super Bowl look.) The dancers also assumed an X formation at one point, a reference to Malcolm X.\n\nWhile fans and critics praised the performance, and the audacity of making such a powerful statement in front of her entire country. New York Times Magazine staff writer Jenna Wortham put it well: I think she wants us to know that even though she's headlining a mainstream event like the Super Bowl, she has opinions and isn't afraid to share them, nor is she afraid to do it on a national and global scale.\n\n(It's worth noting this was in February 2016, seven months before Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem in protest against police brutality and racism in the US.)\n\nOthers took offense at what they perceived as an anti-police sentiment. Some were so upset that they organized a poorly attended anti-Beyoncé rally at the NFL's New York headquarters. Rudy Giuliani, the outspoken former mayor of New York mayor and Donald Trump's attorney, called it outrageous.\n\nThis is football, not Hollywood, he told Fox News , and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive.\n\n2017 - Lady Gaga takes to the skies\n\nLady Gaga performs during Super Bowl LI Halftime Show at Houston's NRG Stadium in 2017.

Cox/Getty Images\n\nLeave it to Lady Gaga to take the Super Bowl halftime show to new heights.\n\nThe singer started her set with God Bless America and This Land Is Your Land before being lowered into the stadium on cables to sing, dance and play piano to her greatest hits.\n\nSurprisingly, she wore only two outfits throughout: An iridescent, crystal-embellished bodysuit (which she later covered with a spiked golden jacket); and a white jacket that resembled football shoulder pads with matching hot pants. Both were designed by Atelier Versace, so subtle they were not.

(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)\n\n(CNN) —\n\nRihanna claims her father and his business partner fraudulently used her name to make money and she's suing them over it.\n\nThe singer alleges that her father, Ronald Fenty, and his partner, Moses Perkins, falsely represented their company's affiliation with her.\n\nAlthough Mr. Fenty is Rihanna's father, he does not have, and never has had, authority to act on Rihanna's behalf, nor has he ever been authorized to use her name, intellectual property or publicity rights, the suit obtained by CNN reads. Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017.

(CNN) Each week, Sheri McGregor gets hundreds of emails from parents shut out of their children's lives. Every story is different, she said. What the parents have in common is a profound sense of isolation.\n\nThey say, 'I thought I was the only one,' said McGregor, founder of a website for estranged parents who lives in the foothills of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. A lot of these people have been suffering alone for years. ... You feel like you're the only one, so you don't tell other people.\n\nAfter being cut off by her own adult son, McGregor had felt the same. In the years since, she has written extensively about the healing process, and heard from countless families coping with similar losses.\n\nFamily rifts between parents and adult children are the most common, according to the Cornell University survey.\n\nMcGregor, and the people who write to her, are not alone in their rifts with family members. It's something they have in common with millions of people.\n\nIn one recent high-profile case, multiple family members of Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois released a letter shunning the politician for his criticism of then-President Donald Trump. What a disappointment you are to us and to God! they wrote . It is now most embarrassing to us that we are related to you.\n\nOver a quarter of adults responding to a US survey by the Cornell Family Reconciliation Project reported being estranged from a family member. The representational survey, which is the first of its kind, suggested by extension that tens of millions of Americans may be estranged from at least one relative.\n\nThat number is probably low, said Karl Pillemer, professor of human development at Cornell University, who led the study and explored his findings in the recent book  Fault Lines: Fractured Families and How to Mend Them .\n\nPeople find this to be an embarrassing problem, he said, noting that even in a confidential survey, some topics can simply feel too shameful to share.\n\nThe groundbreaking survey sheds light on a topic Pillemer said is poorly understood by scientists, given how widespread and painful estrangement is. No more than 20 reliable scientific articles about estrangement exist, he said, and those are all based on small and non-representative samples.\n\nToday, however, researchers and mental health professionals are tuning into the problem. Here's what experts say about why estrangements happen, why they may be rising and how families can begin to heal.\n\nWhy family estrangements happen\n\nEvery family is different, but there are six main paths to estrangement between family members, Pillemer said.\n\nDivorce can have long-term impacts on families. Conflict over money and inheritance can play a major role in blowups.\n\nRelationships with in-laws can cause tension, sometimes to the point of estrangement. A family member might also have unmet expectations, seeing their relatives as failing them in some crucial way.\n\nFor example, tennis champion Naomi Osaka 's Japanese mother, Tamaki Osaka, was estranged from family members for over a decade because they disapproved of her relationship with Naomi's Haitian father, Leonard Francois.\n\nThe most prominent path, though, may be a painful history that proves just too hard to move on from, Pillemer said.\n\nProblems in childhood, problems in the family of origin were a main cause in many estrangements, he said. In some ways, that reflects how what he calls positive shared history can provide a buffer against the stress of normal conflict, Pillemer explained.\n\nImagine a pair of siblings facing a conflict about money, for instance. Or a parent-child relationship strained by a difference in values, like the family situation faced by Tamaki Osaka.\n\nRemembering a lifetime of positive, loving interactions could see the family through a rocky patch.\n\nIf there's been this long and solid basis of childhood attachment and affection, you're more likely to reconcile. It's more likely to be a temporary thing, Pillemer said.\n\nWhy family estrangement may be rising\n\nA family rift is intensely personal, yet each story plays out against a broader cultural backdrop of values and behavioral norms. While no historical data exist to demonstrate a clear rise, Pillemer said he suspects estrangements have gone up over time.\n\nSomeone feeling comfortable saying 'I never want to speak to my family members again,' is probably increasing, he said. Divorce, which correlates to likelihood of family estrangements, has risen dramatically over past decades.\n\nThere is also a change in perspective, Pillemer said. The sense that 'I will stick with my relatives no matter what' ... I think that's still there to some extent. But I think there's a lower-threshold breaking point, for younger people in particular.\n\nMany Americans now place a greater emphasis on individual well-being, said psychologist Joshua Coleman, author of the new book  Rules of Estrangement: Why Adult Children Cut Ties and How to Heal the Conflict .\n\nStaying in contact is much more tied to identity, to personal growth, to the pursuit of happiness, he said. In the past, Coleman explained, such bonds were more likely to be grounded in a sense of duty or obligation.\n\nThat's different now, said Coleman, whose focus is mainly on estrangements between parents and adult children. Such ruptures are particularly painful, and the Cornell University survey found they're the most common of all.\n\nToday, parents are held to a much higher standard, Coleman said. The only thing that keeps an adult child tied to a parent is whether the adult child wants the relationship.\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing, he said. The cultural shift makes it easier for adult children to separate from parents who have been abusive , or who reject their sexuality, gender identity and basic values.\n\nPrior generations of parents had too much power in terms of relationships with their children, while today it's much more equal, he said. In some cases, though, Coleman thinks US culture has swung too far away from family cohesion to support overall social well-being.\n\nThe equilibrium between cohesion and individual happiness varies between cultures and families. In the Cornell University study, for example, participants from families who immigrated to the US from the Caribbean, Africa and Latin America reported feeling strong social pressure to repair any rifts with estranged relatives.\n\nOverall in the US, though, we're wedded to this more individualistic narrative of personal happiness, Coleman said, that if a relationship doesn't make you feel good, or makes you feel bad in any way, then you should consider this person toxic and cut them out of your life.\n\nThat, in turn, might not actually make us very happy, Coleman said. There's enormous loneliness in our culture, he said.\n\nOlder adults tend to be especially isolated, a situation that has been aggravated by the pandemic. Being part of a group — caring about what other people think, feel and need — is important.\n\nHow estranged families can find healing\n\nSome estranged families make their way to Coleman's Oakland, California, therapy practice , where the psychologist works with parents hoping to reconcile with their children. It's a predicament he can relate to, because he, too, has experienced such loss firsthand.\n\nI had an estrangement with my daughter, which has made this kind of a mission, said Coleman, who has since reconciled with his child. The parents I work with are heartbroken, they're miserable.\n\nReconciliation is possible for many families, Coleman said, but it's not easy. In most cases of successful reconciliations between parent and child, he said parents initiate the process.\n\nParents must show empathy for the adult's child's perspective, they have to take responsibility. Coleman often invites parents to write their children a letter that does just that, acknowledging why the child felt they needed to cut off the relationship.\n\nIt's not all about making amends, he said. It's also important to signal that you're ready for a relationship that respects your family member's ideas of what a healthy connection looks like, even if that differs from your own expectations.\n\nNot all parents, frankly, are capable of doing that, Coleman said. And sometimes parents may do all of these things and the child is still not willing to reconcile.\n\nColeman underscores empathy when he's talking to adult children, too. If they were open to reconciliation, I would pursue with them a different way of looking at their parent, one that's borne more of compassion and empathy, he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSuch a shift in perspective can be difficult for people on each side of a rift. For many families, though, he said the benefits of reconciliation means it's worth the hard emotional work.\n\nPeople sometimes say, 'How successful are you?' Coleman said. We're very successful when both people are willing to come to the bargaining table and are open to change. But both people have to be willing.
(CNN) America faces 13 days of danger before the departure of an unhinged commander-in-chief who set his mob on the US Capitol in an act of insurrection that shattered a more than 220-year tradition of peaceful transfers of power.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's seditious behavior has provoked a full crisis inside his White House bunker in his final days, following a fracture with his ultra-loyal Vice President Mike Pence , who refused to join the futile but destructive effort to overturn the result of the election.\n\nAfter orchestrating one of the most notorious days in US political history and trashing democracy by refusing for weeks to accept his defeat, Trump suddenly issued a dead-of-night statement belatedly pledging an orderly transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden on January 20.\n\nBut as usual, the move appeared motivated by self-interest rather than a sense of duty as it appeared to be an attempt to stem a wave of West Wing resignations amid talk of a snap impeachment or effort by the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to force him from office.\n\nIn unspeakable scenes on Wednesday, marauding thugs marched from an incendiary Trump rally to storm the Capitol. Their aim was to stop lawmakers finalizing President-elect Joe Biden's victory ahead of his January 20 inauguration. But the bedlam, which saw rioters smash windows, lay siege to lawmakers and reach the House and Senate chambers, had the opposite effect, hastening the moment of final repudiation for the President and his baseless claims of a stolen election.\n\nA number of Senate Republicans who had been minded to drag out the President's stunt flipped in revulsion at the storming of their citadel of democracy in an ugly culmination of a lawless presidency. But despite the outrage perpetrated by Trump supporters, more than 100 of his allies in the House -- a majority of Republicans -- still voted to uphold totally fraudulent claims of election fraud.\n\nBut shortly before 4 a.m. ET on Thursday morning, Pence read out the final tally of electoral votes — 306 to 232 in the President-elect's favor — as the Constitution and the will of the people triumphed over Trump's stunning attempt at a coup.\n\nShortly afterward, the President issued a written statement pledging an orderly transition on January 20 even though he said he disagreed with the outcome of the election, once again repeating false claims about how the facts were on his side.\n\nWhile this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again! Trump wrote.\n\nThe breaching of the Capitol for the first time since 1814 overshadowed hugely significant results of twin runoff elections in Georgia that handed Democrats control of the Senate. The victories of Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will transform prospects for Biden's presidency, which will begin in a nation ripped in two by Trump's seditious behavior and consumed by a murderous and worsening pandemic that produced a new daily record of more than 3,800 Covid-19 deaths.\n\nBut before then, there is growing concern about the stability of a President who has had his Twitter and Facebook accounts suspended because of incitement but retains the full power of the presidency and the nuclear codes.\n\nInside his White House bunker on Wednesday night, Trump was fulminating about his defeat and what he sees as the treachery of Pence.\n\nSome officials were considering resigning, including national security adviser Robert O'Brien. His deputy, Matt Pottinger had already gone Wednesday afternoon, sources told CNN. A GOP source said that some Cabinet members held preliminary discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment to force Trump's removal from office on the grounds he is not fit to serve. There were demands from some House Democrats to trigger immediate impeachment proceedings. However the tumult is resolved, there is the alarming prospect of an uncontrollable President running rampant and a splintered chain of command at the White House that will have grave national security implications and could create a vacuum conducive to further unrest.\n\nIt is not clear how much momentum efforts to expel the President will gather with Trump so close to leaving office. But they reflect extreme concern of even those officials and Republicans who have appeased his wild impulses and abuses of power for four turbulent years.\n\nAfter all, a President who has already been impeached once, who was caught on tape trying to steal the election in Georgia last weekend and who has never recognized the guardrails of his office, is acting in a way that suggests he thinks he has nothing to lose.\n\nHe's out of his mind, one source who is in frequent contact with Trump told CNN's Jim Acosta.\n\nPresidential historian Douglas Brinkley expressed concern about the damage that an unchained and angry president could wreak in the next two weeks.\n\nAnybody in any federal bureau has to be keeping a close eye on Donald Trump because he is acting and thinking in an irrational way, Brinkley said.\n\nA surreal moment\n\nThe most terrifying truth revealed by the assault on the Capitol was not the act itself. It was the mania of a President who turned his insurgents on the nation's legislature and who has immeasurably deepened political estrangements that will fester long after he has left office.\n\nThe spectacle of rioters, waving Trump flags and wearing Make America Great Again hats piling up the steps below the glorious dome that shines as a beacon of self-government was too surreal to believe at first. But while shocking, the unprecedented scenes of an American horde rampaging through the halls of Congress, of police guns drawn in the House chamber and of rioters smashing windows cannot be said to be a surprise.\n\nThey were, in fact, a logical climax to a presidency steeped in demagoguery, conspiracy theories, incitements to violence and a strongman's contempt for the Constitution. They were the inevitable result of years of misinformation and instigation by Trump, his aides and his lie-pumping media propagandists that have left millions of Americans believing his false claims of a rigged election. The shame of a dark day in American history is shared by all those who mocked warnings that Trump's political treachery was brewing an explosion -- including Republican lawmakers, who have abetted his ludicrous claims of voter fraud after enabling his malignant presidency.\n\nWe are going to walk down ... to the Capitol, Trump said in a rally near the White House that lit the touch paper for a day of mayhem as Congress met to finalize Biden's election victory.\n\nYou'll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength, you have to be strong.\n\nThe appalling scenes horrified an incredulous watching world and recalled the revolts and palace rebellions of unstable banana republics rather than the stately rituals of the supposed last best hope for democracy on Earth.\n\nThis is not America, Josep Borrell, a top European Union official, said on Twitter.\n\nSadly, and to the contrary, this is the America wrought by the country's most vengeful President whose abominable four years in power have stoked an American carnage more dangerous than the economic blight he decried in an inaugural address delivered nearly four years ago from the same steps overrun by his thugs.\n\nA day of infamy actually began with the FBI opening an investigation into an apparently fake threat broadcast on air traffic control frequencies to fly a plane into the Capitol to avenge the US killing of a top Iranian general last year. The day's peril came not from outside but from within, as the Trump mob pulled off an incursion previously only managed by British armies 200 years ago.\n\nThere has been a recent debate among journalists on how to refer to Trump's bid to steal a free and fair election he lost, his refusal to honor a peaceful transfer of power, and his incitement of angry supporters to disrupt the constitutional process.\n\nThis is as close to a coup attempt as this country has ever seen, former Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey told CNN.\n\nTimothy Naftali, a CNN presidential historian from New York University, said that Trump had broken a golden thread of democracy that has sustained American freedom.\n\nToday was the first time in our history that a President has opposed a peaceful transfer of power, Naftali said.\n\nA 'shameful' episode\n\nThe question now is whether Wednesday's outrage will be a one-off eruption, that once quelled, will become an awful memory of a presidency that tore the country apart.\n\nBut the bitter feelings unleashed by Trump are not confined to the tens of thousands of supporters who flocked to Washington, DC. The President and his media shills have seeded a pernicious mistrust of democracy across vast swathes of the country. The majority of Trump voters are not violent. But millions of them believe his poison about the election being stolen — and think their country is being taken away from them. This raises the possibility that Wednesday's unrest is more than the violent death throes of a failed presidency, but a venomous force that will not only thwart Biden's hopes of healing corrosive divides but will fester once Trump leaves office and offer him a platform for continued extremism.\n\nUtah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said that the best way to show respect for voters who are upset at the election result is not to perpetuate Trump's lies but to tell them the truth.\n\nThose who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy.\n\nSeveral Republican senators were angered by Wednesday's events -- despite sending a signal of impunity for Trump's previous abuses of power by voting to acquit him in his impeachment trial and forging a marriage of convenience with Trump to pursue shared goals like confirming conservative judges.\n\nTrump and I have, we've had a hell of a journey. I hate it to end this way. Oh my God, I hate it, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said. All I can say is count me out. Enough is enough, Graham said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell condemned the violence and reinforced his opposition to efforts to block Biden's victory.\n\nWe will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats, McConnell said. We will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nEleventh hour resignations and acknowledgments of Biden's victory, however, are hardly profiles in courage following the indulgence granted by Republicans to Trump's anti-democratic conduct and weeks of appeasing his denial of Biden's victory.\n\nTrump silent amid the mayhem\n\nWhile members of Congress took cover beneath their seats, and his supporters roamed though leadership offices, Trump did nothing — but watch the mayhem that he had triggered unfold on TV.\n\nOne source told CNN's Kaitlin Collins that Trump was more preoccupied with what he sees as Pence's political apostasy after the vice president announced he would not seek to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory — a step he had no power to take in any case. Eventually, Trump issued a video telling protesters to go home but exacerbated the situation by making more disgraceful and false allegations about a stolen election.\n\nThe President's silence when real violence was raging contrasted with his incessant and false pre-election claims that leftist mobs were running rampant through US cities and his calls for the restoration of Law and Order.\n\nAnd the apparently meager US Capitol Police forces that were overwhelmed in Congress contrasted sharply with the heavily armed phalanxes of security forces Trump poured onto streets filled by Black Lives Matters protests over the summer. On that notorious occasion, the Justice Department sent federal troops into Lafayette Square with tear gas to clear protesters ahead of an absurd presidential photo-op.\n\nIt was left to Biden , who will take office in a country brought to its knees by Trump's divisiveness and a pandemic that is now claiming more than 3,000 American lives per day, to offer the steady hand of leadership.\n\nThis is not dissent. It is disorder. It is chaos. It borders on sedition, Biden said in a speech in Delaware.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.
(CNN) Transportation Secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg said Thursday that the Biden administration will look at all relevant authorities at its disposal toward a federal mask mandate on all forms of transportation, part of his confirmation hearing that could put the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor on the path to becoming the first Senate-confirmed LGBTQ Cabinet secretary.\n\nWe are prepared to make sure that we use all relevant authorities to enforce the President's executive order to ensure that across all modes of transportation, workers, passengers, commuters are protected, Buttigieg told Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts during his confirmation hearing before the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\n\nButtigieg, who gained national attention during his upstart presidential campaign, is also expected to play a central role in President Joe Biden's push for a bipartisan infrastructure package. During the campaign, Biden proposed spending $1.3 trillion over 10 years to build schools , roads, bridges, railroads and pipes, expand broadband access and usher in a 100% clean energy economy .\n\nWe need to build our economy back, better than ever, Buttigieg said. The Department of Transportation can play a central role in this, by implementing President Biden's infrastructure vision creating millions of good-paying jobs, revitalizing communities that have been left behind, enabling American small businesses, workers, families and farmers to compete and win in the global economy, and tackling the climate crisis.\n\nButtigieg often spoke about infrastructure on the campaign trail from the perspective of a small-town mayor, arguing that local governments like the one he once ran needed people in Washington who understood their needs and issues.\n\nRead More
Robinson signs autographs before the start of the Old Timers Game between the Angels and Dodgers at Anaheim Stadium in 1969. Three years later, he died of a heart attack at age 53. His legacy lives on in countless ways: His number has been retired by every baseball team, and Jackie Robinson Day is celebrated every April 15 in honor of his first day in the majors. Rachel Robinson founded the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which gives scholarships and leadership training to minority youths, in 1973.\n\nRobinson attends a meeting for Freedom Marchers in Williamston, North Carolina, in 1964. He was there to lend his name to the integration efforts in the city.\n\nJackie and Rachel Robinson had three children, from left: Jackie Jr., David and Sharon. They're shown at their home in Stamford, Connecticut, in 1962. Jackie Jr. died in a car accident in 1971 at age 24.\n\nRobinson retired after the 1956 season and became active in other pursuits. He became an executive for the Chock Full o'Nuts coffee company, spoke out on civil rights -- and occasionally popped up on television, as with this appearance with Ed Sullivan in 1962.\n\nRobinson was a terrific base runner, leading the National League twice in stolen bases and upsetting pitchers' rhythms on a regular basis. He also stole home 19 times in the regular season, and in the 1955 World Series, his steal of home in the eighth inning of Game 1 helped ignite Brooklyn to its only World Series victory (though they lost the game).\n\nRobinson played several positions for the Dodgers: mainly second base but also third base, first base and a little outfield. Here he leaps into the air in an attempt to make a double play as the Cubs' Hank Sauer slides into second in a 1952 game.\n\nDodgers shortstop and native Kentuckian Pee Wee Reese was a supporter of Robinson in the latter's first rough year in the majors, refusing to sign a petition from teammates for a boycott and -- according to some stories -- showing his solidarity by putting his arm around Robinson's shoulders. He became one of Robinson's best friends. The two are pictured in 1950 with their children, cooking soup.\n\nDodgers executive Branch Rickey eyed Robinson as the right man to break the color line and signed him to his first major league contract. The two are shown here in 1950.\n\nRobinson married Rachel in 1946. Through his years in baseball and afterward, she was his partner and sounding board, a steady companion when he was the subject of criticism and worse. She's still a vibrant presence at age 93.\n\nRobinson was born in Cairo, Georgia, but raised in Pasadena, California. He was a formidable athlete, lettering in four sports at UCLA and leading the nation in rushing as a football player. After a short stint in baseball's Negro Leagues, he signed a contract with the Dodgers organization and spent his first season with its Montreal Royals farm club. Here, he crosses home plate after hitting a three-run home run on Opening Day 1946.\n\nJackie Robinson, who broke the color line in Major League Baseball by becoming the sport's first modern-day black player, had a rich life beyond the game. No wonder: A life, he said, is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. Click through for a look at Robinson's life.\n\nStory highlights Jackie Robinson, a sweeping documentary about the baseball star, airs Monday and Tuesday The film shows echoes between Robinson's life and events of the present\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe story of Jackie Robinson isn't just the story of a pioneering baseball player.\n\nIt's also, says Ken Burns, a story that says much about race and America – as well as the complicated man at its center.\n\nRobinson is the subject of Jackie Robinson, a documentary from celebrated filmmaker Burns, his daughter Sarah Burns and her husband, David McMahon. It airs Monday and Tuesday on PBS.\n\nRobinson's life paralleled, and sometimes intersected with, events in the life of the country. He was born in the Jim Crow South, the son of sharecroppers and the grandson of a slave. He grew up in California, the state to which so many would migrate in the coming decades.\n\nHe served in the military – and fought its discrimination. He played in New York in the 1950s when it was the capital of baseball.\n\nHe was a Republican who attended the 1964 GOP convention but then supported Democrats as the political parties' makeup changed. He struggled with the social tumult of the 1960s, a conflict poignantly reflected in his relationship with his son, a Vietnam War veteran who overcame a drug problem only to die in a car accident. He had a rich and devoted marriage to his wife, Rachel, his partner and sounding board.\n\nIn other words, there's a much bigger picture than the one you'll find on a baseball card.\n\nThis is a multigenerational portrait of an African-American family, Burns said.\n\nHe added, In some ways, knowing the full, complex picture of Jackie gives you a greater perspective on what's going on today, from Trayvon Martin and Ferguson to the presidency and even the rollback of some of the essential liberties given to African-Americans in the mid-'60s that now seem to be in jeopardy.\n\nFire and competition\n\nThere are any number of stories in Jackie Robinson that echo events of our time.\n\nFor example, the image of Robinson entering the major leagues is of a man who kept his temper in check, engaging in the Christ-like gesture of turning the other cheek, in Burns' words. Certainly, he was encouraged to do so by Branch Rickey, the Dodgers executive who signed him, and Robinson did largely channel his aggression into his play.\n\nBut there was a great deal of anger underneath.\n\nIn one instance, as an officer stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, during World War II, Robinson was told to go to the back of a desegregated Army bus. He refused, the driver called the MPs, and Robinson was taken into custody. He was later booked on some trumped-up charges (though most were eventually dismissed) and court-martialed. He was acquitted, but the event left its mark.\n\nMoreover, as a black ballplayer, he was sometimes unfavorably compared with Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella, an easygoing sort praised by the press as much as the fiery Robinson was criticized. Robinson was accused of being a rabble-rouser and of insolence – terms that attempted to define him as an angry black man.\n\nI think if you understand the more complicated person – the sort of driven, competitive, impatient person who was asked to (break the color line) – you have an even greater appreciation of what it must have been like to withhold his response, Burns said.\n\nA love story\n\nThe documentary also puts Robinson's marriage to Rachel at the center. Rachel Robinson, now 93, is revelatory: a sharp, vibrant presence and guide.\n\nA really telling moment is when there's the discussion in the first episode about how smart he was in picking Rachel. And I think it's really true, that (if) there's no Rachel, then there's no Jackie, Burns said.\n\nRachel Robinson wasn't just an adoring wife, Burns observes. She sent back an engagement ring when she was unhappy with his behavior. She had her own job, as a nurse, and insisted that her husband stay active after his playing career ended.\n\nIn their dynamic, there are parallels with another couple Burns interviewed for the film: Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nThere's the President and first lady, another couple hurtling through time and space – seemingly a different time and space – but experiencing the same thing, Burns said. As the President said, it's really good to go home when people are giving you a lot of grief, not based on substance but on the color of the skin, and have somebody who's got your back.\n\nLegacy of a 'great American'\n\nRobinson died in 1972. He was 53 years old.\n\nIn the decades since, his legacy has been secured. Every April 15, Major League Baseball celebrates Jackie Robinson Day to honor the Hall of Famer. Every MLB team has retired No. 42, Robinson's uniform number. The Jackie Robinson Foundation – founded by Rachel – continues to award college scholarships and provide support services for worthy applicants. The movie 42 brought the story of Robinson's life to a wide audience. A Jackie Robinson Museum remains in the works.\n\nBut for all that, Jackie Robinson still finds new stories to tell.\n\nAfter all, Robinson isn't just the most important person in the history of baseball, Burns said.\n\nHe was, the documentarian added, one of the great Americans of all time.
London (CNN) When an American actress marries a prince, the world watches. And Meghan Markle , who is soon to wed Britain's Prince Harry , is not the first.\n\nOn April 4, 1956, hundreds of journalists gathered at New York's waterfront to catch a glimpse of Grace Kelly as the Oscar-winning actress boarded the ocean liner that would take her to Europe -- and to the man she was engaged to marry, Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.\n\nIt was the harbor's biggest shipside news conference in 30 years, writes Robert Lacey in his biography of Kelly. The whole country was mesmerized.\n\nThe couple's fairy-tale wedding two weeks later was broadcast to over 30 million television viewers in Europe alone, according to Lacey.\n\nMore than six decades on, a similar fairy tale is mesmerizing people around the world. Unlike Kelly, Markle will not officially become a princess, but to most, that hardly matters.\n\nLike Kelly, Markle is described as passionate and beautiful -- and a woman who knows what she wants.\n\nWhat else does she share with America's most famous princess bride?\n\nThe outsider\n\nMarkle, 36, is no stereotypical princess. She's American, divorced and biracial (she has an African-American mother, Doria Ragland, and a white father, Thomas Markle).\n\nShe grew up in Los Angeles, 2,700 miles from Kelly's home city of Philadelphia. But her school, Immaculate Heart High School, a Catholic school for girls, was just a short walk from the Hollywood studios that propelled Kelly to stardom.\n\nBoth acted from a young age and forged successful on-screen careers before crossing an ocean and entering an entirely new world.\n\nWhen Grace Kelly became Princess Grace, she put Monaco on the map, says royal historian Carolyn Harris.\n\nMeghan is an outsider (in the royal family), and I think that's only a good thing, says Anna Whitelock, royal historian at Royal Holloway, University of London. She has a unique perspective.\n\nKelly, who was just 26 when she married her prince, reportedly struggled to feel accepted by Monaco's high society, and some of its royals.\n\nGrace Kelly came up against the established traditions that existed in Monaco, says Carolyn Harris, royal historian and author of the book Raising Royalty.\n\nBoth as a foreigner and as an actress, she found she inadvertently offended people.\n\nIn contrast, Harris sees Britain's royals making a big effort to create a supportive atmosphere for their newest member.\n\nMarkle herself has spoken of the warm welcome she has received from Prince Harry's family.\n\nThe family has been great, she said in a joint interview with her fiancé , filmed and broadcast on the day they announced their engagement, adding that she was starting to feel a part of not just the institution but also part of the family.\n\nMarkle spent Christmas Day with the royals in 2017, unusual for someone who hasn't yet married into the family.\n\nHarris attributes this difference mostly to cultural shifts.\n\nThis marriage gives a sense of just how much social and cultural change has taken place over the course of Queen Elizabeth's life, says Harris. The royal family is now much more inclusive in terms of who can be a member.\n\nWhitelock believes Markle, as an outsider, can help push that process even further -- and likens her to Harry's mother, Princess Diana, in that regard.\n\nDiana held a mirror up to (the royal family). She forced them to change and modernize and look outwards. I think Meghan will also be a force for good.\n\nThe actress\n\nPrincess or actress -- take your choice, Lacey writes in his biography of Kelly. Grace could not be both.\n\nWhile Markle has not reached the same heights as Kelly -- who starred in 11 movies and won an Oscar for her performance in The Country Girl (1954) -- she has built a successful career as an actress, most notably starring as Rachel Zane in seven seasons of television drama Suits.\n\nMarkle played paralegal Rachel Zane in seven seasons of Suits from 2011 to 2018.\n\nBut for Markle, like Kelly, relinquishing that career was a step on the path to becoming a royal. While Kelly reportedly seemed reluctant to wholly give up her former life and later tried to return to acting, Markle has spoken positively of the shift.\n\nI don't see it as giving anything up, I just see it as a change, she said in the engagement interview. It's a new chapter.\n\nHarris says Markle's experience in the world of celebrity will help both her and the royal family in the transition process. She's used to being in the public eye and that's an asset for the royal family, she says.\n\nBut Meghan still faces a big transition, Whitelock says. She comes from a very different world -- a world of Hollywood and celebrity and acting, she says. There will need to be a pivot on her part from promotion of Meghan Markle to promotion of the monarchy and the royal family.\n\nKelly's performance in The Country Girl won her an Oscar for Best Actress in 1955.\n\nLacey's book suggests Kelly found that process a challenge. And, as Markle has also remarked, a headline-making career as an actress does not prepare a person for the scrutiny and press attention faced by a princess.\n\nAs naïve as it sounds now, I did not have any understanding of just what it would be like, Markle said in November, adding with a nod to her fiancé: I don't think either of us did.\n\nAs Harry's wife, Meghan will never be off the press radar -- especially if the couple start a family, as they say they intend to. They will have to try to strike a balance between public and private, says Harris. There will be tremendous public fascination if they have children.\n\nThe feminist\n\nTalking to Lacey, actress Rita Gram described Kelly as one of the first independent women in America... She left her home, she earned her own living, she made the bed.\n\nThe biography tells of a woman who sought to be self-sufficient and self-determining, a daunting prospect in 1950s America. While many battles for female independence have since been fought and (largely) won, Markle shows a similar disinclination to bow to patriarchal norms.\n\nShe's a mature, very independent, very articulate woman, says Whitelock, who notes that Markle spoke more than her fiancé in their engagement interview and showed great self-assurance. It's a partnership of equals.\n\nMarkle seems to have a strong sense of self, says Harris.\n\nMarkle has also been a vocal advocate for gender equality since childhood and in February declared her intention to hit the ground running with her work to empower girls and women across the UK.\n\nIndeed, with the passage of 60 years and the accompanying cultural shifts, Princess Meghan finds herself with far more freedom than Princess Grace, both as an individual woman and in her female advocacy projects.\n\nOf course, Kelly was marrying the monarch, while Markle will be wife to a man who is unlikely ever to be king (Harry is sixth in line to the throne). Markle can speak, dress and act more freely than her Philadelphian counterpart.\n\nGrace saw her royal duty as being the model corporate wife to her husband, wrote Lacey. And later: She was very good at smiling, at being dignified and stylish... But that, Grace now knew, was just about all that being a princess had to offer.\n\nPrincess Grace of Monaco and Prince Rainier III of Monaco meet the media during a trip to Atlantic City, five months after their wedding.\n\nWhile Markle will have scope to be far more than her husband's accessory, she does also face a raft of unavoidable new restrictions and protocols. Her entire life will be scheduled well in advance, says Harris. That reduces the scope for spontaneity.\n\nAnd what Markle can say -- and where -- is now much more limited. Her days of winning fans by documenting her life on a blog are over, Whitelock observes, adding that the act of closing down her lifestyle website The Tig last year is indicative of a bigger closing down.\n\nThe humanitarian\n\nLacey recounts how Kelly threw herself into charitable work in the years after her wedding, making frequent visits to Monaco's orphanages, hospitals and homes for the elderly, becoming president of Monaco's Red Cross and founding a charity that lobbied for the rights of children.\n\nFor decades, royals across the world have used their unique position to shine a spotlight on particular causes -- and the UK's young royals are no different. It's a role Markle is well prepared for.\n\nIn 2016 she became a global ambassador for World Vision and traveled to Rwanda to see the impact of the charity's clean-water initiatives. A year earlier, she was named the UN Women's Advocate for Political Participation and Leadership.\n\nWhitelock believes Markle is showing the right character for charitable work too. She's shown a real sense of ease with people. She doesn't have the kind of stuffiness or the nervousness of the other royals on their early outings... She will reach out to people.\n\nMarkle clearly connects with people, says Whitelock. On this occasion, she was meeting members of the public during a trip to Northern Ireland with Prince Harry.\n\nAnd while Kelly seemed to do most of her charitable work alone, Harry and Meghan are clearly planning a joint assault on the world's problems.\n\nIt was really one of the first things we connected on, Markle recalled in the engagement interview. One of the first things we started talking about when we met was just the different things we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change.\n\nThat's what got date two in the books, she added, smiling.\n\nAnd since date two, back in July 2016, the pair have had a lot of time to get to know each other, to become the fantastic team Harry says they are, and for Meghan to acclimatize to the reality of her new role.\n\nMarkle is entering this open-eyed, says Whitelock. She's coming to this as a very well-equipped princess.
(CNN) The shocking invasion of the US Capitol by a mob of supporters of US President Donald Trump is proof that the anger and frustration that divides America politically has reached a boiling point.\n\nWhile only a radical few may condone violence, disappointment and animosity over the outcome of the election -- fueled by false tales of election fraud -- is widespread among Trump supporters.\n\nThat bitterness could threaten relationships with family, friends, colleagues and loved ones, as many find themselves on opposite sides of a seemingly unbridgeable ideological chasm.\n\nIsn't there a way to communicate that allows both sides to be heard without further tearing these relationships apart?\n\nCNN put that question to experts before the November presidential election. The answer: absolutely. Here are 10 suggestions on how to de-escalate angry conversations and begin to bridge the gap.\n\nAsk yourself: Why am I doing this?\n\nIt's important to know why you want to reach out.\n\nIn terms of deciding whether or not you want to have a conversation with somebody across political lines, it is important to be aware of what your own motivations are, said Tania Israel, author of  Beyond Your Bubble: How to Connect Across the Political Divide: Skills and Strategies for Conversations That Work .\n\nIf your goal is to change the other person's mind in one conversation, you're going to be really disappointed, because you're not likely to be that effective, cautioned Vaile Wright, American Psychological Association's senior director of health care innovation.\n\nIt can help to keep your relationship with that other person top of mind, suggests Jacksonville, Florida, clinical psychologist Nina Silander, who has written about the lack of conservative views in the field of psychology\n\nThink about why it is you care about this person or why you like them or appreciate them, Silander said. That can soften your response and help you better articulate your perspective and lend credence to their viewpoint.\n\nDealing with 'fake facts'\n\nYou may find it difficult to acknowledge a perspective that you know to be based on disinformation. Entrenched views among certain age groups have become more common as people share exaggerated or falsified news via social media.\n\nLists of fake news sites are available, such as this one by Snopes or this tip sheet from Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, but shoving those in front of your friend or relative isn't likely to elicit a positive response.\n\nInstead, try to approach the issue by acknowledging the emotions of the person who has chosen to believe fake news, even as you gently discuss the facts.\n\nIt's clear that we need healthy and productive ways to engage across different opinions, but we should never have to accept false information. We can and should challenge non-factual statements. As we approach these engagements, it is more productive to not challenge each other's emotional reaction to a situation, said Caroline Hopper, managing director of the Citizenship & American Identity Program at The Aspen Institute, which oversees The Better Arguments Project along with The Allstate Corporation and educational nonprofit Facing History and Ourselves\n\nThe Better Arguments Project wants to teach us how to have more productive arguments. These conversations don't have to drive us apart, the group says. In fact, by learning to argue better, we can come together.\n\nWe need to be interacting within a realm of fact, but we also need to leave room for human emotion, feelings like hope and fear, which we know can absolutely steer discourse in this country just as much as facts can, Hopper added.\n\nFor example, a person should not challenge someone telling them: 'I am upset about the outcome of this election because it makes me feel afraid.' Rather, we should seek to understand more about why that opinion is held.\n\nTry curiosity first\n\nTo de-escalate ill will, avoid approaching the exchange with a list of talking points or facts in mind, experts suggest. Instead, you want to ask questions and truly understand the response.\n\nThe most important thing you can do is to listen to the other person, advised Israel, a professor in the department of counseling, clinical and school psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\nTo do that, enter the conversation with simple curiosity, she advised.\n\nBeing curious about where they're coming from and trying to understand where they're coming from helps set people's expectations (about the outcome of the talk) more appropriately, Israel said.\n\nBe prepared to listen, not talk\n\nTo do that, you may have to learn and practice some new (or rusty) skills, the type taught in marriage counseling, for example.\n\nRepeating back what you think you heard and asking questions are techniques known to elicit clarifications, as your loved one realizes either they misspoke or you misunderstood.\n\nMinimizing misunderstanding is incredibly important -- repeating back what we think we've heard, asking questions to clarify, looking and really striving for opportunities to share and find common ground can go a long way, Silander said.\n\nIt helps you to really listen if you know that you're going to need to summarize, Israel added. It's also going to help them to feel more understood, and that's going to help to create that connection and keep the entire conversation on a calmer level.\n\nGo a step further and acknowledge the other position, Silander suggests.\n\nTrying to understand someone else's position, or trying to see the world through their eyes is what we call in developmental psychology, 'theory of mind.' It's something we learn to do between four and five years of age -- understanding that other people can see things differently, Silander said.\n\nUsing I statements instead of you statements is another important way to facilitate dialogue, Wright said.\n\nUsing I statements to express how you feel may foster communication with someone with opposing political views.\n\nFor example, you could say 'I have a lot of concerns about this election, and how it might affect health care because I have a preexisting condition.' Keep it about you and your feelings and about the policies, not the people, Wright added.\n\nExperts CNN spoke to point out that these skills not only will help better our dialogue across political lines, but in our daily lives as well.\n\nThey're also going to help us to be better parents, better partners, better community members and coworkers, Wright said.\n\nBeware the minefield of human nature\n\nExpect to feel an emotional flare-up when you hear things you don't like. It's part of being human, an ancient and automatic reaction to any perceived threat to our well-being.\n\nIt turns out that our bodies don't necessarily know the difference between the saber-toothed tiger and a shocking news event or a heated conversation with another person, Israel said.\n\nOur sympathetic nervous system goes into action when we perceive a threat, flooding the body with adrenaline and other stress hormones. Key signs of that reaction can be a racing heart, tense muscles, even a flushed face.\n\nWe are ready to fight or to run away from the threat, Israel said.\n\nSuch reactions to politics can even harm our health, research has found.\n\nThe hospitalization rate for heart attack and stroke in a major California health system was 1.62 times higher in the two days immediately after the 2016 presidential election than the same two days the week before, a study released in late October said.\n\nThis is a wake-up call, said study author David Williams, chair of the department of social and behavioral sciences and a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in a statement.\n\nWe need to pay greater attention to the ways in which stress linked to political campaigns, rhetoric and election outcomes can directly harm health.\n\nGround yourself\n\nIt's possible to interrupt our natural tendency to become stressed and anxious by using grounding techniques as soon as we feel ourselves tensing, psychologists say.\n\n'We can do deep breathing, Israel said. We can physically ground ourselves by noticing the feeling of the chair underneath us or by touching our own arm and paying attention to that.\n\nSet yourself up for success by making sure you're in top mental shape for the conversation, Wright suggests.\n\nIt's not great to have these conversations at the end of a long, hard day, or when people have been drinking or a situation where you're not as emotionally in control as as you'd like to be, she warned.\n\nBeware of tribal urges\n\nIt's natural for people to want to be in groups with similar viewpoints, or to find our tribe, experts say.\n\nDuring an election year, we can become rather tribal, and that can be inflamed by media, it can be flamed by special interest groups, and it caters to our own human nature, Silander said.\n\nThe people media choose for spokespeople usually are more extreme in their views, but it's also our basic psychology that we tend to have these distorted perceptions of people who we see as being different from ourselves, Israel said.\n\nThis instinctual feeling of us versus them intensifies with divisive rhetoric, Wright said, which can lead us to label people in ways that make it difficult to find common ground.\n\nIt isn't just that you and I have differences on how the educational system should run, Wright said. It becomes 'You don't care about teachers, you don't care about kids.' It becomes not about the issue, but about you as a person and your values.\n\nTry to find common ground\n\nTo combat that, Silander suggests learning about the fundamental value differences between liberals and conservatives in an objective and considerate way.\n\nIt really enables us to better understand and empathize with one another, Silander said. And we can start to see that maybe we often share concerns that are more similar in nature than we would have thought, even if we disagree with what solutions to those concerns would look like.\n\nAs an example, Silander points to civil rights issues as a way for liberals to try to understand why some conservatives believe mandates to wear masks are an infringement on personal liberties.\n\nThe underlying theme or principle can at least be one way to relate even if we disagree, she said.\n\nJoin a group and practice\n\nPractice makes perfect, as they say. Over the last four years, groups of people dedicated to bringing political opposites together have sprung up around the country.\n\nJoining a training -- such as those offered by The Better Arguments Project -- can jump-start your skills for that all-important talk with a loved one.\n\nThe concept of a better argument is really all about caring more about one another than we do about our opinion on a specific subject, Hopper said.\n\nIf we politely ignore our differences -- especially with those closest to us -- we are giving up our public discourse, our family discourse, to the voices that are the most polarized, she said.\n\nWe're not going to be able to seek any kind of informed solutions together because we're not getting the full scope of information that we need, she added.\n\nBe human first\n\nTo have a better argument, one has to care about the other person, not just their opinion about the issue.\n\nWe ask participants to 'be human first.' What we mean by that is you shouldn't only engage with each other about your opinions; share more about yourself and seek to learn more about the person with whom you are engaging, Hopper said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOtherwise, you will only see one another only as opponents, rather than as people representing very full lives and experiences that are shaping those opinions, she said. The priority is to walk away from that interaction caring more about that other person than about whether or not you won that argument -- be human first.\n\nThis also means that you have a right to expect that your own humanity should be acknowledged and respected. There is no room for hate and bigotry in a 'better argument.'\n\nThis story is updated from a story that originally published on November 4, 2020.
(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday.\n\nPolygamist Warren Jeffs is facing eight additional counts related to alleged incest and sexual contact with a minor.\n\nA grand jury indicted Jeffs May 10 on two counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of incest for alleged incidents that occurred in 2002, according to a statement issued by Mohave County Attorney Matthew J. Smith.\n\nOn Thursday, another grand jury indicted him on two additional counts of sexual conduct with a minor and two additional counts of incest. Those offenses took place in Colorado City, Arizona, in 2003, according to the indictment.\n\nBoth indictments state that Jeffs, leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS), committed the offenses as an accomplice.\n\nAccording to Arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a Class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison. Incest is a class 4 felony punishable upon conviction by up to 2½ years in prison.\n\nThe cases involve two separate victims, Smith said in the statement. Mr. Jeffs will not come to Mohave County to face these charges or to have an initial appearance on them until his Utah case is resolved.\n\nJeffs, 51, is awaiting trial in Washington County, Utah, on a charge of being an accomplice to rape by arranging the marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old cousin.\n\nThe trial initially was set to begin in April, but Fifth District Judge James Shumate postponed it earlier this year, and a new date has not been set. At the time, Shumate said the delay was due to recent information in the case, but he did not elaborate.\n\nThe judge in March refused a defense request to move the trial out of Washington County because of press coverage, but he said he may reconsider if attorneys encounter difficulty during jury selection.\n\nUtah prosecutors say that because Jeffs forced the underage girl to marry, and therefore forced her to have sex with the adult man, and because Jeffs insisted she stay married, he is an accomplice to rape.\n\nDuring his preliminary hearing in December, Jeffs' defense attorneys said that he never knew whether the marriage he arranged was consummated and, if it was, whether the sex was consensual.\n\nThe girl, identified only as Jane Doe, testified at the preliminary hearing that she was so scared during the forced wedding.\n\nThe whole time I was crying, she said. I wanted to die.\n\nThe rape as an accomplice charge is a first-degree felony in Utah, carrying a penalty upon conviction of five years to life in prison.\n\nJeffs previously was charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional charge of conspiracy.\n\nThose charges, from 2005, were put on hold while Jeffs faces trial in Utah.\n\nJeffs was captured August 28, 2006, in a traffic stop near Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time, he had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for months.\n\nThe FLDS freely practices polygamy in the towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona, which straddle the state line. The sect maintains groups of followers in Texas, South Dakota, Nevada, British Columbia and Mexico.\n\nThe offshoot sect broke from the mainline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, over the practice of polygamy.\n\nThe Mormon church, which gave up plural marriage more than a century ago, has no ties to Jeffs' group.

Kamala Harris announced that she will run for president in 2020. Almost immediately, headlines appeared declaring her the female Barack Obama. Like many other prominent women, she is – wrongly and inaccurately to boot – best known as a derivative of a more-famous predecessor.\n\nPHOTO: Holly Thomas Holly Thomas\n\nThere are similarities between Harris and Obama, to be sure. Both are Democrats, both have a background in law, both have a mixed-race background. There is an obvious convenience to the comparison. It neatly captures the public imagination at a time when Harris is yet to be world famous, but is charismatic, on the rise and prepared to challenge President Donald Trump, while Obama's name continues to conjure a nostalgic, anti-Trump emotion.\n\nIt makes superficial sense. But it's also symptomatic of a lazy habit that infantilizes high-profile women in America and abroad, and skims over the personal details and unique circumstances that shaped them.\n\nKamala Harris is the first Indian-American woman to have a seat in the US Senate. She was also the first woman, black, Indian-American or South Asian, to serve as district attorney of San Francisco, and as California's attorney general. The most famous instance of public sexism she faced before announcing her presidential bid occurred in 2013, when none other than Barack Obama called her the best-looking attorney general. Obama later apologized to Harris after the remark was widely criticized (rightly) as sexist.\n\nThe two are very different political beings. Obama, with some liberal moves such as reduced sentences for drug offenses aside, did not make prison reform a priority, and was against mass incarceration. But the prison system is a subject close to Harris' heart.\n\nDespite personal reservations, she promised to defend the death penalty in California as attorney general, and proved herself an often harsh prosecutor, favoring long periods of imprisonment. In other areas, Harris has positioned herself further to the left than the former President. Those only aware of her overlap with Obama might make assumptions about her attitudes elsewhere, which would turn out to be untrue.\n\nHarris is far from the only female politician to receive this media treatment – and that treatment isn't always limited to comparisons to more famous men (though admittedly that's overwhelmingly the case when it comes to world leaders).\n\nTake Theresa May. Coverage of the British Prime Minister is regularly peppered with references to Margaret Thatcher. Throughout her negotiations over the Brexit deal in Brussels, Belgium, in December, newspapers referred to May's handbag-wielding Maggie moments – Thatcher's handbag being the mythical weapon with which she would supposedly clobber her opposition.\n\nConsidering Margaret Thatcher was in favor of Europe, fought for Britain's interests within the EU, and for Britain to strengthen its position as a member of the EU, this likeness is especially ironic.\n\nTheresa May's Brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause – leaving the EU – she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. Her predecessor David Cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null EU reform deal in 2016 was far more Thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). Coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him Maggie – or indeed, refer to other male PMs who went before him. When he acted in his own name, he was treated as such.\n\nThe fudging of political personalities can be derogatory in both directions, depending on individual sympathies. When Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer succeeded Angela Merkel as leader of Germany's Christian Democratic Union last year, she noted the commentary describing her as a mini Merkel, or Merkel 2.0.\n\nI have read a lot about what I am and who I am, she told her party. Mini, a copy, simply 'more of the same.' Dear delegates, I stand before you as I am and as life made me, and I am proud of that.\n\nThe attention paid to Kramp-Karrenbauer's likeness to Merkel distracts from the future implications of her attitudes for the country, and indeed, Europe at large. Kramp-Karrenbauer is extremely conservative on same-sex marriage, and has likened it to incest in the past. Her stance on migration is also vastly stricter than Merkel's, and she has made it clear she is keen to dial down the more liberal attitude exhibited by the party in the last decade.\n\nWhile Merkel's political career was catalyzed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, Kramp-Karrenbauer's has been forged in the wake of Merkel's. That by definition gives her an adapted frame of reference, which merits its own scrutiny.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nEvery politician – every person – is a product of their own time and place. In the coming months, it looks quite possible that Kamala Harris might win Obama's endorsement of her bid for president.\n\nIf she does, the comparisons between the two are likely to reignite. As with May and Kramp-Karrenbauer, those watching would do better to pay attention to the political landscape Harris is working within now, rather than any nostalgic connotations. The president whose footsteps are most pertinent to Harris, the president who she will be measured against should she prevail against her fellow Democratic candidates, is Donald Trump.\n\nIf she finds herself competing with him, the very least Harris deserves, the very least the voting public deserves, is to be judged as an adult in her own right, running under her own name.
(CNN) Internal rifts in both political parties are threatening to derail an effort to renew a set of powerful surveillance tools prized by law enforcement ahead of their expiration next month.\n\nWhite House officials are aligning with GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio against Attorney General Bill Barr and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, over the best legislative strategy to renew the authorities. Divisions among House Democrats caused an abrupt decision to scrap a key committee vote on Wednesday. And a number of influential Democrats, including House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, stiffened their opposition to Barr's and Graham's call for a quick extension of the authorities to avoid a lapse in the surveillance law.\n\nThe growing divisions over both the policy and the legislative strategy are raising the prospects that Congress might not reach a deal by a critical March 15 deadline when the authorities are set to expire.\n\nJordan, after meeting with White House officials on Wednesday about the matter, told CNN that he differed with Barr's strategy of a straight extension, arguing changes must be made now to the law.\n\nI think Barr has done a great job as attorney general, but I don't think we can do a clean reauthorization, Jordan said.\n\nAt issue is a trio of expiring authorities of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA, that have been caught in a proxy fight over the future of the wider national security wiretap program in the wake of cutting criticism from the Justice Department's inspector general over the bureau's use of FISA in the Russia investigation. The House Judiciary Committee had been set to hold a hearing Wednesday afternoon to review legislation that would extend the authorization of some of the expiring provisions while also adding in limited reforms, but the hearing was canceled after a last-minute move by a Democratic lawmaker to propose more radical changes.\n\nThis week Senate Republicans seemed to be coalescing around their own strategy -- a clean reauthorization of the provisions followed by broader reform down the line -- further complicating the environment in which lawmakers are acting.\n\nPartisans on both sides of the aisle had dug into their opposition of the bill ahead of the House Judiciary Committee hearing. Rep. Zoe Lofgren , a Democrat from California, had said she wanted to add amendments to the legislation that would inject more civil liberties protections, and Georgia Rep. Doug Collins , the committee's top Republican, had said on Tuesday that the proposal failed to protect American citizens -- including future presidents and presidential campaigns -- from unlawful spying.\n\nAfter the committee vote was postponed, Collins slammed the Democrats in a statement for stall tactics.\n\nDemocrats are yet again putting our national security at risk with their stall tactics, Collins said. Critical counterterrorism provisions are hanging in the balance because Democrats chose to delay an already ill-timed markup.\n\nCollins and Jordan are among a group of House Republicans who have clamored for even more sweeping changes to the broader FISA system after the Justice Department inspector general reported in December that the FBI had made a series of errors as they sought to wiretap Carter Page , a former Trump campaign adviser.\n\nReform of the secretive surveillance court where national security officials obtain wiretaps in terrorism and espionage cases has long been a goal of civil liberties groups like the ACLU. The addition of conservative lawmakers inspired by the inspector general report and the President's criticism of the FBI has created an unusual marriage amid the current debate.\n\nThe surveillance bill that had been set to be marked up before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday afternoon had been crafted over months of careful negotiation with the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, House leadership and outside civil liberties groups like the ACLU, but was scrapped at the last minute after Lofgren said she planned to introduce a group of amendments that were seen as making the legislation's eventual passage untenable, a committee aide said.\n\nThe committee aide said Lofgren's office had been included early on as the bill was being written, but after this report was published Wednesday, Lofgren denied that in an interview, saying her office had not been part of the negotiation process, had only been shown the text of the bill earlier this month and had expressed around that time that they were interested in making amendments.\n\nSome of the reform provisions from a bipartisan reauthorization bill Lofgren had co-sponsored in January were included in the bill eventually put forward by the Judiciary Committee, though Lofgren had wanted deeper reform, like the expansion of the role of an outside attorney to challenge the government's evidence before the FISA court.\n\nThey're simple things to protect the civil rights of Americans. There's no poison pill in there. If the Constitution is a poison pill we've got bigger problems, Lofgren said.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Lofgren told committee leadership that she would be introducing the amendments, the aide said. Nadler decided to scrap the markup Wednesday afternoon after consulting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who leads the Intelligence Committee, the aide said.\n\nThe Republican fracture on the issue appears to have reached the White House, where influential factions have been pushing the divergent strategies. A number of House conservatives met earlier Wednesday with Jared Kushner and White House counsel Pat Cipollone on the FISA fight, two sources familiar with the situation told CNN.\n\nAfter the meeting, Jordan, who's close to the President and set to take over GOP leadership of the House Judiciary Committee with Collins running for the Senate , told CNN that he didn't support simply passing a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions and saving the structural reform for a future date.\n\n(DOJ Inspector General Michael) Horowitz just told us that (the FBI) lied to the FISA court 17 times -- 51 mistakes that they made in the whole process, 17 misstatements, omissions, better known as lies, in the Carter Page FISA, Jordan said. So we have to reform. There are some good reforms I think we can do.\n\nSchiff is also resisting a clean reauthorization of the expiring provisions, according to a committee official.\n\nNo, Nadler said Wednesday when asked if he would back a straight extension of the three expiring provisions.\n\nAmong the committee's rank-and-file members, feelings about the bill were even further mixed.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, suggested in an interview that she would be fine with letting the three FISA provisions lapse, though she added the committee was working to find an agreement with significant reforms that would make it palatable to a wider group of lawmakers.\n\nI'm one of those individuals probably that reflects concerns that society has, which is privacy, how much power do we give government and at what expense do we have additional security, said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat who sits on the committee and was supportive of changes to the bill that was set to be voted on during the Wednesday meeting.\n\nOn Tuesday, Barr was on the Hill to lobby for his own plan for the surveillance reform. In a closed-door meeting, Barr urged GOP senators to extend the expiring provisions while he takes steps within the Justice Department to begin reforming elements of the law administratively, according to several senators and a senior Justice Department official.\n\nBarr also indicated that Congress could work on broader reforms to be enacted at a later time, and said he supported the effort by Graham to hold hearings on the issue in future weeks, the senators said.\n\nBarr told the lawmakers that his approach had the support of the National Security Council, the intelligence community and the FBI, although he acknowledged that there are differing opinions within the White House, including at the Domestic Policy Council, the DOJ official said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas warned Nadler that it would be a mistake to block a clean extension of the expiring provisions.\n\nI don't know if he wants to be responsible for the expiration of some essential tools for anti-terrorism investigations, said Cornyn, a member of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees. I would be surprised if he wants to bare that responsibility but I think that's where we are right now.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments including comments from Rep. Zoe Lofgren.
Two women in northeastern Nepal on their way to see doctors, on May 14, 2015, after earthquakes killed over 8,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless .\n\nStory highlights Child trafficking often increases after natural disasters such as earthquakes The disruption of institutions means the usual child protection systems aren't in place, writes Anna Childs Exploitation of trafficked children can take many forms -- forced prostitution, labor, marriage, militia and more\n\nEditor's Note: Anna Childs is academic director for International Development at The Open University. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nWhen a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal in April 2015, it killed well over 8,000 people and turned much of the country into a disaster zone.\n\n17 days later, as recovery operations were getting established, a 7.3 magnitude quake caused further destruction.\n\nIn the desolation, chaos and widespread panic that followed, a surge in child trafficking was inevitable. Just as it was after the 2004 tsunami in southern Asia, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2011 drought in Horn of Africa, the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines, and many other natural disasters besides.\n\nSo why do these disasters make children so vulnerable to trafficking – and what can be done about it?\n\nUNICEF defines child trafficking as the act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation either within or outside a country.\n\nThe exploitation of trafficked children can take many forms – forced prostitution, labor, marriage, militia, domestic servitude and more – but nearly always means dirty and dangerous work for little or no pay, often involving sexual abuse and enforcement through threat and violence.\n\nAccording to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the most common form of human trafficking (79%) is trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation.\n\nIt's difficult to get accurate and current statistics on trafficking because generally only those survivors who are identified and rescued can be counted, and there is no single monitoring organization.\n\nPHOTO: NOEL CELIS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Children swim on a flooded street in Manila on September 23, 2013, after monsoon rains and Typhoon Usagi caused floods and landslides.\n\nIn 2001 the International Labour Organization estimated that worldwide there are some 2.5 million people who have been trafficked. The UNODC suggests that an average 20% of these are children, with a much higher fraction in many developing countries and regions.\n\nPoverty plus disaster\n\nIn Nepal, as in other developing countries, birth registration is poorly enforced, making children difficult or impossible to track in any system.\n\nPeople living with poverty are especially vulnerable to the false promise of a better future, and in an economy that depends heavily on dividends from migrating workers, desperation can lead people to consider risky opportunities.\n\nFamilies are often enticed by the offer of well-paid work for their child in another region or country.\n\nThey may even be given an advance against the child's anticipated earnings, and trafficked children hope to improve their lives and send money back to their families. But when they arrive at their destination, they find that the situation is very different.\n\nIn most poor societies, it's the girls who are more readily taken out of school (or never sent in the first place). Parents may believe that education is wasted on a girl whose destiny is to marry and leave home.\n\nThat leaves them open to persuasion that the opportunity to go away and gain life experience is in their daughter's best interests. Girls – especially those with disabilities or from ethnic minorities or certain castes – are therefore particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\n\nA 2001 estimate suggested that 12,000 girls are trafficked from Nepal to India annually for prostitution, a horror highlighted in the book and movie Sold.\n\nThis number took no account of any other trafficking from or within Nepal. Current estimates put the annual total at around 20,000.\n\nVulnerability amplified\n\nIt's easy to see how a natural disaster can amplify the conditions that enable and attract traffickers. The immediate disruption of state and civil society institutions, particularly schools, means the usual child protection systems aren't in place. Regulatory mechanisms and border controls are also in chaos.\n\nUnder the cover of rescue efforts, traffickers (often women) can pose as religious leaders, relief workers or representatives of government-accredited employment agencies promising jobs. Sometimes these tricks are mere opportunism, but sometimes they are the well-organized work of national and transnational criminal groups.\n\nPHOTO: Handout/Getty Images South America/Getty Images A mother shelters her children from the sun in a tent city in the commune of Cite Soleil after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010.\n\nThe people they exploit are extremely vulnerable. With family breadwinners killed or injured, land and livelihoods destroyed and food and shelter hard to come by, people are more inclined than ever to take desperate actions.\n\nChildren separated from their families may be believed missing or dead. The assumption, genuine or otherwise, that a child is an orphan makes them especially vulnerable. Sadly some families even send their children to orphanages because they can't afford to care for them.\n\nThese orphans may be trafficked directly or otherwise subjected to illegal adoption, sold to well-intentioned families from richer nations.\n\nThis typical story from Nepal tells of seven children who have disappeared from a small village. Their parents believed they were sending them to a Buddhist monastery in India:\n\nWe had to lie to police so that my son could leave the village with the Lamas, said a parent of one of the children. We are happy because the Lamas had promised to educate my son and send him home after three years.\n\nNone of these children have been heard of since their departure shortly after the quakes, and their location remains unknown.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nLess than two months after the Nepal quakes, UNICEF reported that 245 children had been intercepted and saved from trafficking. That number has shocking implications for how many might not have been so lucky. Dr Tshering Lama of ChildReach Nepal recently estimated that hundreds if not thousands of children will have been trafficked as a direct result of conditions caused by the earthquakes.\n\nIn the direct aftermath, UNICEF worked in collaboration with the Nepali government on a range of responsive and preventative measures, and with civil society and a number of national and international NGOs to prioritize getting children back into school as quickly as possible.\n\nA fundamental strategy to fighting child trafficking in Nepal is to keep children in schools, protecting their right to education and a safe environment.\n\nCampaigns such as Taught Not Trafficked, working in partnership with survivors' group Shakti Samuha, promote crucial awareness and have been providing education, shelter, legal aid, vocational training and counseling before, during and after the period of the quakes.\n\nBut more than that, it's essential that child trafficking everywhere is not treated as a symptom of crisis during times of natural disasters.\n\nIt must be recognized as a scourge that requires coordinated international action, including advocacy and awareness integrated across all programs that work with vulnerable children and their families and communities. In this way, agencies will be prepared to respond quickly and effectively when – not if – the next disaster strikes.
(CNN) A Jewish shopkeeper standing proudly outside his store, a wry smile on his face and an Iron Cross pinned to his lapel.\n\nJust a meter away is a Nazi guard.\n\nIt is an notorious image of the Nazi era, replicated in museums and institutions across Germany.\n\nUntil now little was known about the man photographed outside his Cologne bedding store on April 1, 1933 -- the day the Nazis launched a boycott of Jewish businesses.\n\nThe boycott saw guards stand outside Jewish shops in a bid to deter customers from entering. Many stores were subsequently vandalized.\n\nAs many countries around the world commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day on Monday, the incredible story of one Jewish shopkeeper, whose defiant picture has been shown around the globe, has been uncovered by researchers at genealogy site MyHeritage\n\nHis name was Richard Stern.\n\nIf you look closely it seems the Nazi party agent feels uncomfortable, Eike Stegen, a historian at the House of the Wannsee Conference, told CNN.\n\nYou realize that he is wearing a fantasy uniform -- he has never been to war, while the soldier in the picture is the Jewish German who is proudly showing his Iron Cross.\n\nThe power is with the soldier from the First World War.\n\nThe Iron Cross, once a military decoration, was considered a top honor in Germany during both world wars.\n\nStern's fight against his oppressors went even further than this image. He would later receive another award for his outstanding military contribution -- this time from the US army in World War II.\n\nRichard Stern earned the prestigious Iron Cross for his distinguished service during World War I.\n\nThe photo of defiance\n\nResearchers at MyHeritage uncovered a wealth of information about the German Jew who earned the prestigious Iron Cross for his distinguished service during World War I.\n\nThey sifted through hundreds of online documents to uncover his incredible story.\n\nResearcher Nitay Elboym told CNN that he and his team became interested in the 1933 photo after seeing the image online and learning that it hangs in the House of the Wannsee Conference, at which the Nazis devised the Final Solution, which the Nazis used to describe their genocide of Jews in Europe.\n\nIt's his body language that got our attention, Elboym said. Not only is he standing there with the Iron Cross on, but the look on his face says 'I was a German hero in World War One, I'm wearing the medal that you gave me, so how dare you do this?'\n\nJack Romberg, a Florida-based rabbi, is the grandson of Stern's sister Martha.\n\nThe eldest of three brothers, Romberg recalls his quiet relative with affection. Now retired, the 65-year-old is writing a book about his great uncle, whom he says was more like his grandfather.\n\nRomberg was able to shed light on the 1933 photo, which is also on display at Berlin's Jewish Museum as well as the city's German Historical Museum, the NS Documentation Center in Cologne and the nearby Roonstrasse Synagogue.\n\nAt Wannsee and the Jewish Museum in Berlin, the picture is displayed alongside a pamphlet written by Stern.\n\nJUST WATCHED Drone video shows scale of Auschwitz camp Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Drone video shows scale of Auschwitz camp 01:12\n\nAccording to Romberg, Stern's brother-in-law Heinz Flögerhöver produced the leaflets in his print shop next door, distributed them to passers-by and took the photo. The shop was forced to close following Kristallnacht in 1938. This rampage of state-sponsored violence by the Nazi regime against Jewish communities caused widespread looting and destruction of Jewish properties across Germany and Austria.\n\nAddressed to all front comrades and Germans, the document states that Hitler and the Nazis repeatedly declared: Anyone insulting a combat veteran is punishable by imprisonment!\n\nStern said in the pamphlet that he had enlisted as a teenager and served during World War I.\n\nHis brother and father also served. Taking a stand against the boycott, he wrote: Has the German Jew become a second class human, only tolerated as a guest in his fatherland?\n\nWe see this action against German Judaism as an insult to the memory of 12,000 German combat soldiers of the Jewish faith killed in action.\n\nIn 2012, Romberg visited the Jewish Museum in Berlin and was taken aback by what he saw.\n\nTheir version of the photo is huge and the picture of the leaflet is very close. I stood there and I couldn't stop staring at it even though the same picture hangs in my office. I couldn't say anything -- it was unbelievable.\n\nOn his most recent visit to Germany in September, Romberg met with archivists at the various museums and institutions.\n\nThey were shocked that they'd met a living relative of Richard Stern -- it blew them away, he said.\n\nStegen told CNN that Stern's image features in the House of the Wannsee Conference's permanent exhibition, The Meeting at Wannsee and the Murder of the European Jews.\n\nThat is why we portray Richard Stern. He does not 'simply' suffer from persecution, he is not merely a victim of discrimination, hatred, racism, but he acts, Stegen said.\n\nTwo World War medals, given either side of the Atlantic\n\nRecords unearthed by MyHeritage show that Stern left Germany and arrived at Ellis Island, New York, aged 40 in May 1939 -- just four months before war broke out. It stated that the first person he met up with in the US was his brother-in-law Ludwig Walker.\n\nThe research carried out by MyHeritage did not uncover a wife or children. Romberg explained that the reason was because in 1927 Stern had promised his dying father that he would look after his sister Martha, whose marriage had broken down, and her son Rudolf.\n\nStern became the boy's legal guardian and worked to guarantee their safe passage to America, together with his own. But problems with Martha's paperwork delayed their escape until the very end of August -- just days before war broke out.\n\nA census the following year revealed that Stern was working as a bus boy and lived in Queens with two of his sisters, Walker, a niece and a nephew.\n\nOn October 13, 1942 -- less than a year after America joined the war -- Stern enlisted in the US army.\n\nThen on October 13, 1942 -- less than a year after America joined the war -- Stern enlisted in the US army.\n\nHe was aged 43 and still not a citizen.\n\nScott Daubert, director of the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia, told CNN that a German national being recruited by the US at the time would have been quite rare but that soldiers were sometimes recruited for their language skills.\n\nBeing a non-citizen and German would have certainly raised an eyebrow or two, but there would have been many questions early on in the training stage to gauge loyalty, Daubert said.\n\nIn 1944 Stern was awarded the Silver Star, which is the third-highest military combat decoration that can be awarded to a member of the US armed forces.\n\nMyHeritage researchers discovered a newspaper clipping from July 6, 1944, detailing Stern's service in Italy.\n\nThe Long Island Star-Journal reported: The victim of German brutality, 45-year-old Sergeant Richard F. Stern, earned the Silver Star for gallantry in action during an assault Jan. 7 on the slopes of Mount Porchio when in the face of heavy enemy fire he addressed the Germans in their own tongue and demanded that they surrender, convincing them they were hopelessly outnumbered.\n\nToday, the medal holds pride of place in Romberg's home, alongside a treasure trove of documents and letters from Stern.\n\nWhen I was about seven my dad told me the story of Uncle Richard and what he did in World War II, so that summer I went running in to the house and said 'Uncle Richard can I see the Silver Star?' It was in a box at the bottom of a drawer in a back bedroom, Romberg told CNN.\n\nThe Iron Cross, however, is missing.\n\nRomberg told CNN: In 1942 the USA were collecting metal to melt down and make into ammunition.\n\nSo Uncle Richard turned it in to create bullets to shoot the Nazis. He made it very clear in January 1942 that he had to enter the US army. He was 43 but determined to do it.\n\nMonday, January 27, 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.

Stimulus\n\nMillions of Americans stand to lose their unemployment benefits in less than a month, meaning the pressure is on for Congress to reach an agreement on President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic rescue proposal . Despite Biden's hopes for a bipartisan deal , a process is underway that would allow Democrats to pass the bill through the Senate with just 51 votes. The House is on track to pass their portion of the proposal as soon as next week. But the bill could face a tougher time in the Senate. Progressive and moderate Democrats there will have to settle a series of philosophical debates over its scope, including whether they are willing to spend $1.9 trillion and whether they want to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour as part of the bill.\n\n2.

The footage also highlights the restraint of police at the scene, and suggests the riot could have been deadlier had officers acted more aggressively. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced plans for a commission to investigate the riot, similar to the one that examined the 9/11 terror attacks. But some of the extremists who entered the Capitol that day are carrying on as before.

That's especially good news, as more evidence suggests that the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK is linked to more severe disease . The UK's success comes as new research from Israel finds that the Pfizer-Biotech vaccine appears to reduce symptomatic coronavirus infections by more than 90%.

(Health.com) -- Lana, a 38 year-old publicist in Los Angeles, California, was diagnosed with genital herpes in 1997.\n\nSince then, she has kind of been hiding from the dating scene.\n\nLet's face it: How do you drop that bomb on a potential love interest? And when?\n\nShe considered a number of online dating venues, but she says Match.com asked too many questions on its enrollment form, eHarmony was too religious, and MySpace was too much of a hookup zone.\n\nI wanted to meet men with my same diagnosis so we wouldn't [need to] have 'the talk,' or fear of rejection and transmitting, she says. Most of us with this don't wish to spread it.\n\nDespite -- or perhaps because of -- the economic downturn, the billion-dollar online dating industry has been booming. But not everyone has felt welcome at the party.\n\nWhile sites like Match.com and eHarmony don't discriminate, they also don't cater to people like Lana who are coping with sexually transmitted diseases, disabilities, or mental health conditions. All of these can make dating -- often an ego-shattering minefield for those in perfect health -- even trickier.\n\nOn bigger dating sites the competition is tremendous, says Jim Houran, PhD, a clinical psychologist and columnist for Online Dating Magazine. And let's face it, depending on what [the illness] is, it could very well make you uncompetitive in the larger dating pool.\n\nHealth.com: 28 days to a healthier relationship\n\nFortunately, there are a number of alternatives. A new breed of dating sites has emerged to play cupid for people with chronic diseases and disabilities.\n\nOver the past five years, several sites -- such as Prescription4love.com, Nolongerlonely.com, and Cisforcupid.com -- have launched to serve the needs of people with conditions ranging from bipolar disorder to Crohn's disease. Together these sites now boast tens of thousands of members.\n\nIn addition to providing their users with a more hospitable environment, these websites defuse the tension over how and when to disclose an illness, which is often an issue for people with diseases and disabilities who venture onto mainstream dating sites.\n\nWhen health problems equal heartache\n\nAfter some horrible results on other dating websites, Lana joined Prescription 4 Love and the STD-specific site Positivesingles.com.\n\nBoth sites require members to disclose their illnesses upfront, clearing the air for what might be a deal-breaking revelation later. Within her first week on Positive Singles, she went on three dates and has since gone on seven more, which fostered one romantic relationship and a friendship over the past two years. She's even rejected a couple dozen guys.\n\nHealth.com: How to tell your partner a health secret\n\nI don't think I would have been able to have 10 dates without the site, says Lana. It's easier to get rejected via email, and you can take baby steps online without hunting outside.\n\nThough Prescription 4 Love didn't yield any dates for Lana, this fast-growing online community offers an alternative to mainstream dating sites for thousands of singles.\n\nNow three years old, the site currently has 8,000 members who represent nearly 40 health conditions ranging from genital herpes (2,425 members) to Tourette's syndrome (32 members).\n\nRicky Durham founded Prescription 4 Love in 2006, inspired by his late brother Keith, who lived with Crohn's disease for 15 years before passing away in 2004.\n\nHe was a good-looking boy, and he could find dates, but when do you tell someone you have a colostomy bag? The night you go out? Two weeks after you go out? Durham asks. He was having a hard time with that, so I thought if he could find someone who had the same disease, or someone with a colostomy bag, he wouldn't really have to discuss that.\n\nSince launching the site, Durham, 48, who previously dabbled in the stock market and worked as a bartender, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Though he doesn't find it appropriate to be a member of a community he founded, he says he can empathize with his members.\n\nIt's nice to find someone who's going through what you're going through, he says.\n\nLove for less\n\nNiche sites are also a lot less expensive. Prescription 4 Love, which started charging in May 2009, is $9.95 per month, while most of the features on No Longer Lonely (including the dating service and chat rooms) are still free.\n\n(Access to the site's full features is available for $24 per year. That's substantially cheaper than sites like Match.com and eHarmony, which can cost upwards of $35 per month.)\n\nTo me, that's pressure right there, says Robert Watson, the executive director of the nonprofit dating service DateAble.org, which caters primarily to those with physical and mild psychiatric handicaps. If it's the 30th day of the month, you're thinking, 'I've got one more day to find someone or it's another $35.'\n\nDateAble, which was founded in 1987 by a Washington, D.C., doctor who wanted to give her patients a way to combat the isolation that accompanied their physical disabilities, charges a $125 initiation fee for the first year and $25 every year thereafter.\n\nFor that fee, members get a more personalized experience, as DateAble is more akin to an old-school matchmaking service. The organization has been responsible for almost 1,000 marriages, according to Watson. As one of its first members, he should know: He met his wife, Lynn, at a DateAble Valentine's Day party in 1988.\n\nI didn't want to try it, says Watson, who has moderate cerebral palsy and was working as a national project director for the United Cerebral Palsy Association at the time. But I probably knew everybody in my community and nobody I knew wanted to date me or vice versa. Lynn lived 60 miles away, but we made it work.\n\nBy pushing a friends first concept, which has been emulated in the communal blog and forum features of Prescription 4 Love, No Longer Lonely, and other illness-specific sites, DateAble members can get up to speed on the dating world in a familiar environment without the prying eyes of the Web.\n\nPeople with disabilities, especially developmental disabilities, are typically behind the eight ball because they haven't had the practice of dating in college or their young adult life, says Watson. Many of them never had the puppy love, been broken up with, experienced the fights, or the good stuff.\n\nTo make up for this lost time, his best bit of advice is to be totally honest. Even in our post-Americans With Disabilities Act society, notes Watson, failing to mention that you're confined to a wheelchair or dealing with another type of handicap might bring a first date to an abrupt end after a courtesy I'm sorry drink.\n\nThe stigma of mental illness\n\nPeople with physical disabilities aren't the only ones who face stigma while dating. People with mental health problems, from chronic depression to schizophrenia, have also benefited from specialized sites.\n\nJim Leftwich, 39, a college librarian from White Plains, New York, has lived with schizoaffective disorder, a condition that combines features of schizophrenia and mood disorders (such as depression), since 1992. In 2004, after years of brushing up against the harsh realities of the dating scene, Leftwich founded No Longer Lonely, a dating site that caters to the mentally ill.\n\nI thought to myself, 'There should be something like this out there,' and I was surprised to find there wasn't, says Leftwich. If you're mentally ill, it's kind of a hostile world out there. I thought by taking down that whole bugaboo of having an illness, making it all open with everyone knowing, it would facilitate things. People would be more trusting and relationships might be more successful.\n\nNo Longer Lonely now has 16,000 members and a brand new interface (similar to those of social-networking sites) that allows users to upload poems, art, videos, and blogs. The site has been responsible for more than 20 marriages.\n\nI find with my clientele, they're more willing to get to know someone remotely and they're more open, he says. They don't have the same kind of prejudices that people in general tend to have.\n\nEven though most mental illnesses can be controlled with medication, therapy, or a combination of the two, some people still view conditions such as bipolar disorder as a mark of weakness or instability.\n\nEven in today's enlightened society, where acceptance and diversity are hailed as the right thing to do...mentally ill people tend to be outcasts. It's terrible, says Houran, who is also a former instructor of clinical psychiatry at the Southern Illinois School of Medicine.\n\nThe minute someone knows you have a certain mental disorder, they assume it means that you're not capable of love, or that you're dangerous or unstable. Those are myths. Given the right care, people with mental illnesses and other medical conditions can lead very normal, functioning lives.\n\nSome mental illnesses -- certain mood or personality disorders, for instance -- could cause problems in fledgling relationships, Houran acknowledges. And especially if the relationship progresses to thoughts of marriage and kids, two partners who each have bipolar disorder, for example, could find themselves debating whether it's safe or wise to have children.\n\nHowever, says Houran, in most cases these considerations aren't enough to forestall a relationship. Even under the best of circumstances, people still have major relationship challenges, he says.\n\nFor Houran, this outgrowth of illness-specific dating sites and services is a boon. Niche sites are growing in popularity because they allow people with these very specific needs or interests to connect in a way that's not possible on the big dating sites, he says.\n\nThe big dating sites are akin to Wal-Mart. You have a lot of quantity, but that doesn't mean you're going to find people with a lot quality in the way you define it. That being said, niche sites by their very construction tend to be very small. So I always advocate [that] people use both.\n\nCopyright Health Magazine 2011

(CNN) —\n\nHome is where the heart is…and where we currently spend the vast majority of our time. In addition to navigating an ongoing global pandemic, the winter is also a time when hibernation is normal. However, endless hours spent underneath the same roof and the same four walls can make anyone grow weary and, at times, bored.\n\nThat's why it's essential to fill your space with life's essential ingredient: happiness. Of course, joy looks and feels differently to every human. (After all, Marie Kondo taught us this years ago.) However, there are some universal ways to interject calm, color and bliss into your abode.\n\nBy chatting with a plethora of experts, from life coaches and home organizers to nutritionists, doctors and therapists, we've gathered the ultimate ways to make your home a place you want to be — and, hopefully, a spot that stimulates your mood and optimism.\n\nDisplay your fruits and vegetables\n\nFor Kati Carrapa, a professional organizer, life coach and pastor, happiness comes through aliveness. The most straightforward (and easy!) way to invite color and life into your kitchen is through displaying your fruits and vegetables. Stay simple with standard red apples or lemons, or go bolder with pineapple, dragon fruit or persimmon.\n\nThe colors are all up to you. If you long for exotic fruits and tastes, then go for it, she suggests. [If] you think you need more grounding energy, then go for kale, purple cabbage and carrots. She recommends trying various color combinations to see which ones make you the happiest, and taste the best too.\n\nTry these: Simple Houseware 2-Tier Countertop Fruit Basket ($21.87, originally $27.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Simple Houseware 2-Tier Countertop Fruit Basket\n\nThreshold 2-Tier Gold-Plated Wire Basket ($25; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Threshold 2-Tier Gold-Plated Wire Basket\n\nLight candles in scents you enjoy\n\nOf all of our senses, scent is the one that brings us back to a rose-colored memory the fastest.

But even when we see the mess, we can sometimes feel paralyzed to pick it up. How come? According to Pia Thompson, home organizer and owner of Sweet Digs, we consider the easiest place from which to retrieve something instead of the easiest place to return something to. That's why having accessible, comfortable and beautiful storage options will improve the happy factor of any room.\n\nChoose a spot where you usually use the item that is near to similar items and that isn't buried under something else, Thompson continues. Consider this shift in perspective when you are choosing a home for your items, and you will soon see your clutter disappear.\n\nTry this: TheWarmHome Decorative Basket ($16.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon TheWarmHome Decorative Basket\n\nAlways have fresh flowers\n\nAs backed by research, flowers are proven to create joy, improve empathy and make people happier, says Kristina Libby, an artist with the Floral Heart Project. This can be cut stems that you put in your home, flowering plants that you put in multiple rooms or a small garden that you grow outside or on your windowsill, she suggests.\n\nHowever, if you're a fan of gardens, go bigger and add floral wallpaper or hang floral-related art. I am particularly fond of florals in unexpected places: teacups, the riser to a staircase, in a bathroom or a small vase by your bed, she adds.\n\nTry these: Opalhouse Canary Floral Peel & Stick Wallpaper ($34; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Opalhouse Canary Floral Peel & Stick Wallpaper\n\n1-800-Flowers Sunflower Bouquet (starting at $44.99; 1800flowers.com)\n\nPHOTO: 1-800-Flowers 1-800-Flowers Sunflower Bouquet\n\nBromeliad Aechmea Pink ($65; bloomscape.com)\n\nPHOTO: Bloomscape Bromeliad Aechmea Pink\n\nInvest in a quality mirror in low-sun areas\n\nYou may not realize it, but a mirror is an excellent way to direct the natural flow of sunshine in your space. As shamanic practitioner and coach John Moore explains, sunlight impacts our mind, body and spirit. If you do not have a ton of natural vitamin D from outside, he suggests adding mirrors where there aren't windows to open the space.\n\nTry this: CoolXuan Round Hanging Mirror ($30.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon CoolXuan Round Hanging Mirror\n\nCreate a sleep sanctuary\n\nWhile not everyone thinks about their bedroom's health, it can play a crucial role in creating a happy home, according to Elizabeth O'Connor Cole, a well-being educator and founder of Salveo Lifestyle. The place where you lay your head each night should feel like a calm, inviting sanctuary that instantly provides relaxation and Zen. She recommends decluttering, allowing in the fresh air, creating amber lights and investing in high-quality mattresses and bedding.\n\nDitch synthetic pajamas, sheets and pillowcases and upgrade to organic cotton or natural silk, she adds.\n\nTry these: Beckham Hotel Collection Gel Pillows, 2-Pack ($39.99, originally $79.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Beckham Hotel Collection Gel Pillows, 2-Pack\n\nParachute Linen Sheet Set (starting at $149; parachutehome.com)\n\nPHOTO: Parachute Parachute Linen Sheet Set\n\nWashable Silk Tee Set ($198; lunya.co)\n\nPHOTO: Lunya Washable Silk Tee Set\n\nReserve time to bond with loved ones\n\nOne of the most significant contributions to your mental state inside your home is who you share it with. And while you may find the very sound of your partner chewing or your child's singing to be annoying on month 10,000 of lockdown, it's still essential to set aside time for intentional bonding, says author and neuroscientist Dr. Caroline Leaf.\n\nAs humans, we are made for deep, meaningful connection. When we feel connected and part of a community, we boost our mental resilience and toughness, as well as our mood, she explains. Meaningful socialization helps us feel happy and at peace within ourselves, balancing the energy in the brain and helping us build up our cognitive resilience.\n\nWhether you whip up a meal together, play board games or host a movie viewing evening, reserve the time on your calendar so you make it a priority.\n\nTry these: Czech Games Codenames ($14.88, originally $19.95; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Czech Games Codenames\n\nDr. J Professional HI-04 Mini Projector ($89.99, originally $99.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Dr. J Professional HI-04 Mini Projector\n\nPlace crystals strategically around your home\n\nYou may or may not subscribe to New Age ways of thinking, but if there's a chance a small purchase could make you feel more grounded and positive, wouldn't it be worth the shot? According to licensed psychologist Dr. Sarah Schewitz, there is much value in having a token or a totem representing a state of mind you would like to achieve. Whether this totem has actual spiritual properties or not, it's more about the mindset it evokes in you, she says.\n\nFor example, amethyst and rainbow fluorite are both beautiful stones that add a nice decorative flair to your home and are known to create a sense of calm. Alternatively, Schewitz says that adding a crystal to your home office or bedroom nightstand is a nice decorative touch and serves as a reminder of the state of mind you're trying to create when in that area of your home.\n\nTry this: Zatny Premium Healing Crystals Kit ($39.74; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Zatny Premium Healing Crystals Kit\n\nCarve out space for fitness\n\nWe know, we know… You miss the gym and your in-person fitness classes. While there will be a day — hopefully soon! — when we can all gather together to work up a sweat, it's still vital to keep exercise as part of your daily routine now. As certified life coach Adam Jablin puts it, the natural endorphins and serotonin from working out produce feelings of happiness, well-being and confidence. That feel-good energy can be poured into your job, relationships, friendships and self-care practice. If there's a piece of equipment, such as dumbbells, an exercise bar or a bike, that you've been delaying buying, here's your nudge to go for it.\n\nTry these: Tribe Resistance Bands Set Bundled With Loop Bands ($35.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Tribe Resistance Bands Set Bundled With Loop Bands\n\nAmazon Basics Rubber-Encased Hex Dumbbell (starting at $22.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Amazon Basics Rubber-Encased Hex Dumbbell\n\nAdd pops of color\n\nKathryn Goetzke, the chief mood officer of The Mood Factory, says that splashes of yellow in a room can pick up your spirit since we innately associate this color with happiness. If a sunshine-gold color isn't your cup of tea, find an eccentric removable wallpaper to add to an accent wall, suggests Allison Chawla, a licensed psychotherapist, certified life coach and healer.\n\nPick a bathroom and turn the stripe nook into a rainforest with some bright green leaves. Throw a splash of color or some smiling sloths up to remind you that it is a good time to slow down, she continues. Decor, similarly to fashion these days, has quite an 'anything goes' vibe going. And, hey, if it makes you happy, then go for it.\n\nTry these: Opalhouse Tropical Peel & Stick Wallpaper Green ($34; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Opalhouse Tropical Peel & Stick Wallpaper Green\n\nOpalhouse Monkey Play Peel & Stick Wallpaper ($34; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Opalhouse Monkey Play Peel & Stick Wallpaper\n\nAlign your home with your goals\n\nBelieve it or not, your home could help you stick to those New Year's resolutions or overall goals you have for your life. But you have to set up your space for success. To begin, make a list of your current aspirations and then assess how your home helps — or hinders — you from achieving these dreams, suggests Rebecca West, the author of Happy Starts at Home. If you want to write a novel, you should have a designed writing corner. If you're trying to improve your health, remove tempting snacks and make it simple to meal plan.\n\nThis kind of exercise can help you understand the why behind your projects and make sure that you are spending your energy and money wisely as you make changes to your home, she adds.\n\nTry this: Rifle Paper Co.

In fact, Cole says these were often seen as a gift from the gods. There is a good reason for this, as baths are not only cleansing, but they also provide a wonderful combination of comfort, calm and happiness, she explains.\n\nYour bathroom itself can be upgraded with cozy goodies, like a towel warmer, an oil diffuser or a plush bathmat. You can modernize your bubble bath from childhood by investing in salts, oils, dried flowers or even a sage-burning ritual to clear away the negative energy. Light the end of the stick and fan the flame until it's smoking. Wave the sage stick over the bath and around you, Cole suggests. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths before you soak.\n\nTry these: Zadro Ultra-Large Luxury Bucket-Style Towel Warmer ($139.99;bamazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Zadro Ultra-Large Luxury Bucket-Style Towel Warmer\n\nInnoGear Essential Oil Diffuser ($13.59, originally $15.99;bamazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon InnoGear Essential Oil Diffuser\n\nMake sure you like the stuff you use every day\n\nThis may sound obvious, but Schewitz says many people compromise and buy furniture or decorations they aren't very excited about because it saves them a little bit of money. Furniture and home decor items are something you will use and look at daily. Looking at and using items you love sparks joy and gives you a happier experience in your home, she says.\n\nThe same goes with your kitchen goods: Make them fun and colorful so you'll be excited to use them.\n\nTry this: The Pioneer Woman Vintage Floral 12-Piece Dinnerware Set ($49.97, originally $58.10; walmart.com)\n\nPHOTO: Walmart The Pioneer Woman Vintage Floral 12-Piece Dinnerware Set\n\nKeep the music flowing\n\nThough some people enjoy a quiet home, others need a soundtrack to carry them throughout their day. According to Chawla, the right type of music can boost your mood and makes you feel nostalgic, focused or relaxed, helping keep your spirit high. Music soothes the soul, encourages focus, increases libido, warms our hearts — you name it, she explains. Test out a few playlists, from lo-fi and jazz to feel-good beats, and determine which jams are, well, your jam.\n\nTry this: Apple HomePod Mini ($99.99; target.com)\n\nPHOTO: Target Apple HomePod Mini\n\nCheck and replace your lightbulbs\n\nWhen was the last time you gave a second thought to the lightbulbs in your home? Probably when one flickered out and it needed to be replaced, right? Lighting impacts our mood, and those fluorescent bulbs can be overpowering and intense. That's why Dr. Steven McGough, the director of research and development at Women and Couples Wellness, LLC, suggests omitting daylight bulbs from your house. As he explains, they can confuse your circadian rhythm if you use them after 4 p.m. and into the evening.\n\nInstead, he recommends soft white bulbs (2,700 to 3,000 kelvin) in your bedroom. If possible, have it so you can switch to soft white in your home in the afternoon, he suggests, since this will help mimic how the light changes outside later in the day. Or you can try a light strip that gives you control with a click.\n\nTry this: Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Lightstrip Plus ($66.47, originally $79.99; amazon.com)\n\nPHOTO: Amazon Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Lightstrip Plus\n\nSeparate your work and life\n\nWhile it's easier said than done, as much as you can, designate a place for your work and reserve the rest of your home for personal needs.\n\nHaving a dedicated work area that you can use every day and then break down at the end of your workday is highly therapeutic and promotes work-life balance, which is more important than ever, explains licensed clinical social worker Hillary Schoninger. Whether you have your own home office or are working from your dining room table, it's essential to end your day just like you would at the office.

So they gave all patients who didn't have a window view pictures of landscapes, and they found that after looking at scenic pictures, patients reported less pain and lower rates of anxiety, she explains.

Editor's Note: Rafia Zakaria is the author of The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan (Beacon 2015) and Veil (Bloomsbury 2017). She is a columnist for Dawn newspaper in Pakistan and The Baffler. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN) —\n\nThe first time I fell in love, it was from a distance. I was a teenager, and Pakistan, where I lived at the time, had only just emerged from nearly a decade and a half of martial law and Islamization, in which the general in charge had imposed rules based on his definition of Islam.\n\nI had recently and very fleetingly heard of a thing called Valentine's Day and its associations with romantic love. Regardless, I hoped on February 14, 1990, like many still do today, for a miracle. In the particular case, I wanted the boy I was in love with, a gangly character (whom I had never seen any closer than from across the street) to call me on the telephone.\n\nPHOTO: Jeremy Hogan Rafia Zakaria\n\nNot surprisingly, that boy I longed for from across the way never reciprocated. He had probably never heard of Valentine's Day or more likely of me, despite all my doleful staring. As a middle-class Pakistani girl from a conservative family, I was not allowed to speak to boys, let alone fall in love with them. I didn't let this keep me from either, pursuing both love and forbidden conversations with boys with great resourcefulness and assiduity.\n\nI fell in love with the boy who dropped his telephone number in my lap through the open car window while my mother was not looking. I fell in love with a boy whom I beat in a debate competition and the boy who called several evenings in a row demanding to speak to a different Bollywood character each time. Some reciprocated my feelings; most had little clue about Valentine's Day unless I told them.\n\nOf course, they also did not really know me. Falling in love in those pre-Instagram, pre-cell phone days was understood as a mysterious matter, where facts and the onerous getting to know each other played little part. Some of this was understandable. Where marriage was a matter of careful arrangement, love had to be left wild and chaotic, without being hemmed in by the constraints of data or some similar bubble-bursting encumbrance.\n\nThings have changed in Pakistan. Not only is Valentine's Day a pretty big deal now – there are specials at florists and displays at stationery shops and tinsel-wrapped candy everywhere – the encroachment of the semi-arranged marriage, on the realm between love and arranged marriage, seems to have altered the path and pattern of both. These semi-arranged marriages, particularly popular among the growing urban middle class, seek to add a little of love's mystery to the once standard arranged marriage, whose closely chaperoned interactions leave little room for romance and where the two being wed do not know each other at all.\n\nIn the semi-arranged marriage, there may be room for a few solo coffee dates. And the newly paired duo can announce to their friends that they are in love, while their parents can insist that the match was entirely arranged. In other words, parents can find possible spouses who meet a certain combined checklist of qualities identified by both the bride or groom-to-be and the parents. Veto power, however, lies with the young couple.\n\nAdded volume to the Valentine's Day business comes from the virtual realm that has made most everything including love and/or marriage a competitive sport. Cheaply available cell phones are everywhere in Pakistan, and nearly all are equipped with social media, such that everyone can see the presents that those in love are bestowing on one another.\n\nIn addition, celebrating Valentine's Day gives the upwardly mobile urban couple's love the legitimacy of individual choice – with roses, chocolates and jewelry adding a bit of luster to the worn and antiquated patina of an arranged marriage. If the celebration is attended to with some gusto, even an entirely arranged match can be passed off as one in which the parties fell in love without any machinations of their aunt or uncle or the neighbor lady-turned-matchmaker who lives three doors down.\n\nEven in rural Pakistan, where marriages are still generally arranged and love is a separate realm, Valentine's Day is now a known, if not openly, celebrated quantity. Where trysts between lovers can be arranged via the ubiquitous cell phone, any excuse to meet in the sugarcane field – including Valentine's Day – is used. Men and women who may have to endure spouses chosen by mothers, fathers and the village council, one theory goes, are especially entitled to a bit of fun on the side.\n\nLove in Pakistan may seem like a tale from a very distant elsewhere, but one could argue that the slightly waning popularity of Valentine's Day here (or at least the cynicism that hangs over some) is for reasons remarkably similar, if reverse, from those seen in Pakistan.\n\nWhile Pakistanis may have moved from the arranged to the semi-arranged sort of marriage, Americans have moved from the love by accidental chance or serendipity to a more calculated – if not algorithmic-driven – sort of love. In the data-driven, virtually-infused and forever-impatient realm of finding a partner, social media and the internet provide a ton of information faster than the spark of attraction.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nFor those actively and intentionally looking for love, a dizzying array of apps, many with the ability to match a staggering set of data points – looks, income, language, location – can help with pairing with far greater precision than the most enterprising set of Pakistani parents. In some, bucket lists and credit reports can be exchanged even before the trouble of a first meeting. Why waste a couple of hours when artificial intelligence can tally up the possibility of true love using hundreds of variables? Mystery is the enemy here and data is the friend; love is made (like Valentine's Day) utterly predictable.\n\nIn Pakistan, the United States and likely anywhere on our data-driven globe, the role of Valentine's Day is changing. In the West, marketing departments of dating apps can rely on the fact that many more will sign up for their love-on-demand services on or around that day. In Pakistan, even those betrothed who have spoken barely a sentence to each other will send cards, flowers and chocolates.\n\nIn different ways, love is a status symbol, a badge of desirability. And Valentine's Day is a perfect showcase to make sure that everyone in the virtual audience knows it.
(CNN) A planned UK tour by US evangelist Franklin Graham is in question after every venue booked by the preacher canceled planned appearances, following an outcry over his homophobic and Islamophobic comments.\n\nGraham -- the son of preacher Billy Graham -- has called Islam evil, attacked laws increasing rights for transgender people, and told his followers that the legalization of same-sex marriage was orchestrated by Satan\n\nNow, every venue booked by Graham as part of a lengthy summer tour of the UK has told him not to come.\n\nAn arena in Newcastle upon Tyne became the seventh and final venue to cancel his scheduled appearance on Wednesday. The move follows similar decisions by venues in other British cities, including Birmingham, Liverpool and Sheffield.\n\nGraham, one of the most high-profile speakers in the US, is the president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and an outspoken supporter of US President Donald Trump , whose election he believes was enabled by God.

Similarly, neither Mr. Perkins nor the Company has any affiliation whatsoever with Rihanna.\n\nThe pair launched Fenty Entertainment, a production and talent company, in 2017.\n\nRihanna's popular Fenty Beauty line of cosmetics also launched in 2017.

(CNN) Having already aired director Ava DuVernay's documentary 13th, about the legacy of the 13th Amendment, Netflix ups the ante by devoting a six-part series to the 14th with Amend: The Fight for America. It's an ambitious project that mixes various techniques, stars and historians to enliven the history and connect it to the present, with its most conspicuous weakness being the contributions of host and producer Will Smith.\n\nEnacted in 1868, the 14th Amendment has become one of the most-litigated amendments in US history. Its key provisions , promising equal protection for all persons, have proven remarkably elastic, becoming the foundation not only for civil rights but women's rights, marriage equality (both involving mixed-race and gay couples) and immigrants.\n\nAmend employs multiple methods in bringing that history to life and powerfully connecting it to the battles of the 21st century, with the rise of extremist forces rooted in white supremacy. Those narrative wrinkles include animation and dramatic readings, with a gaudy list of actors like Mahershala Ali and Samuel L. Jackson presenting the words of Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr., respectively.\n\nThe early episodes take a deep dive into Reconstruction, the rise of Ku Klux Klan and the Jim Crow era installing a form of legal apartheid, as NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund president Sherrilyn Ifill notes.\n\nThe timeliest material charts a direct path from the racial backlash then into the heart of modern politics, detailing the importance of the Supreme Court in codifying (and later overturning) discrimination, the use of home-grown American terrorism against African-Americans and the extent to which violence was used to mount a political counter-revolution against Reconstruction, as historian David Blight explains.\n\nRead More
London (CNN) Britain's royal family was facing a once-in-a-generation crisis on Monday after Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, rocked the institution with a litany of devastating allegations in their eagerly awaited interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nOver the course of the two-hour special , the couple -- who despite their royal split still sit five relatives away from the throne -- painted a picture of a family so stubbornly rooted in its ways that it left a young, bi-racial couple alone to fend off racist abuse and their own troubled mental health, forcing them into silence and ultimately leaving them with no option but to flee the palace's clutches.\n\nMeghan said she was so isolated and lonely while working as a royal that she contemplated suicide , telling Winfrey she just didn't want to be alive anymore. The couple were intensely critical of the way the institution treated them, and Meghan revealed a staggering allegation of racism from a member of the clan that threatens to throw its reputation into crisis.\n\nHarry meanwhile admitted his relationships with his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles , and his brother, Prince William , have come under severe strain in recent years, and suggested the institution may have planted stories in the media that cast him and Meghan in a negative light.\n\n'I just didn't want to be alive anymore'\n\nThe palace faced storms on multiple fronts by sunrise in London on Monday.\n\nThe interview had been relentlessly previewed in the media over recent days, drawing comparisons with a royal tell-all given by Harry's mother, Princess Diana , in 1995, which shed light on the breakdown of her marriage to Charles.\n\nBut the revelations in Sunday's broadcast may have dwarfed even those in magnitude, as Harry and Meghan's scorched-earth confessional posed problem after problem for palace staffers and senior royals.\n\nPerhaps the most pertinent was Meghan's allegation that an unnamed family member had asked about Archie's skin color and what that would mean or look like. She said those discussions were relayed to her from Harry.\n\nHarry declined to name the family member but said he was a bit shocked by the conversation. Winfrey said on CBS on Monday morning that it was not his grandmother nor his grandfather that were part of those conversations. In Britain, the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said Buckingham Palace should launch an investigation.\n\nPalace officials are also scrambling to respond to claims from both Duke and Duchess that their pleas for help with their mental wellbeing and security were ignored by the institution.\n\nFighting back tears at one point, Meghan said her thoughts of suicide were incredibly difficult to bear, and she was reticent to share them with her husband. But I knew that if I didn't say it, that I would do it -- and I just didn't want to be alive anymore, she said.\n\nHarry , whose mother Diana was killed when he was a boy, said he was terrified by his wife's admission. The prince, who is sixth in line to the throne, said there is a culture of suffering in silence in the royal family. But Meghan's race and the abuse she endured made the situation even more difficult for the couple, and their perceived lack of support ultimately led, above all other factors, to their dramatic decision to quit as working royals in January 2020.\n\nHow to get help: In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.\n\nThey described in emotional detail the most difficult moments -- Meghan revealing her thoughts to Harry hours before they were due to go to an event; the Prince arriving home from work each day to find his wife crying while breastfeeding their newborn -- and said a lack of support and lack of understanding were the reasons they chose to step away.\n\nMeghan said the situation was exacerbated by often racist and outdated, colonial undertones that repeatedly appeared in coverage of the couple in Britain's notoriously vitriolic tabloids . Both described a toxic blend of press intrusion, bitterness on social media and isolation from a support structure.\n\nHarry added that he pushed the issue with the royal family. He told Winfrey he believed there were many opportunities for the palace to show some public support in the face of continued racial abuse in the press, yet no one from my family ever said anything. That hurts.\n\nI regret believing them when they said I would be protected, Meghan told Winfrey.\n\nCNN has reached out to the royal family for comment.\n\nHarry reveals serious rifts in the family\n\nIf there was even the faintest suggestion that Harry and Meghan could someday rejoin the royal family's mission, Sunday's broadcast likely extinguished it for good. The interview laid bare the depths of division between the pair and the rest of the family, a chasm that would have been unimaginable when they married in Windsor just three years ago.\n\nThey told Winfrey that the family had been welcoming towards Meghan at first, and that when they married, they were committed to their roles.\n\nBut things quickly changed. Harry told Winfrey his relationship with his father Charles reached the point where the heir to the throne stopped taking his calls, so angered by the pair's decision to leave as working royals in 2020. There's a lot to work through there, Harry said. I feel really let down, because he's been through something similar -- he knows what pain feels like.\n\nOn his brother, William -- with whom Harry grew up, and whose shared childhood was meticulously followed by the media -- the Prince implied that communication is virtually non-existent. We're on different paths, he said, adding that the relationship is space at the moment, and that time heals all things -- hopefully.\n\nPerhaps the only silver lining for the family is that its leader survived the interview relatively unscathed. Harry and Meghan both spoke effusively of the Queen, describing her as caring and kind from the beginning.\n\nMy grandmother and I have a really good relationship, and an understanding and I have a deep respect for her, Harry said. Meghan said she has spoken to her frequently in the past year, including on the day that Prince Philip was admitted to hospital last month.\n\nMeghan added that despite the ordeal, it was important to differentiate the royal family from the people running the institution.\n\nShe discussed rumors of a dispute with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Meghan said reports she made Kate cry over the dresses of flower girls at her wedding were untrue, and it was in fact the Duchess of Sussex who cried. But there was no confrontation, Meghan said, describing her sister-in-law as a good person.\n\nBut the evidently strained family dynamic will overshadow the royals' upcoming engagements. No statements have yet been issued by any of their communications teams in the wake of the interview.\n\nMeghan and Harry (right) with the Queen, Prince Charles and other royals in 2019. During their Oprah interview, Harry detailed a breakdown in relationships with several of his senior relatives.\n\nBreathless reaction in Britain\n\nAs the hours ticked by and the dust from the broadcast settled on Monday, Buckingham Palace remained silent. But the British media leapt to cover the fallout, with some newspapers publishing extra early editions overnight in order to feature the interview on their front pages.\n\nAs has so often been the case with the couple, coverage ranged from the measured to the hysterical. The Daily Mail ran a headline reading Kate Made Me Cry on its 2 a.m. edition, before leading on Meghan's accusation of racism later in the morning. The tabloid's website also included a prominent banner that read: I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF.\n\nThe Sun featured a new nickname for Meghan amid her rift with the royal family: Megxile, and the Daily Express dismissed the broadcast as a self-serving TV chat with Oprah.\n\nA selection of front pages in the UK on Monday.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, several journalists used Boris Johnson's press conference on Covid-19 to ask for his thoughts on the Oprah interview. The Prime Minister declined to weigh in, aside from saying he'd always had the highest admiration for the Queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country.\n\nThe media's treatment of the royal couple formed a significant part of the interview, with the pair both taking aim at sections of the press.\n\nHarry said the palace is in fear of its media coverage, meaning they had little freedom while part of the family.\n\nTo simplify it, it's a case of if you as a family member are willing to wine, dine and give full access to these reporters, then you will get better press, Harry said. There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations.\n\nThe interview was broadcast in Britain at 9 p.m. Monday, with terrestrial broadcaster ITV winning the race to acquire rights. But its main talking points were already being dissected in detail by Brits and in the media long before its UK airing.\n\nCharles Anson, a former press secretary to the Queen, said on Monday the couple raised issues that need to be looked at carefully, but claimed to the BBC that there wasn't a strand of racism within the royal household.\n\nBut Julie Montagu, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke, told the BBC that their revelations were astounding, and that as an American woman who married into British aristocracy, she could relate to Meghan's descriptions. You don't really know until you're in it, and I think that she made that very well known last night in her interview, she said.\n\nCNN will soon launch Royal News, a weekly newsletter bringing you the inside track on the royal family, what they are up to in public and what's happening behind palace walls.

(CNN) The brother of the stepfather of two missing Idaho children released a statement asking for him to come forward and cooperate with police.\n\nChad Daybell and his wife Lori Vallow, the children's mother, left the state. Vallow has refused to cooperate with authorities, police said in a statement on December 30. The children, Joshua JJ Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, have not been seen or heard from since September\n\nDaybell's brother, Matt Daybell, said in a statement to CNN affiliate East Idaho News Friday that he has not been close to Chad Daybell since they were children.\n\nMy immediate family has had little association with Chad the last many years due to our concerns with his religious claims and particular books he had chosen to publish, including his own, Matt Daybell's statement read. I plead again for Chad to come forward and cooperate with the investigation so that this very difficult situation might be resolved.\n\nMatt Daybell said in a statement Friday he has neither seen nor directly spoken to his brother since the memorial of Chad Daybell's previous wife in October.\n\nRelatives of missing kids offer $20,000 reward\n\nJJ's biological grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock of Louisiana, held a news conference last week in Idaho to offer a $20,000 reward for information on the whereabouts of JJ or Tylee Ryan.\n\nKay Woodcock made a public plea to their mother.\n\nPlease, just let us know where the kids are, she said. It's not difficult. It will end all this, as far as the kids are concerned.\n\nKay and Larry Woodcock are offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of their grandson, Joshua JJ Vallow, and his sister, Tylee Ryan.\n\nThe children's disappearance is part of a complex past 12 months for the family -- a time frame in which police have investigated two deaths, one of which authorities say still is under investigation.\n\nPolice determined the children were missing in late November -- four months after Lori Vallow's estranged husband was shot dead in their former home state, Arizona, and shortly after Vallow moved with the children to Idaho and remarried.\n\nVallow's estranged husband was shot and killed in July during a fight with Vallow's brother. According to a petition for dissolution of marriage filed in February , Vallow's former husband said Vallow recently become infatuated and at times obsessive about near death experiences and spiritual visions.\n\nPolice conducted a welfare check for JJ -- Vallow's adopted son with her late husband -- on November 26 at their home in Rexburg, Idaho, after relatives raised concern about not hearing from him since September.\n\nDuring the welfare check, both Vallow and her new husband, Chad Daybell, told investigators the boy was staying with a family friend in Arizona, police said.\n\nBut police determined that he wasn't staying with a family friend. When police returned November 27 to execute a search warrant, investigators determined Daybell and Vallow had fled the home, and also didn't appear to have taken JJ with them, according to authorities.\n\nInvestigators learned that Tylee hadn't been seen since September, though she'd most recently lived with Vallow and JJ in Rexburg.\n\nPolice investigate whether the disappearances are connected to a woman's death\n\nThe case is complicated further by the death of Daybell's previous wife, Tammy Daybell, in Idaho in October. Her death initially was believed to be natural, but Rexburg police announced last month that it was suspicious, and her remains were exhumed.\n\nDaybell and Vallow married a few weeks after Tammy Daybell's death, police say.\n\nRexburg police have said they're investigating whether that death and the kids' disappearances are connected.\n\nInvestigators don't believe the children are with Lori Vallow, but they think she knows where they are or what happened to them, Rexburg police said.\n\nAn attorney for the family, Sean Bartholick, released a statement to East Idaho News on December 23 saying that while he is in contact with Vallow and her husband, Chad Daybell, he does not have information about the children. CNN has made multiple attempts to reach Bartholick but has not received a response.\n\nLinks to a religious content website\n\nChad Daybell had connections to a website called Preparing a People, a religious content provider that describes itself as as series of lecture events focusing on self-reliance and personal preparation, featuring several Latter-Day Saints speakers.\n\nPublishers of the site, Michael and Nancy James, released a statement December 26 emphasizing that while Daybell, and to a lesser extent Vallow, were featured in the series, neither was an owner or a founder.\n\nMichael and Nancy James said they decided to pull content featuring either Daybell or Vallow in light of Tammy Daybell's death and the disappearance of the children.
(CNN) The World Bank has postponed its decision on granting Tanzania a $500 million loan, following pressure from activists who oppose the country's policy of banning pregnant girls and young mothers from attending state school.\n\nThe bank's executive board was meant to meet on Tuesday to consider the loan, but the meeting was postponed after one member requested a delay on Monday, a source at the bank told CNN.\n\nSources did not say why the meeting was postponed. However, the request to delay came in after the bank held a last-minute emergency meeting with Tanzanian activists and international human rights organizations earlier on Monday.\n\nLast week, Tanzanian civil society groups sent a letter, seen by CNN, to the executive board urging them to stop the loan until the country passes a law that guarantees the rights of pregnant girls to attend regular secondary schools and ends mandatory pregnancy tests.\n\nCNN visited three Tanzanian schools in 2018 where girls from grades eight and up were given compulsory pregnancy tests\n\nRead More

She and her husband agreed to do that when they made their embryos 15 years ago, but her feelings changed after using some of them to have children.\n\nI have these two gorgeous, smart people who came from this process, Sammis said. These embryos are all like seeds that could become potential people. That reality to me was all abstract when they were in the freezer.\n\nTank failures at two clinics in Ohio and California last year revealed hidden issues with long-frozen embryos, including some from the 1980s when IVF began. A few years ago, medical groups developed sample consent forms clinics could use for new patients, spelling out what could happen to unused embryos. But that hasn't resolved what to do with ones made long ago.\n\nANTI-VAXXERS AMONG TOP 'THREATS TO GLOBAL HEALTH,' WHO SAYS\n\nIt's a real dilemma for these clinics, said Rich Vaughn, a Los Angeles lawyer who headed the American Bar Association's assisted reproduction committee for many years. We don't quite know what to do with them and everyone's afraid to act for fear they'll be sued if people surface decades later and want their embryos.\n\nThe number is growing as more couples try IVF and because of changes in how it's done. The old way was to mix eggs and sperm in the lab and transfer multiple fresh embryos to a womb, hoping at least one would lead to pregnancy. Now, couples usually freeze many embryos, test for health problems and transfer the most viable one at a time to avoid multiple births. That often means leftovers once the desired family is complete.\n\nHow many embryos are in storage isn't known — centers don't have to report that. One study estimated there were 1.4 million in the U.S. Researchers think 5 to 7 percent are abandoned, though it's as high as 18 percent at some clinics. Some define that as a year of no contact or storage payments after reasonable efforts to find the owners; others draw the line at five years. Some clinics search social media and hire investigators to find owners when abandonment is suspected.\n\nIt has vexed our field from the start, said Dr. Mark Sauer, a fertility specialist at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School who is on the ethics committee of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine.\n\nIt also has vexed couples, many of whom never expected so many leftovers. Sara Raber of New York's Long Island had five extras after conceiving two children.\n\nBABY BORN 3 YEARS AGO HAS GONE HOME FROM HOSPITAL AT LAST\n\nYour goal in the beginning is just to get pregnant, so making a lot of embryos seems necessary because you don't know how many tries it will take, she said. But disposing of extras brings a finality to family building that's different for IVF couples than it is for those who conceived naturally.\n\nYou're making a conscious decision not to have a baby anymore, said her husband, Howard Raber. That's what makes it hard.\n\nEven after the Rabers agreed to donate theirs to research, which usually means to a fertility clinic to let staff practice IVF, the paperwork sat on her desk for months, Sarah Raber said.\n\nIn Arlington, Virginia, Sammis is having a similar struggle. I get to the point of signing the papers and I just can't deal with it, she said.\n\nSammis said a friend who couldn't decide what to do with her embryos moved away and didn't give the fertility center her forwarding address ... That was her way of dealing with it.\n\nWhen couples have abandoned embryos, it was largely because they did not want to be responsible for making a very difficult decision. They would rather let the program do it, Sauer said.\n\nCOLORADO REPORTS STATE'S FIRST PEDIATRIC FLU DEATH OF SEASON\n\nAndrea Braverman, a health psychologist at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, said it's not an easy choice. A study of 131 couples in Canada found that one third had not returned for frozen embryos after five years. Another study found that up to 70 percent of couples delayed a decision for at least five years and many changed their minds about what they thought they'd do after they had IVF.\n\nThis is a fluid decision. It is not a one-and-done, Braverman said.\n\nDr. Craig Sweet, who runs a fertility clinic in Fort Myers, Florida, knows the problem well. About 18 percent, or 300, of his clinic's frozen embryos are abandoned, some for 25 years. A study he did found that couples were more likely to abandon embryos if they had stored them a long time, had a low education level, already had many children or owed the clinic money.\n\nOne of his patients with more than a dozen leftover embryos forged her husband's signature on forms giving permission to use them because she wanted more children and he did not. The plan fell apart when the clinic insisted on seeing him personally.\n\nThings happen. Life happens, divorce happens, depression, financial changes — many things can lead a couple to disagree about using embryos, Sweet said.\n\nThe courts view an embryo as something between person and property, said Susan Crockin, a reproductive law expert at Georgetown University. When it's in the lab as opposed to being in a womb, people have equal rights to it and most courts will not allow one member of a couple to use an embryo over the other's objection, she said.\n\nThe actress Sofia Vergara and her ex-fiancé Nick Loeb fought over frozen embryos they made, but a court said Vergara could not be forced to procreate against her wish and denied Loeb use of the embryos after the couple split.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nStates may try to rewrite legal precedents. Last April, Arizona's governor signed legislation allowing one member of a divorced couple to use embryos created during a marriage even if the ex-spouse doesn't want a child.\n\nClinics try to avoid being in the middle.\n\nWhat we tell couples is that if you're divorced, nobody gets to transfer the embryos until we get something from a court that says who has control of them, said Dr. Richard T. Scott Jr., scientific director of Reproductive Medicine Associates, one of the nation's largest clinics with centers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida.\n\nIn 2005, Sweet began requiring patients to agree not to destroy unused embryos. He also started Embryo Donation International to provide embryos to couples willing to use them to have children. He accepts embryos from 62 facilities in North America and has more than 400 available; 50 to 60 were used in 2017, he said.\n\nIt just didn't make sense to us that people were discarding perfectly normal, useful embryos, he said.\n\nHis IVF coordinator, Rebecca Ruano, had 18 leftover embryos after the birth of her twins, and agreed to donate the extras to people unable to have children. I was not willing to destroy or donate them to science. We worked too hard for them, she said.\n\nFrozen embryos remain viable for decades as far as anyone knows. Last year, the National Embryo Donation Center in Tennessee reported a birth using an embryo that had been frozen for 24 years.\n\nSweet supplied a Chicago woman an embryo that had been frozen for 17 years and made one request:\n\nWhen the baby is born, he said, I want you to see if you can register the kid to vote.
A strange video of Julianne Hough that shows her shouting during an energy treatment has left fans thinking she underwent an exorcism.\n\nHough, 31, caught the public's attention after a blogger posted a video of the former Dancing with the Stars professional lying on a table as a doctor waved his hands over her body. Hough's body began to contort and move in a wave-like motion as she shouted uncontrollably.\n\nThe actress reportedly participated in the demonstration with Dr. John Amaral in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nJULIANNE HOUGH'S HUSBAND BROOKS LAICH 'STILL HOPING THINGS WILL WORK OUT' AMID RUMORED MARRIAGE TROUBLES: REPORT\n\nGonna tell my kids this is 'The Exorcist'...(Policy Guidline (sic) Disclaimer: I aspire to such flexibility and mind body connection and hope to have similar orgasmic experience at Kinrgy. Love and Light.) blogger Jackie Schimmel, who filmed the video, posted to her Instagram account.\n\nThe clip has since caused a frenzy on social media, with celebrities and Hough's fans weighing in on what exactly they think is going on.\n\nWhat the actual...., Vanderpump Rules star Stassi Schroder commented.\n\nBROOKS LAICH TALKS GOAL OF EXPLORING HIS SEXUALITY AMID RUMORED MARRIAGE TROUBLE WITH JULIANNE HOUGH\n\nI'm calling the cops, another Instagram user joked.\n\nHough even took to the post to agree with the exorcism claims.\n\nI thought the same thing when I first saw it too! the actress and dancer commented with a laughing face emoji.\n\nOthers were spooked by the video and in search of more answers as to what kind of treatment Hough was really receiving.\n\nThe demon is trapped in her little body. In the name of Jesus I rebuke this woman. Bye. Take it Jesus, comedian Heather McMahan wrote.\n\nBROOKS LAICH TALKS GOAL OF EXPLORING HIS SEXUALITY AMID RUMORED MARRIAGE TROUBLE WITH JULIANNE HOUGH\n\nI don't know whether this is absolutely hilarious or absolutely terrifying. My mind is still processing what I just witnessed. This can't be real. She is officially cult status, commented another.\n\nIn the video, Dr. Amaral explains how the treatment -- the exact name of it wasn't announced in the post -- affects the body's nervous system.\n\nThere's always a huge dissipation of energy and a feeling of relief, release, freedom, he said. Expression of emotion may happen when the system moves. When energy that was stored or bound up in the muscles begins to dissipate, and if we're really free to express and allow energy that we have in our bodies to move -- this woman is like an incredible dancer, actress, just human being and she has practiced just allowing things to move through -- but even with that, things get bound up.\n\nThe physician then told his audience that most people, especially in this environment, wouldn't make that sound.\n\nWe've just made it easier for that energy to be liberated, the physician continued.\n\nHough's twin brother, Derek Hough, commented on the video in support of the energy healing ritual.\n\nThis stuff looks whacky and crazy but diving into it with the understanding of pure energy is a pretty wild experience. Maybe ahead of its time but worth an open mind, Derek wrote.\n\nOthers noted that Hough's screams sounded orgasmic.\n\nTHIS IS NOT REAL! another freaked out user wrote.\n\nJULIANNE HOUGH, BROOKS LAICH SHARE LONG EMBRACE AT AIRPORT AMID REPORTS THEY'VE BEEN 'HAVING PROBLEMS'\n\nAnother person on Instagram said: She deserves an Oscar. Meryl Streep who?\n\nI listened to this with no sound and it's still frightening/confusing/scary, wrote another.\n\nThen, in a second strange video posted by Schimmel, Hough is seen performing another demonstration -- this time on her feet as she waves her arms up and down and breathes heavily.\n\nTake it and throw it! Hough says to the audience. Breathing in through the nose, out through the mouth. Yes. Keep going, keep going. We're turning up that heat. Taking that dirt, taking that fire, all that negative energy that we don't need in our life and throwing it away!\n\nSeconds later, Hough brings her hands together above her head and then swings them toward her hips.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe energy healing videos come amid rumors that Hough and her husband, Brooks Laich, are having marital problems.\n\nEarlier this month Laich shared a cryptic Instagram post about entering a new stage of life after Hough was spotted without her wedding ring. Sources told People that despite the couple's relationship appearing strained, Laich is hopeful that things will work out.

He is also a member of President Trump's Coronavirus Task Force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nRedfield's path to his position started early. Both his parents were scientists at the National Institutes of Health and were huge influences in driving him toward a career in retroviruses in human disease.\n\nAlong his way to his current job, he worked as an Army physician and medical researcher for Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. While there, he worked together with several teams on the cutting edge of AIDS research, writing several papers on the topic.\n\nWHO IS ROBERT REDFIELD? 3 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE CDC'S NEW DIRECTOR\n\nHis work prior to joining the CDC was not without controversy and in 1992, the Defense Department launched an investigation after he was accused of promoting the effects of an HIV vaccine he'd overseen. Although no evidence of misconduct was found, the vaccine failed.\n\nSCIENTISTS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY HAVE DEVELOPED A RAPID TESTING TECHNOLOGY FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\nWhen he retired from the Army in 1996 as a colonel, he began to concentrate on setting up a multidisciplinary research organization to develop research and treatment programs for chronic human viral infection and disease.\n\nTo help study this, he co-founded the Institute of Human Virology based at Maryland, together with his HIV research colleagues Robert Gallo, the co-discoverer of the HIV retrovirus, and renowned viral epidemiologist William Blattner.\n\nPrior to joining the CDC, Redfield served as a tenured professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, as well as chief of infectious disease, vice chair of medicine and co-founder and associate director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nSCIENTISTS MAP HOW IMMUNE SYSTEM FIGHTS BACK AGAINST COVID-19\n\nIn the early years of AIDS, Redfield led research responsible for being the first to conclusively show the HIV retrovirus could be heterosexually transmitted, while also developing the staging system now used worldwide for the clinical assessment of the HIV infection.\n\nHowever, in 1992 his work on a controversial AIDS vaccine that turned out to be ineffective brought allegations he committed scientific misconduct by selecting data that were favorable to the vaccine.\n\nA decade later, an investigation by the U.S. Army did say he had an inappropriate close relationship with the non-governmental group Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy (ASAP), which promoted the vaccine. The group, founded by evangelical Christians, worked to contain the HIV/AIDS outbreak by advocating for abstinence before marriage, rather than passing out condoms — a view Redfield says he's since changed...\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRedfield also authored the foreword to a book co-written by ASAP leader W. Shepard Smith, Christians in the Age of AIDS, which discouraged the distribution of sterile needles to drug users as well as condom use, calling them false prophets, a book describing AIDS as God's judgment against homosexuals.\n\n\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) issued a stark condemnation of President Biden's abortion agenda on the day of his inauguration, arguing that he would advance moral evil on the preeminent priority for the faithful.\n\nI must point out that our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender, said Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, who serves as the USCCB's president. Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.\n\nHis comments came amid a broader debate about U.S. politicians, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who identify as Catholic but pursue policies that conflict with Church teaching. Biden, during the campaign, reversed his decades-old position on the Hyde Amendment, which blocks most taxpayer funding for abortions. He's also pledged to codify Roe v. Wade, a move that conservatives say would allow abortion up till the moment of birth.\n\nSOME ROMAN CATHOLICS SOUNDING ALARM ABOUT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, CONFLICTS WITH MORAL TEACHING\n\nPrior to Biden's inauguration, he and Pelosi attended a mass held at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C. It's unclear whether they took communion but Archbishop Wilton Gregory said beforehand that he wouldn't deny Biden the sacrament.\n\nDuring the campaign, then-candidate Biden was denied communion by a South Carolina priest and in August, Cardinal Raymond Burke, the former head of the Archdiocese of St. Louis, said the former vice president shouldn't receive communion and wasn't a Catholic in good standing.\n\nFor years, Biden supported the Hyde Amendment with the rationale that religious Americans shouldn't have to pay for procedures they fundamentally oppose. He similarly argued that Americans shouldn't be forced to embrace his faith's view of abortion. He appeared to personally flout church teaching, however, when he officiated a same-sex wedding ceremony in 2016. He also picked a Health and Human Services secretary who previously sued nuns for opposing Obamacare's contraception mandate.\n\nRegardless, Gomez welcomed Biden and said it would be refreshing to engage with a President who clearly understands, in a deep and personal way, the importance of religious faith and institutions.\n\nGomez added in Wednesday's statement that abortion is not only a private matter, it raises troubling and fundamental questions of fraternity, solidarity, and inclusion in the human community. It is also a matter of social justice. We cannot ignore the reality that abortion rates are much higher among the poor and minorities, and that the procedure is regularly used to eliminate children who would be born with disabilities.\n\nBIDEN LAUNCHES ADS TOUTING HIS FAITH AFTER CARDINAL SAYS HE'S 'NOT A CATHOLIC IN GOOD STANDING'\n\nBoth the Catholic Catechism and some clergy have indicated that politicians have an obligation to support anti-abortion legislation. The section of the Catechism discussing abortion says that the procedure and infanticide are abominable crimes.\n\nAfter Gomez's statement, Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich called it ill-considered, alleging that bishops only received it hours before it was released and was crafted without involvement from the body's Administrative Committee.\n\nThe internal institutional failures involved must be addressed, and I look forward to contributing to all efforts to that end, so that, inspired by the Gospel, we can build up the unity of the Church, and together take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis, Cupich said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPope Francis, meanwhile, called on Biden to work towards a society that respected every human's rights.\n\nAt a time when the grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses, he said, I pray that your decisions will be guided by a concern for building a society marked by authentic justice and freedom, together with unfailing respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those who have no voice.
Larry King's wife, Shawn King, has revealed his cause of death as well as the final words she spoke to him.\n\nThe iconic television host died Saturday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles at the age of 87, leaving behind three living children -- Larry Jr., Chance and Cannon -- as well as his wife, Shawn.\n\nNo cause of death was given at the time of his passing, but he had been hospitalized with a COVID-19 infection weeks prior, reports said. In a new interview, his wife revealed the broadcaster did not die from the coronavirus.\n\nIt was an infection, it was sepsis, she told Entertainment Tonight. Well, he was finally ready to go, I will tell you that. You know, he never wanted to go but his sweet little body was just, it had just been hit so many times with so many things and once we heard the word COVID, all of our hearts just sunk. But he beat it, you know, he beat it, but it did take its toll and then the unrelated infection finally is what took him, but boy, he was not gonna go down easily.\n\nLARRY KING'S WIFE SHAWN KING SPEAKS OUT AFTER TV TALK-SHOW ICON IS LAID TO REST: 'I'M STILL PROCESSING'\n\nShawn said King's mind wasn't right and his body was going, noting it was a difficult thing to witness. The actress and King were in the middle of a divorce at the time of his passing. King filed for divorce in August 2019 after 22 years of marriage.\n\nShe confirmed the pair's divorce was never finalized.\n\nIn my heart, I didn't think it was really going to happen and it never did. We were partners in every sense of the way, in business, and in, well, first in our familiy and then in business. But we're a close family. You know, family is the most important thing, and God, she said.\n\nShawn also touched on King's final moments in the hospital. She said she and King's kids were able to FaceTime him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nAnd it was hard for him to talk, but the one message that he wanted to make sure I heard was, 'I love you, take care of the boys,' she said.\n\nKing's family laid him to rest in a private funeral this week. She said she still feels his strong presence around her.\n\nI can very, very distinctly feel him around me and around us. I'm sure he is so happy at the coverage that his passing has gotten. ... Larry was a little boy in so many ways. And he used to always, you probably have 30 different soundbites of him saying, 'I pinch myself every day. I can't believe this is my life.' And he really, really did. So all of these beautiful tributes, you know, I'm sure he's thrilled, and the family, we're all just so happy and so proud of him for all the wonderful things that he did. He did a lot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKing was married a total of eight times throughout his life, to seven different women. Shawn was his last marriage and his longest.\n\nJust months before his death, King lost two of his five adult children when Andy, 65, and Chaia, 51, died within weeks of each other. Andy had a heart attack, while Chaia had been battling lung cancer.
Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\nBloomberg pummeled in debate debut – with Warren leading the onslaught\n\nThe Democrats' showdown Wednesday night in Las Vegas repeatedly put former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in his primary rivals' crosshairs as the surging billionaire made his debate-stage debut. But the event quickly expanded into an all-out melee and was easily the most aggressive debate of the nomination season to date, as each of the 2020 presidential candidates took sharp and often personal shots at one another.\n\nThe fight started out white-hot when, in her first turn at the microphone, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asserted she would support whoever wins the nomination, but warned that Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.\n\nShe said the field is running against somebody who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians -- and no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump, I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.\n\nIn another explosive moment, attendees erupted in the hall when Warren called on Bloomberg to release women from nondisclosure agreements they have signed concerning their civil complaints that he harassed them in the workplace. After a disappointing fourth-place finish in New Hampshire, Warren was particularly combative as she tangled with multiple rivals in a bid to distinguish herself once more ahead of Saturday's Nevada caucuses.

He said he didn't expect the Senate to vote against having him testify.\n\nRice, citing security clearance procedures for her own book, said she couldn't imagine withholding my testimony, with or without a subpoena or going public with information if she thought it was of national importance. But Bolton insisted his testimony would not have mattered.\n\nPeople can argue about what I should have said and what I should have done, he said.

Kirk Douglas, one of the most famous American leading men of the mid-20th century remembered for his dimpled chin, chiseled features, and virile Hollywood roles, died Wednesday at the age of 103, his family announced.\n\nIt is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103, Kirk's son, Michael Douglas, wrote in a statement shared to social media.\n\nHe continued: To the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.\n\nBut to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband, he added.\n\nMichael concluded his post by writing: Kirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come, and a history as a renowned philanthropist who worked to aid the public and bring peace to the planet.Let me end with the words I told him on his last birthday and which will always remain true. Dad- I love you so much and I am so proud to be your son.\n\nThe statement did not indicate exactly how or where he died.\n\nKIRK DOUGLAS SAYS WIFE ANNE SAVED HIS LIFE TWICE\n\nThe 75-year-old actor also shared photos of his late father which included several sweet family photos.\n\nA World War II veteran who survived a helicopter crash, a stroke, and two knee replacements, Douglas literally rose from rags to riches -- his father was a ragman -- and starred in over 80 films, including, perhaps most famously, Spartacus. He remained in the public spotlight well into his old age, if not as an actor then as a producer, author, and blogger.\n\nDouglas was born Issur Izzy Danielovitch on Dec. 9, 1916, to Russian Jewish parents in Amsterdam, New York.\n\n\n\nHis family was poor, and he claimed to have worked more than 40 jobs -- including stints as a professional wrestler, a waiter, and a janitor -- before becoming an actor.\n\nMICHAEL DOUGLAS REVEALS PLANS FOR DAD KIRK DOUGLAS' 103RD BIRTHDAY\n\n\n\nLoans, scholarships, and sweet-talking propelled the aspiring performer through St. Lawrence University and, eventually, the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, where he studied alongside Lauren Bacall and his future wife Diana Dill, who would give birth to his first and most famous son, Michael, in 1944.\n\n\n\nAfter two small roles on Broadway under his new stage name, Kirk Douglas, and a few years in the Navy during World War II, he made his on-screen debut with a part in 1946's The Strange Love of Martha Ivers at age 30.\n\nKirk's life was well lived, and he leaves a legacy in film that will endure for generations to come — Michael Douglas\n\n\n\nHowever, his big break came in 1949 when he starred as an ambitious boxer in the film noir classic Champion, which earned him his first of three Oscar nominations for Best Actor.\n\n\n\nThe role cemented Douglas' steely image, and with his distinctive raspy voice and piercing eyes he continued to take on intense, often cocky, characters in his films. He was once quoted as saying I've made a career of playing sons of b---hes.\n\nCATHERINE ZETA-JONES GUSHES OVER KIRK DOUGLAS\n\n\n\nHe played a ruthless Hollywood producer in The Bad and Beautiful (1952) and portrayed Vincent Van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956).\n\nThrough his own company, Bryna Productions -- named for his mother -- Douglas also produced and starred in the Kubrick-directed Paths of Glory (1957) and, more famously, in Spartacus (1960).\n\nDouglas' decision to give screen credit to Spartacus' blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo -- one of the Hollywood Ten who testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 -- helped bring an end to entertainment industry McCarthyism.\n\nAfter a divorce from his first wife in 1951, Douglas eloped with German-born publicist Anne Buydens in 1954, and despite affairs with fellow stars Joan Crawford, Marlene Dietrich and Pier Angeli, among others, he retained a reputation as a family man, increasingly devoted to his wife as he grew old.\n\nOf the secret to his long-lasting marriage, Douglas told Fox News in 2017: [Date night is] the same as it's been throughout our marriage. We spend what we call the 'golden hour' together at around 6:30 each night. We'll sit and talk and laugh and share our day and our thoughts with each other.\n\nAs his film career waned in the 1980s -- and his son's career took off -- Douglas focused on philanthropy, charity work, and his role as goodwill ambassador for the US State Department, a post he has held since 1963.\n\n\n\nHe received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981, the Jefferson Award for public service in 1983, and the French Legion of Honor in 1985.\n\n\n\nThough he never actually won an Academy Award, Douglas was granted an Honorary Oscar in 1996 for 50 years as a creative and moral force in the motion picture community.\n\nDouglas wrote three novels and several memoirs about his career, his newfound spirituality -- he embraced Judaism, the faith in which he was raised, after surviving a helicopter crash that killed two others in 1991 -- and his struggle with depression and regaining his speech after suffering a stroke in 1996.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\nIn 2003, Douglas finally starred alongside his son Michael, as well as his first wife and grandson Cameron, in It Runs in the Family, a movie about a dysfunctional multi-generation family trying to reconcile their differences. It earned disappointing box office figures and cool reviews.\n\nHe fared much better with critics at age 92, when he delivered sold-out performances of his one-man show, Before I Forget, presenting anecdotes about living through Hollywood's Golden Age and self-deprecating meditations on his achievements.\n\n\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 65 years (married May 29, 1954) Anne Buydens, their son Peter Douglas, two sons from his first marriage -- Michael and Joel Douglas -- and seven grandchildren.

The president is expected to be joined by his senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nTrump's visit to comes after he walked out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday afternoon as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi again rejected his pitch to fund the border wall.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNIELSEN BLASTS DEMS' 'MANUFACTURED' RHETORIC: On the eve of her trip to the southern border in Texas with President Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told FOX News' Sean Hannity that it was offensive and disrespectful for top Democrats to accuse Republicans of exploiting illegal immigration for political gain ... Speaking earlier on Wednesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez echoed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's language, telling America's Newsroom that this whole border security crisis … it really, I believe, is a manufactured crisis.\n\nNielsen, who met with congressional leaders Wednesday in the Situation Room with President Trump and has played a central role in talks to end a partial federal government shutdown, called that rhetoric disgraceful on Hannity.\n\nJUSTICE RETURNING TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT: What is in store for the Justice Department with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein expected to resign after soon after President Trump's nominee, William Barr, is confirmed as the nation's next attorney general? Badly needed reforms, says FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett in an analysis on FoxNews.com ... Jarrett writes: Under the failed leadership of fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein, the department has been operating more like the Department of Injustice in its handling of the out-of-control and ever-expanding Russia probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and overseen by Rosenstein. And that's only one example of Rosenstein's misconduct.\n\nNEW, DEADLY SUSPICION HANGS OVER DEM MEGADONOR: Democratic Party megadonor Ed Buck faces new questions this week as Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives investigate the death of a man at Buck's home - the second in less than two years ... In addition, a third man has come forward and claimed that the well-connected Buck lured him to a sex toy-filled apartment and injected him with crystal methamphetamine during a frightening encounter.\n\nBuck has not been arrested and his attorney says he is cooperating with authorities. Both of the men found dead at his home were black; so is the man who accused him of injecting him with meth.\n\nBuck, 64, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to a slew of liberal causes and candidates over the years, including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and a who's who of top California politicians. Critics have wondered whether Buck's wealth and influence caused authorities to slow-walk the investigation into the first death at his home.\n\nBILLIONS ON THE LINE IN BEZOS DIVORCE: Billionaire Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Wednesday that he and his wife MacKenzie are divorcing after 25 years of marriage, and some observers believe the soon-to-be ex-Mrs. Bezos could become the world's richest woman ... It isn't clear whether the Bezoses have a prenuptial agreement or any other contract affecting the financial terms of their divorce. However, without an agreement, MacKenzie Bezos would likely be entitled to an equal share of Bezos' personal fortune of $137.2 billion, Bloomberg reported.\n\nWith approximately $69 billion, MacKenzie Bezos would easily surpass the world's current richest woman, L'Oreal cosmetics heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who has an estimated net worth of $45.6 billion.\n\n\n\nTHE SOUNDBITE\n\nLIBERAL PARROTS IN THE MEDIA - If Democratic leaders saying it, reporters are saying it, too.

As a journalist, falling in love with a person you are covering is about as taboo as it gets. Add in the fact that the subject of such affection is a person who once earned the title The Most Hated Man in America, and you've got one big story to either share or conceal. As former Bloomberg journalist Christie Smythe tells me, it is in fact, a crazy story.\n\nI sat down with Smythe for her first TV interview since revealing her love affair with Martin Shkreli in a tell-all article published in Elle magazine in December. Shkreli is best known as Pharma-Bro, the former drug company CEO who is currently serving seven years in the low-security Allenwood Low Federal Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania for two counts of securities fraud and one count of securities fraud conspiracy.\n\nShkreli earned the nickname after raising the price of the life-saving HIV drug Daraprim by 5,000% overnight, sparking outrage and earning him the moniker for what was called his callous nature in making the dramatic price increase.\n\nREPORTER QUITS JOB, LEAVES HUSBAND AFTER FALLING FOR JAILED 'PHARMA BRO' MARTIN SHKRELI\n\nSmythe describes her budding relationship with Shkreli as something unimaginable at first saying, I mean, from where I started and where I ended up, it's like no one would believe that. If you wrote fiction about it, no one would believe it. But, I've been a journalist for 15 years. I've covered business and legal issues mostly. I graduated from the University of Missouri. I did a fellowship at Columbia. You know, I have a solid journalism education. I got into covering courts after moving to New York in 2008.\n\nSmythe began covering Brooklyn Federal Court for Bloomberg News in 2012, which is how she ended up reporting on Shkreli. She says, He was the villain everybody hated. So, of course, when he was arrested for securities fraud charges, massive story. My biggest story ever. That was how I got into the story. Like that was my first introduction to him.\n\nShkreli gave tabloid writers and business reporters plenty of fodder through the course of his trial, creating headlines as he rolled his eyes through testimony, and live-streamed at home after court, drinking the occasional beer.\n\nSmythe was one of the reporters who broke the story of Shkreli's arrest in 2015. She says that over time the two fell in love and that Shkreli is simply misunderstood, saying, He's just a very, very eccentric person. It doesn't play well in public, especially in negative light. He is phenomenally intelligent and charismatic, but also has no emotional intelligence and very little common sense and is very awkward. And if you combine all of those things, you get kind of this public relations disaster.\n\nTRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO LOWER DRUG PRICES IN FIGHT AGAINST BIG PHARMA\n\nSmythe says her marriage was already having difficulties and her attention to Shkreli only made things worse. But, she says, she didn't cross the line when it came to covering him.\n\nHer former employer disagrees. In a statement, a Bloomberg News spokesperson said in part, Ms. Smythe's conduct with regard to Mr. Shkreli was not consistent with expectations for a Bloomberg journalist. It became apparent that it would be best to part ways. Ms. Smythe tendered her resignation, and we accepted it.\n\nAfter Smythe left her job she says that's when things between the two heated up, and her marriage cooled off, telling me, After I left my job at Bloomberg and I was kind of on the way out with my husband, with my ex-husband, we were planning to split up. I visited Martin in prison and I just simply told him that I loved him.\n\nI asked Smythe if there was any sort of soft launch into the romantic conversation, to which she replied, No, once you're in, you're in. Smythe says that's when Shkreli told her that he loved her, too.\n\nThere is only one photo of the two together, taken during a visitation day inside the prison. Smythe says that over the course of his imprisonment the two have shared letters, spoken on the phone, exchanged emails and even talked about having a life together once he is released from custody. Smythe added that Shkreli also told her he wanted to have children with her, too. She told me, We talked about me freezing my eggs and after he suggested that that could be a possibility, I said, 'OK, sure, I'll go ahead and try, I'll look into it and see about that' and I did it and I'm really glad I did it. I mean, if things work out with Martin, great. If they don't, I feel like I've preserved that option for myself.\n\n'PHARMA BRO' MARTIN SHKRELI DENIED PRISON RELEASE TO RESEARCH CORONAVIRUS CURE\n\nI asked Smythe what she has to say to people who have told her she's been brainwashed and that Shkreli is using and manipulating her. She said she would tell them, You don't know what you're talking about, you don't know me and what an incredibly willful and independent person I have been since childhood. And you don't know Martin. Martin is not a brilliant manipulator when you get to know him.\n\nSmythe says she's also had to confront criticism about how Shkreli treated other female journalists, even calling him out for some of the comments he made online and says she doesn't support any form of harassment but says she believed Shkreli saw some of his comments as justified responses.\n\nAccording to Smythe, the relationship hit a snag after COVID hit and the Elle article was published. She says their relationship started to break down and the two stopped speaking. As of this writing, Smythe says they are back on speaking terms and have been corresponding through emails and phone calls.\n\nAs for what's next, she says they are figuring things out.\n\nI would love Martin to get out, she said. I would love him to start working on something productive that helps the world. And I'd like to play some sort of role in helping him get there. That's my dream.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJust this week, a federal judge denied Shkreli's second request for an early release, rejecting his claims that the prison's lockdown due to COVID-19 has put a strain on his mental health. In the 12-page ruling, the judge said Shkreli didn't make an extraordinary and compelling reason to modify his sentence.\n\nSo for now, Smythe waits for Shkreli's release. I asked her if she felt like she threw it all away in the end, as some of the post-Elle magazine headlines have suggested. Smythe told me, No, that was their interpretation. Obviously, they wanted to heighten the drama and the contrast of where my life was before and where it is now. So I understand those choices. But no, I didn't throw anything away. I chose a different path. And it wasn't for Martin specifically. Martin definitely was a catalyst, but helped kind of propel me in that direction. But, you know, I chose freedom, essentially.
Mary-Kate Olsen has finally settled her divorce from estranged husband Olivier Sarkozy.\n\nAttorneys for the former pair appeared virtually in front of a Manhattan judge on Wednesday and entered their decisions, adding that they expect to have a signed copy of the split agreement to the court by next week, according to Page Six.\n\nAs of this morning, we reached a final agreement, Sarkozy's lawyer Michael Mosberg told a judge during a Manhattan Supreme Court video hearing.\n\nCourt Justice Lori Sattler asked Olsen's lawyer, Nancy Chemtob, if she agreed, to which Chemtob replied, Yes, your honor, that is correct, everything is resolved. We've been working very hard. We do have a settlement.\n\nMARY-KATE OLSEN LOSES BID TO FILE FOR AN EMERGENCY DIVORCE AS JUDGE DETERMINES IT'S 'NOT AN ESSENTIAL MATTER'\n\nOlsen, 34, who filed to dissolve her marriage to the French banker in May, appeared on the video feed donning a simple black turtleneck as the respective parties' attorneys proceeded with formalities.\n\nOlsen lost a bid in her request for an emergency divorce amid the coronavirus pandemic in May. New York City Judge Michael Katz denied the request, saying the matter wasn't essential in nature and thus, the estranged pair had to follow the proper channels in settling their marital dispute.\n\nMARY-KATE OLSEN'S EMERGENCY DIVORCE FILING DENIAL IS LIKELY A 'VERY PUBLIC MESSAGE' FROM JUDGE: LEGAL EXPERT\n\nCurrently, we are only accepting essential, emergency matters for filing, a spokesperson for the New York courts said in a statement to Fox News at the time. The original filing was rejected by the New York County clerk because they did not follow the essential matter procedure.\n\nThey refiled under the essential matter procedure and the matter was referred to the ex-parte judge, a New York State Supreme Court judge, the note continued. He determined that it is not an essential matter, so they can't file anything at this point.\n\nOlsen was reportedly looking to speed up the process after she claimed Sarkozy terminated the lease of the New York City apartment they shared and sent a notice to Olsen that she needed to vacate by May 18.\n\nMARY-KATE OLSEN WANTED CHILDREN WITH OLIVIER SARKOZY BEFORE DIVORCE, SOURCE CLAIMS\n\nPage Six reported at the time that Olsen stated in her filing: I am petrified that my husband is trying to deprive me of the home we have lived in and if he is successful, I will not only lose my home but I risk losing my personal property, as well.\n\nAmid the divorce, Olsen moved to a $325,000 Hamptons rental for the summer.\n\nSattler pushed the lawyers to finalize the settlement, the outlet maintained.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nUntil I actually see the proof, I'm going to hold your feet to the fire a little bit, the jurist said, according to Page Six. I do trust and believe that this is happening, however, I'm going to keep control of the case to make sure this gets done and get them divorced.\n\nAttorneys for the pair did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.
2020 was not easy for many celebrity marriages, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's union was certainly no exception.\n\nThe 40-year-old reality star and the hip hop icon, 43, have been married for six years, after tying the knot in an extravagant televised celebration in Italy in 2014.\n\nOver the years, the fashion-forward couple has supported one another's professional endeavors, put on united fronts at awards shows and red carpet events, and of course, have been generous in giving fans a glimpse at their private lives on social media and on the Kardashian family's hit reality show.\n\nBut much like a number of seemingly sturdy celebrity marriages that fell apart in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, Kardashian and West's marital troubles loomed. Social media outbursts from West hinted at a divorce between the pair shortly after the rapper announced his 2020 bid for president. The couple appeared to keep it together, however, with Kardashian jumping at the defense for her husband more than once.\n\nHere's a look back at the couple's ups and downs over the last year and what may have contributed to their reported imminent divorce.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN HASN'T OFFICIALLY FILED FOR DIVORCE FROM KANYE WEST BECAUSE OF THEIR KIDS: REPORT\n\nKim Kardashian, Kanye West give a peek at their Calabasas compound\n\nAs 2021 neared, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were reportedly leading separate lives and had been spending a lot of time apart. But back in March 2020, the pair appeared in sync, sharing details about their home life and giving a rare glimpse at their famously minimalist Los Angeles mansion for the cover of Architectural Digest.\n\nThe rapper and his reality-star wife told the magazine that they let their kids run loose within their sprawling home, which features bare-bones furnishings and a beige and white aesthetic. West said it was designed with their family of six in mind.\n\nThe kids ride their scooters down the hallways and jump around on top of the low Axel tables, which they use as a kind of stage, West told the magazine. This house may be a case study, but our vision for it was built around our family.\n\nIn the end, we don't take it too seriously. We're not going to be fanatics, Kardashian agreed.\n\nKim defends Kanye amid Taylor Swift audio leak\n\nAlso in March, Kardashian voiced support for her husband when the full audio of the rapper's infamous four-year-old phone call with Taylor Swift about his controversial song Famous leaked.\n\nSwift used the opportunity to plug her donations to the World Health Organization and Feeding America in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and encouraged her fans to do the same. She also took aim at the Hollywood couple over the years-long feud.\n\nInstead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years)…SWIPE UP to see what really matters, Swift wrote on her Instagram Story Monday in reference to the leaked video.\n\nKardashian fired back, defending herself and West in a series of tweets.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST DIVORCE 'IMMINENT': REPORT\n\n.@taylorswift13 has chosen to reignite an old exchange - that at this point in time feels very self-serving given the suffering millions of real victims are facing right now, Kim began her statement.\n\nTo add, Kanye as an artist has every right to document his musical journey and process, just like she recently did through her documentary, Kardashian wrote. Kanye has documented the making of all of his albums for his personal archive, however has never released any of it for public consumption & the call between the two of them would have remained private or would have gone in the trash had she not lied & forced me to defend him.\n\nKanye announces his 2020 presidential run\n\nWest took center stage on Indepence Day last year when he shocked many with the formal announcement of his decision to run for president of the United States in the 2020 election on Twitter.\n\nWe must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future, he wrote. I am running for president of the United States! #2020VISION.\n\nAt the time, the mother of four showed her support for West by sharing his tweet on her own Twitter profile with an American flag. Additionally, a source told Us Weekly at the time, Kim has known about his aspirations and has been supportive.\n\nKardashian 'furious' at West over remarks about abortion\n\nDuring his first campaign rally in South Carolina in July, West brought up the possibility of divorcing his wife while claiming they considered aborting their first child, North, 7.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO KIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST SPLIT REPORTS: 'REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOALS'\n\nShe was crying… and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her not having this child. She had the pills in her hand, West continued (via People magazine).\n\nEven if my wife wants to divorce me after this speech she brought North into the world even when I didn't want to. She stood up and she protected that child. You know who else protected a child? 43 years ago, who do you think protected a child? West said at the rally as he began to sob uncontrollably.\n\nA source told the magazine that Kardashian was furious that he shared something so private. Kardashian later implied it was an episode brought on by his bipolar disorder.\n\nKanye's Twitter rant about divorcing Kim goes viral\n\nWest's fans began to fear for his mental health in late July as he went on a lengthy Twitter rant in which he touched on his marriage to Kim Kardashian, his fears of getting locked up and teased an upcoming album named after his late mother.\n\nIn one tweet, West wrote, Kim was trying to fly to Wyoming with a doctor to lock me up like on the movie Get Out because I cried about saving my daughters life yesterday.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, the Power rapper also claimed that he'd been trying to divorce Kardashian ever since she attended a prison reform event with Meek Mill in 2018.\n\nIn the same rant, he also shaded Kardashian's past Playboy spread and claimed that the reality star's mother, Kris Jenner, was no longer allowed to see his children.\n\nDays later, West issued a public apology to Kardashian. I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter. I did not cover her like she has covered me.to [sic] Kim I want to say I know I hurt you. Please forgive me. Thank you for always being there for me.\n\nKim breaks silence on Kanye's bipolar disorder\n\nIn response to West's social media outburst, Kardashian spoke up about the Yeezy founder's bipolar disorder for the first time, asking for compassion from the public.\n\nAs many of you know, Kanye has bi-polar disorder. Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand, Kardashian's statement shared to Instagram began.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN REPORTEDLY 'FURIOUS' AT KANYE WEST: A LOOK BACK AT THEIR RELATIONSHIP\n\nKardashian added she realized that her husband's words can carry particular weight and cause strong opinions and emotions due to his status as a public figure. However, she said she finds him to be a brilliant and complicated person that is simply struggling to deal with his mental illness at times.\n\nHe is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressure of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder, she wrote. Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions.\n\nTensions rise in Wyoming\n\nThe pair reunited in late July at a local fast-food joint in Cody, Wyo.\n\nHours after Kardashian's arrival broke, photos of the couple show the two appearing to be in an emotional argument while sitting in their car.\n\nIn the pics, Kardashian can be seen crying while she and West are talking to each other. At the time, a source claimed to People that the pair had been discussing divorce for several weeks.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST LEADING 'SEPARATE LIVES' IN MARRIAGE: REPORT\n\nA second insider claimed that both the KKW Beauty founder and the rapper felt the marriage is over.\n\nFamily vacations, Kanye squashes beef with Kris\n\nIn August, social media footage showed evidence that the couple jet-setted to an undisclosed tropical location enjoying some R&R with their kids. West appeared to provide evidence of the family's reunion with a video of himself and daughter, North, 7, busting some moves. Kardashian was noticeably heard laughing in the background.\n\nMeanwhile, West took to Twitter to make it known he had smoothed things over with Kris Jenner.\n\nMy mother in law Kris Jenner ... makes the best music playlist, West, 43, tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING DIVORCE FOR WEEKS: REPORTS\n\nThe appreciative comments about Jenner followed reports he referred to the famed mom-ager as Kris Jong-Un, called her boyfriend Corey Gamble Calmye, said the matriarch is involved in white supremacy because she didn't reply to his texts, and informed her that she couldn't see his kids.\n\nKim recalls assisting Kanye amid coronavirus fight\n\nIn October, more information about the Kardashian-West household came to light. In an interview with Grazia magazine, the prison reform advocate revealed she helped care for West as he fought the novel virus in early 2020 while also caring for their four kids.\n\nKanye had it way at the beginning, when nobody really knew what was going on, recalled Kardashian. It was so scary and unknown. I had my four babies and no one else in the house to help.\n\nThe star said she'd change her husband's sheets and help him get out of bed when he wasn't feeling good as he fought the infection.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN LAUGHS WITH KANYE WEST IN FAMILY VIDEO FOLLOWING REPORTS OF MARITAL STRUGGLES\n\nIt was a challenge because it was so unknown, she confessed. Changing his sheets with gloves and a face shield was really a scary time.\n\nKanye gifts Kardashian a birthday gift of a lifetime\n\nIn October, the KKW Beauty founder said she received the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime from West for her 40th birthday: a hologram of her late father, Robert Kardashian.\n\nShe recalled on Twitter: For my birthday, Kanye got me the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime. A special surprise from heaven. A hologram of my dad.\n\nThe KKW Beauty mogul also shared a two-minute clip of the hologram. I am so proud of the woman that you've become, Kimberly, and all that you have accomplished, the hologram of the late attorney said in part.\n\nWest reportedly also helped Kardashian celebrate her 40th by attending her birthday extravaganza in the tropics with friends.

Carly Waddell wanted to set the record straight regarding her divorce from her husband Evan Bass after three years of marriage.\n\nThe Bachelor in Paradise alum, 35, addressed rumors in a YouTube video posted on Sunday.\n\nI call this the divorce room because this is where Evan told me he wanted a divorce.

We greatly appreciate everyone's love and support and kindly ask that you please respect our family's privacy as we navigate through this.
In her Ingraham Angle monologue on Monday, host Laura Ingraham said Democrats are misuing American servicemembers for political theater just months after they roundly condemned Donald Trump for considering deploying National Guardsmen to quell left-wing riots in major cities across the country.\n\nIngraham played a montage of top Democrats, including former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut claiming at the time that Trump was misusing military and government assets for his own advantages.\n\nFast-forwarding to present day, Ingraham pointed to how District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser will hold National Guard troops in Washington until at least March.\n\nThousands of troops were called to action in town earlier this month in advent of President Biden's inauguration.\n\nThose Democrats have had a change of heart, she said, adding that Bowser's plan calls for 5,000 guardsmen to stay in the District -- down from about 25,000 called upon following Capitol unrest and ahead of Biden's ceremony.\n\nDid they really think that insane animal skin guy was planning to return to D.C. with other furry friends to make a stand? she said, referring to now-indicted Q-Anon Shaman Jacob Jake Angeli Chansley of Arizona.\n\nThis is political theater directed by Democrat leadership. They are using the military to ratchet up the drama of their kangaroo impeachment trial of former President Trump, the host said.\n\nIt allows them to play the victim despite evidence of any serious on-going threat. It furnishes them with a back door way to execute their next agenda item: purging the military of any political opponents.\n\nIngraham went on to explain that, according to The Hill, Democrats seek to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to address purported extremism within the Pentagon and related agencies.\n\nThe broader and more opaque the language, the easier it is to cancel military members and other government personnel who don't call in line politically or even culturally, she said.\n\nMost people would agree that generally dangerous extremists should not be allowed to serve and join the military. We don't want members of ISIS in our ranks and obviously KKK, of course not. That's not who the Democrats are talking about.\n\nIngraham went on to point out a recent comment from White House Press Secretary Jennifer Psaki, who said Biden ordered the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to execute a comprehensive threat assessment coordinated with the FBI and DHS on domestic violent extremists.\n\nThis assessment will draw on the analysis from across the government and as appropriate, nongovernmental organizations, said Psaki.\n\nIngraham warned that it is worth considering what NGOs Psaki is referring to.\n\nWhat non-governmental organizations is she talking about that will report on their fellow Americans? The ACLU, Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood? Anti-gun rights organizations?\n\nPresumably, they think anyone who disagrees with their far-left goals are extremists. From what we have already heard the Biden administration say, it's clear that they are going to use the power and surveillance of the U.S. Government to keep tabs on a lot more people than we ever would have thought would have been embedded in government agencies as domestic terrorists.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYes, law-abiding Americans whom the party in power think are getting out of the line.\n\nWhat if someone complains on Facebook that the federal government wastes money or says Roe V. Wade should be overturned. Or what if they are conservative baptists and believe sex outside of marriage is immoral? Will they now be considered extremists or even terrorists? We deserve to know, she continued.\n\nYou see where this is destined to lead. It is not to a freer and more united America.
Ioan Gruffudd and his wife, Alice Evans, are apparently splitting after 13 years of marriage.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, a rep for the couple said, As you can imagine, this is an incredibly difficult time for our family and we remain committed to our children. Thank you for respecting our privacy.\n\nThe 49-year-old actress revealed the news via Twitter late Monday evening writing how the Welsh actor, 47, has left his family.\n\nSad news. My believed husband/soulmate of 20 years, Ioan Gruffudd, has announced he is to leave his family, starting next week, she wrote in the since-deleted tweet according to Page Six.\n\nADELE REACHES DIVORCE SETTLEMENT WITH ESTRANGED HUSBAND NEARLY 2 YEARS AFTER SPLIT: REPORTS\n\nMe and our young daughters girls are very confused and sad, revealed Evans, as quoted by the outlet. We haven't been given a reason except that he 'no longer loves me.'\n\nEvans and Gruffudd married in 2007 and share two daughters, Ella, 11, and Elsie, 7.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Evans alleged that it was Gruffudd who took over her account and deleted her tweet.\n\nI didn't delete the tweet from a few hours ago about him leaving, she explained. He did. From my account.\n\nEvans added, And hell yes when I am being gaslit and mentally tortured then hell yes I will wash my linen in public.\n\nWhen one fan commented on Evans' tweets, calling them weird,, another person commented, I did the same when this happened to me. I think it's how one acknowledges there's no returning to what existed before. Accepting it by stating it publicly helps you to recognize the impossibility if reconciliation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nTo which Evans replied, This is exactly why. And thank you. Six months of harrassment: yes/no/maybe. I cannot live anymore like this.\n\nThen she added, Why? I have lost my mind.\n\nGruffudd's Twitter account is set to private.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian in February 2020, the Fantastic Four star implied that his busy work schedule and extended periods away from home have hurt his marriage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGruffudd said that he Evans have struggled the past four years, making time for each other because physically we're apart.\n\nAlice had come back, she had been away for a week. I was showing off – 'the kids are in bed' – and she was [like], 'Yeah, you've done one week [alone], try six months,' he said at the time.
Farrah Fawcett was destined to be a star.\n\nThe future Charlie's Angels icon was in her freshman year studying microbiology when she was named one of the 10 most beautiful coeds on the University of Texas campus. It was 1968.\n\nFARRAH FAWCETT MAINTAINED CLOSE BONDS WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS AFTER BECOMING FAMOUS\n\nAs a result, her photos were sent to various agencies in Hollywood before it caught the eye of agent David Mirisch. He took two years trying to convince a young Fawcett to leave behind Texas for Hollywood. By junior year, she finally agreed.\n\nCloser Weekly reported she was quickly signed by Screen Gems to a contract that paid her $350 a week.\n\nHer father was shocked, wondering what she was doing to make so much money a week, Mike Pingel, Fawcett's former assistant who currently runs CharliesAngels.com, told Closer Weekly. … Fans have told me when they saw her in those commercials, they were like, 'Who is that girl?' She just had the 'It' girl look.\n\nFawcett was soon in demand for TV guest roles for shows such as I Dream of Jeannie, Myra Breckinridge and The Flying Nun, just to name a few. But it was a poster that would forever change her life.\n\n'CHARLIE'S ANGELS' STAR JACLYN SMITH REFLECTS ON BATTLING BREAST CANCER\n\nAccording to the publication, Fawcett was approached in 1976 by Pro-Arts, Inc. to become their newest pinup. Fawcett agreed and 40 rolls of film were shot by photographer Bruce McBroom, the choice coming down to the famous one of her in the one-piece red swimsuit. That image reportedly remains the best-selling poster in history. The sultry image is currently enshrined at the Smithsonian.\n\nThe combination of that poster with 'Charlie's Angels' was a phenomenon that was hard to escape, said Pingel. Something like 12 million boys plus had that poster on their walls, so it's hard to avoid the big smile, big hair and that bathing suit.\n\nIt was also that same year when Jill Munroe came calling.\n\nCloser Weekly noted that Fawcett and then-husband, The Six Million Dollar Man star Lee Majors, often played tennis with producer Aaron Spelling, which led to her being cast as the heavenly blonde bombshell in the 1976 movie Charlie's Angels, which spawned the series that ran from that same year until 1981.\n\nCHERYL LADD EXPLAINS WHY SHE NEARLY TURNED DOWN ROLE\n\nCharlie's Angels was based on a wealthy mystery man named Charlie who ran a detective agency featuring three beautiful women (Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith). It was an immediate hit.\n\n… These three women were not only breaking the ceiling of being three leads on their own show, but they were number one in the ratings, Pingel explained. It was just lightning in a bottle. … The funny thing is that many of them told me that they were working so hard all the time, they had no time to really understand what was going on until they had a break. Then they would go out in public and be mobbed. And they all had stalkers; people were trying to break into their homes. [Co-star] Cheryl Ladd said, 'One day I was nobody and the next day everything I ate was something interesting to someone.\n\nBut despite the show's success, Fawcett was ready to spread her wings even further. The Guardian reported that after Season 1, she left.\n\nAt that point, I think she was like, 'I'm pretty good at doing something like this,' said Pingel. Farrah was wanting to expand her acting. The progression came and at the end of the first season, she wanted more as an actress. People are going to hate me for saying this, but she was done with the 'cookie-cutter' Jill Munroe, the beautiful girl that episode after episode did the same thing.\n\nPingel added Fawcett also knew her worth.\n\nSUZANNE SOMERS TALKS 'THREE'S COMPANY' FIRING\n\nEven in '77 she knew the power of her imagery and what money can come with that, and what she's worth as far as that's concerned, he explained. They were only offering her 2.5 percent of the merchandise. At that point, she already had her own poster coming out; she knew she wanted much more than that for her image and her rights. And that's why she didn't sign the contract. She kept saying to them, 'Can we renegotiate this?'\n\nCloser Weekly noted Fawcett was allowed to leave the show but was contractually obliged to make guest appearances six times, which she did. Ladd, who played Munroe's sister Kris, would go on to replace her.\n\nNot only did Fawcett stayed busy professionally, but she was also focusing on her personal life. Her marriage to Majors lasted from 1973 until 1982. And while her relationship with actor Ryan O'Neal was on again/off again for a number of years, they welcomed a son, Redmond James Fawcett-O'Neal, in 1985. Fawcett and O'Neal remained together in the last decade of the star's life.\n\nPingel said he had zero regrets working alongside the star.\n\nWhen I was being asked to even interview for the job, I was like, 'I don't really want this job, because I don't want Farrah Fawcett to be yelling at me at some point,' he admitted. And at some point that is gonna happen, because you're an assistant. But honestly, we had such a great rapport in our working relationship. … she was just a down home country girl. Very sweet, but the smartest businesswoman I've ever met. She knew the value of her and she wasn't going to take anything less than what she valued herself for.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFawcett passed away in 2009 at age 62 from anal cancer. Pingel said it's still difficult to think about his former boss all these years later.\n\nIt's tough for all of us who were very close to her, he explained. Because she had such a way about her. Such sweetness and just a genuine, amazing person. She's gone way too soon; she had so much more to offer… It's been 10 years this summer, and it's still hard to even wrap my head around the fact that she's no longer her. I know that's a weird thing to say. Believe it or not, I'll be in a store and I'll see something and still be like, 'Oh, Farrah would love that. I should call her.'\n\nShe was a boss. She was a friend. She was an angel, added Pingel.\n\nBut Fawcett's legacy lives on. Closer Weekly noted the Farrah Fawcett Foundation was designed to help with patient care and financial assistance for those battling cancer.\n\nBack in April 2018, Jaclyn Smith told Fox News she still cherishes fond memories from her times on Charlie's Angels.\n\nWe had laughs, we had so many laughs, said the now-73-year-old. Angels in chains, being chained together. Eating lunch together. It was an education and it was eye-opening because each girl was so unique with her own personality and style. And these are my friends today. That bond is what I really remember.\n\nThe friendship is what I treasure from that. The friendship. Aaron Spelling was so dear to me. He's somebody I miss. He was a personal friend, as well as the producer of that show and the creator. We've lost some people. John Forsythe, what a gentleman. David Doyle. And of course Farrah [Fawcett]. It's bittersweet to think back.

The marriage of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip has lasted for over 70 years — yet it hasn't escaped rumors of alleged affairs.\n\nBritish author Ingrid Seward, who is also editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, has been covering the royals since the 1980s and has written over 20 books on the subject. Her latest one, My Husband and I: The Inside Story of 70 Years of Royal Marriage, analyzes the lasting union between Elizabeth, 92 and Philip, 97.\n\nIn the book, Seward investigates allegations of Philip's affairs that have lingered for decades. As previously reported by Town & Country, the Duke of Edinburgh has been linked to numerous women, most notably Pat Kirkwood in the '30s and '40s, a stage actress whose legs were coined the eighth wonder of the world.\n\nPhilip and Kirkwood reportedly met on seven different occasions, the first of which Philip went to her dressing room before a performance in London in 1948. That initial meeting purportedly led to dinner and dancing until dawn. Elizabeth, who was then a princess, was eight months pregnant with Prince Charles at the time.\n\nAccording to the U.K.'s Mirror, Kirkwood denied claims of any illicit relationship with Prince Phillip until her death in 2007 at age 86.\n\nIn my research, I never got a conclusive answer, Seward told Fox News about all the rumors. There's so much gossip about Philip and his affairs, but all the women that deny it, that have been picked out of possibilities of having affairs — well, most of them are dead now. … And Philip himself obviously denies it.\n\nIn 2012, The Telegraph reported royal biographer and historian Michael Thornton had custody of the letters between Philip and Kirkwood. Thornton claimed he wasn't allowed, by the terms of Kirkwood's will, to show the letters to anyone except the person who will be chosen as Philip's official biographer after his death.\n\nHowever, the publication noted nothing in the letters confirmed anything improper occurred between the prince and the showgirl.\n\nThe Telegraph added it was photographer Baron Nahum who introduced his pal Philip to Kirkwood at the London Hippodrome, where she was headlining in the revue Starlight Roof. Thornton claimed Kirkwood was reportedly upset that Philip never released an official denial of the affair to protect her reputation.\n\nKirkwood reportedly wrote to Philip, … if there had been some support from your direction, the matter could have been squashed years ago, instead of (my) having to battle a sea of sharks single-handed.\n\nPhilip replied, Short of starting libel proceedings, there is absolutely nothing to be done. Invasion of privacy, invention and false quotations are the bane of our existence.\n\nKirkwood reportedly went on to tell one journalist: A lady is not normally expected to defend her honor. It is the gentleman who should do that. I would have had a happier and easier life if Prince Philip, instead of coming uninvited to my dressing room, had gone home to his pregnant wife on the night in question.\n\nIn addition to Kirkwood, Philip has also been linked to other actresses, including Helene Cordet, Merle Oberon and Anna Massey. People magazine previously reported rumors persisted that Philip was actually the father — not the godfather — of Cordet's two children. She called the paternity gossip ridiculous and claimed they were fathered by French fighter pilot Marcel Boisot.\n\nNo one is saying anything [about these stories] and probably won't until after the queen dies, said Seward. No one will say anything because anything would be very hurtful to her if indeed they were true. But, there are lots of stories. You can't ignore it.\n\nIn 2017, Netflix's The Crown implied Philip may have had an affair with Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova in the 1950s. However, People noted there is no evidence that a relationship ever occurred.\n\nPeople have often said, 'He must have been unfaithful,' but there is no solid evidence for that, said the show's historical consultant Robert Lacey to the publication. When you've seen the episodes, you get the feeling why people made that supposition. But there is no evidence for it.\n\nThere was one woman who rocked the royal household — and it wasn't an alleged mistress.\n\nSeward revealed that despite tabloids claiming Philip never welcomed his former daughter-in-law Princess Diana when she said I do to his son Charles in 1981, the pair did connect before her seemingly fairytale marriage fell apart by rumors of his infidelity.\n\nHe did everything he could to help her, said Seward. And he wrote these very charming letters saying, 'I too was an outsider and it's very difficult to marry into this family.' … But when the marriage started to fall apart, she became very difficult. And his tone got harsher. And at the end Diana says… that she hated him.\n\nShe absolutely hated him. But to begin with they had a very good relationship. It just deteriorated as Diana's marriage deteriorated. Philip's reasoning for this was that her actions were derogatory to the monarchy. … [He felt] if people are reading all these stories, they will lose respect for the royal family and that's what worried him. And sadly, by the end, she wasn't on speaking terms with him.\n\nDiana and Charles officially divorced in 1996. In 1997, Diana passed away at age 36 after suffering from injuries she sustained in a Paris car crash.\n\nDespite all the gossip and scandals Elizabeth and Philip had to face over the years, their bond endured.\n\nIt's quite extraordinary really, said Seward. … In those days, it wasn't quite so unusual to have a young girl fall in love with someone and stay in love with them. But she never really looked at anyone else once she met him. He was just gorgeous. He was so handsome, tall, blonde and very funny. And you know, women love funny men.\n\n… I think women just adored him because he was such a handsome specimen. … And he has an amazing charm when he wants to use it, an amazing charm. He's a very interesting character. … Whatever he may have done in his private life, no one has really put their finger on that. He's always put his duty to the queen first.
After five years of dating, Blake Shelton stunned Gwen Stefani with a marriage proposal near the end of 2020, leaving their fan bases equally excited for what's to come.\n\nThe possibility of walking down the aisle for a second time is one Stefani, 51, had been frequently asked about in interviews and by fans during the power couple's dating years. The former No Doubt singer filed for divorce from Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale in 2015 after 20 years together. Similarly, Shelton endured a public divorce from country star Miranda Lambert after four years of marriage. He was also previously married to and divorced from Kaynette Williams.\n\nJust months into their engagement, Stefani and Shelton have both opened up about their past and future, including details of the country star getting down on one knee to what they have in store for a future ceremony.\n\nHere's a look back at their romance and all the things the musicians have said about their love since becoming one step closer to officially saying I do.\n\nBLAKE SHELTON REVEALS HE HID GWEN STEFANI'S ENGAGEMENT RING IN HIS TRUCK FOR 'ABOUT A WEEK'\n\nThe proposal\n\nOn Oct. 27, 2020, Stefani shared the big news on Instagram with a snap showing her kissing the country music singer while holding her left hand up to the camera, showing off her new ring.\n\n@blakeshelton yes please! she captioned the snap.\n\nShelton posted the same picture of the pair and captioned it: thanks for saving my 2020... And the rest of my life.. I love you. I heard a YES!\n\nDuring an appearance on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in January, Stefani called the proposal magical.\n\nGWEN STEFANI AND BLAKE SHELTON ANNOUNCE ENGAGEMENT\n\nWasn't expecting it at the moment it happened at all, she admitted. Didn't have any idea.\n\nI was sort of like, 'What's happening with us?' Stefani added about their relationship before Shelton, 44, finally asked her to marry him.\n\nInvolving Stefani's kids\n\nStefani shares three sons – Kingston, 14, Zuma, 12, and Apollo, 6 – with Rossdale. Shelton has no kids of his own but has seemingly grown close to Stefani's children.\n\nShortly after announcing their engagement, reports claimed that Shelton even asked Stefani's sons for their permission to wed the star before proposing.\n\nA source close to Stefani told People magazine that Shelton reached out to her children before getting down on one knee and proposing to his longtime love.\n\n10 CELEBRITIES WHO GOT ENGAGED IN 2020\n\nBlake told her boys that he wanted to propose and ask their permission, the source alleged to the outlet. Her family very much approves of him. He's an amazing partner and a great dad to the boys. Gwen is ecstatic. The proposal was a surprise.\n\nPlus, the boys will have a large part in the upcoming nuptials, said the source.\n\nGwen's sons are just really solid, sweet kids, and they're so excited for Blake and Gwen to get married, the insider shared. They can't wait to stand by their sides.\n\nWedding plans\n\nStefani and Shelton followed in the footsteps of a bevy of other Hollywood stars who became engaged in 2020, an unprecedented year given the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe health crisis is still surging around the globe, meaning the date of the duo's future ceremony is unknown. Earlier this month, Stefani admitted to Fallon that they have no plans because of the pandemic.\n\nAlso, back in December, Stefani appeared on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, where she spilled details of her dream nuptials to the country star and how the pandemic will impact it.\n\nIt's so funny to even say 'engaged.' It feels so weird. People have been saying it for so long, like five years, 'Are you getting married? Are you engaged?' And now we actually are and it feels like I'm in a cartoon or something, Stefani told Seacrest, via People magazine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Let Me Reintroduce Myself singer said her one request is for her parents to be in attendance when she walks down the aisle, noting that the global pandemic makes it difficult to nail down a date.\n\nI would say I just want my parents there at this point. My parents wouldn't come to Thanksgiving because they're so scared, so really would rather it not be a COVID situation. Like, I would rather not have masks and that kind of thing, Stefani said.\n\nStefani, her boys and Shelton have reportedly been spending most of their time during the pandemic at Shelton's Oklahoma ranch.

For that same time period, Love is Blind garnered more than 350,000 social media engagements, such as comments, retweets and likes, according to the outlet.\n\nThat rate of engagement would be considered extremely high, Talkwalker's marketing operations manager, Rafael Sternbach-Le Noury, told the Journal.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nDozens of fan pages have been created on Facebook – some with more than 7,500 members.\n\nGood, bad and ugly, viewers had a lot to say about Love is Blind.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nBy shortly after 2 a.m. on Thursday – the scheduled finale date – people were eager to see how the show ends.\n\nNETFLIX CEO'S NEW BOOK TO SHED LIGHT ON STREAMING GIANT'S WORK CULTURE\n\nWhile the show's creator and executive producer Chris Coelen would not give the Journal any spoilers, he shared some useful information about how the ending: Without giving anything away, the people who decided to get married, anybody that does that is still together today, he said.

Candace Cameron Bure began the New Year with words of encouragement to her fans, but soon after she found herself caught in another controversy on social media.\n\nThe Fuller House actress responded to a swarm of criticism she received after sharing a family photo on Instagram in which she shared well wishes for a positive 2021.\n\nHappy New Year from the Bures!! Looking forward to what 2021 has in store. I'm praying for unity, grace, humility, compassion and love for mankind. With God, all things are possible 🙏🏻. Sending virtual hugs and kisses! XO, Bure captioned the pic, which features herself, her husband, Valeri Bure, and their kids Natasha, 22, Lev, 20 and Maksim, 18.\n\nThe 44-year-old was none too pleased when some claimed the photo looked weird and like a Ralph Lauren ad, while others mocked some of her kids' expressions.\n\nCANDACE CAMERON BURE SAYS SHE'D RATHER 'SHARE JESUS WITH PEOPLE' THAN RETURN TO 'THE VIEW'\n\nWow- I post a family photo and you all find everything you don't like about it or can make fun of. Do better than that. Please, Bure responded.\n\nBure noted the photo was taken by her Fuller House co-star Dave Coulier's wife, photographer Melissa Coulier. The married couple and their youngest, Maksim, smile for the photo, while Natasha and Lev have more serious faces as they pose around a porch.\n\nNatasha caught wind of the backlash over her expression and sarcastically commented, Omg!!!! I didn't smile or look at the camera sue me!!!\n\nBure's daughter then added: Vibes.\n\nWhile the backlash dominated the photo shortly after it was posted, some of Bure's famous pals reacted with kind words.\n\nCANDACE CAMERON BURE ON WHY SEX 'IS SOMETHING TO BE CELEBRATED AS A CHRISTIAN'\n\nPretty in white, actress Kristin Chenoweth replied, referring to the form-fitting white dress Bure wears in the pic.\n\nThe most beautiful family inside and out, trainer Kira Stokes commented.\n\nI'm buyin what ur sellin! celebrity hair stylist Paul Norton said.\n\nFormer Disney star Christy Carlson Romano wrote: Slayyyyyy Bures!!!!\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Hallmark actress' dismissal of social media trolls comes months after she was shamed for posting a photo with her husband that showed him cupping one of her breasts. The pic did not sit well with members of her Christian fan base, who sounded off in similar critical remarks. At the time, Bure felt no remorse for sharing the pic, writing, Classic Val. He approved this post.\n\nBure also clapped back, revealing that she found the backlash funny and added that she and her husband of nearly 25 years have so much fun together.\n\nLater, in an interview with Fox News, Bure said she felt like she needed to respond to the backlash because she doesn't ever feel that sexual intimacy has to be lacking in marriage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI love the fact that so many people had an opinion on it. It made me laugh because I wasn't trying to make a statement, she said of the cheeky photo. This is just how my husband and I are. You know, we adore each other and we still have fun and we're spicy together.\n\nWe have a playful, loving marriage and I think that's why we're still married 24 years later, she continued. But I did respond because I always get bummed out when people have been married for so long and then I feel like the joke is always like, 'Oh, we're married – so that means we don't have sex anymore.' And it's kind of like that a lot. And so I thought it was just a cute, funny picture and it was playful and it's very much reflective of our personalities in real life.\n\nFox News' Stephanie Nolasco contributed to this report.
A man from New Jersey has been charged with disorderly conduct after setting off fireworks in celebration of his buddy's engagement — and scaring the living daylights out of everyone within earshot.\n\nNathan Sanders, 23, had arranged to set off the fireworks outside of an indoor rock-climbing facility in Howell Township, to coincide with a marriage proposal his friend was planning on Wednesday. However, the sound of the fireworks was mistaken for gunfire, and immediately caused panic at the adjacent Xscape movie theater, according to Howell Township police.\n\nMOM ACCIDENTALLY RECORDS OWN REACTION INSTEAD OF DAUGHTER'S PROPOSAL\n\nSome patrons believed the gunfire to be coming from inside the theater. Police responded to the scene, but could not immediately confirm there was an actual shooting.\n\nPatrons of the movie theater were evacuated and detained during the preliminary investigation.\n\nAccording to police, a manager at the movie theater had discovered that Sanders, from Lakewood, had set off fireworks outside of the adjacent Climb Zone. Law enforcement soon discovered the remnants of discharged fireworks nearby.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nSanders was placed under arrest and charged with a fireworks infraction and disorderly conduct, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe was released from custody the same evening.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMr. Sanders lit off the fireworks while a friend was proposing marriage. There was no intent to cause panic to theatre patrons, police wrote on Facebook.\n\nObviously this was a very poor decision rather than an overt act.
Evangelist Franklin Graham shared a hopeful message on Fox & Friends Friday for anyone suffering amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn addition to the COVID-19 crisis, Graham said: And all of us go through catastrophic events in our life: marriage problems, health problems, so forth.\n\nFRANKLIN GRAHAM ASKS IF PELOSI PROMISED 10 REPUBLICANS 'PIECES OF SILVER' TO BETRAY TRUMP\n\nThe president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association wrote the forward to Who's in Charge of a World That Suffers? authored by his father, the late Rev. Billy Graham, in 1981 and is now being rereleased.\n\nEven though my father's been dead for two years, his voice is still being heard and this is a book that can help change your life right here in the middle of this pandemic, said Graham, who is also the CEO of Samaritan's Purse.\n\nThe preacher shared a faith-filled message, quoting from John 3:16 and giving a call for salvation, asking anyone who hasn't made the decision to follow Christ to do so today.\n\nGod made us and he created us and he loves us. He sent his son Jesus Christ from heaven to this earth to take our sins. He died on the cross. He rose again from the grave. He's alive and he can come into each and every heart that invites him, he said.\n\nMAX LUCADO: YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS — WHATEVER MESS YOU'RE FACING GOD WILL USE FOR GOOD\n\nExplaining pain and suffering, Graham said the devil wants to destroy everything as the god of this age, adding, but we know that if we put our faith and trust in Christ, we come under his shelter, we come under his protection, and nobody can snatch us out of his hand.\n\nGraham also thanked President Trump and his administration for their efforts protecting religious freedom ahead of National Religious Freedom Day Saturday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAbout 260 million people live in areas where they are persecuted for their faith. You had, I believe it was around 3,000 Christians, close to 4,000 that lost their lives because of their faith in God. Churches were destroyed. Close to 10,000 churches were attacked and destroyed last year, so religious freedom is very important and I appreciate the fact that Donald Trump made this a big issue in his administration, he said in part.\n\nI hope that Joe Biden will see the value of religious freedom and that he will protect it as well, Graham concluded.
The following is a look at the faith of the top 2020 Democratic presidential candidates:\n\nPete Buttigieg: Episcopalian\n\nFormer Mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg was baptized Catholic but says he did not consider participating in the church because he is gay. He eventually settled on the Episcopal Church, the American branch of Anglicanism and a progressive branch, which voted to allow same-sex marriages.\n\nI was reluctant to talk about (religion) for a long time, Buttigieg told CNN. But after he married his husband, Chasten Glezman, at the Cathedral of St. James, and declared his candidacy, he has pointed to his faith on the campaign trail.\n\nHe questioned whether President Trump believes in God, called Vice President Mike Pence a cheerleader for the porn-star presidency, and condemned conservative Christians as moral hypocrites for supporting the Trump administration.\n\nAmy Klobuchar: Congregationalist\n\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said she is a Congregationalist, a member of the United Church of Christ, and her husband is Catholic.\n\nFaith is very important to me, it helped me get through my dad's addiction. I think everyone should be able to practice whatever religion they want in this country, Klobuchar said during a CNN town hall. That's the United States of America. Or not practice religion. But for me that's a very important part of my life.\n\nBernie Sanders: Jewish\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told the New York Times he is proud to be Jewish but is not actively involved in organized religion.\n\nI am Jewish, Sanders told the Times' editorial board when asked whether he believes in God. I am proud to be Jewish. I was bar mitzvahed from the Kings Highway Jewish Center, a long time ago. I am not actively involved in organized religion.\n\nSanders says he believes in God and freedom of religion in contrast to President Trump, whom he says practices discrimination by restricting immigration from a number of Muslim-majority countries.\n\nJoe Biden: Roman Catholic\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has not been shy about his Roman Catholic faith, with which he has always identified.\n\nI find great solace in my faith, Biden told NPR in 2017. I happen to be a Roman Catholic, a practicing Catholic … I found that, for me, the externalities of my faith bring me a sense of peace. … My son died, and he had this set of rosaries on and I've been wearing it since and I will wear it till I die. … I'm not saying when I pray the rosary God's gonna help me — it's just solace.\n\nThe former senator was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina for his support for abortion rights, which he refused to comment on saying it was his personal life. He also diverges from the church's official stance on LGBTQ rights, backing same-sex marriage.\n\nElizabeth Warren: Methodist\n\nAlthough Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she grew up as a Methodist, she attends various churches and told a CNN town hall that she taught Sunday School to fifth graders.\n\nMy faith animates all that I do, Warren told reporters at the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's annual convention in Chicago. I truly do believe in the worth of every single human being.\n\nTom Steyer: Episcopalian\n\nThe billionaire-turned-liberal activist Tom Steyer was raised by a Jewish father and Episcopalian mother, and he said he was taken to synagogue and church and given the option to choose synagogue, church, or neither.\n\nAt 30 years old, he told his mom he believes in God. He has adamantly pushed for impeachment against President Trump and fighting climate change, and says it is informed by his Christian faith.\n\nSteyer told ABC News' Journeys of Faith with Paula Faris every day he inks a Jerusalem cross on his hand to remind himself to do the right thing.\n\nMichael Bloomberg: Jewish\n\nBillionaire and former mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg is running for president out of his own pocket but in 2007 he lamented America was never going to elect a short, divorced Jewish billionaire commander-in-chief.\n\nAccording to a 2010 story in The Wall Street Journal, Judaism never took a stronghold in the New York mayor's own life, his advisers and other observers say. He believes in God, but is more likely to be found at church for a political event than temple for worship. He grew up among very few Jews in Medford, Massachusetts, but his family maintained some traditions, such as a kosher kitchen and Hebrew school.\n\nA member of the Temple Emanu-El, the Upper East Side Reform synagogue, Bloomberg didn't raise either of his daughters Jewish nor is his current companion Jewish.\n\nAndrew Yang: Progressive Christian\n\nWith a campaign slogan Humanity First and MATH hats to counter Trump's MAGA hats, businessman-turned-politician Andrew Yang defends his signature campaign promise, the freedom dividend, or a universal basic income of $1,000/month for every American, using his pastor, Rev. Dr. Mark Mast.\n\nI was brought up in an entirely secular household, Yang told the H3 Podcast in December. His wife, Evelyn is a Christian and together they are raising their kids in the church.\n\nThe church we belong to is very progressive. They've got a rainbow flag up out front, he added about the Reformed Church of New Paltz. Certainly I'm very excited to have my little boys in that kind of environment because I can see that they love it.\n\nTulsi Gabbard: Hindu\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii became the first Hindu to join either chamber of Congress, sworn in on the Bhagavad Gita in 2013, but on her website, she highlights being raised in a multi-faith family studying both the Christian and Hindu scriptures.\n\nShe grew up celebrating Christmas and Janmashtami, the birth of Krishna, and she says, rather than saying I'm 'religious,' it would be more accurate to say that I am a very spiritual person, and yoga and meditation are the focus of my spiritual practices.\n\nGabbard, the first female combat veteran to run for president, said her faith was put to the test while she served in Iraq. She married her husband, Abraham Williams, in 2015 in a traditional Vedic wedding ceremony.
Last month, Chinese leader Xi Jinping reportedly made China's wealthiest man Jack Ma disappear. Here at home, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey made the president of the United States disappear. Both of these moves were shows of strength. And the parallels between them should shake every American to their core.\n\nSilicon Valley tech giants like Twitter and Facebook are now, undisputedly, the most powerful companies in the history of the world. The Dutch East India Company wielded a private militia, but it still couldn't control what people said and read.\n\nAs of today, President Trump will have access to neither the nuclear codes nor a Twitter account. But our new class of unelected corporate monarchs now controls whether and how Americans can hear any democratically elected president in the future.\n\nJUDGE ANDREW P. NAPOLITANO: FREE SPEECH, THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND OUR MODERN TECH-FILLED WORLD\n\nThis is the power of the 21st-century Leviathan, far more insidious than anything Thomas Hobbes imagined. It's the unholy marriage between big government and big business, through which corporations operate as the extended tentacles of the state.\n\nIt's the birth of woke capitalism – a toxic new brew of profit-seeking and wokeism. It's a cultural revolution perpetuated not just by politicians, but by the leaders of big corporations – especially in Silicon Valley.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDon't private companies get to decide who uses their platforms? Yes – if they're actually behaving as private companies. But in reality, today's corporate behemoths in Silicon Valley are effectively doing the work of big government under the cloak of private enterprise to evade constitutional constraints. Here's how the game works.\n\nFirst, Congress endowed big tech with the special corporate privilege of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that immunizes technology companies from any liability in state court for censoring or otherwise regulating user content.\n\nSecond, liberal congressmen threatened those same companies at hearings for the last year saying that if they fail to remove hate speech from White nationalists, they would be punished.\n\nThird, liberal lawmakers congratulated social media companies after they go on to censor content that Democrats don't like.\n\nFourth, tech titans took their most aggressive actions of all just as Democrats are poised to have control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives for the first time in over a decade.\n\nAnd fifth – of course – Silicon Valley billionaires made staggeringly one-sided campaign contributions to those same Democratic candidates as a show of good faith, and to remind them where their bread is buttered.\n\nIn 2020, keeping money out of politics ceased to be a liberal mantra. Instead, blending profits with politics became the new progressive way. Consequently, we have devolved from a three-branch federal government to one with a headquarters in Silicon Valley and a branch office in Washington D.C., and with no pesky constitutional term limits for Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nHopefully, victories in court against today's new class of state-like actors will spawn a cultural revival that steadily restores the voice of every American.\n\nThe great challenge for today's conservative movement isn't to simply dismantle big government. It's to dismantle the powerful henchmen of big government in the private sector. They can fire you, tarnish your reputation, excise you from the Internet and cancel your identity. You can either speak your mind freely or enjoy the comforts of modern life. But you can no longer safely do both.\n\nConservative solutions must be prudent, not merely reactionary. Enacting regulations out of spite will only favor big business leaders who deftly capture the regulatory process. Likewise, repealing Section 230 would be a boon to big tech in the long run. The statute was a bad mistake but repealing it now would simply empower Silicon Valley's titans against smaller startups since larger companies can better withstand legal liability.\n\nInstead, the right first step is to work through the last institutional bastion that we can trust – our court system – to recognize that state action dressed up as private business is still state action. The First Amendment applies to big tech censorship, a view supported by certain Supreme Court precedents.\n\nHopefully, victories in court against today's new class of state-like actors will spawn a cultural revival that steadily restores the voice of every American – in their places of work and their sites of worship, at the dinner table and on the Internet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNo doubt this will be difficult for both populist conservatives and classical free-market conservatives to swallow. But to borrow from Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, we're not in 1980 anymore. The problem isn't just big government; it's the woke-industrial complex. Defeating that monster should be the defining challenge of the new conservative movement.\n\nIf we succeed, the prize is worth winning: a revival of true democracy and true capitalism in America. To save both, we need to disentangle each from the other. The leaders who help the Republican Party understand this new reality will hold the keys to the GOP's future – and more importantly, our country's future as well.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM VIVEK RAMASWAMY
Just two months after Enrique Pena Nieto's tenure as Mexico's president came to an end, his wife has announced that she's divorcing him.\n\nAngelica Rivera, the former first lady, took to Instagram on Friday to announce that after nearly nine years of marriage she would be divorcing Nieto.\n\nToday all my energy, strength and love are focused on continuing to be a good mother, on recovering my life and my professional career, Rivera said, according to a translation of a post made in Spanish.\n\nShe said she had always given her all to her marriage and deeply regrets this very painful situation.\n\nRumors circulated earlier this week that the couple split back in December. Nieto's six-year term ended Dec. 1.\n\nThe pair, who wed in November 2010, were last seen together in January at the funeral of a prominent leader of his Institutional Revolutionary Party. Their last official public appearance was on Sept. 15, for Mexican Independence Day celebrations.\n\nMEXICAN JOURNALIST KILLED IN GULF COAST STATE OF TABASCO\n\nBeyond Mexico's soaring murder rates and strained diplomacy with U.S., Nieto's presidency was mired in scandal and corruption cases -- one even involving Rivera.\n\nIn 2014, many Mexicans were outraged when it was reported that Rivera was living in a multimillion-dollar home registered to a builder who'd been awarded public contracts.\n\nRivera, a onetime telenovela actress, claimed she had paid for the mansion legitimately with earnings from her acting career. She said she was selling her stake in the property.\n\nAccording to local reports, the couple remain cordial. This was the second marriage for both Nieto and Rivera. Nieto and his three children remain in Mexico, while Rivera and her children have gone to her residence in the United States.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
People often ask what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would say today. No need to second guess. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n\nSurely, the violence at the U.S. Capitol would have broken his heart, as would the partisan witch hunts that seem to multiply daily.\n\nWe adopt the means of nonviolence because our end is a community at peace with itself, he once said. We will try to persuade with our words, but if our words fail, we will try to persuade with our acts.\n\nREMEMBERING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.\n\nMy earliest memory of my uncle was his marriage to Coretta. I was the flower girl at the wedding, which took place on the lawn of my aunt's parent's house in Marion, Ala., in June 1953. I was almost 3 years old. My early memories were just like snapshots, yet I knew even then that I was a member of a family whose faith in God was the driving force.\n\nMy granddaddy, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., and my grandmother, Alberta Williams King, instilled in their three children, Christine, Martin and Alfred, that the King Family Legacy is one established by God, in faith, hope and love. It was that faith, that deep and consequential love of God, that brought my family to a level of leadership of the 20th-century civil rights movement.\n\nNonviolence is absolute commitment to the way of love. Love is not emotional bash; it is not empty sentimentalism, Uncle ML said. It is the active outpouring of one's whole being into the being of another.\n\nWe were also taught that forgiveness must be bestowed willingly, freely and without conditions. Those were lessons we fell back on many times as we were called on to forgive, publicly and sincerely, the most heinous of crimes.\n\nIt's true we lived in the spotlight, and many of the civil rights leaders passed through our homes on a regular basis during their journey. Yet, in many ways, we were just a normal family. My daddy, Rev. A.D. King, would wrestle with his older brother, Uncle ML, while the family chuckled in the background. They were playful and joyful and growing up around them was a lot of fun.\n\nI have decided to stick with love, my uncle famously said. Hate is too great a burden to bear.\n\nWhen Uncle ML was assassinated in 1968, I was 17 years old and in the restive way of teenagers, I wanted to blame all White people. I wanted to give hate room to grow in my heart. But my mother and father and my grandparents and Uncle ML reminded all of us that hate only begets more hate, and there should not be room in the world for animosity or mistrust or hostility.\n\nWhen my uncle was killed on April 4, 1968, I remember talking to my daddy about my feelings of hating White people. Daddy rocked me in his arms and said to me, White people march with us, they go to jail with us, they pray with us, they live with us, and they die with us. White people didn't kill your uncle, the Devil did.\n\nThe next year I was called to forgive again – not only those still-unknown people who had killed my uncle, but now they had killed my father. I had to forgive yet another injustice; including all those that had shrugged off my daddy's death and called it a suicide.\n\nDuring this time from 1968 to 1974, much was happening in my life. I became engaged to be married in 1968, a bride in 1969, and a mother in 1970. Still reeling from the brutal deaths of my daddy and uncle I experienced two abortions and a miscarriage. Then on June 30, 1974, my beloved grandmother Alberta King was murdered while playing the Lord's Prayer on the organ during Sunday services at Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBack then I didn't think my broken heart was big enough to forgive and to go on loving my fellow men and women. But love and forgiveness were the King family legacy, and while that legacy sometimes felt like a burden, I see now how it is a gift.\n\nI have decided to stick with love, my uncle famously said. Hate is too great a burden to bear.\n\nThat's what he would tell us today, and what I say whenever I am given an opportunity. This year, as we observe MLK Day, I urge everyone to remember that it is designated not as a day off from work, but as a day on of service. We can all find something constructive to do in our communities, even if it's just shaking the hand of the neighbor who supported a different candidate. Anything we can do to increase the peace is more than worth our efforts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLove, my Uncle ML said, is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.\n\nWhen we learn to value the human personality, and understand that we are one blood and one human race, we can learn to live together as brothers and sisters and we won't perish as fools.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM ALVEDA KING
A group that advocates for religious liberty in the military says the U.S. Air Force Academy should cancel a planned speech by a Chick-fil-A executive.\n\nThe Military Religious Freedom Foundation said Wednesday the company has a history of supporting anti-gay causes and that Rodney Bullard, a Chick-fil-A vice president and academy graduate, shouldn't speak at the school's upcoming leadership conference.\n\nBullard said the company and its charitable foundation don't fund anti-gay programs. He says Chick-fil-A's foundation funds programs to help children in poverty, including groups that work with LGBQT youth.\n\nChick-fil-A has faced accusations that it is anti-gay since 2012 when its president, Dan Cathy, publicly opposed gay marriage. The company has said Cathy's statements are his personal views.\n\nThe academy said it invited speakers with a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and conference participants choose which talks to attend.
After coming out as a lesbian and revealing she has a girlfriend, Real Housewives of Orange County star Braunwyn Windham-Burke revealed that she would be heartbroken if her husband were to move on with another woman.\n\nLast month, the 43-year-old reality TV star came out during an interview with GLAAD. At the time, she also revealed that she started dating a 28-year-old woman named Kris. However, the mom of seven explained that her husband, Sean Burke, is supportive and they're working on what to do with their 20-year marriage in light of her revelation.\n\nThe star conducted a Q&A Saturday on her Instagram Story, where she was asked about her marriage.

Sean, who was sitting beside her during the Q&A, noted that he'll likely date other people, but isn't sure when.\n\nYeah, it kinda sucks cause it's hard, figuring it out, he said of the situation with his wife's new relationship.\n\n'REAL HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY HILLS' STAR ERIKA GIRARDI SPLITS FROM HUSBAND TOM AFTER 21-YEAR MARRIAGE\n\nIt didn't take long before Braunwyn's followers called her out for being selfish by barring her husband from doing exactly what she did. The star noted that she is indeed being unfair but explained that's why they're currently in therapy together.\n\nWe are working through this. We can't figure this out on our own. This is a lot … This is hard and we're working it out, she explained.\n\nHowever, she also noted that she is not keeping Sean from doing anything or forcing him to do anything he doesn't want to do.

LIMA, Peru (AP) — Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, the two-term United Nations secretary-general who brokered a historic ceasefire between Iran and Iraq in 1988 and who in later life came out of retirement to help re-establish democracy in his Peruvian homeland, has died. He was 100.\n\nHis son, Francisco Pérez de Cuéllar, said his father died Wednesday at home of natural causes. Current U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Peruvian diplomat a personal inspiration.\n\nMr. Pérez de Cuéllar's life spanned not only a century but also the entire history of the United Nations, dating back to his participation in the first meeting of the General Assembly in 1946, said Guterres in a statement late Wednesday.\n\nMARLON GOMEZ via Getty Images Disturbed by the United Nations' dwindling effectiveness, Javier Perez de Cuellar sought to revitalize the world body's faulty peacekeeping machinery.\n\nPérez de Cuéllar's death ends a long diplomatic career that brought him full-circle from his first posting as secretary at the Peruvian embassy in Paris in 1944 to his later job as Peru's ambassador to France.\n\nWhen he began his tenure as U.N. secretary-general on Jan. 1, 1982, he was a little-known Peruvian who was a compromise candidate at a time when the United Nations was held in low esteem.\n\nServing as U.N. undersecretary-general for special political affairs, he emerged as the dark horse candidate in December 1981 after a six-week election deadlock between U.N. chief Kurt Waldheim and Tanzanian Foreign Minister Salim Ahmed Salim.\n\nOnce elected, he quickly made his mark.\n\nDisturbed by the United Nations' dwindling effectiveness, he sought to revitalize the world body's faulty peacekeeping machinery.\n\nHis first step was to shake the house with a highly critical report in which he warned: We are perilously near to a new international anarchy.\n\nWith the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and with conflicts raging in Afghanistan and Cambodia and between Iran and Iraq, he complained to the General Assembly that U.N. resolutions are increasingly defied or ignored by those that feel themselves strong enough to do so.\n\nThe problem with the United Nations is that either it's not used or misused by member countries, he said in an interview at the end of his first year as U.N. secretary general.\n\nDuring his decade as U.N. chief, Pérez de Cuéllar would earn a reputation more for diligent, quiet diplomacy than charisma.\n\nLe ton fait la chanson, he was fond of saying, meaning that melody is what makes the song and not the loudness of the singer.\n\nHe has an amiable look about him that people mistake for through and through softness, said an aide, who described him as tough and courageous.\n\nFaced early in his first term with a threatened U.S. cutoff of funds in the event of Israel's ouster, he worked behind the scenes to stop Arab efforts to deprive the Jewish state of its General Assembly seat. There was muted criticism from the Arab camp that he had given the Americans the right of way in the Middle East.\n\nROBERTO SCHMIDT via Getty Images UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar announces on August 25, 1990 his invitation to Iraq's Foreign Minister Tarek Aziz to a meeting in New York or Geneva for discussions on peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis.

He refrained from publicly rebuking Poland for refusing to allow his special representative into the country to investigate allegations of human rights violations during the Warsaw regime's 1982 crackdown on the Solidarity trade union movement.\n\nIn July 1986, Pérez de Cuéllar underwent a quadruple coronary bypass operation, putting in question his availability for a second term. From the outset, Pérez de Cuéllar had insisted that he would be a one-term secretary-general.\n\nUpset with what he viewed as member states' reluctance to pitch in to help the world body out of a financial crisis, he told the New York Times in September 1986, I don't see any reason why I should preside over the collapse of the organization.\n\nBut he did come back for a second term after a groundswell of support for his candidacy, including a conversation with President Ronald Reagan, who — in the words of the U.N. chief's spokesman — expressed his personal support for the secretary-general.\n\nJust about all the Western countries have told him they'd like to see him stay on, a Western diplomatic source said at the time. There is no visible alternative.\n\nUnlike his predecessor, Kurt Waldheim who was regarded as a workaholic and who spent long hours in his office, Pérez de Cuéllar liked to get away from it all. He is very jealous of his own privacy, a close aide said.\n\nWhen I can, I read everything but United Nations documents, Pérez de Cuéllar confided to a reporter. Once on a flight to Moscow, an aide observed that in the midst of it all, the secretary-general had time for splendid literature.\n\nTrilingual, Pérez de Cuéllar read French, English and Spanish literature.\n\nPérez de Cuéllar spent much of his second term working behind the scenes on the hostage issue, resulting in the release of Westerners held in Lebanon, including the last and longest-held American hostage, journalist Terry Anderson, who was freed Dec. 4, 1991.\n\nAll told, Pérez de Cuéllar's diplomacy helped bring an end to fighting in Cambodia and the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.\n\nShortly after midnight on Jan. 1, 1992, he walked out of U.N. headquarters to his waiting limousine, no longer the secretary-general, but having attained his final goal after hours of tough negotiations: a peace pact between the Salvadoran government and leftist rebels.\n\nMr. Pérez de Cuéllar played a crucial role in a number of diplomatic successes — including the independence of Namibia, an end to the Iran-Iraq War, the release of American hostages held in Lebanon, the peace accord in Cambodia and, in his very last days in office, a historic peace agreement in El Salvador, said Guterres.\n\nEddy LEMAISTRE via Getty Images Pérez de Cuéllar and his wife, the former Marcela Temple.\n\nJavier Pérez de Cuéllar was born in Lima on Jan. 19, 1920. His father a modest businessman, was an accomplished amateur pianist, according to the former secretary-general. The family traced its roots to the Spanish town of Cuéllar, north of Segovia.\n\nIn Peru, the family belonged to the educated rather than the landowning class. He went to the right schools, a countryman at the United Nations once said of Pérez de Cuéllar.\n\nHe received a law degree from Lima's Catholic University in 1943 and joined the Peruvian diplomatic service a year later. He would go on to postings in France, Britain, Bolivia and Brazil before returning to Lima in 1961, where he served in a number of high-level ministry posts.\n\nHe was ambassador to Switzerland and then became Peru's first ambassador to the Soviet Union while concurrently accredited to Poland. Other assignments included the post of secretary-general of the Peruvian Foreign Ministry and chief delegate to the United Nations.\n\nAfter leaving the U.N. Pérez de Cuéllar made an unsuccessful bid for Peru's presidency in 1995 against the authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, whose 10-year autocratic regime crumbled in November 2000 amid corruption scandals.\n\nAt the age of 80, Pérez de Cuéllar emerged from retirement in Paris and returned to Peru to take on the mantle of foreign minister and cabinet chief for provisional President Valentin Paniagua.\n\nHis impeccable democratic credentials lent credibility to an interim government whose mandate was to deliver free and fair elections. Eight months later, newly elected President Alejandro Toledo asked him to serve as Ambassador to France.\n\nBetween foreign assignments, he was professor of diplomatic law at the Academia Diplomatica del Peru and of international relations at the Peruvian Academy for Air Warfare.\n\nTransferring to the United Nations in 1975, he was appointed by Waldheim as the secretary-general's special representative in Cyprus. During his two years on the divided island he helped to promote intercommunal peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.\n\nAfter a brief stint as Peru's ambassador to Venezuela, he returned to the United Nations in 1979 as undersecretary-general for special political affairs. In that capacity, he undertook delicate diplomatic missions to Indochina and Afghanistan.\n\nPérez de Cuéllar resigned his U.N. post in May 1981 — just before the election campaign for U.N. secretary-general heated up — and returned to the Peruvian diplomatic service.\n\nHowever, he encountered political problems at home when he was nominated by President Fernando Belaunde Terry to be ambassador to Brazil.\n\nThe nomination failed to win Senate approval. There was no public debate, but congressional sources in Lima said opposition came from Javier Alva Orlandini, Peruvian vice president and leader of the ruling Popular Action Party. The sources said Orlandini resented Pérez de Cuéllar's participation in the swearing in of the military junta that overthrew Belaunde Terry in 1968.\n\nPérez de Cuéllar maintained that, as secretary-general of the Peruvian foreign ministry at the time, he was required by protocol to take part in the ceremony even though he had no pro-junta leanings.\n\nBelaunde Terry, restored to power in 1980, reaffirmed his confidence in Pérez de Cuéllar by recommending him for nomination as U.N. secretary-general.\n\nPérez de Cuéllar married the former Marcela Temple. He had a son, Francisco, and a daughter, Cristina, by a previous marriage.\n\nHis funeral will be held Friday.\n\n—-\n\nEdith M. Lederer in the United Nations contributed to this report.
BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia's national police chief has ordered an investigation into the detention of 12 transgender women in the province of Aceh, officials said on Friday, after reports that they were stripped, beaten and forced to cut their hair before being released without charge.\n\nIndonesia has the world's largest Muslim population but Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, is the only province that enforces Islamic law and outlaws homosexuality.\n\nReligious police and vigilantes in the ultra-conservative province often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.\n\nPolice in North Aceh raided hair salons - where transgender people often work - last weekend and briefly detained 12 individuals. Rights activists and media reports said they were forced to cut their hair and were stripped and beaten.\n\nThere were photos circulated that led us to suspect that there had been physical action taken against the suspects, Misbahul Munauwar, a spokesman for Aceh police, said. The national police chief has instructed us to investigate those photos and to determine if there was any...procedural or ethical violation.\n\nA national police spokesman confirmed that police chief Tito Karnavian had ordered the investigation.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and other rights groups welcomed the move, which comes amid a rising tide of hostility against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.\n\nPolice in Aceh and elsewhere have stepped up raids on what they call gay spas and gay sex parties in recent months, detaining people on charges of violating strict anti-pornography laws.\n\nDozens of protesters on Friday staged an anti-LGBT rally outside a mosque in the provincial capital Banda Aceh.\n\nWe don't hate gay, bisexual or transgender people. What we hate is their actions, and if we can prove their actions, they will be punished, Aceh governor Irwandi Yusuf told the small crowd.\n\nLast year, the provincial and central governments drew international condemnation after authorities in Aceh tried two young men on charges of engaging in gay sex and then publicly caned them - the first such case in the country.\n\nIndonesia's parliament is also drafting revisions to the national criminal code that could ban all consensual sex outside marriage.\n\nThe parliamentary commission drawing up recommendations has still to finalize its proposals, but a draft seen by Reuters includes measures to criminalize extramarital sex, same-sex relations and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated.\n\nReporting by Reuters stringer in Banda Aceh; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Ed Davies and Nick Macfie
DigitalVision Vectors No one likes to talk to a chronic one-upper.\n\nWe all have that friend: the one who one-ups you in conversation every chance they get. Sometimes it's a co-worker or family member, but what they all have in common is that anything you can do they can do categorically better.\n\nWent to a Public Ivy for your undergrad? Oh, yeah, they applied to a handful of them but ultimately went with Harvard.\n\nFinally got around to buying a new hybrid sedan? Sure, the new Priuses are nice, but they're waiting for Tesla to put out the new Model S.\n\nGoing to the Amalfi Coast for your vacation next spring? Sweet! They went there with their spouse years ago, before it got super touristy. They can send you a list of recs if you want! (Everyone loves the list. They've forwarded it like 50 times.)\n\nIf this article were a medical malpractice ad, this is the point where we'd say: If you or a loved one has had prolonged interaction with a one-upper, you may be entitled to financial compensation...\n\nJokes aside, one-uppers ― people who listen to you tell a story and immediately try to do you one better (or try to do you one worse, if you shared something sad) ― are some of the least pleasant people to talk to.\n\nIt's almost as if one-uppers have the belief that if your light shines, theirs is dimmed, said Margaret Rutherford, a psychologist in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and the author of Perfectly Hidden Depression. Do they do it to take you down a notch? Or is it because they somehow feel less than because you're getting attention or praise for something?\n\nA 2015 study found that braggarts overestimated the extent to which their audiences would feel proud and happy, and underestimated their annoyance.\n\nRutherford hears complaints about one-uppers all the time in her therapy practice, and she's dealt with plenty in her own life, too.\n\nI'm an avid walker, and I had a family member who would tell others that they walked just as much or farther than me when all of us knew they'd never walked for exercise. Ever, she said. It's quite sad.\n\nOneupmanship can be born from all kinds of inner struggles. Sometimes it's rivalry, low self-esteem masked by bravado, an actual problem with lying or just having an awkward social presence, Rutherford explained.\n\nThat awkwardness is worth exploring a little: Most of us can read the room if we're coming across as braggy: If we jump on someone's sentence before they can finish getting it out or use their story as a jumping-off point for our own humblebrag, we'll notice that there's an awkward pause from the rest of the group once the interaction is through. We'll spot the occasional eye roll and realize, Oh, my gosh, I'm a thunder-stealing monster! and change our ways.\n\nIt's different for a one-upper. What sets them apart is their failure to relate to others and read social cues, said Amanda Deverich, a marriage and family therapist in Williamsburg, Virginia.\n\nMany people who like to 'story top' are not aware of what they are doing. They're simply enjoying sharing their story and feeling like they are one of the gang with a similar experience, she said. These who are unaware are getting a good feeling, as if they are popular and well-liked.\n\nScience backs this up. A 2015 study found that braggarts overestimated the extent to which their audiences would feel proud and happy, and underestimated their annoyance.\n\nWhen a one-upper brags, they misjudge how the story will play for others. If I tell my co-workers about how I quit my first job at 22 to backpack through Europe for a whole year, they'll think it's romantic and cultured sounding! the one-upper thinks.Maybe they'll want to join me on my next smaller trip.\n\nMeanwhile, the one-uppers' co-workers are thinking: Could this guy be any more of a bragger? Must be nice to up and quit your job. His parents probably paid for that.\n\nSometimes one-upping is motivated by a competitive streak, too, but a sophisticated, competitive person knows story-topping generally is impolite, off-putting and disenfranchising, Deverich said. It doesn't actually secure your position at the top of the social hierarchy. The intelligent, competitive person will save the topping story for the most advantageous moment.\n\nHow to deal with a chronic one-upper:\n\n1. Go into the conversation expecting it.\n\nCertain things ― a root canal, a conversation with a relentless one-upper ― are easier to deal with if you just accept it's going to be rough going. If you're in regular conversation with a one-upper, just think of their habit as part of the package. Maybe even learn to laugh at it. (I wonder how many times they'll respond with a brag this time; last time, I think the count was four.)\n\nAs with so many character traits that are annoying, what's helpful is to expect the response ahead of time, Rutherford said. If you're talking about your own accomplishments, assume the one-upper will do the same. They have to stick their two cents in, whether what they're saying is truth or fabrication. If you expect it, it has less impact on you. It can even make you smile.\n\n2. Sympathize with the one-upper. They probably don't even know they're doing it.\n\nNow that you know most one-upping is fueled by the inability to read the room and relate to others, hopefully you'll respond differently the next time your pal does it. It's not them, it's their social awkwardness!\n\nTry not to get too annoyed or frustrated with this person, even though it can be taxing to deal with, said Jessica Baum, a psychotherapist in Palm Beach, Florida. Remind yourself that the other person might have low self-esteem or that maybe they feel out of place and could be unaware of their behavior. Patience is really important here.\n\nIf the one-upping is hindering your relationship, it's OK to speak up and share that you need them to listen to you more, because you want to connect with them and feel that they care about your experiences, too. - Jessica Baum, psychotherapist in Palm Beach, Florida\n\n3. Maintain a healthy sense of pride in your accomplishments ― even if the one-upper tries to steal your thunder.\n\nA healthy sense of self-esteem can make you near bulletproof to one-uppers, Deverich said. Resist competing with the bragger in your life; it's a waste of time, plus, there will always be someone who's done, seen and accomplished more than you have. Our goals are so highly personal and individualistic, what's the point of comparing?\n\nOne-upping is just a never-ending cycle of madness, Deverich said. Encourage yourself when it comes to your goals, and appreciate the experiences of others. Definitely distance yourself from braggarts and aggressively dominant jerks, though.\n\n4. If you're close to them and it's really starting to bother you, address it gently.\n\nWhile practicing patience and empathy is usually the best approach, that can be difficult when you're close to the one-upper and their bad habit is starting to chip away at your goodwill toward them. In this case, healthy and kind communication is a big step in the right direction, Baum said.\n\nYou can share your take on their behavior and do so in a loving way, she said. If the one-upping is hindering your relationship, it's OK to speak up and share that you need them to listen to you more, because you want to connect with them and feel that they care about your experiences, too.
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's big day is fast approaching, which got us thinking about all of the British royal wedding traditions we may (or may not) see on May 19.\n\nSure, you may be aware that female wedding guests don fancy hats and fascinators for the ceremony (a British custom not just reserved for royals). Who could forget the bold headwear Princess Beatrice of York wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge? But there's probably quite a few traditions you've never heard of before. Below, we delve into some of the lesser-known ones.\n\n1. The bride carries a sprig of myrtle in her bouquet.\n\nDan Kitwood via Getty Images Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, holding her wedding bouquet, which included a sprig of myrtle.\n\nThis tradition dates back to the 19th century when Prince Albert's grandmother gave Queen Victoria some myrtle ― a symbol of good fortune in love and marriage ― which Victoria then planted in her garden at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. She cut a sprig from that plant when her oldest daughter, Princess Victoria, got married in 1858. Since then, Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana and Kate have all carried a bouquet with myrtle from Victoria's garden. The same bush is still thriving.\n\nWe take very good care of it, a spokesperson for Osborne House told People.\n\n2.

The newlyweds serve fruitcake at the reception.\n\nPrincess Diana Archive via Getty Images David Avery, head baker at the Royal Naval Cooking School, displays Charles and Diana's multi-tier fruitcake in 1981.\n\nA fruitcake was originally a symbol of wealth and prosperity because of its precious ingredients such as dried fruits, alcohol and spices, London pastry chef Chris Dodd told Vogue. Furthermore, the cake, in a way, represented the vastness of the British empire, using ingredients from far-flung corners of the globe. A wedding was, and is to this day, a time of celebration, and as such it calls for a cake to match the occasion.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle, however, will be going in a different direction. In March, Kensington Palace announced that the couple decided on a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream frosting by chef Claire Ptak of London's Violet bakery. It's possible they will also have a smaller groom's cake, as William did at his wedding.\n\n4. And after the wedding, guests receive a slice of the wedding cake in the mail.\n\n5. The bride leaves her bouquet at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior inside Westminster Abbey.\n\nPeter Macdiarmid via Getty Images The bridal bouquet Kate held on her wedding day was placed on the Grave of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThis tradition began in 1923 with the Queen Mother as a way to honor her late brother Capt. Fergus Bowes-Lyon, who was killed during World War I.\n\nSince then, other royal brides ― even those who did not marry at Westminster Abbey ― send the bridal bouquet to be laid on the grave on their behalf.\n\n6. The royal family member must receive the queen's formal permission to tie the knot.\n\nCHRIS JACKSON via Getty Images The queen must approve the marriages of the first six people in line for the throne.\n\nOn March 14, two months ahead of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, the queen gave her formal blessing for the nuptials in an official letter that read: I declare my consent to a contract of matrimony between my most dearly beloved grandson Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales and Rachel Meghan Markle.\n\n7.

He is a member of the royal family. This is a family wedding which is taking place not in public, not out of the public eye, but within the castle, which is much less visual.\n\nIf he does wear military garb for the ceremony, Harry will likely change out of it afterward, as his brother, William, did at his 2011 wedding.\n\n8.

LONDON (AP) — Sarah, the Duchess of York, has landed a book deal for her debut novel for adults, a historical romance fictionalizing the life and loves of her great-great-great aunt.\n\nIn a promotional video posted Wednesday on her Twitter account, the former Sarah Ferguson said the novel, titled Her Heart for a Compass, is set in the Victorian era and is about daring to follow your heart against the odds.\n\nThe duchess wore a Victorian-style outfit in the video and described her heroine as strong, rebellious and courageous.\n\nI'm delighted to announce my first historical romance novel, #HerHeartForACompass, published in August by @MillsandBoon (UK) and @WmMorrowBooks (US)!\n\n\n\nSet in the Victorian era, the book is about daring to follow your heart against the odds. Pre-order UK: https://t.co/Lv1pyfM3kP pic.twitter.com/cqz3lLT2sa — Sarah Ferguson (@SarahTheDuchess) January 13, 2021\n\nPublisher Mills & Boon, a romance imprint of British publisher Harlequin UK, said the story is based on Sarah's ancestor, Lady Margaret Montagu Douglas Scott, who fled an arranged marriage and the confines of polite society.\n\nThe duchess said she also drew on many parallels from my life for the love story.\n\nSarah was married to Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's third child, but the couple divorced in the 1990s. She has previously published her memoirs and authored a number of children's books.\n\nHer novel, which was written with author Marguerite Kaye, is set to be published in August.
Marriage therapy only works if both partners are committed to the process. But by the time some couples schedule an appointment, one or both partners has already checked out.\n\nBelow, marriage therapists around the country share seven reasons to head to therapy sooner than later.\n\n1. Struggling alone does you no favors.\n\nThe average couple that comes in for therapy has been struggling for about six years. This means they've been unhappy for much longer than they needed to be. One reason to get into therapy early is to get ahead of the curve and address issues before they become problems. ― Zach Brittle, a therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forBetter\n\n2. Solvable problems may escalate to entrenched, bitter hurts.\n\nCouples who reach out earlier for support when things are amiss often head off a caustic, ugly pattern of hurting each other in ways that are hard to forget or forgive. Marriage therapists should be able to help partners identify the ways they express themselves when they are hurt or angry and to recognize how they may unintentionally put their partners on the defensive.― Linda Lipshutz, a psychotherapist in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida\n\n3. Asking tough questions now will save you a world of hurt later.\n\nIn my opinion, the ideal time for couple's therapy is pre-engagement. Like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. When you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that's when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. So many of the issues I see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: People who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. Couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. Couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. A few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you're signing up for. ― Ryan Howes, a psychologist in Pasadena, California\n\n4. You lose empathy for your spouse the longer you stay bitter.\n\nWhen issues remain unresolved, resentment can create a large and ugly divide between two people. This often manifests as lack of empathy, disinterest and at times, even disrespect. Go to therapy before arguments seem insurmountable because one or both of you have become apathetic. ― Talia Wagner, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California\n\n5. The earlier you nip problems in the bud, the better.\n\nI'd say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. That means they'll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. Couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. Therapy can help you prioritize 'repair,' or staying connected over 'resolution,' which is often out of reach. ― Zach Brittle\n\n6. Crisis is a horrible time to work on things.\n\nI often share a folksy old saying with my clients: 'It's best to fix the roof when the sun's shining.' We all know that when we're in the midst of crisis we make hasty, impulsive decisions that strive for immediate safety instead of long-term sustainability. Maybe you've noticed the relationship is strained every time a partner has a job change and you see a new career shift on the horizon. The wise choice may be to go to counseling now, when things are still calm, to learn tools to cope with the changes. It's OK to go to counseling when things seem 'fine' so that you are more resilient when they aren't. Even the strongest marriages will encounter tough times eventually, and it's good to be equipped when they come. ― Ryan Howes\n\n7. And ultimately, life is too short to be miserable in your marriage.
Hi, readers!\n\nThis is Dominique, back on the newsletter this week — this time from sticky, sweltering Singapore, where the streets have been disquietingly empty as people have battened down the hatches and taken shelter out of fear of getting ill with the novel coronavirus. Below, a native of Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the sickness, shares her perspective on the virus terrifying the globe — but let's not dwell on that for the time being.\n\nI first want to thank all the generous readers who wrote in to share their own stories in response to last week's newsletter on gender dynamics in marriage. Some readers said gender imbalances in relationships appear to be shifting in a positive direction in many cultures, including in the U.S., but that there's still a long way to go. Self-love and self-work, including seeking counseling for both partners, is key to enacting change in a relationship, a Pennsylvania-based clinical social worker and family therapist suggested in her email to me.\n\nThis week, we'll be pivoting our focus to something quite different but similarly compelling: Exploring this interactive feature on Black hair, created by HuffPost U.S. and published in honor of Black History Month.\n\nThe feature, which seeks to amplify Black conversations about Black hair, tells the stories of 18 people and their relationship with their kinky, curly, straight, dreadlocked and even hairless heads.\n\nHuffPost US\n\nBlack Hair Defined is all about letting people tell their stories about their hair journeys, Erin Evans, a senior enterprise editor at HuffPost who commissioned the articles for this project, told me from New York.\n\nWhether that was a story about hair loss, or about embracing natural hair as a Black trans woman or even a few fun pieces that looked iconic hairstyles in film, music, politics and sports — it was important for there to be a variety of perspectives and voices since Black hair is beautiful and versatile in all its many forms, Erin said.\n\nFor me, this project really resonated as a true exploration of how people think deeply about their relationship to their hair, Erin added. I rock a curly 'fro because I love how it looks, whether the curls are defined, frizzy or tangled. And as a Black woman, I think there's so much beauty and power in being able to embrace my curls and coils no matter what anyone else may think.\n\nSoak in the project for yourself and then perhaps ponder how your own hair has influenced your identity. Share your thoughts with me at herstories@huffpost.com.\n\nWishing you a fantastic weekend,\n\nDominique\n\nDominique Mosbergen, Senior Reporter, HuffPost U.S.\n\nIf you're in New York, you can also join HuffPost editors for a conversation on Black hair, politics and identity on Feb. 26. Register here.\n\nChina Daily CDIC/Reuters\n\nCanadian resident and Wuhan native Debbie Lu shares her perspective on the coronavirus outbreak. So many Westerners only know Wuhan in the context of the [virus], she laments. They don't know that we have famous authors and scholars and actors, or great street food, or hot summers. They don't know that we're known for our schools. So when people share negative opinions over social media about my home, because of coronavirus, I wish I could show them its better side — the side of Wuhan that I know and love.\n\nLauren Mulligan/Getty Images\n\nIt can be hard to tell your parents, in-laws and other relatives that you've made the choice to not have children.

Mixed race woman taking broken paper heart\n\nIf you don't start offending your wife, I don't think you're going to have a marriage. I heard these words come out of my mouth at a recent session with a couple in my office. I imagined that they were thinking, This family therapist is crazy. But I was pretty sure I was right.\n\nLet me explain: Marriage, or any duet or intimate partnership needs plenty of caring, lots of tolerance and acceptance and enough humor to take the edge off. But a pattern of too much politeness or caution in one or both partners kills the spark, and pretty soon the marriage is limping along, barely alive, or, sometimes, so turbulent that it can break apart.\n\nA recent couples' session illustrates this dynamic:\n\nBeth and Larry, a mid-30's couple with two young daughters, came to see me on the verge of divorce. At least, Beth is on the verge of divorcing her mild-mannered husband. From the first visit, Beth was large and in-charge. This attractive woman, who runs a child-developement center, indicated that she felt let down by Larry in every way. He was no longer affectionate with her, he argued with her over what she considered petty things, and Beth had begun making plans to, as she put it, work on becoming effective co-parents-i.e., she was giving up on the marriage. This was her second marriage, by the way.\n\nBeth fell for Larry shortly after she left a really turbulent relationship with her bi-polar-ish first husband. Beth felt responsible for him, and said she hung on much longer than she should have. Devastated and emotionally drained following her break-up, this handsome, capable and calm Larry felt like just the ticket. They dated for several years, during which time they each pursued professional degrees. Beth remembered that they fought rather intensely during periods of separation from each other, but had long months where they enjoyed a close and loving connection.\n\nIn the sessions, the most striking quality of this couple is Larry's reticence with Beth. He's a really smart guy, thoughtful, a well-regarded environmental specialist, but he seems dumb with his wife. While she threatens to give him the boot, he looks unruffled. But he's clearly hurt, and at our initial meeting he acknowledged not being able to sleep because of worry that Beth would leave.\n\nAt our last session, I wondered about Larry's quiet demeanor. This followed my umpteenth observation that Larry appears to be a caring, engaged guy who loves his family and wants to make things better. That's worth a lot. When I asked Larry what keeps him so polite with Beth, he responded, I'm afraid of offending her. She easily gets offended. On a roll now, he described how he had been sleeping on the couch for a couple of years-!-because his wife was committed to co-sleeping with the kids. He didn't like the idea, he wanted his bed-and his wife-back, but, according to him, she became offended when he tried to bring this up. Wow!\n\nThis was the problem with these well-meaning people in a nutshell. When Beth gets upset, or fights Larry on an idea, he withdraws. I'm not sure if he's protecting himself or her, but my guess is that it's a bit of both. And even though Beth says she wants a relationship of equals with two strong voices, she has a subtle way of appearing to be the expert. She says she wants an equal, but a real equal partnership will challenge her status as exclusive expert, especially on the kids. I'm not sure she's ready for that.

Less than a year after legalizing marriage equality, Bermuda passed a law last month to ban same-sex marriage once again.\n\nSame-sex couples have until the end of May to wed there before the new measure goes into effect. The self-governing British territory became the first to reverse its stance on the issue, according to GLAAD, as countries increasingly move to legalize marriage between people of any gender.\n\nNow, a pack of celebrities, including Ellen DeGeneres, Tegan and Sara and Patricia Arquette, are calling to boycott the vacation hot spot ― at least until its residents make equality the law of the tiny land.\n\nI guess I'm canceling my trip, DeGeneres tweeted Thursday evening. Anyone else?\n\nBermuda just banned marriage equality. I guess I'm canceling my trip. Anybody else? https://t.co/c5bwUbyjZt pic.twitter.com/VpT5QQAFsq — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) March 7, 2018\n\nActor Bradley Whitford called for a boycott last month, shortly after the news broke.\n\nLater in February, Arquette also called on followers to boycott Bermuda.\n\nOn Wednesday, pop duo Tegan and Sara sent a tweet saying they were thinking of our friends in the LGBTQ community in Bermuda, and encouraged followers to support efforts to overturn the policy.\n\nThinking of our friends in the LGBTQ community in Bermuda. Bermuda is the first country in the world to remove the right to marry for gay and lesbian couples. Learn more here and consider supporting the fight for justice and equality. https://t.co/LR2zNJSVzB https://t.co/gUgk7lOSad — Tegan and Sara (@teganandsara) March 8, 2018\n\nBermuda's Supreme Court ruled in May 2017 that a registrar's decision to deny a marriage license to a same-sex couple was discriminatory, legalizing marriage equality in the socially conservative Atlantic territory.\n\nLegislators responded by creating the Domestic Partnership Act, which allows same-sex couples to form domestic partnerships, not marriages, and claims to offer such partnerships equal rights. Same-sex couples who are already married in Bermuda can remain married.\n\nCritics say the law contradicts Bermuda's constitution, which protects against discrimination.\n\nSome worry the law will create problems for Bermuda's $431 million tourism industry. Cruise lines registered in Bermuda ― including Carnival's Cunard, P&O Cruises and some Princess cruises ― will not be able to host same-sex marriages regardless of where the ships travel, CNBC reported.\n\nThe LGBTQ segment of the global tourism industry is significant and growing, according to a 2017 report by the World Tourism Organization, which states that locations supportive of LGBTQ rights are (unsurprisingly) appealing to LGBTQ travelers.\n\nGLAAD has called on tourism businesses to speak out against Bermuda's reversal on marriage equality.\n\nThese brands and their business leaders should demonstrate true leadership and stand for those customers they've courted by helping to combat this harmful decision, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement.\n\nA CrowdJustice campaign has raised 25,000 pounds (about $35,000) of a 50,000-pound goal (about $70,000) to finance efforts to reclaim marriage equality in Bermuda.
Young-ju Kim, author of A Daughter-in-Law's Letter of Resignation, was a good daughter. She got married in 1989 to the eldest son of the eldest son in a large extended family, which meant she had to become a manmyeoneuri, or the eldest daughter-in-law. It was a role that would long consume her life.\n\nShe quit her job and worked as a daughter-in-law, mother and wife for decades. But after 24 years, she felt she'd done enough ― and decided to live the life she actually wanted before it was too late.\n\nShe filed for divorce in 2012 and submitted a letter of resignation to her parents-in-law just before the 2013 Chuseok holidays, a major harvest festival in South Korea. Her loved ones complained and asked how she could do such a thing.\n\nBut she had no regrets. She felt like nothing would change before she died unless she acted on her decision. There was nothing to lose.\n\nSanga Kim Author Young-ju Kim wrote a letter of resignation to her husband's family in 2013.\n\nHer declaration of resignation as eldest daughter-in-law changed almost everything. Her husband, whom she moved in with again after knee surgery in September 2017, finally began to listen to her, and the annual ancestral rites and holiday ceremonies, which had been a source of immense strain and stress, were simplified. She and her husband grew in respect for one another, and ended up not divorcing. The change that occurred in her daily life was significant enough that she has called it amiracle, even a small revolution.\n\nI'm the only unmarried person in my family. I asked Kim how women should take on their roles as daughter, sister and sister-in-law so that there will be no regrets later.\n\nI, myself, must be happy first and foremost, Kim told me firmly. Put off the pressure of having to play roles in the family; make sure that you are happy first. That's what's most important.\n\nIt's not a selfish choice but a way to make people around you happy, she added. Everyone has their own burdens of life. Rather than trying to solve your family's problems for them, let them solve the problem for themselves. No matter how long it takes. Seriously.\n\nWe tend to think that we are close to our family, but we don't actually know their thoughts, who they really are, or even their likes and dislikes. I spoke to Kim about how we can feel happiness in our relationships with our family, how her own family has changed and self-care.\n\nSanga Kim Young-ju Kim when she was still the eldest daughter-in-law.\n\nThe Korean New Year holidays are just around the corner. How will you spend the festive season?\n\nJust as I typically do ― or, at least, typical as things have been since I submitted my letter of resignation in 2013. After my letter, I didn't go to my husband's parents' home for two to three years. Then, when I did go, there again, I didn't cook ― as I normally would've done ― and we ordered in. But the food wasn't as good as home-cooked meals, so we started cooking one dish at home, and since last year, we've been cooking just enough jeon [Korean pancake] for our family to eat.\n\nBefore my resignation, I had cooked for the entire family all by myself ― but now we all cook together. My parents-in-law buy groceries in advance, and we all share the rest of our duties. It takes less than two hours to finish now.\n\nYou may say, That's the same as before, isn't it? But it isn't. The difference is my actions are now voluntary. No matter how good a duty of obedience is, no one enjoys doing it. It feels demeaning. But it's not unpleasant to do it voluntarily in a balanced relationship. Now the holidays have become a fun time to meet and talk about current events for hours, as well as cook and eat delicious food together.\n\nHow were your holidays when you were the eldest daughter-in-law, before you submitted your resignation?\n\nIt all centered on preparation and cooking. It took two to three days to buy all the groceries. I had to go to traditional markets, big supermarkets and even small shops when I needed a specialty item.\n\nDid you shop alone?\n\nYes, alone, without even my husband's help. I bought piles of groceries and cooked all alone. I also had to make a lot of side dishes on top of the main holiday foods. It was so hard and stressful.\n\nI'm feeling a rising frustration in my heart as the New Year holidays approach...\n\nThere was a family gathering at the end of last year .… That day was winter solstice, and my father-in-law bought red bean porridge, my mother-in-law boiled the cabbage soup, my sister-in-law went grocery shopping, and my husband's brother and his wife washed all the vegetables while others grilled the meat. I brought side dishes from home. My husband washed all the dishes.\n\nEveryone from all three generations prepared the dinner and washed the dishes together. My son bought coffee after he finished eating, and everyone was very happy to have coffee and tea together. I felt so content because I felt a great sense of cooperation and equality. I realized again that my ordinary life had changed like a miracle.\n\nA roomful of adults of different generations. It sounds like a recipe for squabbling!\n\n[Laughs.] Is that so? We have three generations. My parents' generation, my husband and my generation, and our son's generation. When we meet, we talk about social issues. We all have different ideas and perspectives. Nevertheless, we don't ignore others, and we don't say, you don't know any better. By listening carefully, we can at least understand where others' ideas stem from ― even if we don't necessarily share those opinions.\n\nSince I know what it was like before, I feel like the present situation with my husband's family is a sort of miracle. Actually, I feel more intimate with them after submitting my resignation letter. I've grown to think of them as actually really good people.\n\nAs all these changes happened in your family after you submitted your resignation, you clearly played a big role in this transformation.\n\nNo, I actually think the letter was just a spark, a small starting point for change rather than a major personal achievement. It could've gone in a completely different direction. I am grateful to my family for having worked toward building the balanced and peaceful relationship we have now.\n\nHave you ever regretted the letter?\n\nI have my regrets. I also regret not quitting sooner. Had I acted at an earlier date, I could have created a more equal and respectful environment for my children. At the time, my husband's family felt like this insurmountable, enormous rock, and it was scary. But then I realized that I too am a person with power.\n\nThe rock wasn't as enormous and insurmountable as you expected it to be?\n\nI had initially regarded myself as too small and meager in comparison to such a huge rock ― and I felt I didn't have a voice. But after submitting my resignation letter and filing for divorce, I realized how much power I possess.\n\nAfter I saw how my small actions prompted big change within my family, I realized that it wasn't just them that had needed to change ― but I had needed to change first.\n\nSanga Kim\n\nQuestions are increasingly being raised now about the honorific titles and other language used in familial relationships and in the marital setting in Korea. Like, why is it that a woman needs to use formal terms like miss or young master when referring to her husband's family members? What do you think about these terms?\n\nI'm very empathetic. When I got married, I addressed members of my husband's family as miss or young master ― but I felt like I was a maid.\n\nI remember calling my husband's 6-year-old brother young master, but in informal settings, I would use his real name. When an elder relative got wind of this, however, he told me to call him young master instead. I thought it was irrational.\n\nDaughters-in-law are often required to speak deferentially to their husband's family members. The language contains respect. But there's not much respect for the names of women. It is a problem that my generation does not dare to touch, but I think that it will change in the next generation.\n\nYou lived alone for 10 months starting in November 2016. How was that?\n\nI lived in my parents' house before marriage, and I lived as a wife, a mother and a daughter-in-law after marriage. It was the first time in my life that I'd spent 24 hours totally alone.\n\nI woke up when I wanted to wake up and slept when I wanted to sleep. I felt a bit lonely, but I went out and met people, and that helped.\n\nThings I really wanted to do had been removed from my priority list when I was living as a daughter-in-law ― but during those months alone, I lived fully and enjoyed it. That's when I wrote the book.\n\nHow is your relationship with your husband now?\n\nI thought that each of us should be free and independent for a healthy marital relationship, and a lot has changed. After I left, my children also became independent, and my husband was alone. When I came back after my surgery, I saw him cleaning the house and watering the flower pots. [Laughs.] Now we do everything together, from start to finish, when we cook.\n\nHave you ever heard of other people who tried to make a change via a letter of resignation?\n\nI've heard of many. There was a middle-aged man whom I met at a reading. He said he was shocked after reading my story. He had never thought about it that way and began worrying about his own wife resigning. He said he had a mental breakdown and decided he needed to change before his own wife quit. He said that he had got rid of all the unnecessary things for holiday preparations and went to the movies with his wife after almost 20 years of marriage, which made them both very happy.\n\nHe also said that he was committed to making changes to things that need to be changed from now on, which made me very happy.\n\nI hadn't expected my book or my actions to have made this sort of effect. I resigned because I felt like I was dying at the time, and after, I felt I'd been reborn. I am so encouraged when I hear about those who are trying to recover after thinking they've lost everything.\n\nThis interview has been translated from Korean. It was edited for length and clarity.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's governor announced Wednesday that he is posthumously pardoning a gay civil rights leader while creating a new pardon process for others convicted under outdated laws punishing homosexual activity.\n\nBayard Rustin was a confidant of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a key organizer of the March on Washington in 1963. He also helped plan other nonviolent protests and boycotts to end racial discrimination.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom pardoned Rustin for his arrest in 1953 when he was found having sex with two men in a parked car in Pasadena. He was in town as part of a lecture tour on anti-colonial struggles in West Africa.\n\nHe served 50 days in Los Angeles County jail and had to register as a sex offender before returning to his home state of New York. He died in 1987.\n\nNewsom noted that police and prosecutors nationwide at the time used charges like vagrancy, loitering and sodomy to punish lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people.\n\nHe issued an executive order creating what he called a new clemency initiative to identify those who might be eligible for pardons and swiftly consider those applications. He encouraged Californians to apply for clemency for people they believe meet that criteria.\n\nNewsom's office could not say if other states have taken similar steps.\n\nIn California and across the country, many laws have been used as legal tools of oppression, and to stigmatize and punish LGBTQ people and communities and warn others what harm could await them for living authentically, Newsom said in a statement. He thanked those who pushed for Rustin's pardon and encouraged others in similar circumstances to seek a pardon to right this egregious wrong.\n\nNewsom first gained national prominence in 2004 when, as San Francisco's mayor, he ordered officials to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The practice was overturned then but eventually became the law nationwide.\n\nThe California Legislature's LGBTQ and black caucuses last month asked the Democratic governor to pardon Rustin.\n\nRustin's close friends knew he was gay, but his religious and political associates distanced themselves after his arrest, Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Assemblywoman Shirley Weber told Newsom on behalf of the caucuses.\n\nGenerations of LGBT people — including countless gay men — were branded criminals and sex offenders simply because they had consensual sex, Wiener said in a statement praising Newsom's actions. This was often life-ruining, and many languished on the sex offender registry for decades.\n\nWeber said the pardon helps leave Rustin's legacy in the civil rights movement uncompromised.\n\nRustin was a great American who was both gay and black at a time when the sheer fact of being either or both could land you in jail, she said in a statement praising Newsom. This pardon assures his place in history.\n\nRustin was stripped of his leadership post at the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a pacifist organization involved in the civil rights movement, after U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina read Rustin's arrest file into the Congressional Record.\n\nCalifornia repealed the law against consensual sex between same-sex adults in 1975, and in 1997 created a way for those individuals to be removed from the California Sex Offender Registry. But neither step changed the original convictions.\n\nPresident Barack Obama honored Rustin posthumously with a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013 for the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and King's famous I Have a Dream speech.
When I was born in a dingy hospital in Ahmedabad, India, 29 years ago, my parents were handed two documents: a birth certificate and a natal chart. The doctor informed my mom that the latter, also known as a birth chart, was an astrological map that revealed how the position of the sun, moon, planets and other celestial bodies at the time I was born would influence my behavioral tendencies, character traits and life purpose.\n\nShe has to be named with the 'P' rashi [moon sign], he told her before handing over the paperwork. Don't lose this.\n\nIronically, my birth certificate got misplaced, but the natal chart remained accounted for and intact in its laminated form. When we moved to the United States, it traveled with us and eventually found a permanent and secure home in my dad's safe.\n\nI learned very early on that Vedic astrology ― the kind of astrology practiced in India, which differs from Western astrology ― served as a guidepost in my parents' household. Their trusted astrologer was on speed dial, despite living in India, and they frequently referred to my star alignment before I was allowed to make monumental decisions. Going out of state for college? Consult the planetary placement first. Picking a career in law? Make sure the zodiacs are on board. Looking to get married? Ensure the celestial bodies don't have any concerns.\n\nAlthough I'm not religious or an avid believer in astrology, I didn't argue with my parents' reliance on the astrologer's recommendations because it was just easier than trying to dispute the accuracy of his claims. They found solace in knowing that the Universe was somehow supportive of key milestones for me, and for most of my life, my personal pursuits seemed to be reinforced by the cosmic world they believed in, so I chose not to rebel.\n\nUntil now.\n\nLast summer, I got engaged to a British Indian man. He, like me, is a product of a liberal upbringing but understands the need to respect certain facets of our culture.\n\nThis meant that he needed the Universe's permission before formally asking for my hand in marriage.\n\nShortly after he proposed to me, our families decided to recognize our engagement in the traditional Hindu way, or as we colloquially call it, the coconut ceremony. During this ceremony, my fiancé and I would be given coconuts, money and other gifts from both sides of the families as a token of good luck as we formalized our commitment before God.\n\nThey say the course of true love never runs smooth and, for us, the biggest impediment was astrology.\n\nA week before the Indian engagement ceremony, my parents, brother, fiancé and I sat in our living room in Queens, New York, huddled around a phone to learn the astrologer's assessment of our compatibility. Kundali matching is a popular method in which the prospective bride and groom's horoscopes are compared under an obscure system that counts 36 points among the two horoscopes. If 18 or more points match, that's a match literally made in Heaven. Fewer than 18 matches means your marriage is not approved by the stars.\n\nIn order to calculate our score using this mysterious scientific and mathematical process, the astrologer needed some information.\n\nWhat's your birthday, exact time of birth and birth location? the familiar voice inquired over the speakerphone.\n\nMy fiancé reluctantly replied. I could read the apathy on his face, noting that to him this meant very little. On the other end of the line, I could hear the soft tapping of keys as the astrologer input our data to determine if our marriage would be suitable. The room was filled with palpable tension as we waited impatiently. We all understood that this analysis was a make-it-or-break-it moment for my parents.\n\nSixteen, he answered moments later. Not compatible. The marriage will not work.\n\nI could see the color drain from my parents' faces. My mom immediately went into problem-solving mode, inquiring what remedies were available to undo the cosmic block. She was determined to find a comfortable solution without defying the stars. After all, she and my dad had been married for over 30 years and she was convinced that it was due to their astrologer's prediction.\n\nI could hear the soft tapping of keys as the astrologer input our data to determine if our marriage would be suitable. The room was filled with palpable tension. ... We all understood that this analysis was a make-it-or-break-it moment for my parents. 'Sixteen,' he answered moments later. 'Not compatible. The marriage will not work.'\n\nOne possible remedy was an ancient practice called Kumbh Vivah, a ritual whereby a woman first symbolically marries an earthen pot or banana tree to remove the horoscopic error, something my mother had done herself. The objective was to neutralize the negative influence of Mars in an effort to transfer the bad luck that would otherwise befall her future husband to the artificial groom (the tree, pot, etc.), thereby allowing the bride to have a peaceful future marriage.\n\nAnother solution was to have a puja, a ceremony initiated by a priest whose chants and prayers would ward off the inauspicious energy. I could also wear a suitable yantra (gemstone) per my zodiac sign in what I learned was considered gemstone therapy, and the gem would radiate positive energy and lure away ill omens.\n\nFrankly, none of these solutions worked for me.\n\nIndian philosophy views marriage not only as a long-term commitment between two people but as a union of cosmic energy and permanent stability. Generations have relied on horoscope matchmaking (especially for arranged marriages) to get assurance that the married couple would enjoy a life of bliss, stability and health.\n\nI understand my parents' intentions regarding the horoscope matchmaking were nothing but positive. Throughout my life, my respect for them and my culture had dissuaded me from making decisions they might not agree with. I had silently complied with their need for astrological affirmation because it had never deterred me from what I wanted for myself. But this was where I drew the line. I did not feel comfortable with any of the astrologer's recommendations for fixing our problem.\n\nAfter trying to reason that astrology is imperfect and would provide no tangible assurance about the strength of my future marriage, I realized it was time to say what I was really thinking. At that moment, I didn't care that the cosmic bodies had determined that my marital union would be doomed. I was willing to take the risk of spending the rest of my life with my chosen partner, confident that we could overcome any obstacles ― cosmic or otherwise ― together.\n\nMy parents, of course, met this decision with some resistance.\n\nWhat about Jyoti, who got married against the astrologer's recommendation? Now they're getting divorced! my mom exclaimed about a distant cousin whose five-year marriage ended mutually due to noncosmic reasons. My parents listed other examples of couples with unsuccessful marriages, neglecting the many other reasons those relationships failed besides astrological incompatibility. It was clear they didn't want me to become another horror story or the classic I told you so example that other parents would end up telling their children.\n\nThis made me and my fiancé want to prove them ― and Indian society ― wrong even more.\n\nStill, as determined as we were, I will admit our astrological reading did give me temporary anxiety. This was the first time I would deviate from what astrology told me to do and for a moment, I wondered if I was going to jinx my marriage.\n\nI very quickly realized I was being irrational. My relationship with my partner was built on a foundation of mutual understanding, communication and real-life work. It is this same approach that we will rely on as a married couple, with no space for the Universe's opinion. For me, love is not a mystical phenomenon ― it is a manifestation of the respect and unconditional care that two people have for each other and that makes them want to spend forever with each other.\n\nI am sure there are many examples of others who did not heed the advice of their astrologer and still went on to experience successful marriages. We plan on joining those ranks.\n\nMonths have passed since that fateful reading and my parents have come around with their blessing and are now happily participating in our wedding planning. I thank my lucky stars that, despite some serious moments of doubt, they are supporting us. I realize that deviating from the comfort and certainty that astrology has brought them is a process in itself.\n\nMy fiancé and I are hoping to get married in London this coming September, once the global pandemic is over (or at least much less severe) and we can have our big fat Indian wedding safely in the presence of our close family and friends. There are still a lot of unknowns ahead of us but there's one thing I do know for sure: Astrology won't be on our guest list.\n\nPooja Shah is a freelance writer living and working in New York City.

Feb 27 (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called women's inequality stupid and a cause for global shame on Thursday, as he pledged to press governments to end discriminatory laws in the face of a strong and relentless pushback against women's rights.\n\nWhile Guterres did not name and shame, President Donald Trump's administration has led a push at the U.N. against the promotion of sexual and reproductive health services for women because the administration sees that as code for abortion.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were also being diluted or rolled back.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in New York next month, Guterres warned that the state of women's rights was dire and said he would seek to end default male thinking across the United Nations.\n\nJust as slavery and colonialism were a stain on previous centuries, women's inequality should shame us all in the 21st. Because it is not only unacceptable; it is stupid, Guterres said in a speech to The New School in New York.\n\nHe said legal protections against rape and domestic violence were being diluted or rolled back and that in 34 countries rape within marriage was still legal.\n\nThere is a strong and relentless pushback against women's rights, Guterres said. Women's sexual and reproductive rights are under threat from different sides.\n\nLanguage promoting women's sexual and reproductive health is long-agreed internationally, including in resolutions adopted by the Security Council in 2009 and 2013 and several resolutions adopted annually by the 193-member General Assembly.\n\nHowever, the United States under Trump has pushed to remove such language from new U.N. resolutions. The Trump administration also cut funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund because it believed it was linked to an abortion program, but the U.N. said that was an inaccurate perception.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that women have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion but the issue is still divisive in the United States.\n\nThe U.N. should not put itself in a position of promoting or suggesting a right to abortion, whether it is humanitarian or development work, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, said in October.\n\nThe United States has received support for its stance from countries including Russia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Guatemala, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Sudan, Uganda, Poland and Hungary.\n\nI find it pretty strange that the United States is mobilizing so hard on this issue ... because if you look at the bigger picture is the main threat to the world today abortions? Or is it an assertive China? A Russia that is expansionist? Let's just get our focus right here, said a senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nLast year Washington threatened to veto a Security Council resolution if a reference was not cut citing the need for U.N. bodies and donors to give timely sexual and reproductive health assistance to survivors of sexual violence in conflict.\n\nGuterres said on Thursday he would urge governments to achieve gender parity in senior leadership. He said he achieved gender parity among his senior leadership team - on Jan. 1, 90 women and 90 men were in the ranks of full-time senior leadership, two years ahead of the target date he set.\n\nWomen have equaled and outperformed men in almost every sphere, he said. It is time to stop trying to change women, and start changing the systems that prevent them from achieving their potential.
Did Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry get engaged on Valentine's Day?\n\nThat's the consensus on social media and among multiple news outlets after pop star Perry shared a post — simply captioned full bloom — to Instagram early Friday.\n\nThe image below appears to show Perry sporting a sparkler on what many fans believe is her ring finger. In the background of the couple's picture are dozens of heart-shaped red balloons:\n\nBritain's Daily Mirror tabloid reported that Perry's mother, Mary Hudson, confirmed the engagement news in a Facebook post.\n\nBloom shared the same snap on Instagram, which he captioned Lifetimes. He posted this rumination on relationships the day before:\n\nPerry also posted a picture on Thursday celebrating happy mushy gushy day.\n\nAnd in her Instagram stories, singer shared this sweet image of her beau:\n\nPerry, 34, has dated the 42-year-old British The Lord of the Rings actor on-and-off since 2016. Perry's first marriage to British actor and comedian Russell Brand ended in 2012. Bloom shares a son with supermodel Miranda Kerr, with whom he split in 2013.
Two years ago, after eight years of marriage, my husband moved out and even though the change was good and long overdue, financially it was utterly devastating. I had two kids to take care of, a mortgage to pay and bills that never seemed to stop coming. While part of me was excited to tackle it all on my own, I had only worked part-time while caring for my kids. In that sense, I'd never done it all on my own. I was terrified.\n\nI knew getting my finances under control wouldn't happen without effort. Still, my two kids were finally both full-time in school. I saw an opportunity to push further in my career than I'd ever been able to do as a mom at home with the kids. I was excited to sink my teeth into new and exciting work, and I did. I scrimped and saved and cut back on expenses. I put just enough gas in the car to get the kids to school and get back home. But no matter what I did, I'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. I'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.\n\nI felt my financial struggles gaining on me, so I picked up extra jobs wherever I could, bargain-shopped and sold items that were sitting in my garage. I tried hard to get ahead of it. Still, I wondered if January 2020 would be the year that it all came crashing down. For a while, it was all I could think about. I wondered how anyone, especially single parents, was able to financially survive in modern times. Personally, I felt like I was constantly underwater.\n\nNo matter what I did, I'd check my balance and my heart would pound in my chest. I'd pay one bill and five more would roll in with late fees attached.\n\nI used to love Christmas, but this past year, as soon as all the gifts were unwrapped and I'd polished off the last sugar cookie while standing over the sink, all I felt was relief. There had been arguing with my estranged husband about holiday plans, and a sad, toxic mediation session that took place just a few days before Christmas. I had burst out crying in the first five minutes. In an effort to stand up for myself and my kids, I yelled and raged, and I left feeling angry and broken, wondering why on earth we had decided to schedule mediation so close to the holidays. But mostly, what kept me up at night was a heavy, consuming financial stress that had been building for months.\n\nI couldn't sleep for weeks leading up to Dec. 25. I stayed awake refreshing my bank account on my phone to see if my paycheck had cleared. It finally did on the evening of the 23rd, and I frantically went out and did all of my shopping ― for my two kids and everyone else ― on Christmas Eve. Mostly, I crafted and made cookies and wrote heartfelt notes to teachers and people I wanted to do more for but couldn't, financially.\n\nRegardless of having slapped Christmas together, the whole vibe of the holidays was off, at least for me. I was so consumed by stress, I hadn't felt like myself. I had been catching myself too overwhelmed to offer a smile to a stranger, or do the things I would normally do, like drop change in a bucket or make a donation to an important charity or take a hat out of my glove compartment and give it to someone on the street ― things I like to do but this year felt I couldn't. Emotionally and financially, I was maxed out, and that meant I wasn't in the spirit of helping others, even though I wanted to.\n\nI was about one late payment away from serious repercussions. I had to fill the income gap, and fast. Truthfully, I was starting to panic.\n\nEven though I'd recently gotten a more steady job as an editor and had been picking up other work as much as I could, a gap in my income still meant I couldn't pay my January mortgage. Because I'd made late payments before, it wasn't good. I was about one late payment away from serious repercussions. I had to fill the income gap, and fast.\n\nTruthfully, I was starting to panic. I whispered affirmations to myself. I brainstormed ways to make up the money. I sold my engagement ring for $250, picked up freelance assignments and I reached out on a Facebook community where fellow writers and editors often discuss work opportunities. In a moment of panic, I wrote a quick note about my situation and let members know I was available for some quick jobs if anyone had anything to toss my way.\n\nAlmost immediately, a member responded. I was excited because I didn't know if the message would get overlooked completely or if maybe someone had a quick writing or copyediting job to offer. The group member sent me a private message. She asked me what my Venmo name was. I responded immediately, assuming she wanted to connect for future payment, after I completed whatever work she had to offer, maybe transcribing something that wouldn't take too much time. I had said I was open to anything. Instead, my phone dinged immediately ― it was the sound of a Venmo payment coming through. This complete stranger had sent me $350 ― the amount I had specified that I was needing to earn in the next few days to make up the gap.\n\nAlong with the payment she wrote a note. Happy new year to a badass single mama ― no strings attached. I was completely blown away. Are you kidding me!? I wrote her back, my fingers flying on keyboard. We chatted briefly. I thanked her profusely but I was stunned. I didn't know what action to take.\n\nIt was such a tremendous gift that it almost didn't add up. I'd never been gifted money like this before for no good reason.\n\nPart of me felt like sending the money back. It was such a tremendous gift that it almost didn't add up. I'd never been gifted money like this before for no good reason. But I realized, this woman really wanted to help, and clearly she was able to. She didn't seem to need a lot of thanks or even acknowledgment ― she didn't want anything at all. It was hard to find the right words to express my gratitude.\n\nShe had no idea how much it meant, though. With this gift, I'd finally be able to get out of the hole I had basically been in for two years since getting separated. I'd be starting 2020 with a clean slate, rather than yet another late mortgage payment. It was maybe the most meaningful gift I'd ever gotten and it came from someone I'd never met or even spoken to before online.\n\nI wondered why she had done it. Had she once been a struggling single mother? Had she recently read something that made her want to pay it forward? Had the note I'd quickly jotted asking for an odd job, or any job, struck a nerve? Did she just go around doing things like this for others all of the time? I didn't know the answer and I'd probably never get it. Still, regardless of the reason, her action filled me with gratitude.\n\nPeople are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined.\n\nWhile I had begun the year exhausted by stress and financial worry, I felt a shift in my mentality after the first week of January. I realized how unexpectedly kind people can be. It's so hard to see sometimes because most people don't have the means to help others, and I don't just mean financially. People are generally just so caught up in their own lives, their own stress, their own minor panics, that small acts of kindness get sidelined. I certainly was caught up in mine.\n\nLast week, my daughter and I gave a ride to a woman whose car had broken down. It took us five minutes out of our way ― it didn't cost a thing. This gift that was given to me, even though it was financial, helped me remember the tons of ways we can help one another and that we should do them as often as we can, despite our income bracket. The truth is that most people genuinely want to help. When we do, it creates a space for us to keep paying it forward in whatever ways we can. Easing someone's burden gives them the ability to help ease someone else's.\n\nI'm back to dropping change in buckets whenever I can because someone dropped change in mine.\n\nHave a compelling first-person story or experience you want to share?

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief on Wednesday criticized proposals in Indonesia's parliament to criminalize gay sex and extramarital sex, saying such laws could hurt the country's beleaguered LGBT community and other minorities.\n\nZeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said he had raised the issue with President Joko Widodo during a three-day visit to the world's largest Muslim-majority country, where hostility toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community has risen sharply in recent years.\n\nDiscussions of (revisions to the criminal code) betray strains of intolerance seemingly alien to Indonesian culture that have made inroads here, Zeid told a news briefing, adding that he believed the proposed rules were discriminatory.\n\nThe hateful rhetoric against the LGBT community that is being cultivated seemingly for cynical political purposes will only deepen their suffering and create unnecessary divisions, he said.\n\nIndonesia's parliament is currently deliberating revisions to a Dutch colonial-era criminal code, including proposals to outlaw sex outside marriage, same-sex relations, and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated by law.\n\nThe revisions have broad support in parliament, where few politicians have stood up for LGBT rights for fear of alienating a largely conservative voter base ahead of legislative and presidential elections next year.\n\nMany officials in President Widodo's government have said LGBT people, like other citizens, should be free from discrimination and violence. But top officials, including the president, have said that Indonesia's cultural and religious norms do not accept the LGBT movement.\n\nActivists have raised concerns that, if approved, the new rules could violate basic rights and be misused to target minorities.\n\nCurrently, Indonesian law does not regulate homosexuality, except in the ultra-conservative Islamic province of Aceh.\n\nZeid, a member of the Jordanian royal family who has been in the U.N. post since 2014, said Indonesia was among the most progressive states in Southeast Asia on human rights.\n\nBut he also urged Jakarta to address past atrocities - like the 1965 massacre of nearly half a million suspected communists - and human rights abuses in the easternmost province of Papua, and the use of the death penalty.\n\nThere are some dark clouds on the horizon but ... I hope the common sense and strong tradition of tolerance of the Indonesian people will prevail over populism and political opportunism, he said.\n\nReporting by Kanupriya KapoorEditing by Ed Davies and Christopher Cushing
It's become an inevitable game, of sorts, every awards season for the last several years (particularly in the wake of #OscarsSoWhite in 2015), for us to tally up so-called diversity and inclusion wins.\n\nAt Sunday night's Golden Globes ceremony, there were major accolades for Awkwafina, who became the first woman of Asian descent to win the award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Egyptian comedian and actor Ramy Youssef took home his first major award for Best Actor in a TV Series - Comedy, using his time onstage to earnestly explain how much it meant for him to create a show about a young Muslim-American man. Kate McKinnon presented a lifetime achievement award to Ellen DeGeneres in an emotional speech where she declared, If I hadn't have seen her on TV, I would have never thought I could be on TV.\n\nBut there were surprising losses, too. (This excludes the works that were completely snubbed in nominations, like Ava DuVernay's stellar When They See Us, Lupita Nyong'o's performance in Us and Zendaya Coleman's role in Euphoria.) Eddie Murphy's comeback performance in Dolemite Is My Name failed to garner recognition; he lost to Taron Edgerton for Rocketman, and Dolemite was shut out altogether. Billy Porter of Pose (unsurprisingly) lost the Best Actor in a TV Series - Drama award to industry juggernaut Brian Cox of the wildly popular Succession. And, in one of the biggest snubs of the night, odds-on favorite Jennifer Lopez — dressed in gold — lost the Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture award to Laura Dern's wonderful albeit glorified cameo performance in Marriage Story.\n\nChristopher Polk/NBC via Getty Images Awkwafina arrives to the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 5, 2020.\n\nThis year's Globes infamously shut out women in the Best Director category, despite the abundance of critically acclaimed, money-making films by female directors including Lulu Wang, Lorene Scafaria, Greta Gerwig, Mati Diop and Celine Sciamma. Their lack of nominations doesn't magically erase the brilliance of the movies they made.\n\nAnd yet, it says something.\n\nNominate more women, Wang, director of The Farewell, told Variety, when asked on the red carpet what her message to members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association would be. What is the determination of a good film versus not a good film if you can't look at critic reviews or box office?\n\nIn a perfect world, such objective (or gesturing toward objective) criteria for nominations would be the norm. But in Hollywood, it's not always about quality in determining who gets nominated and who wins. Politics, the power of a good narrative and diversity — not only of the performers, directors and others, but those who are doing the nominating — are also key drivers in who ultimately nabs the statue.\n\nLike all questions of progress when it comes to diversity and inclusion, actually quantifying forward advancement, or using award shows to gauge that movement, is tenuous at best. Progress usually comes in stops and starts. One year, Moonlight may win the coveted Best Picture Academy Award. Another year, the white savior buddy movie Green Book may inexplicably take the top prize.\n\nThe Golden Globes, of course, are fun, but they aren't the Academy Awards. They aren't even much of an indicator of who may get an Oscar; there's no overlap between Golden Globes voters and Academy members.\n\nAnd yet Sunday's awards were a great microcosm of the interesting place Hollywood now finds itself in, five years after #OscarsSoWhite, three years after #MeToo. The host of the night, Ricky Gervais, made a few pithy attempts at jokes about diversity, calling the HFPA (who vote for the winners) racist, and calling out the lack of female director nominees.\n\nWe were going to do an 'In Memoriam' tonight but … when I saw the list of people who died, it wasn't diverse enough, he quipped. It was too many white people.\n\nIt's a cute enough joke, but it also distills the beginning and ending of so many diversity and inclusion conversations that we've had in recent years. Much of the Hollywood establishment believes that the point of contention is always about whether there are too many white people, or too many men and so on.\n\nReally, it's about something else.\n\nDiversity is all well and good, but there's also a question of taste, of discernment. Award ceremonies are supposed to be the purveyors of what's next, what's exciting, what's enriching the culture as a whole. So-called diverse filmmakers and actors shouldn't win or be nominated for awards just by virtue of existing, no. But when genuinely stellar work by these creators goes unnoticed for the sake of lauding the same revolving cast of characters, it raises a singular question.\n\nIf an awards show in 2020 shuts out several brilliant female directors as nominees in favor of predictable male directors, if it completely snubs one of the best miniseries of last year, When They See Us, is it even relevant anymore?
I'm referring, of course to Valentine's Day. And what a blessed relief it is to hit the pause button, take a break from hatred and celebrate love. I can't remember a time we needed it more.\n\nBut before we get into that, did you know that the Feast of Saint Valentine (or Valentine's Day) wasn't always about couples expressing their love for each other?\n\nThat only happened later, first in the 14th-century, when Geoffrey Chaucer incorporated Saint Valentine's Day into his love poem, The Parliament of Fowls and then, in 18th-century England, when lovers began giving flowers, confectionary and sent greeting cards.\n\nBefore that Valentines was anything but loving.\n\nLegend has it that way back in the third century the Roman Emperor Claudius II was building up a military and thought single men made better soldiers. So he outlawed marriage for young men. A priest, named Valentine, disagreed and thought the ban was unfair, and he continued to perform marriage ceremonies secretly.\n\nMore and more I hear Canadians making mean and disparaging comments about those who disagree or have different points of view. I also hear racist remarks, which is terribly distressing.\n\nYep, Claudius got pissed and had the priest killed. I suppose we should be grateful that President Trump just takes to Twitter.\n\nSome of you may wonder why I harp so much on Donald Trump. There are a few reasons, not the least of which is that I detest everything he stands for. It just goes against all I believe in and hold dear. Plus, If he continues to head down this same path he's currently headed on, I believe he will put America -- and very possibly other countries, Canada included -- in danger.\n\nHis influence, his message of hatred and hostility, are alarmingly far-reaching and that really concerns me.\n\nMore and more I hear Canadians making mean and disparaging comments about those who disagree or have different points of view. I also hear racist remarks, which is terribly distressing. It's not who we are as a nation. Some of the things said after the shooting at the Mosque in Quebec made me feel like I was at a Trump rally.\n\nAnd I'm not ashamed, or afraid, to say I don't like it.\n\nWe need to nip it in the bud before we find ourselves smack dab in the middle of a rebellion here, in Canada. We cannot delude ourselves into thinking we're immune. We have plenty of issues of our own -- like income inequality, like aboriginal issues, like the Keystone pipeline, like electoral reform -- and I sure hope Justin Trudeau's paying attention. Because the Trump effect crosses borders, we're already seeing some evidence of that. And I'd prefer us to solve our problems our way, not his.\n\nThere may be another way to counter his revolution of hate and it's Valentine's Day that's made me think of it. Maybe it's time we -- and by we I mean the world -- had a revolution of our own. Maybe it's time for another love-in.\n\nWhat if every time Donald Trump tweets something hateful, we tweet something loving and kind.\n\nWhat if we respond to every nasty act of his, by being considerate.\n\nWhat if every time he points fingers, we give hugs.\n\nWhat if we smile at strangers on the subway, in the elevator, on the street, in restaurants and cafes and supermarkets.\n\nWhat if we always remember to take the extra minute to say thank you.\n\nWhat if we all wore little red heart pins on our lapels.\n\nWhat if ...\n\nIf you enjoyed this story click on become a fan at the top of the article right next to my name.

LONDON (AP) — Lawyers for the Duchess of Sussex asked a British judge on Tuesday to settle her lawsuit against a newspaper before it goes to trial by ruling that its publication of a deeply personal letter to her estranged father was a plain and a serious breach of her rights of privacy.\n\nThe duchess, 39, is suing Associated Newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement over five February 2019 articles in the Mail on Sunday and on the MailOnline website that published portions of a handwritten letter to her father, Thomas Markle, after her marriage to Britain's Prince Harry in 2018.\n\nAssociated Newspapers is contesting the claim, and the full trial is due to be held in the autumn at the High Court in London.\n\nThe duchess is seeking a summary judgment that would find in her favor and dismiss the newspaper's defense case. Her lawyer Justin Rushbrooke argued that the publisher had no real prospect of winning the case.\n\nAt its heart it's a very straightforward case about the unlawful publication of a private letter, he said Tuesday at the start of a two-day hearing, held remotely because of coronavirus restrictions.\n\nClive Mason via Getty Images The Duchess of Sussex attends day twelve of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships on July 14, 2018 in London.\n\nRushbrooke said Meghan had every expectation that a heartfelt plea from an anguished daughter to her father would remain private.\n\nLawyers for the duchess say Thomas Markle, a retired television cinematographer, caused anguish for Meghan and Harry before their May 2018 wedding by giving media interviews and posing for wedding-preparation shots taken by a paparazzi agency. In the end he did not attend the wedding ceremony after suffering a heart attack.\n\nRushbrooke said Meghan's letter, sent in August 2018, was a message of peace whose aim was to stop him talking to the press.\n\nHe said the duchess took steps to ensure the five-page, 1,250-word letter would not be intercepted, sending it by FedEx through her accountant to her father's home in Mexico. The letter implored Thomas Markle to stop speaking to the media, saying: Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces.\n\nThe last sentences, read out in court, were: I ask for nothing other than peace. And I wish the same for you.\n\nLawyers for Associated Newspapers argue that Meghan likely knew the letter would one day be published.\n\nThey also say she made personal information public by cooperating with the authors of a behind-the-scenes book about her and Harry, Finding Freedom, in order to present a version of events favorable and flattering to her.\n\nToby Melville / Reuters An employee holds a copy of 'Finding Freedom', an unofficial biography on Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, at a Waterstones bookshop in London on Aug. 12, 2020.\n\nMeghan denies collaborating with the authors — though she acknowledges allowing someone close to her to speak to them — and the book is expected to feature prominently in the trial.\n\nRushbrooke said the fact that the duchess is a public figure does not reduce her expectation of privacy in relation to information of this kind.\n\nHe said the sad intricacies of a family relationship … is not a matter of public interest.\n\nThe defense will respond on Wednesday.\n\nIn October, judge Mark Warby agreed to Meghan's request to postpone the trial, scheduled to begin this month, until October or November 2021. He said the reason for the delay should remain secret.\n\nMeghan, an American actress and star of TV legal drama Suits, married Harry, one of the grandsons of Queen Elizabeth II, in a lavish ceremony at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son, Archie, was born the following year.\n\nA year ago, Meghan and Harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said was the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. They recently bought a house in Santa Barbara, California.

A week after getting engaged, I woke up in the middle of the night soaked in my own stress sweat. The excitement of the proposal had worn off and the questions began to race through my mind.\n\nHow would our relationship change once we got married?\n\nDo we need to get married or can we just ditch the legal document?\n\nWill I have to drain my savings account to fund this wedding?\n\nSpeaking of money, what will happen to my money once we're married?\n\nThat last question has stuck with me for quite some time. My fiancé and I have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. We've discussed topics like having kids, raising kids with a certain religion and our future career and relationship goals. We've always found ourselves seamlessly getting on the same page.\n\nWe've also talked a lot about our finances, disclosing to each other what our cash situation looks like and what kind of money mistakes we've made in the past. But one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word ― prenup.\n\nFor a while, I didn't think getting a prenup was something we needed to do. Neither of us were walking into this marriage with major assets. We just figured we'd keep our separate bank accounts, for a while, and figure out how to split bills and financially plan together, while keeping some things separate.\n\nIn New York, where we plan to get married, the money you make becomes marital. Which means, it's shared. Money or assets from the past become marital, too, unless you protect them with a prenup or don't add any money to your savings account, investments or assets.\n\nMy fiancé and I have always been good at having hard conversations about life and our relationship. But one thing we never talked about before getting engaged was the infamous word -- prenup.\n\nBut the more I thought about the word marriage and the legal bindingness of it, the more I began to panic. I knew I had to talk to my fiancé about our financial game plan and perhaps even about getting a prenup.\n\nI thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more I researched that, the more I realized I was wrong. Essentially, prenups are something for anyone to consider, regardless of how much money you have to your name, who wants protection or a legal game plan of what will happen if the marriage ends. Why argue about all of the assets you came into the marriage with, when the marriage is crumbling and on its final leg? Why not get that out of the way beforehand. The idea of a prenup or a legal financial document started to sound more and more attractive.\n\nWhen I brought this topic up to my fiancé, at first, it was uncomfortable. He questioned why I had this fear and then began to understand the positives of exploring our financial protection options before getting married. For starters, it allowed us to go into the marriage with a clear plan of action for how we'd combine our finances and what we'd keep separate.\n\nI thought prenups were just for people with huge amounts of money in the bank and long lists of assets, but the more I researched that, the more I realized I was wrong.\n\nIt also would be something that could calm my pre-marriage anxiety, which I find normal. You're about to legally bind a lot of yourself to another person, shouldn't that feel a little scary? We decided to educate ourselves on what a prenup would mean and in the process, figuring out the best moves for ourselves individually and as a couple.\n\nBefore continuing any financial conversation together, we decided to spend time separately going through our finances. We each created a spreadsheet with the current state of our bank accounts, our investments our retirement funds, and our debt. We also decided to write down what we both felt we were comfortable combining and what we wanted to keep separate (to be used for a potential future prenup).\n\nTaking this step not only allowed us to both organize any outstanding financial mess (like the need to merge an old 401(k) into a SEP IRA) but also have all our assets documented in an easy to consume way.\n\nAfter sharing our spreadsheets, we decided to reach out and get help. A lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. We both had different ideas about how to go about doing this; I wanted us to live on a tight budget to increase our savings and my partner wanted us to invest more now.\n\nA lot of the conversations that floated to the surface turned into small fights over deciding how to budget and save together. We both had different ideas about how to go about doing this.\n\nAn entire coffee shop of people stared at me as I yelled and cried one afternoon while we went over our credit card statements and talked about the kind of purchases we could cut back on. I found myself feeling strong and sensitive about the fact that I've been single and independent for most of my twenties and have worked hard for my money. Though I've made money mistakes along the way, I was proud of my accomplishments, and at times, exposing my errors to my fiancé made me feel weak.\n\nWe spent full day in silence after a conversation about how to split our money and wages went south after discussing the potential scenario of having kids. I would have to temporarily stop working for a few months, and we both freelance so there's no such thing as paid maternity or paternity leave for us. We didn't reach a resolution.\n\nWe realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. These were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.\n\nWe sat down with someone at The Financial Gym, which according to their website is a group of financial trainers looking to put you in control of your finances, one step at a time.\n\nWe realized that we both needed financial advice and mediation from an expert. These were important conversations to have and to hold before getting married.\n\nWe met with a financial trainer who asked us questions about what our individual and joint financial goals were, analyzed our assets and helped us determine how much we should budget and save for our ideal retirement and investment plans.\n\nTurning to an expert helped us power through a difficult set of conversations about basic finance and how things will work once our money is merged and the money we make becomes shared. Once we knew what we were both bringing into the relationship, and were close to agreeing on how to implement shared money habits, we decided it was time to think about whether or not we wanted a prenup. While I always thought prenups were for people who had millions of dollars in assets, it turns out I was wrong.\n\nBefore making the decision, we decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date, to talk about what kinds of terms we could include in a prenup and what we could potentially add to it later on. This felt like a smart and proactive choice to help protect us from outcomes we weren't necessarily ready for since we weren't planning for them to happen.\n\nWe decided to book an appointment to meet with a divorce lawyer, six months before our wedding date.\n\nWhen we go to that appointment next month, we'll be ready to share our assets with the divorce lawyer, our future concerns and how we'd like to handle the worst case scenario of our relationship, an unexpected ending. Either way, we're way past the awkwardness of having the prenup or financial protection conversation. Now when the word comes up, we laugh and share with our friends proudly that we're considering getting one. A lot of them look at us with wide eyes of shock.\n\nOver dinner with another engaged couple, we talked about the P word and the only thing they could share with us was that they are concerned we're approaching our engagement journey in a negative way, by planning for the worst.\n\nNone of my friends have ever openly talked about getting a prenup before their marriage and if they did get one, they kept that secret and swallowed the idea of releasing that information to their close friends. Some people feel the decision is private, but society tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life ― the actual wedding day.\n\nSociety tells us that getting a prenup is like you're planning for the worst instead of working so hard on planning the best day of your life -- the actual wedding day.\n\nThe more I talked to friends about this and told them I might want to get one, the more I felt judged. Some friends even texted me asking if I was having second thoughts about marrying my fiancé. I'm not. I truly feel like marrying this person is the best decision but that doesn't mean I should feel shamed for wanting to figure out how I will walk out of the marriage, financially, if it ever comes to that. The wedding day will be a great day in our lives, but it's the marriage that's the most important ― and this includes discussing our finances.\n\nI've spent years making money and saving it. When life together gets complicated and changes (kids and more joint assets), I feel like I have the right to have a plan in place ― aka a prenup. It might seem unromantic to be so frank and rational, but I think it's the opposite. We've found ourselves, and our relationship, getting even stronger now that we know everything, every dollar and every conversation, is on the table.\n\nHave a compelling first-person story or experience you want to share?

It's no secret that money problems are a leading cause of stress in relationships. And for a significant portion of Americans, debt is a major source of money strife that doesn't bode well for their love lives.\n\nMore than half of millennials in relationships agree that they don't want to get married until their finances are in order, according to a survey by Credit Karma. Forty-two percent say transparency about a partner's finances is key to a healthy relationship, while 71% say it's at least somewhat important their partner's finances be up to certain standards before marriage.\n\nSo, what if you or your partner is dealing with a load of debt? Is it a death sentence for the relationship?\n\nMoney is a complicated beast in the therapy room, and in real life. It is a charged topic that is, for many, taboo, said Joy Lere, a psychologist with a practice focused on the merger of money and mindset. It is more than simple math … Differences in money management and unspoken rules about how it is discussed (or not) can lead to significant friction or fracture in a relationship.\n\nIf you're concerned that debt will ruin your relationship, know that's not necessarily the case. It depends on how you and your partner handle it together.\n\nDebt Is Simply A Catalyst\n\nWhen it comes to couples with debt, the money alone is not the root cause of relationship problems. It's the pressure and conflict that often arises from dealing with that debt that can bring to light other issues in the relationship.\n\nDebt can serve a stand-alone stressor, but when superimposed on other relational strain can amplify problems in a relationship, Lere said. Issues such as secrecy about spending, disagreements on how to handle finances and varying levels of comfort carrying a balance can all be sources of tension.\n\nThat's because money also is a sort of emotional currency in relationships. It can be a vehicle for communicating certain messages that are not being put into words between two people. When misused, money can be a bid for power, control or punishment. Spending can also be used as a stand-in for other unmet needs.\n\nAmy Rollo, a psychotherapist and owner of Heights Family Counseling in Houston, agreed. As a couples therapist, it is actually rare for money stress to be the biggest issue. For most couples, it is difficulty managing conflict, feeling disconnected, trust issues, commitment difficulties or an inability to create shared meaning in their relationship that causes the most distress, she said.\n\nWhile some couples may view debt as a deal breaker, Rollo said that for most, it's dishonesty. I've had several clients present to couples counseling because they feel deceived by their partner. They share they did not realize their partner's debt burden until they were already married or engaged, Rollo said.\n\nLere put it this way: Money is rarely just about numbers. For a couple to solve financial issues that may be leading to strain in the relationship, they need to develop insight into their own relationships with money and figure out the psychological reasons behind the mismanagement.\n\nAdditionally, Lere said that the circumstances and spirit under which the debt was accumulated can color the impact it has on a couple. If a disproportionate amount of debt belongs to one person (whether it was accumulated before or during the relationship), it can lead to feelings of resentment if the repayment requires deep sacrifice of a partner.\n\nPeopleImages via Getty Images Money is rarely just about numbers, said psychologist Joy Lere. But it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker.\n\nThat's not to say that dealing with a massive amount of debt isn't stressful on its own. Debt is a major burden that makes it difficult to spend on activities and shared goals as a couple. But when it comes to the relationship, it shouldn't be something that tears you apart unless there are other factors, such as communication and coping skills, that need some work, too.\n\nIn my work with couples, I've found debt can negatively impact a relationship, but doesn't have to, said Brent Sweitzer, a marriage counselor in Cumming, Georgia. Family therapist Virginia Satir famously said, 'Problems are not the problem. It's the coping.' I see this truth play out daily in couple interactions and communications.\n\nAfter all, higher levels of debt ― particularly student loan debt ― are becoming the norm for millennials entering relationships and starting families, according to Sweitzer. What seems to make the difference for couples that are able to navigate it successfully and even get closer through managing debt is how they communicate about it, he said.\n\nCommunication Is More Than Just Talking\n\nWhen you get down to it, the root of most problems between couples is communication. If debt is placing undue stress on you or your partner and it's leading to conflict, there's a good chance that your communication about the problem needs some work ― or isn't happening at all.\n\nHowever, Sweitzer points out that communication is much more than simply airing your grievances to each other. It's seeking to understand the other person and the many factors that shaped them, he said. For instance, how did the person with the debt get in that situation in the first place? What did they learn from childhood about managing money and the ethics of debt? Did they learn to cope with emotional difficulties by spending, by depriving themself?\n\nIf both people can seek to understand, they can both feel understood, Sweitzer said. Then debt could be a catalyst for connecting at a deeper level and uncovering solutions to problems that each person wouldn't have come up with on their own.\n\nDebt Can Make Or Break A Relationship\n\nTo say that debt is ever a blessing is probably a huge stretch. However, it can serve as a tool for helping couples learn how to work together.\n\nFor couples who are honest from the start, the debt might not be a big deal or it can even be something that strengthens the couple, Rollo said. You can join forces to tackle the debt and really feel like you're on the same team, working toward a larger goal.\n\nHowever, if you struggle to see finances in the same way, or have different values when it comes to money, it can be helpful to work with a couples therapist. Counseling can help each person learn how to express their needs, while also providing validation and empathy for their partner's needs and viewpoint, according to Rollo. The way we view money can be such a personal thing … this is why it is important for each partner to really get to the root with empathy and respect, she said.
If you're anything like me, you've been waiting for something as entertaining as Downton Abbey to come out, holding out but little hope.\n\nAlas, your tiny hope is not to be in vain! This Friday marks the release of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, a rather wily take on the Jane Austen classic, adapted from the book of the same name. In this zany flick you get all the wit and wisdom of Austen, and all the apocalyptic gore of zombies, in one awesome package. If you did have plans for this weekend, they're obviously all now going to be taking a backseat to seeing this movie.\n\nIn honor of the original and the unmatched Pride and Prejudice as well as this refreshingly irreverent take on feminism and great literature, here are a few things we ALL can learn from P&P heroine Elizabeth Bennet -- the old and the new.\n\nLiz Bennet wouldn't have gotten married. She'd have been too busy slaying zombies.\n\nWay too many people get married because they have very few other goals at a particular moment in time; it just seemed like the obvious next step. I think a good way to remedy this in modern life is to introduce a zombie apocalypse.\n\nIf she DID get married, Liz Bennet would have had a prenup.\n\nWhy? Because she's a realist. Prenups aren't just for CEOs marrying supermodels, folks -- they're for everybody. Much like that extra dagger she keeps tucked in her corset, Liz Bennet knows only chumps don't have backup.\n\nIf she decided to get divorced, Liz Bennet would have kicked ass in court. And out of court.\n\nAs is evident from the pages of the novel itself, Liz Bennet is no slouch when it comes to laying down the law. In short: Don't mess with her. She'll end you.\n\nLiz Bennet would be an awesome co-parent.\n\nShe's able to keep her emotions in check under stress, she (usually) makes excellent judgments, and she knows how to work as part of a team -- this is what makes her great zombie-killing and co-parenting alike.\n\nLiz Bennet is okay with an imperfect reality.\n\nThis film is taking Liz Bennet's ability to adapt to a whole new level, making the most of her well-known tolerance for irritants -- whether they come in the form of zombies or men who don't know how to communicate their emotions properly.\n\nSo life wasn't exactly what you had in mind. Liz Bennet would tell you, quite rightly, to get your s*** together and slay some zombies.\n\nSo, what's your favorite Liz Bennet moment? Did she perhaps even inspire you during a tough divorce? And most importantly, are you seeing this movie?\n\nTweet your responses to @nycdivorcelaw or leave me a comment on our firm's Facebook page.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJames J. Sexton
Barcroft Media via Getty Images Pro-choice campaigners stage a demonstration on June 5. 2018, in Parliament Square in London demanding the British Government decriminalizes abortion in Northern Ireland following the result of the referendum in the Republic of Ireland last month.\n\nIreland just expanded the legal definition of domestic violence to include emotional and psychological abuse.\n\nAs part of the country's Domestic Violence Act 2018, which went into effect on New Year's Day, coercive control is now recognized as domestic violence and is punishable by up to five years in prison. The legislation defines coercive control as psychological abuse in an intimate relationship that causes fear of violence, or serious alarm or distress that has a substantial adverse impact on a person's day-to-day activities.\n\nThe new law makes Ireland one of only a handful of countries that have set such a precedent. It's an important step in Ireland, where one in five women experiences some form of emotional, physical, sexual and financial abuse by an intimate partner in her lifetime, according to the Irish anti-domestic violence organization Women's Aid.\n\nThe new law recognizes that the effect of non-violent control in an intimate relationship can be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship, Ireland's Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan, said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThis new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context, he continued.\n\nThe Domestic Violence Act 2018 also criminalizes forced marriage, allows restraining orders for couples who do not live together and restricts media coverage in cases of gender-based violence.\n\nWomen's Aid director Margaret Martin said her organization will be closely monitoring the implementation of the legislation.\n\nFrom January 1, 2019, women must feel change quickly. It must be positive, it must be practical and it must make them and their children safer from abuse, she said in a Tuesday statement.\n\nShe noted that budget constraints could hinder the law's effectiveness. What is promised on paper must be fully resourced to be effective in protecting those affected by domestic violence, Martin said. We are concerned that an already over-stretched system will see an increase in demand when the new provisions commence. Cases of emotional abuse far exceeded reported cases of physical abuse in Ireland in 2017, according to data obtained by Women's Aid. That year alone, there were 15,833 reports of domestic violence. Of those, 10,281 were cases of emotional and psychological abuse, and 3,502 were cases of physical abuse. Additionally, there were 1,443 reported cases of financial abuse and 607 reported cases of sexual abuse.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg credits the friendly skies for uniting him and his husband, Chasten.\n\nAppearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers this week, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor shared select anecdotes about his nearly three-year marriage, including the reason he opted for a somewhat unlikely location ― Chicago's O'Hare International Airport ― to pop the question in 2017.\n\nI know that not everybody understands that O'Hare can be a romantic place, but it absolutely can, Buttigieg said Monday. The first time Chasten and I ever communicated was on this app called Hinge, and he was sitting at Gate B5 at the airport. ... I always remembered that, in a certain technical sense, even though it was remotely, that was where we first met.\n\nTwo years after that initial 2015 exchange, the couple were visiting O'Hare before embarking on a vacation, where Buttigieg had planned to propose. And as it turns out, air travel turned out to be a fitting metaphor for their relationship.\n\nI told him [marriage] would be a lot like being in the airport, Buttigieg recalled. Life with me would be hard to steal private moments, but also full of adventure. Luckily for me, he said yes.\n\nPrior to his chat with Meyers, Buttigieg briefly alluded to his personal connection to O'Hare in December, while accepting the nomination to serve as transportation secretary under President Joe Biden.\n\nTouting his personal love of transportation, he said: Travel in my mind is synonymous with growth, with adventure, even love ― so much so that I proposed to my husband Chasten in an airport terminal.\n\nDon't let anybody tell you that O'Hare isn't romantic, he quipped.\n\nOfficials at O'Hare have taken notice of Buttigieg's rare affection for the world's sixth-busiest airport. In December, the airport thanked the transportation secretary on Twitter for appreciating all the connections we make possible, and pledged to work with him as we continue to make our airport lovable for decades to come.\n\nBoth O'Hare and United Airlines commemorated the site of the Buttigiegs' first meeting and subsequent engagement with heartwarming photos on social media.\n\nIt was B5. Proof that love actually is all around. 💙😊 https://t.co/9sIoUPjmKf pic.twitter.com/fVAcL9ch4r — United Airlines (@united) December 16, 2020\n\nMeanwhile, Pete and Chasten's love story will soon be making its way to the small screen. On Monday, Amazon Studios announced plans to release Mayor Pete, a documentary directed by Jesse Moss that will examine Buttigieg's 2020 campaign as the first openly gay presidential hopeful from a major party.\n\nAccording to Variety, Mayor Pete promises to go behind the scenes of Buttigieg's historic victory in the Iowa caucuses, and show him and Chasten at their Indiana home.
A woman who works for an aircraft company on the West Coast happened to be looking outside her window recently when she thought: Wouldn't it be funny to skywrite a giant message attacking Donald Trump?\n\nWhen that turned out to be too expensive, she ended up arranging two Florida sky banners instead. They became part of a mini-flurry of anti-Trump messages that hit the news after air restrictions were dropped over the former president's Mar-a-Lago golf resort, where he's now living.\n\nA banner saying Convict Trump and Lock Him Up flew over Mar-a-Lago on Friday, and GOP Grow a Spine and Expel Trump floated over the Daytona International Speedway during practice runs for Sunday's Daytona 500 race.\n\nThird attack banner trolls Donald Trump from the Florida skies. https://t.co/7FN3ed5lDq via @HuffPostPol — The Progressive (@1Progressivism) February 13, 2021\n\nCourtesy Aerial Messages In the air.\n\nClearly, they weren't exactly persuasive, and Republican senators on Saturday acquitted Trump of incitement of insurrection for the storming of the Capitol last month.\n\nIt was expected yet infuriating, the woman who wanted to be identified as S told HuffPost Sunday. Still, the banners were absolutely worth it, she added.\n\nS — whose identity was confirmed by the aerial company that flew the banners — asked HuffPost not to use her name because she doesn't want to be harassed by Trumpers.\n\nShe hadn't been politically active in the past, but 2020 really got me, and the pandemic took the cake, she said. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. When Trump started talking about a third term and then started a chant at a rally of '12 more years,′ I thought: 'That's it. That's a dictator.'\n\nShe added: My parents immigrated from Cuba in the 1960s. They know what a dictator looks like. Trump and his supporters are authoritarian, completely offensive; they stand for what's completely contradictory to this country's ideals.\n\nWhen S reached out to Daytona Beach-based Aerial Messages, CEO Remy Colin was really enthusiastic, she said. He suggested she lengthen her original message because the price covers 45 characters. So I added the lock him up part because of what Trump always said about Hillary Clinton, S said.\n\nWhile Colin confirmed S arranged the latest banners, two earlier messages over Mar-a-Lago — Trump You Pathetic Loser Go Back to Moscow and Trump Worst President Ever — were ordered by a guy, whom he declined to name.\n\nThe London Times reported Sunday that he's a physician who doesn't want his identity revealed because family members fear for their safety. Nevertheless, he told the Times: I want to show people that they can tell Donald Trump what they think of him — and that their emperor has no clothes.\n\nTrump is getting warm welcome from the skies near Mar-a-lago today pic.twitter.com/S6uUFx3t30 — Daniel Uhlfelder (@DWUhlfelderLaw) January 24, 2021\n\nColin said Aerial Messages is the only company currently flying political banners because of the heated atmosphere in the U.S. The company does repeat advertisements for major companies, and personal messages (including marriage proposals), but also touts on its webpage: Take your political message to the sky!\n\nHe emphasized that Aerial Messages is nonpartisan. The company flew several pro-Trump banners in Florida in the 2016 election paid for by Chinese and Russian entities, he noted. Flying banners usually cost $950 an hour, which includes two to four flyovers, depending on the distance from an airport.\n\nColin said he gets lots of calls and interest after a political banner appears in the news. People on Twitter have responded to tweets about the banners offering to happily chip into a GoFundMe site for more anti-Trump missives. Others pitched in to help cover the cost of S's GOP grow a spine message.\n\nColin also gets complaints.\n\nI listen to what they have to say, then I explain that we do banners from both sides. One guy was telling me how irresponsible it was to inflame political attitudes with the anti-Trump messages. I'm listening politely, but I'm thinking to myself, 'What the hell? Your side just stormed the Capitol.'
Joaquin Phoenix is having the last laugh — albeit a very maniacal one — at the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nThe actor picked up the best actor in a drama trophy for his harrowing performance in Joker at the 77th annual ceremony on Sunday in perhaps the most competitive category of the evening.\n\nPhoenix, who famously lost over 50 pounds to play the troubled Arthur Fleck/Joker, beat out Christian Bale, another actor known for his on-screen transformations; Antonio Banderas; Jonathan Pryce; and Adam Driver of Marriage Story in an awards season dominated by male-centered movies.\n\nPhoenix delivered an at times rambling, expletive-laden speech from the Golden Globes stage, first thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for making the evening's meal entirely plant-based before paying tribute to his fellow nominees.\n\nWe all know there's no fucking competition between us ... I'm inspired by you. I'm your fucking student. I can't believe the beautiful, mesmerizing and unique work you've all done this year, he said. I really do feel honored to be mentioned with you.\n\nGeorge Pimentel via Getty Images Joaquin Phoenix attends the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 05, 2020 in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nHe then went onto apologize to Joker director Todd Phillips for being such a pain in the ass.\n\nContrary to popular belief I don't want to rock the boat, but the boat is fucking rocked, he continued, pivoting his speech to address everyone in the room.\n\nI've not always been a virtuous man. I'm learning so much and so many of you in this room have given me opportunities to try to get it right and I'm deeply grateful. But I think together, hopefully, we can be unified and actually make some changes. It's great to vote, but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves, Phoenix continued, pointedly adding that his fellow actors don't need to be taking private jets to Palm Springs.\n\nThe film about the titular Batman supervillain went on to gross over $1 billion worldwide, becoming the first R-rated film in history to do so.\n\nBut the road to box office glory was paved with much controversy, as some vocal critics have labeled the film dangerous and irresponsible over its empathy toward an angry white man who essentially becomes a self-radicalized domestic terrorist.\n\nPhoenix, who took a method acting approach to his performance, has also raised some eyebrows with his behavior during production after a video of the actor cursing out a crew member for whispering in a scene made the rounds on the internet. He also reportedly clashed with co-star Robert De Niro during filming.\n\nThe famously press-averse actor hasn't been too keen on weighing in on the backlash, preferring to let the film speak for itself.\n\nI didn't imagine that it would be smooth sailing, Phoenix told Vanity Fair about the polarizing response to the film. It's a difficult film. In some ways, it's good that people are having a strong reaction to it.\n\nThere's so many different ways of looking at it, he continued. You can either say here's somebody who, like everybody, needed to be heard and understood and to have a voice. Or you can say this is somebody that disproportionately needs a large quantity of people to be fixated on him. His satisfaction comes as he stands in amongst the madness.\n\nThe late actor Heath Ledger posthumously won a Golden Globe for portraying the same character in 2008's The Dark Knight in the supporting actor category.\n\nPhoenix has previously been nominated for Globes five times over his career for films like Her and Gladiator, but has only taken home the award once before for his role in Walk the Line, which also scored him an Oscar nod.
USA, New Jersey, Jersey City, Portrait of young couple sitting on couch\n\nIf your relationship is good, you shouldn't have to work on it, right?\n\nFairy tales promote the effortless happily-ever-after marriage myth when we are at an impressionable age. Later we view romantic movies and read novels with happily-ever-after endings.\n\nConsequently, it's easy to develop unrealistic, fantasy-based expectations about marriage. Many of us spend more time maintain a car -- checking tire pressure, changing the oil, and getting the recommended inspections, and son on -- than we spend on keeping our most important relationship in good working order.\n\nObviously, we humans are more complicated than cars. We have infinitely complex bodies to maintain. We also have feeling, different ways of thinking, different hopes and dreams. And then, when you put the two of us together...\n\nBenefits of Weekly Meetings\n\nHolding a weekly marriage meeting takes a small investment of time each week and yields a great return: more intimacy, romance, and teamwork; and smoother resolution of the kinds of concerns likely to arise in any close relationship.\n\nSome people resist the idea of a formal meeting with their spouse. They think it sounds like work. Why not just talk about things as they come up? Talking on the fly sounds very nice, and that is fine if you are able to do this effectively.\n\nBut you might want to mention something when your partner is watching television, reading a book, or is otherwise occupied. You might be waiting for a right time that never comes. And if you do bring up a sensitive matter when it's the last thing your spouse is in the mood to discuss at the moment, you might feel like you have entered a minefield.\n\nSimilarly, your spouse may want to discuss a concern when you are busy. It is easy to take one's partner for granted, to forget to express appreciation. Chores can pile up or not be handled well. You may forget to plan dates and other enjoyable activities. By scheduling a time for a marriage meeting, you will get to reconnect every week.\n\nCommunicating with Intention\n\nA wife who attended one of my Marin County, California marriage meeting workshops, continued to hold weekly meetings with her husband. She reports: At first the process felt contrived, but after a few meetings we got used to the meeting's structure. I learned that it's much better to communicate with intention than to communicate without intention.\n\nWeekly meetings foster direct, positive communication that addresses concerns at a time when both of you are likely to be receptive. You get to feel appreciated and valued, gain a smoother-running household by coordinating chores, and add romance by planning dates. Issues are resolved and challenges are met before they escalate into crises and grudges. Romance can continue throughout your marriage, but this usually will not happen automatically.\n\nOne small example of a benefit: When I'm home sometimes I wear a kerchief on my head that makes me feel like I look like a less than attractive peasant from the old country. So I was happily surprised when during the Appreciation part of one of our weekly marriage meetings, my husband complimented me for looking cute wearing the kerchief. This gave me a warm feeling inside and an outward smile. We've been holding these meetings for twenty-seven years. I practice what I preach!\n\nInformation is power\n\nYou can learn just what you need to know how to hold effective marriage meetings before conducting one. Guidelines, a simple agenda, and positive communication skills are explained in detail and step by step in my book, Marriage Meetings for Lasting Love: 30 Minutes a Week to the Relationship You've Always Wanted. Included are way to address the concern of how to convince a partner who's reluctant to hold a marriage meeting to give it a try anyway.
Blake Shelton woke up on the shadier side of the bed on Thursday morning.\n\nThe country singer seemingly took a shot at ex-wife Miranda Lambert, who's been accused of beginning a relationship with her current boyfriend, Turnpike Troubadours frontman Evan Felker, while he was still married.\n\nBeen taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up, the Voice coach wrote on Twitter. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It's karma!!\n\nBeen taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It's karma!! — Blake Shelton (@blakeshelton) April 25, 2018\n\nShelton went on to retweet a fan's response to the tweet with a lyric from girlfriend Gwen Stefani's song This Is What The Truth Feels Like.\n\nShelton and Lambert, the country music world's former golden couple, announced their split in 2015 after four years of marriage and another six years together.\n\nWhile neither has commented on the reason for the divorce, rumors about Lambert's infidelity have long swirled thanks to Shelton's 2016 song She's Got a Way with Words, which takes aim at a cheating ex.\n\nWhen we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down, Shelton told Billboard about the inspiration behind his post-divorce album.

Multiple outlets confirmed earlier this month that the two were no longer a couple.\n\nIn January, she invited Felker's band to join her on her Livin' Like Hippies tour. At the time, the frontman was reportedly still married to wife Staci Nelson, who later filed for divorce in February, according to People. Reports claim that Lambert and Felker's romance began while they were both still in relationships.\n\nStaci found out that he had filed for divorce because a friend called her after seeing it in a local newspaper, a source told E! News. Staci wasn't even served with divorce papers so she filed her divorce papers a couple weeks after finding out that Evan filed. He never communicated that to her.\n\nThe Tin Man singer seemingly made mention of her recent relationship struggles in an ACM Awards speech earlier this month as she accepted the trophy for Female Vocalist of the Year.\n\nThank you guys so much for sharing my broken heart with me, she said onstage.\n\nJason Merritt/ACMA2018 via Getty Images Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani attend the 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards.\n\nShelton, meanwhile, has been dating Stefani for nearly three years after the fellow Voice judges bonded over mutual heartbreak. In 2015, the former No Doubt singer was also going through a divorce from her husband of nearly 13 years, Gavin Rossdale, who reportedly cheated on her with the family's nanny.\n\n″[I]t it was like being handed this gift of a friend who was going through the exact same thing at the exact same time, Stefani told Vanity Fair in 2016.\n\nGwen saved my life, Shelton later explained. Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can't even imagine the similarities in our divorces.
I wear my red kabbalah string. I wear a gold good luck piece around my neck.\n\nOf the two lucky items, my red kabbalah string is far more significant in its meaning. I do believe at times good luck knocks on our doors... a chance happening, a force, causes good things to appear.\n\nI believe, in 99% of instances, you and I must make our own good luck.\n\nNevertheless, I continue to wear my red string and my gold charm around my neck. My red kabbalah string is truly comforting; guards and protects me (in my mind) and reminds me to always 'be aware' of the force of luck lurking around my corner. It makes me listen to my inner feelings.\n\nMy gold charm is lovely to look at with its many lucky charms embedded into its circular disc. A four leaf clover, an elephant, a horseshoe, an evil eye, the Arabic good luck sign, a heart and a number 13. I don't feel strongly about it but I figure, every bit of luck helps. I am very attached to a tiny gold Chai (meaning long life in Hebrew) hanging on the same connecter, a gift from my brother, Scott, brought back from Jerusalem. My good luck pieces feed my spirit. They do not bring me luck.\n\nPeople, circumstances my attitude and my brain bring me luck. And dear readers, people and circumstances and your attitude and brains do the same for you.\n\nAt this passage in our lives, we have to keep our eyes, ears and minds open to the suggestions and advice of others for some will shed information that will impact our lives and bring us good fortune. That is, if we listen and act. The source does not have to be a person we know well or a person at all. It can be an article we read or a speaker we hear or even a visual we see.\n\nOne of my close friends, Tova, said to me a few weeks ago, It is not what you know, it is who you know. She was referring to medical situations. Who you know, not what you know, dear readers, may save your life and bring you luck, a long life. Use your brains.\n\nWe are informed by doctors we should have a yearly mammogram, a once a year body skin check with our dermatologist, a yearly physical and a routine chest x-ray. You initiate your own luck by being proactive. Your life is in your hands. Use your brains.\n\nListening to others and being proactive has saved my life more than a few times. Did I look at my red string, the charm around my neck and ask God to bless me. I sure did. But it was my brains that thrust me into my luck, not my good luck pieces.\n\nOn the issue of dating for those of you widowed or divorced or never married... you are your own good luck charm. Don't turn down a date. You may meet someone other than your blah date that evening. Keep yourself fit, informed and spirited and most importantly...be a good picker. Don't rush. It is the most important decision you will make in your life. Use your brains.\n\nA wonderful land or cruise vacation is not guaranteed by luck. You have to do your research. I suggest not using some travel agent behind a computer who has probably traveled less than you. Ask traveled friends for the name of their travel agent. If you enjoy the same type of travel ask friends or acquaintances, you respect, for restaurant and hotel suggestions. My southern friend, Norma Jean, taught me how to persuade the clerk, in every hotel, how to get 'a room with a view.' We are never too old to ask and never too old to learn, dear readers. Just use your brains.\n\nWe all love our good luck pieces, as we should. But we must be frank with ourselves: We cannot wait for good things to happen to us. I do believe, as stated above, we make our own good luck.\n\nI am quite certain you have looked at another person and said to yourself, She is so lucky. Well maybe she is but so can you be lucky because I think we all get a chance to get lucky in life.\n\nMy tips:\n\n1. Feel more than you think. Listen to your inner voice, your intuition.\n\n2. Venture out. Meet and greet. Who knows who you may meet?\n\n3. Focus. Work on friendships, happy marriage, and close relationships with children.\n\n4. Try. Try things. Let your energy flow. Be open to possibilities.\n\n5. Trust. Trust people. Listen and learn and then act.\n\n6. Belief. Believe in yourself. Your inner strength, your resiliency.\n\n7. Curiosity. Be curious about everything. Be an explorer.\n\n8. Proactive. Stay healthy by being proactive.\n\n9. Optimism. Optimistic people create a lot of good luck. People who feel they are lucky actually are lucky. Shoot for the moon.\n\n10. Gratitude. Last but not least a lucky woman is a grateful woman. Our life is not a rite, it is a gift.\n\nDear readers of mine, we will all continue to wear or carry are good luck objects. They are our comfort, like crossing our fingers when we need luck or praying please dear God let all be well in our family. We all want a little bloomin' luck.' So wear your good luck pieces but when glancing at them, think about your lifestyle and how 'you' can add another dimension of luck to your life.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) dropped out of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race on Thursday and offered her full support to former Vice President Joe Biden in his bid for the White House.\n\nGabbard's announcement comes as the coronavirus pandemic drastically changes the presidential race and other 2020 campaigns. The leading Democratic candidates — Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — have been forced to suspend typical campaign fixtures such as rallies and door-to-door campaigning as cases of the disease have been reported in all 50 states.\n\nBut Gabbard lagged behind much of the crowded 2020 field in polling over the past year, failing to win even 1% of the vote in Iowa or New Hampshire, the first two states to hold primaries.\n\nShe had a meager showing on Super Tuesday, the most important day of the Democratic primary race. Her most successful contest was in American Samoa, an unincorporated U.S. territory where she was born.\n\nWith roughly 29% of the support, she finished a distant second in the territory's caucuses, behind former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who garnered about 50%. Bloomberg ended his presidential bid a day later.\n\nGabbard exited the race having only won two delegates.\n\nAs the first female combat veteran ever to run for president and the first American Samoan member of Congress, she was neither a traditional Democrat nor a traditional candidate.\n\nThe Hawaii representative was the only member of the House to vote present on the two articles of impeachment during the December vote to impeach President Donald Trump. She later explained that she could not in good conscience vote either yes or no on the two articles.\n\nIn the days after the historic vote, former Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie urged Gabbard to resign her congressional seat. Abercrombie, a Democrat who served nine terms in the House from 1993 to 2010, expressed concerns that Gabbard had been unable to juggle her responsibilities as a member of Congress and her presidential campaigning.\n\nAbercrombie pointed to Gabbard's present votes and frequent absences from the Hill as examples of this imbalance.\n\nGabbard also clashed with Hillary Clinton shortly before a Democratic primary debate in November. The former secretary of state suggested the congresswoman was being groomed by Russia. In response, Gabbard filed a defamation lawsuit against Clinton, alleging the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee lied about Gabbard with obvious malicious intent to hurt her 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nDuring the November debate, Democrats piled on Gabbard over her support for nationalist and authoritarian foreign leaders, including Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, as well as her close ties to Fox News, Trump's favored news network.\n\nMichael Wyke/Associated Press Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) answers questions at a She the People presidential forum at Texas State University in April.\n\nGabbard did two tours of duty in the Middle East and is currently a major in the National Guard. She went on to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee for over six years. Gabbard was also the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee until 2016, when she resigned in order to endorse Sanders' presidential campaign.\n\nShe said she endorsed Sanders at the time because he supported ending unnecessary wars.\n\nThere is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, Gabbard said on CNN when she announced her run for office in January.\n\nIn 2018, Gabbard introduced the No More Presidential Wars act, a resolution that would require the president to seek authorization from Congress in order to engage the military against any enemy. She also introduced a resolution that would make a presidential war an impeachable offense.\n\nThe last time Congress officially declared war was Dec. 8, 1941, the day that the United States entered World War II, she said at a news conference. Ever since, Congress has failed to uphold this constitutional responsibility and has ceded this power to the president ― presidents of both parties.\n\nGabbard, who has spoken out against interventionist wars in the past, was heavily criticized for a 2017 meeting with Assad on what her office called a fact-finding mission. She said had not initially planned to speak with Assad but when the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so, because of the possibility of achieving peace, Gabbard told CNN's Jake Tapper in 2017.\n\nAssad was accused by the United States and its allies of using chemical weapons to attack civilians during Syria's civil war. Gabbard, however, said she didn't think there was enough evidence to hold Assad responsible then and still doesn't now.\n\nI think that the evidence needs to be gathered, and, as I have said before, if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he should be prosecuted as such, Gabbard said at a CNN town hall in March.\n\nShe also came under fire for her former anti-LGBTQ views. Gabbard worked with her father at The Alliance for Traditional Marriage, a political action committee aimed at opposing lawmakers and legislation that promoted gay rights.\n\nHowever, Gabbard reversed her public position on LGBTQ rights.\n\nShe said she regretted the views she previously held and noted her recent support of LGBTQ legislation. I'm grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey, she said in January.\n\nGabbard took a progressive stance on most other issues.\n\nShe supported transitioning to 100% renewable energy. She wanted to get rid of tuition and fees at four-year public universities, and she supported free community college for everyone. She also advocated for raising the federal minimum wage to $15.\n\nThere are a lot of challenges that are facing the American people that I'm concerned about and that I want to help solve, she told CNN.\n\nDominique Mosbergen, Hayley Miller and Liza Hearon contributed reporting.
The world is consumed with problems, James Corden lamented on The Late Late Show Monday night.\n\nI haven't felt good about anything since 2013, Corden said. Barack Obama was the president. Same-sex marriage was legalized. Justin Bieber bought a monkey. I mean the list is endless.\n\nCorden's band leader, Reggie Watts, responded: 2013 was pretty cool. It's just a shame that the Jonas Brothers split up.\n\nSuddenly, Corden had a mission: We've got to get them back together! It's the only way to fix all of this.\n\nWith that, Corden and Watts were off on a caper involving kidnapping and an encounter with Dr. Phil.\n\nCheck out the video below to see what Corden did when he came face to face with Nick ... Kevin ... this guy.
Valentine's Day - also known as Saint Valentine's Day - began as a liturgical celebration. It has since morphed into an almost worldwide celebration of love. What should divorcees do to increase their chances of finding love again? As a mediator, who deals primarily with divorce and family conflict, I have a few suggestions on how to find love after divorce.\n\n1. Forgive yourself (and your ex)\n\nMany of my clients harbor an enormous amount of guilt for their failed marriage. Let go of guilt. William Pinsof (president of the Family Institute at Northwestern University) reported in The Death of Till Death Do Us Part: The Transformation of Pair-Bonding in the 20th Century, that, for the first time in the human history, divorce has replaced death as the most common endpoint of marriage. This unprecedented shift in patterns of human coupling and uncoupling requires a new paradigm, that is, a more humane approach for social policy, family law and marital therapy. (Remember Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin consciously uncoupling). By seeking a more humane approach to navigating your divorce and post-divorce life, it's easier to forgive yourself and your ex.\n\n2. Love yourself (and your ex)\n\nStrive for Agape, the unconditional love despite flaws and demonstrated by your behavior towards another person. Love yourself and your ex for what you once had - the good and the bad. When conflict arises, take the high road. If you divorce with dignity, it's much easier to love yourself throughout the process.\n\n3. Embrace yourself\n\nEmbrace the opportunity to reinvent yourself and your love life. I encourage my clients to leave their history in the past where it belongs. It best to use the past to help craft a better future. Be present and choose behaviors today that will positively impact your tomorrows. Separate the person from the problem. Recognize that we are all innately good and prone to make bad choices. Recognize and capitalize on the good choices you make while realizing and mitigating the bad choices you make.\n\n4. Refresh yourself
When my wife and I got married I knew there would be some things I would be giving up. Most men worry about never sleeping with another woman again or not having the freedom to go out with the guys. I'll grant you that the first absolutely applies. The second? Not necessarily.\n\nIn a truly amazing marriage the most challenging things for guys to give up have nothing to do with surface stuff. You may even get to do more guy type things. In fact I've done jumping over fire and swimming through mud that was five feet deep...with my wife right by my side.\n\nBut here are three things I sacrificed for an amazing marriage. If you're a man you'll likely want to do the same.\n\n1. Pride\n\nEven though I grew up in a broken home my parents gave me one very important characteristic. They repeatedly told me I could accomplish anything I put my mind to. I loved it and reveled in how much they believed in me.\n\nBut there was a downside. I came to a point where I was sure I knew more than anyone else. In my mind no one was as intelligent as me and I was not terribly shy about sharing my knowledge. When my future wife and I were dating this side of my personality showed up. Repeatedly. But she knew exactly how to handle it. She simply broke up with me. SEVEN TIMES! Every time I got out of line she dropped me. It was some pretty hard core training, but I eventually learned.\n\nIf you are going to have an amazing marriage then you'll need to let go of your male pride.\n\n2. Selfishness\n\nFor a period of time I was an Astronomy professor at a university and also took students on field trips to check out regional geological phenomena. As a professor I was respected and people generally followed my lead. I soon became accustomed to having whatever I wanted and however I wanted it. In short I pretty much always got my way. This is what men like.\n\nOnce when preparing to leave for yet another field trip my wife came to me in tears. Our time together had been dwindling and her heart was breaking. She asked me not to leave. I so very much wanted to go on this particular trip. But I didn't fight or argue. Given the option of seeing and studying beautiful rock formations vs loving and caring for my beautiful wife I chose the latter.\n\nLiving in an amazing marriage means giving up the male desire to always have my own way.\n\n\n\n3. Control\n\nJust before our 10th wedding anniversary we were in desperate need to find a new place to live. The house we rented was being donated to a local non-profit and part of the deal was we must vacate the premises. We spent a significant amount of time searching for a new place in the local area.\n\nEventually we came across what appeared to be a perfect home. Closer to my work, fair rental price and owned by a sweet Christian woman. The day came to sign the lease. I was a man on a mission headed to seal the deal. But out of the blue my wife called and told me this just doesn't feel right.\n\nRemember we had to get out of our current home soon and we had searched and searched until we found just the right place. My male need to be in control wanted to just brush her off for having unnecessary anxiety. But we are people of faith and I trusted her intuition in spiritual matters. So I called off the deal. She was right. Not long after I received an offer for a better paying job that required moving out of that area. Had I not listened to her we would have been locked into a 12 month lease.\n\nTo have an amazing marriage sometimes you need to give up your manly need to be in control and trust your wife.\n\n\n\nYou may think from these stories that I'm a pushover and never have anything I desire. My friend, nothing could be further from the truth. I live in a home filled with joy and have a wife who always looks forward to spending time together. She loves me dearly and does whatever she can to give me the things I want.\n\nI didn't really sacrifice anything to have an amazing marriage. Everything I let go has been repaid back many times over the years in terms of peace, harmony and love. What did I give up? Strife, anger, pain and suffering. What did I gain? A marriage beyond anything I could have ever imagined.\n\nThis post first appeared on The Good Men Project.
level17 via Getty Images\n\nOffice romances may be an HR nightmare, but they happen nonetheless.\n\nIn a 2017 CareerBuilder survey, 41 percent of workers 'fessed up to dating a co-worker, and 30 percent of those relationships led to marriage. Regardless of how common it is, asking your work crush out on a date requires a lot of tact, especially with all the workplace sexual harassment scandals that have unfolded over the last year.\n\nHow do you go about it without being a creep? Below, human resources and dating experts share six things to keep in mind before asking someone out at work.\n\n1. Check what HR policies are in place.\n\nYour workplace is just that: a workplace, not a bar or a dating app for download. None of the HR experts we spoke to encouraged actively looking for love at the office, but they acknowledged it happens. And while it's less common for businesses to enforce or even have a non-fraternization policy, it's still important to determine if your company has one, said Teresa Marzolph, founder of Culture Engineered, a human capital consulting firm in Phoenix.\n\nThe few policies still in existence often focus on relationships that put the company as risk, such as a romantic relationship between a manager and their employee, or one that runs contrary to the checks and balances that exist within the company ― like quality assurance and customer service or finance and sales, Marzolph told HuffPost.\n\nIf no guidelines exist, Marzolph recommends gauging the workplace culture around you: Have you heard of other office relationships developing in the past? Does the company encourage after-hours camaraderie among the staff?\n\nA company that sponsors or hosts non-work events and activities may be an example of a culture that's much more tolerant or even supportive of relationships in the workplace, Marzolph said.\n\n2. Be friends first.\n\nAvoid going from zero to 100 by establishing a friendship first, said Lynn Taylor, a workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior & Thrive in Your Job. This way, you'll find out early on whether you have anything in common besides mutual disgust of your boss' Tupperware lunches.\n\nEstablish a foundation and find out if you're compatible, personality-wise, Taylor said. Then, take cues. Gauge your next actions off the responses you generally receive from the person.\n\n3. Suggest getting coffee.\n\nTake some of the stress out of the situation by suggesting a casual location for your date, said Neely Steinberg, a dating coach and image consultant.\n\nCoffee is usually a good suggestion because it's low key and really, who doesn't like coffee? Steinberg said. Plus, it may be perceived as a friend thing as opposed to an actual 'date.' If you're not getting a good romantic vibe, you can always just chalk it up to a friendly co-worker coffee.\n\n4. When you do ask, don't make it weird.\n\nIn the 12 years Marzolph has worked in human resources, sexual harassment complaints have almost always been about how someone went about asking, not the fact that they had asked.\n\nThe common theme is that the interaction left one person feeling uncomfortable, she told us. Whether intended or not, most filing a claim or complaint describe the pursuing employee's approach as awkward or inappropriate.\n\nTo avoid becoming an office-wide pariah, be mindful of your surroundings and your body language when floating the idea of a date, Marzolph said.\n\nDon't come on too strong or corner the person, and ideally, approach them outside of work or in the communal area, Marzolph said. Try to keep your approach light; be ready to give the person an easy out if they're not interested, so you both can continue working together without tension.\n\n5. If they say 'no,' maintain professionalism throughout the experience.\n\nDon't take it personally if your crush is just not that into you, Taylor said.\n\nIf the person declines, remember that this is a risky proposition, she explained. Your co-worker might have otherwise said 'yes' if you hadn't met at work. Many are averse to dating co-workers as a personal policy.\n\n6. If they say 'yes,' still maintain professionalism throughout the experience.\n\nFrom the beginning, recognize that this is an imperfect dating situation. Asking a colleague out isn't simply about two people getting together ― it almost always complicates the workplace dynamic, said S. Chris Edmonds, a human resources expert and founder of The Purposeful Culture Group.\n\nLuckily, some work relationships work out great, Edmonds said. I met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. You just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. PDA or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.\n\nWhatever happens, Edmonds recommends keeping your personal policy on interoffice romances as simple as possible.
Some audience members at this year's annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington likely did a double take when President Donald Trump hailed people of faith for their abolition of civil rights.\n\nSince the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith, Trump declared in his speech Thursday.\n\nTrump credited people of faith with the 'abolition of civil rights'??? pic.twitter.com/lo7eKcUus8 — NowThis (@nowthisnews) February 8, 2019\n\nThat's probably not exactly how the president intended to put it.\n\nNo matter, because some gleeful Twitter users enjoyed another opportunity to chortle at an apparent Trump gaffe. Amid the religious right's efforts to limit such rights as abortion access and same-sex marriage, others concluded that the president may have seen the light.\n\nHe would be correct. They are leading the abolition of civil rights today. https://t.co/LmqOmEB5XJ — Rep. Poncho Nevárez (@poncho_nevarez) February 7, 2019\n\nSo now he decides to be honest.

ShotShare via Getty Images I'm not the same person I was before I took my job at the grocery store.\n\nWhen I spent $100,000 earning two degrees, I never imagined I'd end up working as a cashier at my local grocery store but I needed the job.\n\nA year earlier, I'd left my corporate marketing job. While working there, it seemed as if I was working to pay for child care and little else. I also struggled to be there for my kids' sick days and school events. But my year off had nearly broken our family financially, and I needed to return to work.\n\nI needed to find a job that I could do at night once my husband came home. That way we'd eliminate our child care costs entirely and I would still bring in some extra money to help ease our other financial burdens. That's what I was offered by a grocery store located in the affluent town we could barely afford to live in.\n\nThe store hired me the same day I applied, and a week later, I began working as a night cashier. Simple, I thought as the training supervisor showed me how to greet customers, find produce codes and ring items.\n\nBut it wasn't.\n\nTwo weeks after I started, the shift supervisor came over.\n\nHey, your ring times are a little bit low but we're going to get them up, he said, pausing before adding, But you're great with the customers.\n\nHe was trying to be kind, but I was mortified. The idea of being corrected by a 19-year-old kid I was old enough to have mothered stung. I managed to convince myself that ring times didn't matter and then I cried the whole drive home.\n\nNicole? I heard a customer say at the beginning of my next shift. The tan woman placed her groceries on the black belt, a mix of party goods ― drinks, paper plates and snack foods.\n\nI didn't know you worked here, she continued.\n\nShe did know because I'd mentioned it the last time I dropped my son off at school. Maybe she'd forgotten.\n\nWhat a great way to get out of the house and away from the kids for a bit, she said.\n\nI remember that day I'd pushed a couple of coupons I intended to use under a bag of rice, hiding them, when I saw this woman approach. I hated that I had moved to the other side of the register and was now serving her.\n\nMonths before, we'd greeted each other in the checkout line as we discussed a school fundraiser she was organizing. She didn't need to work. Her family appeared to live well as a single-income family. I remember that day I'd pushed a couple of coupons I intended to use under a bag of rice, hiding them, when I saw this woman approach. I hated that I had moved to the other side of the register and was now serving her.\n\nI stopped listening to what she was saying and instead focused on ringing up her purchases, while I listened for the beeps. I didn't want to double-scan any items or go too slowly. I could be friendly or I could be conscientious ― I wasn't capable of both. This, I realized, was the reason for my slow ring times, so I'd have to give the customer less of me and give the scanner more. I couldn't believe how awful I was at this.\n\nWell, she said, I guess I'll see you at drop-off.\n\nI waved without explaining that this job was not a way to escape my kids, but a necessity. It allowed me to work nights and make money I desperately needed to pay bills. Like many of the affluent customers we served, I don't think she could understand.\n\nAs the next few weeks went by, I did my best to bring up my ring times and even tried to memorize some of the produce codes. My co-workers helped, including the young supervisor. But I still found myself hiding when mothers I knew walked by. While I couldn't shut my light off and pretend my lane was closed, I did other things.\n\nCan I run to the ladies' room? I'd ask the supervisor on duty. I tried to flag down another shopper so they'd get into my line before the lawyer mother I knew who had just returned from a weekend of skiing did. I didn't want to ring up her organic dragon fruit or imported cheese.\n\nIf all else failed, I'd offer to wipe down the registers or handle returning items to the shelves, which, of course, was also risky. There was always the possibility of running into someone I knew in the aisles. Then I would be forced to listen as they droned on about their latest vacation, or worse, asked me where something was. I'd have to admit I often didn't know because I worked at the front of the store instead of in the center.\n\nI'm a writer, I told a random man one day, though he never asked. He was purchasing an expensive bottle of liquor. Please don't put the bread on the bottom of the bag, he said and returned to his phone call. He never looked at me, not once, throughout the entire transaction.\n\nI was capable of more than ringing and bagging his groceries, I wanted to shout, hopefully jarring him from a call too important to allow him to acknowledge a fellow human being ― me. Instead, I looked at my growing line and thought of my ring times. I'd just have to make the next customer understand: I was not just a cashier. This was not a real job for me. I pushed the button to move their items down the belt and allowed myself to get lost in the hum of the store.\n\nCourtesy of Nicole Johnson The name tag Nicole Johnson wore while working at a grocery store.\n\nI worked mostly nights and Sundays. Sundays were the worst because they were the hardest days to hide. It seemed like every family I knew shopped after church or their kid's sporting events. And it was on a Sunday that I broke down.\n\nIt was not a grand display of wailing and moaning. Instead, I cried silently as I pushed the metal carts. I slid one into another, creating a chain that I jammed into the nearest corral while weaving in between customers and cars. It was Mother's Day and I'd forgotten to put in for the day off. People rushed past me in their cars, the rain lifting off the pavement and soaking the Day-Glo vest I was forced to wear whenever I did cart duty. How the hell did I wind up here, I asked myself as I wiped at the tears I tried to pass off as rain on my face.\n\nAs I stood in the parking lot, soaking wet, I was finally able to admit what I'd tried so hard to hide ― both from others and myself: I was embarrassed by my job. A job that was supposed to be a bump in the road for me. I was 40 years old and had a family at home. After spending thousands of dollars earning my degrees, I never imagined I'd end up pushing carts in the pouring rain. I shopped at this store ― I wasn't supposed to work here! I took my vest off and headed inside.\n\nYou OK? one of my co-workers asked. She had worked her entire career in the store and could tell that I wasn't remotely OK. Don't let the customers get to you, she said, placing an arm around my shoulder and leading me toward the break room. There's free pizza and salad today. You look like you could use some.\n\nThese were the people that I worked with. They brought me bags of their leftover school supplies for my kids. They offered me advice on marriage and parenting. They shared my love of horror movies. And it killed me to realize that the whole time, while I tried to profess my merits to customers who judged me, I had judged my co-workers.\n\nYou, boy ― bag my groceries like this, the woman said to the bagger I was working with at my register. Hasn't anybody taught you anything? she asked while sighing loudly to the surrounding customers.\n\nI was appalled. I wanted to tell her that the particular man she was belittling had escaped a war-torn nation to come here for new opportunities. She was looking down on him and it wasn't right.\n\nSo many of our customers did this without knowing whom they were talking to. And as I handed her the receipt without meeting her eyes, it hurt me to know that I was once one of them. No, I never belittled them or acted rudely, but I did think I was better than them. Maybe it was the education or the house in the affluent town, the one I could barely afford.\n\nThese people offered their service every single day to so many people who judged them unfairly, who judged them based on their titles of cashier and bagger without seeing who they were ― working single mothers, kind-hearted retirees, teenagers saving for college, middle-aged college grads down on their luck. The people who served us our food, rang up our groceries and made it possible for us to do what we needed to every single day aren't so different from us. They were more similar than I ever knew. I was just too wrapped up in myself and my own privilege to ever realize it ― until I became one of them.\n\nAs I stood in the parking lot, soaking wet, I was finally able to admit what I'd tried so hard to hide ― both from others and myself: I was embarrassed by my job.\n\nI remained employed at the store for three years and only left because I eventually took a job in a local school working in special education. Recently, I popped in to pick up some groceries and saw an old manager.\n\nI miss working with you, she said as she organized a display. I miss you too, I told her. And I meant it.\n\nI'm not the same person I was before I took my job at the grocery store. I now know what it's like to be on both sides of the register and I understand how hard that job ― and facing all of the judgments and misconceptions that come with it ― truly is, and it changed me. And I hope that no matter where I'm working or what I'm doing, I'll remember what I've learned from that experience and all of the incredible people who shared so many of their days and nights and stories with me so I can continue growing and approaching and understanding the world in new ways.\n\nNicole Johnson is a freelance writer whose work has been featured on The Washington Post, Redbook, Parents, Ms., Scary Mommy, Your Teen For Parents, Yahoo, MSN and Vox Curbed.

Netflix adds a few dozen movies to the service throughout March, including more than a dozen on March 1.\n\nFilms joining on the first of the month include Crazy, Stupid, Love, Dances with Wolves, I Am Legend, Training Day and the first two Christopher Nolan Batman movies: Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.\n\nA few notable Netflix films debut throughout the month, including the documentary Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell and the prank comedy Bad Trip. Bad Trip stars Eric Andre, Tiffany Haddish and Lil Rel Howery, and was supposed to come out right as the pandemic started last year but got postponed from a theatrical run indefinitely. Netflix ultimately bought the rights, and now you get to see it.\n\nThe streaming service also has a couple of Netflix Original shows of note, with the docuseries Last Chance U: Basketball and the Michelle Obama-starring food show Waffles + Mochi.\n\nFor the second month in a row, Netflix doesn't have any scripted shows I'm really looking forward to watching. The yearslong stretch when Netflix provided an abundance of good new choices each week seems to have ended.\n\nWarner Bros./The Dark Knight The Dark Knight joins Netflix.\n\nNetflix also loses over 40 movies this month, including Spring Breakers, Silver Linings Playbook, Inception and Taxi Driver.\n\nCheck out the full list of arriving and departing movies and shows below.\n\nAnd if you want to stay informed of everything joining Netflix on a weekly basis, subscribe to the Streamline newsletter.\n\nHuffPost\n\nArrivals\n\nMarch 1\n\nBatman Begins (2005)\n\nBiggie: I Got a Story to Tell (Netflix Documentary)\n\nBlanche Gardin: Bonne Nuit Blanche (2021)\n\nCrazy, Stupid, Love (2011)\n\nDances with Wolves (1990)\n\nDC Super Hero Girls (Season 1)\n\nI Am Legend (2007)\n\nInvictus(2009)\n\nJason X (2001)\n\nKilling Gunther (2017)\n\nLEGO Marvel Spider-Man: Vexed by Venom (2019)\n\nNights in Rodanthe (2008)\n\nPower Rangers Beast Morphers (Season 2)\n\nRain Man (1988)\n\nStep Up: Revolution (2012)\n\nTenacious D in The Pick of Destiny (2006)\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nThe Pursuit of Happyness (2006)\n\nTraining Day (2001)\n\nTwo Weeks Notice (2002)\n\nYear One (2009)\n\nMarch 2\n\nBlack or White (2014)\n\nWord Party (Season 5, Netflix Family)\n\nMarch 3\n\nMoxie (Netflix Film)\n\nMurder Among the Mormons (Netflix Documentary)\n\nParker (2013)\n\nSafe Haven (2013)\n\nMarch 4\n\nPacific Rim: The Black (Netflix Anime)\n\nMarch 5\n\nCity of Ghosts (Netflix Family)\n\nDogwashers (Netflix Film)\n\nNevenka: Breaking the Silence (Netflix Documentary)\n\nPokémon Journeys: The Series (Part 4, Netflix Family)\n\nSentinelle (Netflix Film)\n\nMarch 8\n\nBombay Begums (Netflix Original)\n\nBombay Rose (Netflix Film)\n\nMarch 9\n\nThe Houseboat (Netflix Original)\n\nStarBeam (Season 3, Netflix Family)\n\nMarch 10\n\nDealer (Netflix Original)\n\nLast Chance U: Basketball (Netflix Documentary)\n\nMarriage or Mortgage (Netflix Original)\n\nMarch 11\n\nThe Block Island Sound (2020)\n\nCoven of Sisters (Netflix Film)\n\nMarch 12\n\nLove Alarm (Season 2, Netflix Original)\n\nThe One (Netflix Original)\n\nPaper Lives (Netflix Film)\n\nParadise PD (Part 3, Netflix Original)\n\nYES DAY (Netflix Film)\n\nMarch 14\n\nAudrey (2020)\n\nMarch 15\n\nBakugan: Armored Alliance\n\nThe BFG (2016)\n\nThe Last Blockbuster (2020)\n\nThe Lost Pirate Kingdom (Netflix Original)\n\nZero Chill (Netflix Family)\n\nMarch 16\n\nRebellComedy: Straight Outta the Zoo (Netflix Comedy Special)\n\nSavages (2012)\n\nWaffles + Mochi (Netflix Family)\n\nMarch 17\n\nOperation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal (Netflix Documentary)\n\nUnder Suspicion: Uncovering the Wesphael Case (Netflix Original)\n\nMarch 18\n\nB: The Beginning Succession (Netflix Anime)\n\nCabras da Peste (Netflix Film)\n\nDeadly Illusions (2021)\n\nThe Fluffy Movie (2014)\n\nNate Bargatze: The Greatest Average American (Netflix Comedy Special)\n\nSkylines (2020)\n\nMarch 19\n\nAlien TV (Season 2, Netflix Family)\n\nCountry Comfort (Netflix Family)\n\nFormula 1: Drive to Survive (Season 3, Netflix Original)\n\nSky Rojo (Netflix Original)\n\nMarch 20\n\nJiu Jitsu (2020)\n\nMarch 22\n\nNavillera (Netflix Original)\n\nPhilomena (2013)\n\nMarch 23\n\nLoyiso Gola: Unlearning (Netflix Comedy Special)\n\nMarch 24\n\nSeaspiracy (Netflix Documentary)\n\nWho Killed Sara?

Six months after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon (AMZN) is working on reorganizing Whole Foods shelves by first adding Amazon private label products and, soon, it may add popular consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola. Behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, Yahoo Finance has learned.\n\nWhen asked if Whole Foods will add consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola, Whole Foods spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said, As you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don't meet those quality standards. If there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there's always that consideration. Amazon declined to comment.\n\nIn June, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called the marriage with Amazon, love at first sight. And the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; Amazon Echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on Whole Foods products for Prime members.\n\nBut the honeymoon may be over as Amazon and Whole Foods butt heads over what to stock store shelves with. Would adding Coke sacrifice the healthy, organic image Whole Foods has long held dear?\n\nLucy Nicholson / Reuters Boxes of Coca-Cola are seen at a grocery store in Los Angeles, California on November 21, 2017. (REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson)\n\nAdding Coke would signal greater changes\n\nWhole Foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats, according to its website. That rules out Coca-Cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version.\n\nAmazon's plan to change Whole Foods' shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant's initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon. After Amazon's takeover, Whole Foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending Sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier — the biggest in two years.\n\nWhile Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart's 25% and Kroger's 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June.\n\nThen Amazon came. As a consumer-centric company, Amazon is leveraging Whole Foods to satisfy customer needs. That has become more urgent after Amazon provides free delivery of Whole Foods groceries for Prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo snacks.\n\nWhole Foods has proved a specialty retailer focusing only on organic food can't scale and be profitable, says Brittain Ladd, a retail and supply chain consultant. Amazon doesn't want to maintain the status quo. They can't see people go elsewhere simply because these highly-popular products are not available in Whole Foods.\n\nLindsey Wasson / Reuters Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos laughs as he talks to the media while touring the new Amazon Spheres during the grand opening at Amazon's Seattle headquarters in Seattle, Washington on January 29, 2018. (REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson)\n\nWhole Foods resistance\n\nAmazon could add private label products as soon as March, but the plan of bringing in consumer-packaged goods still faces obstacles from Whole Foods, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nIf that does ever happen, it will upset a lot of team members and customers, a longtime Whole Foods store employee in Austin told Yahoo Finance. That's what makes Whole Foods Market different from our competitors.\n\nBut food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the Whole Foods. Last year, Bloomberg reported PepsiCo's Frito-Lay developed organic Doritos marketed under the name Simply, which meet all the criteria needed to be sold in Whole Foods. Industry experts said Whole Foods will eventually benefit from larger store selections, since many packaged goods have higher margins and a strong customer base.\n\nIt's painful, but Whole Foods needs to be put out of the comfort zone, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail told Yahoo Finance. There are retailers that can provide high-quality organic food while offer packaged goods, and Amazon is helping Whole Foods in that direction.\n\nDo you think Whole Foods should carry more consumer packaged goods?

So, you're 23 and rocking it.\n\nOr you've just had your 26th birthday, and feeling adulthood hit you hard.\n\nYou're excited about getting married soon.\n\nOr you're single and loving life... or single and wishing you had a husband.\n\nI have been through all of it, and I'm currently just a little bit past it, but not too far ahead. The 20s are a very formative decade, and come with so many changes it's hard to keep your head on straight sometimes. After I got married at age 26, I began to settle in and adjust to my new life, and realized there were a lot of things no one ever told me about this specific time. While it is different for everyone, just between us girls, here are several things I wish someone would have told me about that would have been extremely helpful in navigating this season:\n\nThe false positive pregnancy tests:\n\nThis was one of the most emotionally exhausting experiences of my life. While I was aware that home pregnancy tests always need to be confirmed by a doctor, I really didn't realize that false positives were very much of a possibility. The instructions even say that false negatives are more likely than false positives, and that both are extremely rare. The over 99 percent accuracy that is advertised on all HPTs leads one believe that they are trustworthy. Imagine the toll on my emotions when, after taking a test one day, I peeled back the shower curtain to discover a little blue plus sign. Shock, excitement, fear, anxiety, and general head-spinning were in order. I stared at the test for a good five minutes before bringing it outside, taking a few pictures in different lighting to make sure it wasn't all in my head, all in between a pounding heartbeat and clasping my hand over my mouth and wondering how in the world I was going to tell my husband. Would he be worried since this was before we had decided to get pregnant? How would we pay for all of this? How would I continue working during the dreaded vomiting of the first trimester? I immediately ran out to the store and picked up different brands of tests to confirm. I waited until the next morning to test again, only to be greeted by only one pink line, not two. The test was negative. How can I possibly explain the confusion that washed over me after a night of extreme emotional ups and downs? I could barely concentrate at work, and ended up asking my boss if I could leave early to go to the doctor. Was I pregnant or not? Needless to say, I really wish someone would have told me about false positives, and how they are apparently more common than we are all lead to believe. This entire experience caused a very unnecessary roller coaster of emotions that, when paired with an already hormonal time of the month, absolutely wore me out.\n\nThe changing cycle:\n\nThe above leads me to the reason for the pregnancy test in the first place. I really had no idea how much my cycle would change after getting married. It was very difficult to adapt. I'm sure it has to do partly with getting older and into my upper twenties, but I know marriage plays a role as well. My cycles had been like clockwork since the very beginning. From age 12, I always knew exactly when to expect their arrival, and never once were they missed or late. I do not exaggerate when I say I never missed a period, even during my early twenties when I was constantly traveling, changing time zones, and alternating my sleep schedules from day-shift to night-shift and then back again. The thing was a rock that wouldn't budge. Fast forward to my life as a new wife, and pair that with turning 26, and you get a recipe for disaster. Well, not really disaster. Maybe just extreme stress. Several times during my first year of marriage, my period was late. Not just a few days. Late, as in 2 weeks, sometimes 3. What do you think this resulted in? Me rushing out for pregnancy tests. Oh my gosh, why is it so late? It's never late! I've got to be pregnant! Nope, not pregnant. Just late. This left me very frustrated. Not only did this change occur, I also noticed changes with symptoms, intensity, and other variables. It seemed to be becoming a lot more sensitive to things such as exercise, sickness, and general life, whereas before, the thing did not falter during times of extreme physical, mental and emotional changes. I thought, Now is not the time for my periods to become irregular - they've had nearly 15 years to be irregular. Now is the time to be consistent and trustworthy, so I can properly carry out married life without the stress of trying to prevent pregnancy or become pregnant. Sadly, this was not the case. After visiting my doctor, I received the wisdom that I wish I would have received before this started happening. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. You are very healthy. You are older now, so your body is changing. This is is your new normal. As frustrating as this was, I was comforted by this being my new normal. I just so wish I would have been told to expect my cycle to change, as this would have saved so much unnecessary stress.\n\nThe body image wrestle and win. While the age at which this occurs is different for all of us, there comes a time in every woman's life where she decides that she is going to love her body. I am lucky that this age for me came early on in my life. Of course I have wrestled with certain things I don't like about my appearance, and things I wish I could change, as we all have. But I have been blessed with people in my life who encourage me in this area, most especially my husband. I think the wrestle ended before we even got married. What really drove it home was coming to the place where I knew that God created me this way, just how He wanted me to be, no more and no less. He wanted every detail about my appearance to be there. Once I accepted this, I was awestruck by the truth of it. Thinking of Who wanted me to be this way, blew my mind. I can honestly say that I don't struggle with my body-image now. Of course some days are better than others, and there are days in every woman's life where she feels average, plain, not pretty. But there is something about this stage of life that just makes us throw our hands up and say I'm done. We throw out all of the lies. We get tired of hearing that we're not perfect. So we take You're too____. and You're not____enough. and we punch 'em in the face. Ain't nobody got time for that!\n\nThe ease of confident self-care. This ties right in with the above. I wish someone would have told me how much the opinions of my husband regarding my appearance would bring me to a place of self-acceptance that I never knew before. This played out in the simplest of things such as shaving my legs. Of course my goal is always to be well-kept, but I am amazed just how much insecurity regarding how I look has been lost. I just don't really care anymore. This is not to say that I no longer care about keeping up with my appearance. Quite the opposite - my husband's affirmation of my looks and him telling me regularly that I am beautiful gives me the extra boost of confidence I need to care just enough. Not too much to where I obsess over my appearance, but not too little to where I become lazy and unkempt. While I love how good and confident it feels to be well-kept, I also know that my husband just doesn't care if it's been 4 days since I shaved my legs, or if I wake up and decide not to do my hair. This is one of the best and most beneficial things I've found about marriage so far. And I do know that some husbands can have the opposite affect on their wives, based on how they affirm, or how they cut down. A spouse is a powerful person, and carries great potential to directly influence the self-confidence of their significant other.\n\nThe blossoming individuality:\n\nHere is something I was not even close to being prepared for after getting married. I had no idea that being married would bring out so much of who I am as a person, to the point where I now feel more like myself than ever before. I believe this has everything to do with marrying a very good man. The right person will always enable you to flourish in your self-esteem, self-care, hobbies, interests and passions. I found myself moving towards things I'd always wanted to do, exploring my passions with great zeal for life, and completing tasks and projects I'd always meant to finish. Being with the right person has a way of giving you that zoom of strength you need to be fully and 100% yourself. The knowledge that someone not only loves and accepts, but also genuinely enjoys, you as a person, brings a steadiness to the heart like never before. I grew to a place where it didn't really matter anymore who thought what about me. I felt no shame in being 100% myself. I believe that a good and solid marriage does this for both people.\n\nGirl, you got this. You're strong, brave and beautiful. You are a powerful woman who is fully capable of rocking out this adulthood thing. You're in your twenties - maybe single, maybe married, maybe soon to be - and you are simply amazing. Don't worry. Stay close to your Father, and your sisters, and rock some red lipstick when you feel down. I'm here for you. Go kick some a**!
Twenty-five years ago, as Hurricane Andrew bore down on northeast Mississippi, a teenage girl vanished without a trace in the town of Tupelo. She wasn't a casualty of Mother Nature. She was, according to police, a victim of a cold and calculating individual who took advantage of the chaos caused by the storm.\n\nThe hurricane, which was downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached Tupelo, left no permanent mark on the city, which is best known as the birthplace of Elvis Presley. However, the disappearance of 13-year-old Leigh Marine Occhi did, and it still hangs like a thick cloud over the city.\n\nFor more than two decades, authorities have dissected and combed through the evidence. Theories and suspicions abound, but the teenager has yet to be found.\n\nStill, there is hope for resolution. The case is now being analyzed in a new podcast, titled 13: The Search for Leigh Occhi, which is being released episodically by local NBC affiliate WTVA News.\n\nThere's a lot of apparent coincidence in this tale, WTVA's Jason Lee Usry says in the preview episode of the podcast, which can be found on iTunes or SoundCloud. A lot of coincidence, a great deal of mysterious behavior, and somewhere within one of the players in this story, a terrifying level of cruelty.\n\nThe case, which this author first covered on the Criminal Report Daily blog nine years ago, began on Aug. 27, 1992. As torrential rains and gusting winds began to hit Tupelo, the alarm clock at the Yarbrough home went off at about 6:45 a.m.\n\nAccording to Vickie Yarborough, she and her daughter, Leigh Occhi, had slept in the same bed the previous night because the girl was afraid of storms. The blond-haired, bright-eyed Leigh had recently celebrated her thirteenth birthday and was supposed to go to an open house at Tupelo Middle School with her grandmother that afternoon.\n\nYarborough had recently separated from Leigh's stepfather, Barney, and she told detectives it was just her and her daughter on that rainy Thursday morning. According to the police report, Yarborough said her daughter had been alive and well when she left for work at about 7:40 a.m. that morning.\n\nYarborough later said she'd heard there were tornado watches in the area and decided to call from work and check on Leigh at about 8:30 a.m. Nobody answered. Concern turned to worry, prompting Yarborough to drive home, according to the report.\n\nThe door was unlocked, and I opened the house and it was all dark, so I didn't see Leigh anywhere, Yarborough told detectives. I said, 'Leigh,' like that, and nobody answered me, and then I went in.\n\nShe added, I saw blood right there splattered on the walls and then I screamed ... and dialed 911.\n\nTupelo Police Department An undated photo of Leigh Occhi that was distributed by police.\n\nAt about 9:00 a.m., Yarborough made a frantic 911 call to the Tupelo Police Department. She requested immediate assistance at her home on a cul-de-sac on the city's west side, telling the dispatcher that her daughter was missing and that she'd found traces of blood inside the house.\n\nWhen police arrived on the scene, they observed blood stains in the hallway and bathroom, and a bloody stain containing strands of hair on a door frame facing the kitchen area. Authorities said there were indications that someone had attempted to clean up the blood in the bathroom. In Leigh's room, a bloody blue nightgown and bra were discovered. The only items missing were the teen's shoes, reading glasses and underclothes.\n\nThere was no sign of forced entry into the house, police said. Based on the evidence, authorities surmised Leigh had been killed inside.\n\nThe next day, the leading headline in The Daily Journal read, Federal Troops Ordered to Fla. A much smaller headline, within a subsection of the paper, read, 13-year-old Tupelo Girl Reported Missing.\n\nDavid Lohr The house where Leigh Occhi was last seen alive.\n\nPolice conducted multiple ground and aerial searches, but found no sign of Leigh. The case was coming to an abrupt standstill when, on Sept. 9, 1992, Yarborough contacted police and told them she'd received a package in the mail containing Leigh's missing eyeglasses. They'd been delivered in an 8-inch envelope, addressed in block letters to B Yarborough. The return address was the same as the mailing address.\n\nAuthorities determined the package had been mailed from Booneville, a small city located roughly 30 miles north of Tupelo. The envelope was sent to the state crime lab in Jackson for handwriting analysis and DNA testing, but nothing of evidentiary value was found.\n\nAccording to Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre, investigators became suspicious and asked Yarborough to take a lie detector test. She was polygraphed three different times ― once by a local polygraph examiner and twice by the FBI – and failed it three times, the chief said in a 2009 interview with this author.\n\nYarborough was named a person of interest at the time, but no charges were ever filed against her.\n\nIn 2009, the same year the police chief revealed the alleged results of the lie detector tests to this author, Yarborough said she was well aware they'd considered her a person of interest.\n\nThat has never been a bother to me, she told this author.\n\nIt's never been about me. It's about finding Leigh, and I didn't care and I [still] don't care what anyone says about any of it ... I have never not cooperated with anybody [and] I am not fazed by what they say.\n\nDavid Lohr Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre in a 2009 photo.\n\nDetectives investigated Leigh's step-father, but ultimately cleared him, police said. Other suspicions ― directed at a man who was known to Leigh's family and later incarcerated for similar crimes ― failed to pan out.\n\nDespite the police department's belief that Leigh was murdered, her mother was unwilling, in 2009, to give up the hope that her daughter was still alive.\n\nI am not going to accept anything for sure, she said. I am not going to do that ... I have to keep focused on factual things ... or I wouldn't be able to cope very well.\n\nIt's unclear if she still holds that belief.

Courtesy of the Lima family Democratic Rhode Island state Rep. Charlene Lima and her husky, Keiko. Lima has introduced a bill in the state legislature dealing with pet custody, a growing issue in divorce cases.\n\nThe divorce court judge was frustrated. The husband, in tears. The wife, adamant. The couple's love for each other had ended, but each professed to love and want the dog. How would the judge decide?\n\nThe husband offered thousands of dollars to his soon-to-be-ex for the pit bull terrier mix named Sweet Pea. The wife wouldn't accept the compensation, and insisted the dog was hers — a gift, in fact, from her husband.\n\nThis was a mutt they got at the pound, and it wasn't worth money, said family attorney Erin Levine of Oakland, California, who represented the husband and said the judge gave her grief for not settling the dispute out of court in the 2015 case. There was no way we weren't going to litigate this; they were so attached to the dog.\n\nThe woman produced a greeting card from her husband saying This [dog] is your gift for Christmas. I love you. Finally, the judge gave her custody of Sweet Pea. Her husband, Levine remembered in an interview, was inconsolable.\n\nIt's that kind of messy pet custody case that a new California law is supposed to help solve. Former Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, owner of two first dogs, corgi mix Lucy and bordoodle Cali, signed the bill, which took effect Jan. 1.\n\nWhile pets are not considered children and are technically property, the California law, recognizing what it calls pets' unique nature, sets up special assessments that judges can use to determine custody in contested cases.\n\nThe law allows people to petition for custody of a pet. It empowers judges to take into consideration the care of the pet when determining sole or joint ownership. Questions like who walked the dog? and who took the cat to vet appointments? are now permissible criteria for determining custody.\n\nOnly Alaska and Illinois have similar statutes, both of which took effect in 2017. But the California law is the most specific, and at least a handful of other states are looking to it as a model.\n\nThis is something I think you could see creeping up in statehouses across the country, said Crystal Moreland, California state director for the Humane Society of the United States. Once California gets involved in something, you tend to have a national effect.\n\nAnimal court\n\nThere's apparently plenty of need for the laws. A 2014 survey by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers showed that respondents reported a 22 percent increase in pet custody hearings in the preceding five years.\n\nDogs were the most disputed family animal, with 88 percent of the cases. Cats were a distant second at 5 percent. Horses made up 1 percent, while the category of other registered 6 percent — including an iguana, python, African grey parrot and even a giant 130-pound turtle.\n\nIn addition, 20 percent of the attorneys surveyed cited an increase in courts determining that pets are an asset in a divorce.\n\nOther than in states with the new laws, pets are generally considered property to be divided between warring couples. That didn't make sense to Rhode Island state Rep. Charlene Lima, a married Democrat who authored a best interests of the pet bill last year.\n\nAlthough the bill stalled in committee, Lima, who owns a very spoiled 8-year-old husky named Keiko, is readying a new bill modeled on California's for this year's session.\n\nShe said she has had constituents tell her about contentious divorce fights that end up costing them tons and tons in legal fees over the pets. She maintained her bill would smooth the process by setting out criteria by which judges could make the determinations on pet custody.\n\nDo we want to treat them like humans? she said. No, but we don't want the pet considered like the couch either.\n\nThe California law allows judges in divorces with pets to take into consideration:\n\nWho feeds the pet?\n\nWho adopted the pet?\n\nWho purchases food, toys and other things for the pet?\n\nWho walks the pet?\n\nWho takes the pet to the vet?\n\nWho protects the pet?\n\nWho spends the most time with the pet?\n\nHave there been allegations of domestic abuse or abuse of the pet?\n\nDemocratic California state Assemblyman Bill Quirk, the bill's author and owner of a 13-year-old Maltese Shih Tzu mix named Luna, which he and his wife adopted from a shelter two years ago, said he was looking to write a law that would encourage judges to consider the pets' best interests.\n\nPets are very emotional, Quirk said. As the owner of a rescue dog … I thought it was very important that their welfare be taken into consideration.\n\nBut he said judges and family lawyers were concerned about how long it would take to settle pet custody in already-time-consuming divorce cases and that the new law might give spouses another avenue for revenge.\n\nBut what does the dog want?\n\nMembers of the Association of Certified Family Law Specialists in June testified before a California Senate committee that they opposed the bill because cases of marital dissolution and legal separation already face significant delays and issues of contention in court, particularly surrounding child custody.\n\nDorie Rogers, family law specialist in Southern California and associate director of the family law association, said her members were worried that clients would have one more thing to fight over.\n\nBefore the new law, she said, she had to explain to clients that since pets were property, they simply had to try hard to settle matters before it got to a courtroom.\n\nShe expects the new law will encourage more of them to go before the judge, now that they know what criteria might be taken into consideration. With more people, especially millennial couples with no children, treating their pets like kids, she said, cases are about to get very complicated.\n\nRogers also said her group opposed the law because of worries about increased time and cost of litigation in divorce cases.\n\nCertifying the welfare of the animal will be difficult and might require expert testimony, Rogers said. How do you prove that? Did you feed the dog, did you take it to the vet? Who's going to be the tie-breaker? Are you going to bring in the vet? she said in a phone interview.\n\nTo try to address those concerns, Quirk amended his bill to make courts' special consideration in pet custody cases voluntary rather than mandatory.\n\nMarie Sarantakis, a family law attorney in Illinois, one of the other states with a pet custody law, said she has handled divorces in which one spouse uses a pet as leverage. In one case, she represented the wife, who had a beagle that she'd owned before the relationship. Out of the blue, Sarantakis said, the husband filed for divorce and asked for the dog.\n\nThat completely caught her off guard, Sarantakis said. She never would have guessed it was something he wanted. She believed that the purpose of asking for the dog was to gain power and ask for other things. Luckily the case got resolved, and she kept the dog.\n\nSarantakis said the pet custody cases can sometimes become more emotional than disagreements over children.\n\nThe children can vocalize. With the dog, you don't know what they want, she said. She noted that sometimes judges award custody of pets in the same manner as children — when the kids go with mom, for example, so does the pet.\n\nWhile pleased that the new law attempts to ease what she said is a challenging and emotional issue for a lot of people, California family law attorney Deborah Marx, immediate past president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers chapter in Northern California, is skeptical that it will make a difference in divorce cases.\n\nShe noted that even though the law aims to take pets out of the property split in a divorce, the statute is in the property division section of the law, not in the family code section. But, she said in a phone interview, it's in a section that deals with unusual provisions, in what is generally a community property state where marital assets are divided equally. That puts the pet question in a special category.\n\nThe unusual provisions section addresses situations such as when one spouse receives a personal injury award during a marriage, allowing courts to award that spouse the entire amount. Similarly, a pet could be considered the property of one person, she said.\n\nBut Marx said much is still up to the judge's discretion and that couples with pets get very differing receptions from the judges depending on how judges feel about pets. Some are sympathetic and some are 'why are you wasting my time?'
Women's rights groups are sounding the alarm about President Donald Trump's nominee to head a key federal agency charged with reducing violence against women.\n\nShannon Lee Goessling, a Republican, is under consideration to lead the Office on Violence Against Women, which administers grants to support victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Advocates say Goessling has limited experience working in the domestic violence field, and has a history of opposing rights for LGBTQ people and immigrants.\n\nA date for Goessling's nomination hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee has not been set.\n\nIn a statement last year, the White House pointed to Goessling's record as a district attorney in Georgia, where she prosecuted crimes against women and children in the 1990s. From 2004 to 2015, she was the executive director and chief legal counsel of Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest law firm and policy center with a record of advocating for gun rights and religious freedom.\n\nDuring Goessling's time at Southeastern Legal Foundation, the group filed an amicus brief arguing in favor of same-sex marriage bans, and sued the governor of Alabama for offering driver's license exams in languages other than English.\n\nEleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to women's equality, told HuffPost that Goessling is an unsuitable choice and wholly unqualified for the position.\n\nThis is a top job, for God's sake, Smeal said. You should have a person here who has experience in this field.\n\nTrump's announcement about Goessling's nomination noted that she previously worked as the director of the Crimes Against Women and Children Prosecution Unit in Atlanta after almost a decade as a state prosecutor. However, her LinkedIn page indicates she only held that position for nine months.\n\nGiven her views, which are most obvious from her tenure at Southeastern Legal Foundation, we are very worried about her ability to enforce the Violence Against Women Act, and to understand all the complexities of the communities that it serves, Smeal said.\n\nSmeal noted that domestic violence affects people of all classes, ethnic groups and backgrounds.\n\nIn each of these different communities, there [are] different complexities. The person who runs the office must not only understand that, but also be sympathetic to it, she said. We're worried that a vote for her would exclude LGBTQ and immigrant survivors from protections and resources.\n\nGoessling did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article.\n\nIf confirmed, as the head of the Office on Violence Against Women, Goessling would have a large influence over which domestic violence and sexual assault programs get funding, Smeal said, and which issues take priority.\n\nSmeal said she was especially concerned with Goessling's record on guns. In 2008, Goessling authored an amicus brief arguing that firearms help protect women from violent attacks, and quoted a researcher who wrote that women who are confronted with a sexual assault are significantly less likely to experience a completed rape if they resist with a weapon.\n\nHowever, Susan Sorenson, a gun violence researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, noted that Goessling's brief relied in part on research that is more than 30 years old.\n\nWe have learned a lot about sexual assault and other violence against women in the intervening decades, she said. The person who is most likely to sexually assault a woman is a man she knows — and resistance takes a different form when it's someone you know.\n\nSorenson said she is unaware of any current research that supports the idea that a woman who resists with a weapon is less likely to be sexually assaulted.\n\nSome might find it to be an appealing idea, but we don't have any research that supports it, she said. What we do know is that women who purchase a handgun are more likely, in the days, weeks, months and years afterwards, to be the victim of homicide and suicide.\n\nGuns are, indeed, known to make domestic violence incidents more deadly. One study found that victims are five times more likely to be killed if their abuser has access to a gun.\n\nToni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, said that when she reviewed Goessling's background, she was overcome with a sense of fear.\n\nI don't feel that she has the empathy or the emotional experience to do a good job in this role, she said. Once again, we are looking at another Trump nominee that will do the exact opposite than what is required of the position.\n\nIn addition to distributing grants, the Office on Violence Against Women is meant to give victims a voice on the national stage, said Richard Gelles, professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThat is not an exceptionally high priority of this administration, he said.\n\nNeed help?

Sources tell TMZ that Kardashian is asking for joint legal and physical custody of the couple's four children: daughters North, 7, and Chicago, 3, and sons Saint, 5, and Psalm, 1.\n\nWest is reportedly comfortable with joint custody, and neither party is contesting a prenuptial agreement.
A groundbreaking culmination of years of underground queer performance by a married artist duo is set to take place this April ― and they need your help to make their dream a reality.\n\nYACKEZ is comprised of Larissa Velez-Jackson and her husband Jon Velez-Jackson, veterans of the underground queer performance scene. The pair's upcoming project, Give It To You Stage, is a multimedia dance concert performance incorporating pro-wrestling as a form of alternative marriage therapy. To make their vision a reality, the pair are enlisting a diverse cast of queer performers from around New York City.\n\nOur ultimate goals are simple but far-reaching, Velez-Jackson told The Huffington Post. We want to provide healing during the current political climate, as well as redefine family entertainment while being subversive and radically inclusive. We also wish to redefine what a concert and dance performance can be and how they function. During this process, we happily skewer pop culture.\n\nWant to learn more about YACKEZ and Give It To You Stage? Check out the video above and head here to visit the project's Kickstarter page.
TMZ reports that Paula Patton has been granted a temporary restraining order against ex-husband Robin Thicke, whom she she accused of physically abusing her amid their ongoing custody battle over their 6-year-old son, Julian.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by People magazine, a Los Angeles judge ruled Thursday that Thicke must remain at least 100 yards away from Patton, the former couple's son and Patton's mother, Joyce, noting that Thicke has a history of domestic violence.\n\nPatton and Thicke's nine-year marriage ended in 2014, and they finalized their divorce in May 2015. But their custody battle rages on.\n\nAccording to Patton's 52-page request for a domestic violence restraining order, the 41-year-old claims, Robin had a temper and could be volatile at times, and went on to provide examples of abusive incidents. Patton lists their son's birthday in April 2013 as one such occasion.\n\nIn the documents, Patton also claims that she observed Thicke having inappropriate contact with the masseuse and says he became so enraged that I had interrupted his 'massage' that he broke down the locked door. Patton goes on to explain that Thicke became physically violent with me. He pushed me down and kicked me.\n\nAnother incident allegedly took place at the Cannes Film Festival in 2013. We began fighting. Robin hit me with a closed fist to my upper body and then pushed me onto the ground, Patton claims in the document.\n\nShe also contends that Thicke endangered her with his infidelity and says the singer admitted to having unprotected sex with seven other women.\n\nThicke is denying the allegations. His lawyer responded to the documents, telling People in a statement, Paula never reported any domestic violence until she was in a position of contempt by violating the custody orders. DCFS asked both Paula and Robin to drug test. Robin agreed and submitted to his test, but Paula refused to test. Infidelity has nothing to do with custody. She is attempting to throw anything at him to hurt him, but Robin's focus is their son.\n\nNeed help? In the U.S., call 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) for the National Domestic Violence Hotline .
There's no doubt that being in a long-distance relationship comes with its challenges: trying to coordinate time to talk across different time zones, making plans to see each other when your work schedules or finances (or the current pandemic) don't allow for it and going long stretches of time without that coveted face-to-face connection.\n\nBut as people in LDRs will tell you, there are also some positive aspects to the experience that you may not have considered before.\n\nFor more than two years, Missy Eames was living in New York while her now-husband Harley was living in Australia; the pair eloped in July at Brooklyn Bridge Park in Brooklyn, New York. The long-distance path was difficult at times but it also strengthened their relationship, she said.\n\nLong distance was not always ideal. It came with struggles, loneliness, longing and then a pandemic happened and made it a bit harder for a short time in our situation, Eames told HuffPost. That being said, the nature of our relationship has left us with tons of memories and experiences that are irreplaceable.\n\nBelow, people who have been in LDRs, presently or in the past, share the surprising perks to their relationships.\n\nResponses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\n1. You don't take the little things for granted.\n\nSure, date nights are great. But we actually find ordinary life together downright magical. Morning hugs in the kitchen. Going to the grocery store together. Just seeing his toothbrush next to mine. Swoon! — Cris Gladly\n\n2. You get to maintain more of your independence.\n\nPerhaps one of the best things about a long-distance relationship is the space that you have. You have lots of time for the things you love, for yourself, for missing each other. You get the benefits of being in a relationship, but can still enjoy your free, independent life.\n\nAs a person who's been through two years of transatlantic dating — and going on six years of marriage — I believe that it's healthy to retain some level of distance in a relationship, even for couples who do live under one roof. Maybe that's a weekend away with your girlfriends while he's fishing with his friends. Distance helps each of you stay self-sufficient and makes it easier to maintain respect towards each other. — Olga Baker\n\n3. You become pros at communicating.\n\nBeing in a LDR has created a stronger level of communication than I think would have developed if we were in a 'traditional' relationship. At any given point, we had a 14-to-16-hour time difference between us, sometimes more if I traveled out west. This worked really well for me because I worked overnight shifts, so most of the time we were both awake at the same time. On days off, one of us either woke up early or stayed up late to ensure that we could talk to each other.\n\nConsidering that months would often pass before we could see each other again, communication was all we had. In turn, I found that we were both very open about our emotions, how we felt about each other and how we felt about our situation moving forward. From almost day one, we have been very open and transparent with each other, and I think that made us stronger as a couple. — Eames\n\nWe actually find ordinary life together downright magical. Morning hugs in the kitchen. Going to the grocery store together. Just seeing his toothbrush next to mine. - Cris Gladly\n\n4. You make the most of whatever time you have together.\n\nOne of the perks was the memories we got to make when we'd see each other. On my weeklong trips to visit Dan in Portugal or Colombia, it was like a constant back-to-back date night because we had to pack it all in before I had to fly home again. We look back on those trips knowing that we spent such excellent quality time together in only seven days that it turned out to be like more quality time in total than the time that couples have together in a regular month living in the same place. — Becca of @Halfhalftravel\n\n5. You're uniquely prepared for a pandemic.\n\nCOVID has kept so many loved ones apart. But being in a long-distance relationship prepared me and my husband well. We already know exactly what to do to keep love strong and alive while apart. We've been doing those things for years! — Gladly\n\n6. You find creative ways to keep your sex life hot.\n\nIt's easy to let your sexual relationship fall to the wayside when you're with your partner every single day, especially during a pandemic. But a thriving sex life takes work and commitment. In LDRs, people are forced to nurture aspects of their relationships that they might not have otherwise — this is especially true with sex. We don't have a playbook for LDR sex lives so we can get creative with it. It can become a multimedia erotic love fest between nude pics, FaceTime sex, mutual masturbation and sexting. — Gigi Engle, author of All The F*cking Mistakes: A Guide to Sex, Love, and Life\n\nYou get the benefits of being in a relationship, but can still enjoy your free, independent life. - Olga Baker\n\n7. You get to explore new places together.\n\nI love traveling and seeing other parts of the world, which is coincidentally how we met. Since we started dating, I have been to Australia two more times and my husband has come to America four times before moving here. During those trips, we were able to play tourist in our respective homes and even see bits of each other's countries. In between those visits, we also got to travel together to Vietnam and Peru together. He proposed at Machu Picchu, which is something I will never forget. We figured that seeing each other would always require a flight on one end or the other, but we could break it up and meet each other somewhere, and then experience a new country together. — Eames\n\n8. Over time, two places start to feel like home.\n\nI get to live like a local in two cities on opposite sides of the planet. We have friends in both places. Favorite hangouts and coffee shops in both places. Two vastly differently environments now feel equally like home. — Gladly\n\n9. You're forced you to make some tough, but ultimately rewarding choices.\n\nLDRs are not an easy feat. They take work, no matter how serious or mutually casual the relationship. These kinds of relationships make you answer the very nerve-wracking question: What do I want from this and am I willing to do the work to make it happen? This is a terrifying aspect of romance that many millennials and Gen Z babes avoid in the never-ending quest to try and be 'chill.' LDRs don't really have room for 'chill' and force us to figure out our values and get clear about what we want. Ultimately, that can leave you with a relationship (or relationships) that sustain you and benefit you in the long-term. — Engle
James Bond star Daniel Craig and wife actress Rachel Weisz are expecting a little human.\n\nThe two are preparing to welcome their first child together, Weisz revealed in a New York Times interview about her upcoming film Disobedience with Rachel McAdams, who reportedly gave birth to a baby of her own recently.\n\nI'll be showing soon, she said Daniel and I are so happy. We're going to have a little human. We can't wait to meet him or her. It's all such a mystery.\n\nThe famously private couple, who've been married for seven years, already co-parent two children from previous relationships. Weisz shares an 11-year-old son Henry with Mother! director Darren Aronofsky, while Craig has a 25-year-old daughter, Ella, with the actress Fiona Loudon.\n\nJason LaVeris via Getty Images Daniel Craig and actress Rachel Weisz attend the 7th annual Governors Awards.\n\nDespite being a bonafide movie star, Weisz says she's not totally at ease talking about her marriage, unlike other celebrities who open their relationship up to the public.\n\nI really take my hat off to them, Weisz said of other famous couples But Daniel and I are really similar. We just literally don't know how to do that. We're just really crap at talking about our private lives.\n\nI'm very happy being married, very, very happy, she added.\n\nWhile Weisz has many new films on the horizon, Craig is also gearing up to return for his fifth film in the 007 franchise after previously joking he'd rather slash my wrist than play the character again.\n\nHe just meant 'I can't think about this today,' having just done one, she said. He was just tired. He needed a really long nap and a glass of wine. It would be like if you asked someone who just had a baby, 'Do you want another one that day?' They'd just go, 'NO!'\n\nSlumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle will helm the latest Bond adventure, which begins production at the end of the year.\n\nTo read Weisz's full interview, head over to The New York Times.
Australia's new deputy prime minister is being called on to heal the wounds left by a shocking anti-LGBTQI rant he penned 25 years ago.\n\nMichael McCormack, 53, on Monday took up the post as Australia's new deputy prime minister after the previous occupant, Barnaby Joyce, quit following weeks of controversy over his affair with a former staffer.\n\nCongrats to Michael McCormack, new deputy PM, who wrote this in 1993 when I was eleven. pic.twitter.com/mlhi80W73k — Bec Shaw (@Brocklesnitch) February 25, 2018\n\nSome LGBTQI rights activists have expressed concern over McCormack's elevation to the office of Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nWhile welcoming McCormack's apologies, just.equal spokesman Rodney Croome called on him to walk the talk and support initiatives to help LGBTQI Australians overcome isolation, prejudice and suicide in parts of rural Australia.\n\nThe apologies Mr. McCormack made in the past are welcome but given the hatefulness of what he said, and the high office he has stepped in to, he needs to walk the talk, Croome said in a statement.\n\nHe needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.\n\nMcCormack issued a fresh statement in August last year apologizing for the editorial. When he issued the August apology, he was small business minister and had ministerial responsibility for the same-sex marriage postal vote.\n\nI have grown and learnt not only to tolerate but to accept all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, or any other trait or feature which makes each of us different and unique, he said at the time.\n\nAustralian's overwhelmingly voted yes in the national survey, and same-sex marriage was legalised in December last year.\n\nMcCormack replaces Barnaby Joyce, who made global headlines last year when he threatened to execute Johnny Depp's dogs and more recently when he was forced to quit the role of deputy prime minister following weeks of controversy surrounding his extra-marital affair with a former staffer who is now pregnant.\n\nA father of three, McCormack was elevated to the post after he was elected leader of The National Party ― a move which automatically makes him deputy prime minister thanks to a long-standing agreement with conservative coalition partner, The Liberal Party.
Things took a surprising turn on the Jan. 1 episode of Sister Wives when a member of the TLC reality show's polygamist family announced she was a lesbian.\n\nAs seen in the above Entertainment Tonight clip, Kody and Meri Brown's 21-year-old daughter, Mariah Brown, came out to her Mormon Fundamentalist family in the episode, which aired Sunday night. It's difficult to gauge from the clip how Mariah's family members reacted, though her words prompted some surprised looks for sure.\n\nAfter the emotional episode aired, Mariah thanked viewers for their support on Twitter.\n\nwow okay y'all making me cry with your support. thank you thank you thank you thank you😌😌🏳️‍🌈 — mariah (@mariahlian) January 2, 2017\n\nA day before the episode aired, she seemed to hint at things to come in a Dec. 31 tweet.\n\nas hard as 2016 was for me, it was also probably the best year of my life. i am genuinely so blessed — mariah (@mariahlian) January 1, 2017\n\nSister Wives viewers will just have to wait until the show's Jan. 8 episode to see how the family comes to terms ― or doesn't ― with Mariah's sexuality. Of course, their devout faith could be an issue. As Fundamentalist Mormons, the family still practices polygamy, which has been explicitly rejected by the mainstream Mormon church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.\n\nStill, in November 2015, the Mormon Church adopted new, rigid guidelines on same-sex couples. Under those guidelines, any Mormon in a same-sex marriage would be deemed an apostate, or having abandoned the religion, and subjected to disciplinary hearings that could lead to excommunication.\n\nWhether or not the Browns would adhere to any of the mainstream Mormon church's stances on LGBTQ issues in any way is unclear. In a 2013 HuffPost Live interview, however, the family said they supported marriage equality. We have established our family the way we've chosen to, we've organized it the way we wanted to, Kody Brown said in that interview, which can be viewed below. We believe that all people should be allowed to have that right.\n\nNoting that she had very close LGBTQ friends, Robyn added, All adults should be able to choose who they love, and how they structure their family.\n\nHere's to hoping that the Browns put those actions into words and continue to support their daughter moving forward.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This article has been updated with additional information to clarify that the Browns identify as Fundamentalist Mormons. That denomination is separate from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the mainstream Mormon church.

Transcript And Video: President Obama's Interview With NPR's Nina Totenberg\n\nNPR/ YouTube\n\nPresident Obama spoke with NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg on Thursday about why he selected Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, why he thinks the judge deserves a hearing from the Senate and the impact Obama sees for the U.S. judiciary if that doesn't happen. Nina writes about the conversation here; a full transcript is below.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG: Mr. President, Judge Garland was runner-up twice before. So why now and not twice before?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think Merrick Garland is one of the best judges, not just in the country, but of his generation. And it is a testimony to how good he is that, you know, he has cropped up as a potential Supreme Court justice for a very long time.\n\nI have always been a huge admirer of his. I've always felt that the way he approaches cases — the intellect, the care to follow precedent, the consensus building — were qualities that would make him an outstanding Supreme Court justice.\n\nThis moment in our history — a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol — I think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.\n\nAnd so although I've always believed that he would make an outstanding Supreme Court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the Supreme Court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring — or at least increasing — the American people's confidence in our justice system.\n\nDid you talk to him about being a piñata, as Sen. Cornyn put it?\n\nWe had a very candid conversation. He's chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, so I assume that he either reads The Washington Post or listens to NPR, and I think had a pretty good sense of the posture that Majority Leader McConnell took immediately after Justice Scalia's passing — the notion that the Republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.\n\nI'm sure that he is aware that, these days, massive advertising campaigns are mounted in opposition to candidates — not just for Supreme Court, but for appellate court judges.\n\nBut he's not — he's not a pol.\n\nNo, he isn't. And so we discussed that, and I wanted to make sure that not only he felt comfortable with it, but his family felt comfortable with it. You know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we're — we call folks like Judge Garland civilians. And so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of.\n\nBut, you know, I think the way he described it — and I'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself — the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. He has loved being a judge for a very long time. He occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. He's got a great job.\n\nAnd he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared I think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that I might make. Because he thinks it's important.\n\nAnd I think he is convinced that he can do a really good job, partly because he has relationships with the judges that are already on the court, and he's shown himself to be a consensus builder. And he believes, rightly, that we're at a time where the more consensus we can forge, the better off we're going to be.\n\nBy the way, when did you offer him the job?\n\nOver the weekend.\n\nWell, he's a very good actor because I had dinner with him Sunday night [at a small charity event], and he looked like — he kept just was saying he wasn't going to get it. [Laughter]\n\nWell, you know, I — I — that just shows his wisdom once again, because when it comes to things like getting — being nominated for the Supreme Court, it's probably always wise to not count your chickens before they're hatched.\n\nBut you just told me they were hatched. [Laughter]\n\nWell, I'm not sure about that.\n\nIn the heat of ...\n\nI might have called him right after dinner.\n\nIn the heat of a presidential campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of Republicans saying that they won't give your nominee a hearing? They clearly don't want to look rude, so they'll meet with him and tell him that they don't want to meet with him. [Laughter]\n\nBut — but how do you keep it up there? When the Supreme Court, frankly — I've written more pieces in my life saying, This year it may be an issue, and then it never really is.\n\nThis year it may be an issue. In fact I think it is, in part because of the circus that has been the presidential campaign season so far.\n\nI think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. I think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in Washington. I think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.\n\nAnd when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the Senate saying, I won't meet with a nominee; I won't provide a nominee a hearing; I will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. That matters to people.\n\nAnd so, you're right, Nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following Supreme Court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. But people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. And this becomes I think a symbol of a process that, if Republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're Democrats or Republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the Senate.\n\nAt that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. And that damages people's faith in the judiciary — because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.\n\nAnd so I — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just Democrats, but a sizable number of Republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government. And what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the Constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.\n\nThere's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the Supreme Court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. George Washington nominated a couple of Supreme Court justices in his last year. And obviously George Washington had better poll numbers, I'm sure, than I did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, I think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.\n\nSo we've reported that Republican — leading Republican senators sent a message sort of back-channel: OK, if you appoint Merrick Garland, we — we still will oppose him now, but we would confirm him in the lame-duck session after the election if there's a Democratic president. Did that play any role in your decision?\n\nI have not had conversations like that.\n\nNo, I didn't say you had.\n\nWhat I have seen are the public statements of leading Republicans like Orrin Hatch broadly complimenting Judge Garland as a brilliant, fair jurist, who should be confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd ...\n\nSo did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that Republicans really do like him?\n\nWell, there's no doubt that what played a role, as I said earlier, was that, number one, I think he's the best person for the job. Number two, I think he's a consensus builder. And the court would benefit from that at the moment.\n\nJustice Scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. But if you think about when the Supreme Court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. And Judge Garland, if you look at his work on the D.C. Circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. And I think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by Republicans.\n\nIt certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. And I said at the outset I would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base. I said I would play it straight — that my goal was to actually confirm a justice who I thought could do an outstanding job. And Merrick Garland fits that bill.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ariel Zambelich/NPR Ariel Zambelich/NPR\n\nYour base, some of them quietly said, you know, everybody on that list, except Merrick Garland, was a minority or a woman; some of them were both. You picked the oldest person by far, the only white guy, and he's sort of a centrist liberal. He's not, you know, he's not going to — this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat do you say to that — those folks?\n\nWell, first of all what I would say is take a look at the appointments I've made since I've been president of the United States. I've appointed as many African-Americans to the Circuit Court as any president ever; more African-American women on the federal courts than any other president; more Hispanics, more Asian-Americans, more LGBT judges than any president in history.\n\nWe actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on the Circuit Courts, something that's never happened before. So my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched.\n\nWhen it comes to the Supreme Court, I've appointed two women, one Hispanic. And in each case, the good news is that I appointed the person who I absolutely thought was the best person for the job. In this case, Merrick Garland is the best person for the job.\n\nAnd I have confidence that — without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case — he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the Constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.\n\nWhat do you ask these folks in your interviews? I mean, you can't say, So, what do you think of Roe v. Wade? That would be improper, right?\n\nI do not do that.\n\nSo, I'm Judge Totenberg. I'm here for my interview. What are you going to ask me? What kinds of things do you ask?\n\nWell, sometimes I just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. You learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is.\n\nAnd when you hear Judge Garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the Oklahoma City bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. And I spent a lot of time on that.\n\nWith respect to judicial philosophy, I have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so I don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases — because I can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and I have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.\n\nOne thing I, I do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the Constitution might be ambiguous. What do they do to — to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? You know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.\n\nBut most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. And they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.\n\nLet me conclude by asking you sort of a devil's advocate question.\n\nSure.\n\nYou've said that neither party comes to this process clean.\n\nIt's absolutely true.\n\nAnd you voted to not end debate on the Alito nomination. And if I understood you correctly at your press conference, what I thought I heard you say was, You know, I knew that it was a meaningless vote. You got a pass from the leadership. You can do this.\n\nBut can you blame the Republicans who look at this nomination and say, There's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court. So can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win the presidential nomination [sic]. And if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the Democrats do the same? They called — they're all already calling it the Biden rule.\n\nWell, a couple of things. First of all, this speech that they continually quote from Joe Biden when he was on the Judiciary Committee — if you actually read the speech, number one, he was speaking hypothetically. [Cellphone rings]\n\nOh, Jesus. Oops.\n\nShould we start that one over? [Laughter]\n\nYeah, let's do that.\n\nWow, Nina. You're supposed to turn off your phone.\n\nI'm not — I'm supposed to be a pro.\n\nCome on.\n\nCome on. [Laughter]\n\nThe, uh ...\n\nIt's the office. [Laughter]\n\nI'm assuming you can just splice the question and I'll just answer it, so Nina doesn't have to answer — ask it again.\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, first of all, if you look at what Joe Biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a Supreme Court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.\n\nWell, you know what? That's exactly what I've done. And so there's no contradiction between what I'm doing and what Joe Biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.\n\nNumber two, with respect to my actions when I was a junior senator, you will recall that I never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. I never said that a nominee should not get a vote. And what I also said at the time was that I was concerned about some of Judge Alito's views that I considered more troubling. But in the case of Merrick Garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.\n\nThis is just raw politics. We don't want somebody who's been nominated by a Democrat — a claim that I would have never made at the time.\n\nNow what is true, Nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice Scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. And so I understand the politics that Republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.\n\nHere's the problem we have, though: If in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a Democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, We've got another excuse for not confirming a Democratic president's nominee?\n\nAnd at that point the process has broken down. Democrats have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which Democrats have left a seat open when a Republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.\n\nJustice Kennedy was confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and I'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of Democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's office. So we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that Democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the Supreme Court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the Supreme Court, but the integrity of the Senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.\n\nAnd my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. I'm not demanding that Republicans vote for Merrick Garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. And at some point, it's got to stop.\n\nA good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a Supreme Court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the Republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.\n\nAre you taking this on the road?\n\nWell, you know, I'm going to make the case — I'm going to make the case for a fair process. Give Judge Garland a hearing; give him a vote. And look at the qualities of the man. That's what the American people expect. And, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that I've heard from Mitch McConnell and some other Republicans is this notion that the American people should decide — we should let the American people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.\n\nWell in fact, the American people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the United States with sufficient electoral votes. And they also decided that the Republicans would be in the majority. They didn't say, We're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. They said, No, you're the president for four years, and Mr. McConnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the Senate.\n\nSo the American people already have decided. They've already weighed in. They will have another opportunity to weigh in, so that if there is another vacancy that comes up, the next president will fill that vacancy.\n\nThe bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. The real argument is the one that you made, Nina, which is that they don't want a Democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a Democrat to fill the seat.\n\nBut one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. And sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the American people actually matter more than your short-term politics. They actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. And there have been a number of times where, as president of the United States, I've had to do things that I knew were bad politics but I understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.\n\nAnd I would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on Earth.\n\nMr. President, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.\n\nI enjoyed it, Nina. Thank you.
Bluff The Listener\n\nOur panelists tell three stories about an expert getting something wrong, only one of which is true.\n\nBILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. We are playing this week with Mo Rocca, Amy Dickinson and Peter Grosz. And here again is your host at the Providence Performing Arts Center in Providence, R.I., Peter Sagal.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\n\nThank you, Bill.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: Right now, it is time for the WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME Bluff The Listener game. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to play our game on the air. Hi. You're on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.\n\nBEN PARKER: Ben Parker from Oxford, Miss.\n\nSAGAL: Hey. How are things in the Oxford, Miss., the Oxford of the South?\n\nPARKER: It is good. I'm (laughter) selling beer, so it's not too bad.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Well, selling beer in a university town is probably a pretty good gig. Am I right?\n\nPARKER: Yeah, you got to keep the students healthy and happy.\n\nSAGAL: Yes.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Well, welcome to the show, Ben. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is Ben's topic?\n\nKURTIS: Trust me, I'm an expert.\n\nSAGAL: Experts have more expertise than nonexperts, according to experts. But this week, we read about an expert getting something wrong. Our panelists are going to tell you about it. Pick the one who's telling the truth. You will win our prize, Carl Kasell expertly leaving his voice on your voicemail Are you ready to play?\n\nPARKER: Yes sir.\n\nSAGAL: All right. First, let's hear from Mo Rocca.\n\nMO ROCCA: When Wendy Schleicher of Ottawa, Canada, turned 50, her family and friends knew where to take her - to a place where she could ski, eat the world's best chocolates and buy a cuckoo clock, all things Wendy loves. So they chartered a jet to Switzerland, except that the pilot must've misheard. When we landed, I thought, Switzerland doesn't have elephants and rhinos, said Wendy. That's when I discovered we were in Swaziland.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nROCCA: Swaziland is a subtropical landlocked monarchy in Southern Africa about 11,000 miles from Switzerland. I felt terrible about the mixup, said pilot Brad Grossman. Lately, I've been suffering from a lot of waxy buildup so my hearing's not what it was.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nROCCA: But a plucky Wendy and her Canadian cohorts made the best of it. It would have been awfully hurtful to Swaziland to turn around and leave. So they used their snow skis to waterski along the Zambezi River. They made their own chocolate from cacao beans they picked. Wendy even dressed up as Heidi to read stories to Masai children at a bonfire. I hadn't packed anti-malarial pills for Switzerland, but luckily since Canada has nationalized health care, I stopped in at our embassy in Mabopane. That's the capital of Swaziland.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: A pilot...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: ...Who brought his chartered jet to Swaziland instead of Switzerland. Your next story of an expert not being so expert comes from Amy Dickinson.\n\nAMY DICKINSON: Alvin Bar hit the jackpot recently when he brought a ceramic jug to Antiques Roadshow to be appraised. Alvin came away with shocking knowledge that his $300 ugly face jug was worth $50,000. The grotesque-style pottery which looks like a cross between a gargoyle and Nick Nolte's mugshot, was described by the show's appraiser as bizarre and wonderful and about 100 years old. After the jug was appraised, Alvin Bar, its owner, reacted like he went to bed with Phyllis Diller and woke up with Beyonce.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDICKINSON: He immediately freaked out and hid the valuable jug behind his couch. When the Antiques Roadshow episode featuring this jug aired on TV how, however, a viewer recognized it as the high school art project made by her friend, Betsy...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDICKINSON: ...In the 1970s in Bend, Ore. Sure enough, the original artist, Betsy, verified that she had made it in ceramics class. So it's not 100 years old, and it's not worth $50,000. It's as old as your mom's Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young album and is worth a little more than $300. The Antiques Roadshow expert admitted his mistake, and the owner took the jug out from behind his couch. He said, I hated it when it was worth $50,000. Who wants that lying around their house? Now it's on my table, and I love it again.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Antiques Roadshow...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: ...Mistakes a high school art project for a valuable antique. Your last story of a guru stepping in doo-doo comes from Peter Grosz.\n\nPETER GROSZ: Dr. Vincent Benjamin of Palm Springs, Calif., is one of America's leading experts in the Kama Sutra, the ancient Indian book containing dozens of creative sexual poses with names like the eagle, the bridge and bandolier. But the Kama Sutra isn't just sexy Twister. It can be a way for couples to rekindle the dormant flames of their marriage, which is why this week Dr. Benjamin sold out the symposium he hosts at the Sheridan in Indio, Calif., entitled More Bang for Your Buck, Spicing Up Your Love Life for Only $50.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGROSZ: The four-hour session ended with Dr. Benjamin introducing the couples in attendance to a new position that he created called the screaming lotus. Now, the exact configuration of the bodies in this position is a little tricky to describe on NPR. But suffice to say, it involves significant balancing, rotating and lifting and as it turns out intense muscle pulling and ligament tearing...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGROSZ: ...Because unless you're a Cirque du Soleil performer and your partner is a professional weightlifter, you're probably eased into the screaming lotus.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGROSZ: All the couples who tried it didn't even get past the first step and found it a little light on the lotus and a little heavy on the screaming.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGROSZ: You wouldn't tell first-time mountain climbers to scale Mount Everest, said Dr. Benjamin. I should've given these couples appropriate warm-up exercises. The couples are threatening to sue the doctor for what is being called the first case of sexual malpractice.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: So these are your choices. Somewhere somebody who was supposed to know something got it wrong. Was it from Mo, a pilot who brought his passengers to Swaziland, not Switzerland; from Amy, an Antiques Roadshow appraiser who mistook a high school art project for a valuable antique; or from Peter Grosz, a sexpert who gave his students a little homework that was too hard, let's say. Which of these is the real person who misled somebody?\n\nPARKER: I would say the screaming lotus feels right, but I'll go with the Antiques Roadshow.\n\nSAGAL: All right.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: You might think the screaming lotus feels right, but not the people who tried it. So your choice then is Amy and her story of the mistake on Antiques Roadshow. Well, to bring you the correct answer we talked to someone intimately involved with this story.\n\nBETSY SEWELL: I made this pot in high school. I was just having fun, and it was appraised for a lot of money.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: That was Betsy Sewell, the woman who made this pot in high school back in the '70s and saw it on Antiques Roadshow being mistaken for a valuable antique. Congratulations, Ben, you got it right. Amy was telling the truth. You knew that. You've won Carl's voice on your voicemail. And Amy gets a point. Congratulations. Thank you so much for playing.\n\nPARKER: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, BIGGEST MISTAKE)\n\nTHE ROLLING STONES: (Singing) But I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life...\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

Saudi Woman Who Fled Country Hopes She Inspires Others To Follow\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lars Hagberg /AFP/Getty Images Lars Hagberg /AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe 18-year-old Saudi woman who secured asylum in Canada hopes other women will be inspired to follow in her footsteps.\n\nAfter she learned on social media that her family had disowned her, Alqunun said she'd like to drop her family name and go by Rahaf Mohammed, the Toronto Star reports. It's her latest show of defiance against a family she says abused her, in a country that forces women to get a man's permission to travel or marry. Relieved to leave that culture behind, she hopes to galvanize others to do the same.\n\nI think the number of women fleeing from the Saudi administration and abuse will increase, especially since there is no system to stop them, she said in her first television interview since arriving in her new country. I'm sure that there will be a lot more women running away. I hope my story encourages other women to be brave and free.\n\nAfter grabbing the world's attention with a series of frantic social media postings, Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun secured asylum when Canada agreed to take her in as a refugee. But for a terrifying period while her fate was uncertain, Alqunun considered taking her own life, she said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nI was expecting them to enter the room and kidnap me, she said of security officials who were outside the airport transit hotel where she barricaded herself earlier this month. That's why I wrote a goodbye letter. I decided that I would end my life, before I was forced back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nAlqunun's story didn't end in that hotel room. With the help of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which facilitated her application for asylum, Alqunun is now in a safe place, she said.\n\nWhen she walked through the airport door in Toronto, and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland was there to greet her, I felt free, and it was like I was born again, she told ABC. I felt overjoyed. There was a lot of love and hospitality, especially when the minister welcomed me and told me I was in a safe country and had all my rights.\n\nAnticipating a new life in Canada, Alqunun wants to attend college and study architecture, she told the New York Times. And she wants to experience what it's like to be a normal teenager. I want to do crazy things I've never done before, she said.\n\nMultiple GoFundMe campaigns have raised several thousand dollars to help Alqunun start over. The official fundraising campaign quickly raised $10,000 and is no longer accepting money. There's also a campaign by the Australian group Secret Sisterhood, which had protested in Sydney to try to persuade Australia to grant Alqunun's refugee request. Alqunun filled out her visa application at the Australian Embassy in Bangkok last week, but the UNHCR withdrew its request for resettlement there because the country was taking too long to decide on her asylum, ABC reported.\n\nAlqunun's newfound freedom has come at a cost. Her family has disowned her simply because I wanted to be independent and escape their abuse, she said. I wanted to be free from oppression and depression. I wanted to be independent. Had she stayed in Saudi Arabia, I wouldn't have been able to marry the person I wanted. I couldn't get a job without permission, she said. Alqunun's father has denied physically abusing her or forcing her into an arranged marriage, The Associated Press reported.\n\nSaudia Arabia has a male guardianship system. This means women need permission from a male relative for major life decisions like marriage, work and travel, NPR has reported. Women there have only been legally allowed to drive since June.\n\nWomen in Saudi Arabia are treated like children, even if they are 50 or 60 years old. They treat women terribly. They aren't free or equal to their male counterparts, Alqunun said. I hope my story prompts a change to the law especially as it has been exposed to the world. This might be the agent for change.\n\nSaudi women have been fighting to end guardianship laws for a long time, Egyptian-American activist Mona Eltahaway said on Twitter. Women's rights activists have been jailed and tortured for fighting to end guardianship. Remember them. Demand their release.\n\nCanada's acceptance of Alqunun could further fray its relations with Saudi Arabia, which had already been tense since the summer, NPR has reported. The Saudi government expelled the Canadian ambassador and recalled its own after Canada's foreign minister criticized Saudi Arabia's arrest of a human rights activist.
Ray Liotta On 'Goodfellas,' Acting And His Return To TV\n\nMy career has been up and down, and I like it much better being up, Liotta says. He plays a corrupt NYC police lieutenant on the NBC series Shades of Blue. Originally broadcast Jan. 12, 2016.\n\nDAVE DAVIES, HOST:\n\nThis FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, GOODFELLAS)\n\nRAY LIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) We always called each other goodfellas, like you'd say to somebody, you're going to like this guy. He's all right. He's a goodfella. He's one of us.\n\nDAVIES: On today's show, we conclude this week's series of favorite recent interviews with Ray Liotta, who starred in Martin Scorsese's classic 1990 film Goodfellas. He played Henry Hill, a wise guy, a member of a New York crime family who testified against the family after he was arrested and went into the Witness Protection Program.\n\nLiotta had already played a tough guy in his first major role in the 1986 film Something Wild. He's since played a range of roles in commercial and independent films and even played Frank Sinatra in the HBO movie The Rat Pack. Terry interviewed him last January about his starring role opposite Jennifer Lopez in the NBC series Shades Of Blue.\n\nThey play corrupt New York cops who take bribes, plant evidence and shake down drug dealers in their precinct. The criminals pay off the cops. And in return, the cops let the dealers do their thing, as long as they don't get too close to schools or cause any other trouble. Before we hear about Liotta's life and movies, let's hear a scene from the premiere of Shades Of Blue. Liotta's character, Lt. Matt Wozniak, is using a little coercion to keep one of his dealers in line.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, SHADES OF BLUE)\n\nLIOTTA: (As Matt Wozniak) I need to remind you about our understanding, Raul?\n\nOTTO SANCHEZ: (As Raul Mendez) Oh, I remember. You wanted to protect parks and schools from the drug trade. I trusted your assurance that no one else would push into that territory.\n\nLIOTTA: (As Matt Wozniak) This isn't about your turf. The dope's cut hot. I need to get it all off the street. You cracked the skull of my only lead.\n\nSANCHEZ: (As Raul Mendez) I don't think you're appreciating my situation. I can't look like a [expletive].\n\nLIOTTA: (As Matt Wozniak) You don't dispense street justice in my precinct. Now, where is he?\n\nSANCHEZ: (As Raul Mendez) The girlfriend never gave him up - tough girl. Don't worry, I'll find him.\n\nLIOTTA: (As Matt Wozniak) No more mayhem, Raul.\n\nSANCHEZ: (As Raul Mendez) We both want what's best for the community, Lieutenant. I think you know what that's going to take...\n\n(FIGHTING)\n\nLIOTTA: (As Matt Wozniak) Let me explain to you how this works. I tolerate you because you keep your business contained and you don't cause me any aggravation. We both know that if I brought you down tonight, some punk phoenix would rise from your ashes. And I'm already starting to like him better. How's that for a reminder?\n\nTERRY GROSS, BYLINE: That's Ray Liotta on Shades Of Blue. (Laughter) Ray Liotta, welcome to FRESH AIR. You're going to go easy...\n\nLIOTTA: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: ...On me, right?\n\nLIOTTA: Yes, I will.\n\nGROSS: You're going to be nice to me, right? (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: I will.\n\nGROSS: So...\n\nLIOTTA: I think I was throwing ashes on him - is - I think is what I did.\n\nGROSS: You were, yeah.\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah (laughter).\n\nGROSS: And they were getting in his eyes and his nose and his mouth. And he was, like, choking and burning and not really liking...\n\nLIOTTA: He deserved it.\n\nGROSS: ...Your particular form of interrogation (laughter). So are you often cast as cops and criminals because of Goodfellas and because of Something Wild before that? Like, did that get you started in a certain trajectory?\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah, I guess it did. The first thing I ever did was a soap opera. And I played the nicest character in the world, Joey Parini. I got it right - about six months out of college, I got the soap. I did it for three years. And then I came to LA. For five years, nothing happened. And then the first thing I got was Something Wild. So that kind of put me on the map as - 'cause that was kind of a crazed character.\n\nBut then I did Field Of Dreams, where I was a nice guy in that. And then along came Goodfellas. And maybe that kind of started it. But Henry Hill, the part I played - he really didn't - it wasn't that violent. Everybody else was kind of crazy around him. But yes, I've definitely played my share of them.\n\nGROSS: So you said that you wanted, you know, a 13-part series, which is why you signed on - one of the reasons why you signed onto Shades Of Blue. What do you want from a series? Like, why did you want one?\n\nLIOTTA: To get better movie parts, to tell you the God's-honest truth. I - you know, I've been lucky enough to do and work in this business for years. But I wasn't getting the exact kind of parts that I wanted. Usually, it wasn't about if I had the ability to do it. It was more about - did I have enough umph behind me to put butts in the seats or eyes on the tube? I just started seeing people's careers.\n\nAnd the whole business changed from when I first started. There were a lot of people that were getting movies that were coming out of television. You know, I started out really hot out of the box. Then I've definitely had and up-and-down career. And when things started cooling off again, it frustrated me. So I was just watching what was going on. And that seemed to be the way things started to be going.\n\nGROSS: Swell. So Goodfellas, of course - a 1990 film. You played Henry Hill. And it's based on the Nicholas Pileggi novel, Wiseguy, in which Henry Hill tells his whole story, starting from when he's a kid. And he aspires to be like the small-time gangsters in the neighborhood. He ends up being their assistant and ends up being, you know, really, like, a part of that whole ring and ends up in the Witness Protection Program. I know that you listened to tapes of Henry Hill.\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: What interested you in his voice? What were you able to pick up from - and I assume - were these FBI tapes? Was this him being debriefed by the FBI?\n\nLIOTTA: No, these were the tapes of - that Nick Pileggi gave me...\n\nGROSS: Oh, for his book.\n\nLIOTTA: ...from when he was writing the book about - right. So he talked to Henry for hours. And once I got the film, I went and talked to Nick to just - to start to get - you know, start doing my homework. And he said, here, listen to these tapes. Well, I listened to the tapes of Henry. And I listened to them every day. And that was back when everybody - everything was on cassette, so you would just put - I'd just put it in my mother's car and listen to Henry for hours.\n\nThe problem was all he did was eat potato chips. And if you've ever listened to anybody eat potato chips for, like, hours as he's talking, it's an extremely annoying thing (laughter). And the biggest thing that I learned from it was just how casual they were - how casual Henry was about what happened. It was just like he was telling a story of what his kids were doing and how they played in a park, except they were talking about, you know, people getting killed or beaten. It was very, very casual, though.\n\nGROSS: So your voice is very important in this 'cause you're not only portraying the character on screen, but you're doing voiceover throughout the film. So let me play the opening voiceover of the film in which - this is a flashback where your character is young. But you're doing the voiceover as an adult looking back on your childhood.\n\nLIOTTA: OK.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, GOODFELLAS)\n\nLIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) To me, being a gangster was better than being president of the United States. Even before I first wandered into the cab stand for an afterschool job, I knew I wanted to be a part of them. It was there that I knew that I belonged. And to me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood that was full of nobodies. They weren't like anybody else. I mean, they did whatever they wanted. They double-parked in front of a hydrant, and nobody ever gave them a ticket. In the summer when they played cards all night, nobody ever called the cops.\n\nGROSS: That's my guest, Ray Liotta, in Goodfellas. It's just so interesting to me how low his sights were set as a kid. You know, like...\n\nLIOTTA: (Laughter).\n\nGROSS: ...he wanted to be the guy that could park - like, double-park in front of the hydrant. And you're not going to get a ticket, you know?\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah, well...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: I guess different strokes for different folks. I guess when you grow up like that, when you're growing up in New York, and your father isn't making a lot of money, to see people who are - have a lot of money and power. You know, that kind of shows a power that they're parking wherever they want when you're not supposed to do that. That really influenced him a lot.\n\nGROSS: So listening through the potato chips when you were listening to the tapes of Henry Hill - did you pick up a lot of slang that he used - 'cause there's, you know, expressions through the film that you assume were a part of that, you know, Wiseguy culture. So did you pick up, like, language kind of things that you thought were really interesting?\n\nLIOTTA: I'm a big believer that the script is your bible. And the script - and a good one - tells you everything that you need to know. And I just committed to the script. I learned everything. I learned - I had so much time to learn it. And I was home in New Jersey 'cause my mother was sick at the time. And Marty was just getting ready to launch Last Temptation Of Christ. And so the movie was pushed so I had more time.\n\nSo I just listened to the tapes. But I didn't get anything in terms of slang. I just know what it's like being an East Coast person, being from New Jersey. But also, just the script was great. What Marty and Nicholas wrote - I just committed to that, to the words that was on the page.\n\nGROSS: Martin Scorsese was very close with his mother and even did a documentary about his mother. I assume he really understood what it was like for you to have a mother who was very sick.\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah, I'm sure maybe personally he did. But I didn't really bring that to the set until - I mean, to be totally honest, my mom passed away in the middle of the movie. And they told me on a particular day during a particular scene that I really had to get home that night because things took a turn for the worse. And, you know, I broke down. I went into my trailer.\n\nI had to get myself together 'cause we had to, you know, get ready and still do the movie. And I had a scene to shoot. I grew up only 45 minutes from the city. So the crew, Joe Pesci - they came to my mom's funeral. It was really, really - it wasn't special. But it was special and nice. But that's the reality of what happened.\n\nDAVIES: Actor Ray Liotta speaking with Terry Gross in January. We'll hear more stories about shooting the film Goodfellas after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview Terry Gross recorded with actor Ray Liotta. It's part of our end-of-summer series of favorite recent interviews.\n\nGROSS: When we left off, we were talking about Goodfellas. And you had mentioned the scene, which is a very famous scene - the laughing scene, in which you and a bunch of the small-time gangsters that you hang out with, including Tommy, who's played by Joe Pesci - you're at your favorite, like, restaurant, bar, hangout.\n\nYou're at a table. And the Joe Pesci character, Tommy, is telling this story. Everybody's laughing at the story. You're laughing the hardest. And after the story ends, he looks at you and he says, what's so funny? So let's play part of that scene, and the scene starts with you just laughing a lot at the end of his story.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, GOODFELLAS)\n\nJOE PESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) Pow, ping - I mean, I wish I was big just once.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) We're the big cops.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) Really funny - you're really funny.\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) What do you mean, I'm funny?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) It's funny, you know, that story - it's funny. You're a funny guy.\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) What do you mean? You mean the way I talk - what?\n\nLIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) It's just, you know - it's - you're just funny. It's - you're funny - you know, the way you tell the story and everything.\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) Funny how? I mean, what's funny about it?\n\nFRANK ADONIS: (As Anthony Stabile) Tommy, you know, you got it all wrong. See...\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) Whoa, whoa, Anthony, he's a big boy. He knows what he said. What'd you say, funny how?\n\nLIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) Just...\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) What?\n\nLIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) Just - you know, you're funny (laughter).\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) You mean - let me understand this 'cause I don't - you know, maybe it's me. I'm a little [expletive] maybe, but I'm funny how? I mean, funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh? I'm here to [expletive] amuse you? What do you mean funny - funny how? How am I funny?\n\nLIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) Just - you know, how you tell a story. What...\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) No, no, I don't know. You said it. How do I know? You said I'm funny. How the [expletive] am I funny? What the [expletive] is so funny about me? Tell me - tell me what's funny.\n\nLIOTTA: (As Henry Hill) Get the [expletive] out of here, Tommy.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPESCI: (As Tommy DeVito) I almost had him. I almost had him. You stuttering prick, you. Frankie, was he shaking? I wonder about you sometimes, Henry. You may fold under questioning.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGROSS: That's Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci in a scene from Goodfellas. So that's such a crazy scene. Like, the Joe Pesci character is so crazy. Like, that's an example of it because you had every reason to think that he was actually threatening you because that's how crazy he is. There's a scene where he shoots the Michael Imperioli character in the foot just kind of for no reason and later just kills him. So what was behind that scene? Like, what's the difference between how that scene looked in the original script and how it looked on screen?\n\nLIOTTA: That was totally improv during - Joe was telling a story - we had two weeks of rehearsal, which is basically unheard of with making movies. But we had two weeks of rehearsal...\n\nGROSS: You mean 'cause that's a lot of rehearsal or a little rehearsal?\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah, yeah...\n\nGROSS: That's a lot, OK.\n\nLIOTTA: And you don't usually rehearse like that. It was just Lorraine, Bob, Joe and myself and Marty. And Joe is a great storyteller. And he was telling a story - that actually happened to him at a restaurant once. And he was telling that story. And Marty thought, wow, that would be a great place to put a scene like that. And, you know, Marty just - you know, he's a genius. So during rehearsal, Joe and I just played around with it. And then we would keep working at it and shaping it. And the improv became part of the script.\n\nGROSS: What our listeners can't see is that in that scene, you're not only laughing loudly. But it's like visually, you are laughing. Like, your mouth is, like, way open as you laugh - like, your whole face is shaped like a laugh. It's as if, like, you're trying to prove, like, this is funny. I am enjoying myself. I'm all in on this joke. And there's even a collage on YouTube of your laughter through the movie. Was that a thing for you when you were making it - that you thought that this character had to just, like, demonstrate that he thought something was funny and that he was enjoying life?\n\nLIOTTA: (Laughter) No, that's the way I laugh. That's just the way...\n\nGROSS: Is that the way you laugh (laughter)?\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah, if I think something's funny, I think it's funny. And I just let it out. I'm amused by a lot of things. I love humor. I'm constantly joking around. It blows my friends' minds that I've never been in a fight in my whole life, and I play all these kinds of characters. It might seem exaggerated, but it's not. I just - you know, some people just have some very full laughter - full of joy - and have no shame or fear of letting that out.\n\nGROSS: So you told us about the potato chip-eating interviews on cassette that you listened to of Henry Hill. Did you meet him in person, like, in a secret location when he was in the Witness Protection Program?\n\nLIOTTA: No. I got a call from him after he saw the movie. Marty didn't want me to talk to him at all. He just wanted - we're just going to go by the script now 'cause he knew that maybe if I met him, he might embellish or - he didn't know what was going to happen. They just wanted me to just go by the script and not to meet him. I got a phone call that he wanted to meet me at a bowling alley in the Valley with his brother. And I said, oh, boy, what the heck is this going to be?\n\nSo I went. And he was there. And I met him for the first time. He had just seen the movie. And basically, he says, yeah, I wanted to meet you. You know, thanks for making me not look like a scumbag, to quote him. And I'm thinking to myself, oh, my gosh, did you really watch the movie? You pretty much were a scumbag. You ratted on your friends...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: ...You were doing all this blow. You were beating people up. But - and then I would see him for years. He had a rough life towards the end of his life. And I would see him, a lot of times, in Venice. And he was just, you know, out of his mind on - you know, doing something - usually pretty loaded. I would see him leaning against trees or just sleeping on the beach. And I would bump into him every once in a while.\n\nGROSS: You're pretty well known now. And probably your most famous film is Goodfellas. But people who are young don't necessarily know much about anything except current films. And that's kind of the joke in an episode of Modern Family that you just guest-starred on. And I want to play a clip from that. It's a really funny episode. And in this episode, the three kids from the family - they want to treat their uncle to a special gift for his birthday. And it's kind of last-minute. So the three teenage Dunphy kids decide to buy a map to the stars' homes in Hollywood and take their uncle, who loves Barbra Streisand, to Barbra Streisand's house. So they take him there. And the uncle's played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson. They take him there. And instead of seeing Barbra Streisand in front of the house, they see you in the front yard - you, as Ray Liotta. But only the uncle recognizes you. The kids have no idea who you are. So you're trying to tell the kids who you are by listing some of your biggest films.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, MODERN FAMILY)\n\nLIOTTA: (As himself) Goodfellas, Something Wild, Field Of Dreams.\n\nJESSE TYLER FERGUSON: (As Mitchell Pritchett) Field Of Dreams.\n\nNOLAN GOULD: (As Luke Dunphy) Never seen it.\n\nSARAH HYLAND: (As Haley Dunphy) We're really not that old.\n\nFERGUSON: (As Mitchell Pritchett) Look, Ray Liotta is a very fine actor. And we have taken up enough of his time, so...\n\nLIOTTA: (As himself) Stop saying my full name like you have to keep telling them who I am.\n\nFERGUSON: (As Mitchell Pritchett) Well...\n\nARIEL WINTER: (As Alex Dunphy) So wait, you live with Barbra Streisand?\n\nLIOTTA: (As himself) You got the map. She lived here for about two months 15 years ago.\n\nFERGUSON: (As Mitchell Pritchett) Oh.\n\nLIOTTA: (As himself) You'd think the bastards would update these things to reflect the current movie star owners.\n\nFERGUSON: (As Mitchell Pritchett) Thank you. Come on, kids. We're very sorry to have bothered you.\n\nLIOTTA: (As himself) No, no, no, no. I don't want you to leave empty-handed. Come on in for a selfie.\n\nFERGUSON: (As Mitchell Pritchett) Oh, all right.\n\nLIOTTA: (As himself) Here.\n\nFERGUSON: (As Mitchell Pritchett) OK.\n\nLIOTTA: (As himself) When you see my movies later, you're going to realize that this is a special moment. Come on. And... Cheese.\n\nFERGUSON: (As Mitchell Pritchett) Cheese.\n\nLIOTTA: (As himself) See, that's an old actor's trick for a perfect smile.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) That's Ray Liotta guest-starring on an episode of Modern Family. That's really funny. So...\n\nLIOTTA: As far as what you were saying to begin with, in terms of kids knowing or not knowing, I do have kids that age coming up to me - mostly young boys. From their fathers - the fathers passed along music and books or whatever that affected them when they were younger. You know, a lot of times you pass it on to your kid. So they'd pass on Field Of Dreams to their sons who played baseball. And some of the fathers that, you know, show their young sons - like, I've had 13-year-old kids come up to me and say, oh, my gosh, you were so good in Goodfellas. And I'm thinking, oh, my gosh, what kind of parents do they have? That's a little too young to see that one.\n\nDAVIES: Ray Liotta speaking to Terry Gross in January. He plays a corrupt police detective in the NBC series Shades of Blue, which is now shooting its second season. After a take short break, he'll talk about his college years when he was a jock performing in musicals and about getting started on the soap opera Another World. I'm Dave Davies. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies back with the interview Terry Gross recorded with Ray Liotta. He stars with Jennifer Lopez as corrupt police detectives in the new NBC series Shades Of Blue. He starred in Martin Scorsese's 1990 film, Goodfellas with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. When we left off, he told Terry that he's met 13-year-old kids who told him, to his surprise, that they've seen the film.\n\nGROSS: I wonder if it's, like, a rite of passage, like an initiation thing into manhood, where fathers sit down their sons and go, son, you're old enough now to see Goodfellas. It's a great film.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nLIOTTA: It could be. I don't know. All I can say is my career has been up and down. And I like it much better being up. And when it's up, part of that is people coming up to you and saying things. I remember when I first started - like, I'm an actor. I don't want that sort of thing. All - I just wanted - it's all about the work. And that's just a bunch of B.S.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: You want people to watch what you're doing. What's the point? There's a personal side to me of challenges as an actor that I like to take on myself. And I do certain things that, maybe, nobody else knows why I'm doing. But it's all - it all has to do with - to grow as an actor. I really believe that you never stop learning. And you never really ever get there. Just like in life, the older you get - you don't arrive at - it's all right, I'm 60 now. I've arrived. It's not true.\n\nIt just keeps going. You're always - you're constantly learning things if you're the type of person who stays open and current. My dad, who - God bless him - just passed away at 98 - he was hip to everything because he read, 'cause he would watch TV. He wasn't - he wasn't closed down about anything. And he passed that on to me - or the way to talk to people. You can have a conversation with anybody. He kind of passed that on to me. He didn't pass music onto me 'cause I couldn't stand - the ironic thing is I once played Frank Sinatra. And I remember my parents listening to that. And I said, oh, my God, who is this guy? Turn this off.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: And then I end up playing him. And now I can't - you know, now if he's on - you know, I listen to the Frank Sinatra station the majority of the time.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, I listen to that a lot, too. And I, too, didn't like that music when my parents listened to it all the time.\n\nLIOTTA: Yep, yep.\n\nGROSS: But yeah, you played Sinatra in The Rat Pack, the HBO movie, in which Don Cheadle was Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah, he was great.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Joe Mantegna was Dean Martin. And you had to play Sinatra. That's not easy. (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: I turned it down a bunch of times. I wouldn't do it. I was first asked to play him by Tina Sinatra or Nancy - one of the Sinatra - his daughters back when they did movie of the weeks. And they were doing a movie of the week of it. And I turned it down because I just didn't want to do it at that time in my career. Then it came along.\n\nAnd it was during this down period of - for me. And they asked me - it was HBO. Rob Cohen directed it. And he called and asked if I would play it. And I said no - no thanks, I don't want to take on playing somebody that so many people knew - that I just felt the judgment would be too much.\n\nAnd I was down in my career. So to take on something if it didn't work - maybe it would make things worse. And then I said, wait a second. The whole point of me doing this is to take on challenges, to keep growing as an actor and not really caring - one of the biggest downfalls for any actor is fear of judgment. And so if you start acting and you start thinking about and worrying about what other people are going to say about it, you'll never really fully commit to who it is and what it is that you're playing.\n\nGROSS: So what makes people think of you when they think of Sinatra?\n\nLIOTTA: Who knows? Maybe my - I got light eyes. I'm from New Jersey, and I curse a lot. (Laughter) I don't know.\n\nGROSS: Bingo, right?\n\nLIOTTA: I don't know (laughter).\n\nGROSS: Did you sing before?\n\nLIOTTA: I started out - (laughter) - I started out - I never, ever wanted to be an actor. It came time to go to college. My dad said, go wherever you want. Take whatever you want. He just really believed in getting out and being exposed to different things. And maybe it would help you decide what to do with your life. I applied. I got into the University of Miami. This was 1973. And at that time, basically, all you needed was a pulse to get in there.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: I got into the University of Miami. I had no idea what it was that I wanted to do. So I just went - I was just going to take liberal arts. I got to the head of the line, and they said, because you don't know what it is, what you want to do, you're going to have to take math and history. I said, oh, my gosh, there's no way. I don't even want to be in college. I'm not going to take any math and history. Right next to the line that I was in was for the drama department. I said, oh, my gosh. That's it. I'll be a drama major.\n\nWell, it's a typical actor's story. I'm in line now to be a drama major because I think that's the easiest way to get by this year. And there was a really pretty girl. And she said, you auditioning for the play tonight? I said, no. And she just berated me. Oh, my gosh, how could you not want to do the play? You got to do the play. It's all about doing plays. What kind of actor doesn't want to do a play? So I went, and I auditioned for the play. And it was for Cabaret.\n\nSo then you had to sing and dance. I said, how am I going to sing and dance? I'm a jock from New Jersey.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: What the fff (ph). So she helped me out. I had seen Pippin. My parents took me to see a Broadway show, and it was Pippin. And there was one song in there, Magic To Do, that I really liked. I got up there, and all I could remember is the refrain, we've got magic to do. We got - I'm just doing the magic to do. And I don't know how old you are, but there used to be a group called Freddie and the Dreamers.\n\nGROSS: I remember. I'm telling you now (laughter)...\n\nLIOTTA: There was a dance. There was a dance called the Freddie. So I started doing the Freddie as my dance...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: ...'Cause they're saying, you're supposed to be singing. You're supposed to be dancing as you're singing. So I just did the refrain, and I did the Freddie. And I got into it. And the first year, all I did were musicals. I was in the chorus for my whole freshman year. But there was an acting teacher there named Robert Buckets Lowery. And he was great. They called him Buckets because he used to play basketball. Me being a jock from New Jersey, like - 'cause when you first get into drama class and, you know, kids who - they're just different people in a lot of different ways.\n\nAnd they - it wouldn't be the people that I would normally hang out with. And I didn't care what they thought 'cause here I am thinking, I'm just going to be here for one year. It doesn't matter. So for some reason, I just really committed and listened to what Bucket said. And thank God he was an acting teacher who was - it was kind of the Stanislavski, you know, the Russian director and acting teacher. I just listened to what he said and kind of understood and just learned.\n\nAnd if it wasn't for Buckets, I probably would've left. But I came back the next year. And I ended up going the whole four years. But during those four years, I graduated to doing Riff in West Side Story and just different musicals. So to answer your question, yes, I had sang before.\n\nGROSS: Well, I'm just going to savor the image of you doing the Freddie while singing (laughter) a song from Pippin.\n\nLIOTTA: I did. You know, I told that story...\n\nGROSS: The Freddie was just, like, the goofiest dance ever. Yeah.\n\nLIOTTA: It was crazy. See, now, I've said that before. And I've done that on talk shows. And you're the only person who I've ever talked to who remembers the Freddie.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, it's kind of like you - say your arms are at your side. You move them up parallel to the ground.\n\nLIOTTA: You go up and down (laughter) - probably with your feet.\n\nGROSS: And then, like, kick your arm - kick your leg to the left and kick your leg to the right. It's almost like a calisthenic exercise.\n\nLIOTTA: Exactly.\n\nGROSS: It's the silliest - it was the novelty record with a novelty dance. (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: Yep.\n\nGROSS: Totally silly.\n\nLIOTTA: Yep.\n\nGROSS: Love it. OK.\n\nLIOTTA: (Laughter).\n\nDAVIES: Actor Ray Liotta speaking with Terry Gross. Their conversation continues after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview Terry Gross recorded with actor Ray Liotta. It's part of our end-of-summer series of favorite recent interviews.\n\nGROSS: You started your career in a soap opera, Another World, which was one of the really, really big soaps. And we have a short clip we're going to play from that.\n\nLIOTTA: No (laughter).\n\nGROSS: OK. And I'll confess this is from the internet. I haven't seen the whole episode. I can't really set it up too well, except to say that you play Joe Perrini.\n\nLIOTTA: Joey Perrini, yep --\n\nGROSS: Yeah, and you were on the soap opera, I think, from '78 to '81?\n\nLIOTTA: That sounds about right, yep.\n\nGROSS: And you've just come back to town, you're talking to your ex-brother-in-law about your failed marriage to this guy's sister. And you speak first.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ANOTHER WORLD)\n\nLIOTTA: (As Joey Perrini) Let me ask you something.\n\nTONY CUMMINGS: (As Rick Halloway) Go ahead.\n\nLIOTTA: (As Joey Perrini) How's Kit?\n\nCUMMINGS: (As Rick Halloway) I thought you didn't want talk about...\n\nLIOTTA: (As Joey Perrini) I don't want to talk about it. I'm just wondering.\n\nCUMMINGS: (As Rick Halloway) Why don't you call her - find out how she's doing for yourself?\n\nLIOTTA: (As Joey Perrini) Look, we got an annulment, right? That means, like, the marriage never happened, right? - never existed.\n\nCUMMINGS: (As Rick Halloway) But it did exist. And your loving each other and caring about each other existed, too.\n\nLIOTTA: (As Joey Perrini) All right. What about all the craziness, you know, about me being married to an heiress, our fights over money or how to live? You know, if I want to annul that, I have to annul all the good times, too.\n\nCUMMINGS: (As Rick Halloway) I disagree.\n\nLIOTTA: (As Joey Perrini) Look, the girl I married was named Kit Farrell, right? She never existed, so everything that we did just didn't really happen. I'm not mad about it or anything else. That's just the way I want things. That's all.\n\nGROSS: OK, so that is so soap opera. You were married to an heiress who wasn't really an heiress.\n\nLIOTTA: Well, yes. But what happened was the love of my life, Eileen (ph), died after I gave her a Saint Christopher medal up on a rock under the moon. I'll never forget the line I proposed to her -with the moon and the stars as my witness, I pledge my love to you. So that's what - but she died. I went up to where I proposed to her. It was winter. I slipped, fell (laughter).\n\nGROSS: Oh, really?\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah, my mouth was open really wide, laughing...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: ...Now that you brought that up.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: And I ended up in the hospital.\n\nGROSS: Oh no.\n\nLIOTTA: I've been taken care - for weeks, I'm being taken care of by this nurse. Well, like I just say, this nurse - I end up falling for her. And I end up marrying her but then eventually find out that she was the richest woman in America. And she said that she had a different name than what it is that she had. So me being - I was playing the nicest guy in the world, Joey Perrini. That's why, again, these tough guys in Something Wild and all this stuff is kind of funny because in the soap I was really principled and religious. And because she lied to me, I got an annulment. And who wouldn't?\n\nGROSS: So was she really wealthy or was she faking it?\n\nLIOTTA: No, man, she had cash.\n\nGROSS: She had really - OK (laughter).\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah, so I ended up realizing - coming to my senses and realized that I loved her. And we got back together. And one of our last scenes is - we go off skiing to Switzerland. And that was it. That's when I quit the show.\n\nGROSS: So if you don't mind my asking - I know your father died recently. And I'm very sorry about that.\n\nLIOTTA: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: I know you were adopted at the age of about six months. How important to you was it to find out who your birth parents were, or at least who your birth mother was? Was that an issue for you? Did you pursue that, and did that affect your life?\n\nLIOTTA: No. I used to use it a lot - being adopted - especially when you're going out with a girl or looking to find out a girl. I'd say, hey, how you doing. In the first five minutes, I'd somehow get in that I was adopted because I always looked at it as being given up. I never looked at it as being wanted. I couldn't get past being given up. And then I met a girl, got married, wanted to have a kid. But she thought it was extremely important - because I was born in the '50s, and they didn't give you any information about health or anything. They had very, very limited information that they had to legally give you. So...\n\nGROSS: About your birth mother?\n\nLIOTTA: Right. And at that time, on all the Oprah shows and Maury - and this was 17 years ago - a lot of the shows were about locating friends, family, mothers, fathers - every show was about that.\n\nGROSS: Because records were starting to be opened about that.\n\nLIOTTA: I don't know. It just made good television, I guess. I don't know. I have no idea why they all started doing it, but they did. And at the end of it was this guy's name. It was Troy - I don't remember the - his name. But Michelle, my ex-wife, called him, said who I was, and people - by then, I was well-known. You know, I was making movies. And he found my birth mother within a day. And he called her and asked - God, this - I think I'm going to get emotional. I don't know how much I can really talk about this. This is very odd. Anyhow, we found her. And I met them. And it was a trip. I've told this story before. And they got mad at me for telling it because I told it on\n\nDavid Letterman. So it's a very weird, wild story. I found out I had four birth half-sisters, a half-brother and a full sister - things I didn't know. And I'm 44 years old, so I didn't know any of this stuff.\n\nGROSS: You were 44 then, yeah.\n\nLIOTTA: Yeah. And also, all this information came to me.\n\nGROSS: So if it was a big issue in your mind, emotionally, that you were given up - that you were given up for adoption - and if that hung over you for a lot of your life, and you felt rejected as a result, did you ever have a long talk with your parents about adopting you? Or was it like they told you you were adopted, you knew you were adopted, and then you just didn't talk about it?\n\nLIOTTA: That's it - didn't talk about it at all. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure they told me - I did - for show-and-tell in kindergarten, I told people the story that I was adopted. It never came up. It never really bothered me. I mean, the only time it would bother me with my parents is - on Saturdays, they used to make us clean - you know, clean the house and vacuum and do chores. And I would never forget saying, the only reason why you adopted us was to do all this work. So it never really bothered me and I never really thought about it that much.\n\nGROSS: Well, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. It's really been terrific to talk with you.\n\nLIOTTA: Thanks.\n\nDAVIES: Ray Liotta speaking with Terry Gross. His NBC cop series, Shades of Blue, also starring Jennifer Lopez, is now shooting its second season, which will be released early next year. Liotta's breakout role as a tough guy was in the 1986 Jonathan Demme movie Something Wild. From the soundtrack, this is David Byrne and Celia Cruz.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, LOCO DE AMOR)\n\nDAVID BYRNE: There's an island in a bay. Loco de amor. She's got most peculiar ways. Crazy for love. Otocume yande. Otocume yande. Like a pizza in the rain. Loco de amor. No one wants to take you home. But I love you just the same. My wild thing. Hey, hey, my wild thing. My little wild thing. Hey, hey, my wild thing. Hey, hey, hey. Yen yere cumbe. Yen yere cumbe. Loco de amor. Loco de amor. Yen yere cumbe. Yen yere, yen yere, yen yere, yen yere, yen yere cumbe. Wild thing, my little wild thing. Hey, my wild thing.\n\nDAVIES: Coming up, our rock historian Ed Ward tells us about a one-hit wonder who should've had more than one hit.

ASHLEY M. JONES: I think in an interview once I said, well, we'll hose you down with the water where somebody else will just poison you with it. And, I mean, that's basically what it is.\n\nGENE DEMBY, HOST:\n\nAnd so much of your poetry seems to be engaging with the past, right? You're contextualizing the past, reimagining it. Your book wrestles with, you know, Sally Hemings. There's Horace King, who was a black architect and politician who built Alabama in a lot of ways. There's George Wallace, obviously, the segregationist governor. Do you feel like you're doing the work of a historian in your poetry?\n\nJONES: So I don't feel that my work with history is separate at all from my work as a poet or really just as a human being. I think that we all carry histories with us. There are so many histories that have made me possible. So I can't be from Alabama and not know and tell that story of George Wallace. I can't be a black woman and not tell the story of Sally Hemings. It's always with me all the time, and it makes me who I am. And as a poet, that's my job, to tell the story of humans. And so I have to, of course, have history in there all the time.\n\nSHEREEN MARISOL MERAJI, HOST:\n\nDo you hear from people that bringing up history all the time stops you from getting past it?\n\nJONES: I've heard that before, and that doesn't make sense to me because we have to remember what happened and what is happening in order for it not to happen anymore. And I'm a teacher, too, so of course I want us to learn and relearn and relearn forever. We can't leave history as history. It's part of the present as well.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: I mean, I feel like that's the perfect segue...\n\nJONES: OK.\n\nMERAJI: ...Into the poem that you're going to read for all of us that's going to close out this Ask A Poet segment.\n\nJONES: Viewing A KKK Uniform At The Civil Rights Institute. All you can really tell at first is that it was starched. Some Betty Sue, Marge, Jane, some proper girl with a great black iron made those corners sharp. The hood, white and ablaze with creases, body flat and open for husband, brother, son. Behind the glass it seems frozen, waiting for summer night to melt it into action, for the clean white flame of God to awaken its limbs. In front of it you are dwarfed. You imagine a pair of pupils behind the empty holes of the mask. Behind the stiff cotton, would the eyes squint to see through small white slits, or would they open wide as a burning house to hunt you down until you pooled like old rope before them?\n\nThank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDEMBY: Ladies and gentlemen, Ashley M. Jones.\n\nMERAJI: You can check out Ashley's work online at ashleymichellejones.wordpress.com. Ashley's newest book is called Dark//Thing, and it's going to be out in February.\n\nNow we'd like to introduce our next guest for the evening. He grew up here. He graduated from Shades Valley High School.\n\nDEMBY: Go Mounties.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDEMBY: Go Mounties. I don't know what that means. Go Mounties.\n\nMERAJI: Go Mounties.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: Back in the day, he bagged groceries at Western Market in Crestwood. And he's a graduate of Samford University's Cumberland School of Law. He's worked for the city throughout his entire career.\n\nDEMBY: He's all B-ham everything. B-ham, right? B-ham.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDEMBY: Just last year, he was sworn in as the 30th mayor of Birmingham, becoming the youngest person to hold that position in 120 years.\n\nMERAJI: Ladies and gentlemen, Mayor Randall Woodfin.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMERAJI: So what do you want people to call you? Mr...\n\nRANDALL WOODFIN: Randall's fine.\n\nDEMBY: Randall.\n\nMERAJI: Randall.\n\nDEMBY: Oh, Randall? OK. Cool.\n\nMERAJI: When people come here and they are new to your city, what's the one thing you say they have to go see or do before they leave?\n\nWOODFIN: That is - it's tough to answer that for one thing. So if a person is an outdoors person, I recommend Ruffner Park...\n\nMERAJI: OK.\n\nWOODFIN: ...Or Red Mountain Park.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODFIN: If it's history and culture, I recommend the Civil Rights Museum, 16th Street Baptist Church.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWOODFIN: And, of course, food always comes up.\n\nMERAJI: Mmm hmm.\n\nDEMBY: Of course.\n\nWOODFIN: And you cannot just give one answer because we have an infinite amount of restaurants to choose from.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: Oh, very diplomatic. Very diplomatic.\n\nDEMBY: That's very diplomatic. It's a politician answer, man...\n\nMERAJI: Before he was mayor, he would've said one particular answer.\n\nWOODFIN: I have my favorite.\n\nMERAJI: Oh.\n\nDEMBY: OK.\n\nWOODFIN: And it's Yo' Mama's.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDEMBY: Is that a place?\n\nWOODFIN: It is a place.\n\nDEMBY: Is that a place? Are you actually...\n\nWOODFIN: It's not my actual...\n\nDEMBY: OK.\n\nWOODFIN: ...It's not my actual mom's house...\n\nDEMBY: I thought you were going to say, like - we going to have to scrap on the stage. What we doing? What we doing?\n\nWOODFIN: It's not my mother's house.\n\nDEMBY: OK.\n\nWOODFIN: It's a actual restaurant.\n\nMERAJI: What if you like to go out, and you want to listen to music or go to a club or...\n\nDEMBY: Where does Mayor Randall Woodfin turn up?\n\nMERAJI: Yes.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWOODFIN: Let's just say last Tuesday, I had a drink at the Platinum. How about that?\n\nDEMBY: I'm going to ask you a very politically-charged question here. Auburn or Alabama?\n\nWOODFIN: Roll tide.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDEMBY: One thing we actually didn't mention when we intro'd (ph) you is that you went to Morehouse...\n\nWOODFIN: Right.\n\nDEMBY: ...One of the most prestigious historically black colleges in the United States. You've been on record saying as a - at Morehouse, student government is like varsity sports. You would've had the student government.\n\nWOODFIN: That's correct.\n\nDEMBY: How is running student government at Morehouse different from running, you know, a city?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDEMBY: And, also, who is better dressed - the dudes at Morehouse or the City Council of Birmingham?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWOODFIN: Two worlds. I would say what's similar is people have high demands and high requests and a lot of issues and concerns for whatever level you represent people. They come directly to you. They want you to fix something, solve something, address something. So that's similar, but different in this - in the fact that this is the largest city in the state of Alabama. So there are many and multiple issues that I am tasked with and responsible for addressing. I want to address - hopefully, my city councilors don't get mad. But I will definitely say my brothers at Morehouse.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: Before you were mayor, you worked in the city attorney's office...\n\nWOODFIN: Correct.\n\nMERAJI: ...For almost a decade. You were also president of the school board. Is that correct?\n\nWOODFIN: Right. Yes.\n\nMERAJI: And on our show - on CODE SWITCH - we talk a lot about racial inequities in public education as well as the justice system. And I was just wondering - in those roles that you had before mayor, could you, in your own way, address those inequities?\n\nWOODFIN: Definitely as a lawyer for the city of Birmingham. Consider it this way. The frame is 10 out of 10 people who saw me did not want to see me.\n\nDEMBY: Right because you were a prosecutor.\n\nWOODFIN: Yeah.\n\nDEMBY: Right...\n\nWOODFIN: No one wants to interact with the court system. No one wants to be a victim, a defendant. I don't even think the defense lawyers want to be there for real. But in my position, I have - I had a choice. I also had discretion. And it's easy - I've seen it - for people to be abusive in that position. But, for me, it was all about how to help people, how to bring issues to a resolve, how to heal victims but, believe it or not, how to help defendants as well.\n\nAnd I can tell you how I know it worked. The people would see me in the street and says, hey, thank you so much. You remember me? You represented me. In my head, I'm like, actually, no, I didn't. I was your prosecutor. But it's how you treat people. And so in how - in treating people right, I think you can find a way to close some issues that are systemwide but, at the same time, help that individual.\n\nDEMBY: So as part of your platform, you said you wanted to pay special attention to all 99 neighborhoods in Birmingham...\n\nWOODFIN: That's right.\n\nDEMBY: Pop quiz. Name all 99 neighborhoods. You got 60 seconds.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDEMBY: No, I'm playing.\n\nWOODFIN: That's a good pop quiz, though.\n\nDEMBY: I mean, can you do it?\n\nWOODFIN: No.\n\nDEMBY: Oh, OK. All right. I was going to say...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDEMBY: And for real, in the past, you've talked about the importance of revitalizing areas of Birmingham. In cities all across the country, there's this tension between revitalization and gentrification in sort of building these communities up and displacing the people that were there. And I'm curious to how - Birmingham and how you're thinking about that tension and resolving that.\n\nWOODFIN: I've been paying attention to other cities. In 2018, you can't call D.C. Chocolate City anymore. Hot Atlanta. We've seen the changes there. And then, you see it even in a city like Austin. I think for Birmingham, watching other cities - what can we do? A city made up of 99 neighborhoods, where 88 of them are all black, 11 are majority white.\n\nDEMBY: Eighty-eight are black?\n\nWOODFIN: Mmm hmm.\n\nDEMBY: Eleven are white.\n\nWOODFIN: Right. Now, I think everyone here who was in Birmingham know we've seen growth in several places. You can't necessarily control gouging of rent. But what you can do is put things in place just to make sure residents have notice, longer notice. And there are other legal ways and creative ways you can create to make sure residents aren't displaced.\n\nMERAJI: Birmingham is sacred ground.\n\nWOODFIN: It is.\n\nMERAJI: It's sacred ground because it's where black people encountered the absolute worst evils of racism and fought back and fought for a society where equality and justice for all actually mean something. And you've written that Birmingham today is really a testament to reconciliation. And I want to know - what did you mean by that? What does that mean for you?\n\nWOODFIN: When we look at the history of America, we haven't always been honest. Well, what's on paper wasn't necessarily in practice. Racism was real. It was tangible. And the difference between Birmingham and any other city in America at that time was our differences were actually wrecking on the world stage. So everyone saw it. They saw the brutality. They saw the racism. They saw the bigotry. They saw the evil. They saw it. At the exact same time, they saw the Fred Shuttlesworths of our world, the Martin Luther King Jrs. of our world, others fight back. And in that reckoning, we were able to get some - a lot of wins out of that for black people.\n\nI think, in 2018, when I fast forward and there have been so many stories - when you think about the four little girls, there was a fifth girl that survived, Sarah. And when I think about her, she is the definition of reconciliation, where she spoke recently - there was a re-enactment of the Children's Crusade, the march. And she spoke in front of an audience, but the majority of the room was full of children. And she spoke of forgiveness and forgiving to what happened to her, what happened to her sister, what happened to her friends. And I think if I had a tangible example to give of just what reconciliation means, she embodies that.\n\nMERAJI: But earlier you talked about how, you know, 88 of the 99 neighborhoods here are black and 11 are white.\n\nWOODFIN: Right.\n\nMERAJI: So segregation is still a thing in Birmingham. The poverty rate here is twice the amount of the national poverty rate. And that's in a city that's three-fourths black. Do you think that that says something else about reconciliation that's not so pretty?\n\nWOODFIN: You're right. There's a massive amount of, not just poverty, but concentrated poverty in the city of Birmingham. When we think about everything in the '50s and '60s around - the intentionality around housing, housing discrimination, it wasn't just at the local level. It actually started at the federal level. And it was at the state level as well. And those policies were enacted at the local level. And then, when there was a final breakthrough in the late '60s, we all know white flight took place. The National Realtors Association talked about how when that happened across the entire city of Birmingham - and other cities in America, too - property value went down. Suburban - more suburban America came online. That includes the fragmentation of Jefferson County, more - expanding of other municipalities in - suburban municipalities outside of the city.\n\nYou fast forward to today in Birmingham, and that's reflected in the makeup of a city that's probably the fifth-blackest city in America. That's how you get three-fourths. That's how you get 88 neighborhoods with 11 majority. Those 11 neighborhoods are concentrated in the south and southeastern portion of the city. And they backend one of the wealthiest cities, suburban cities in America. Mountain Brook's probably like - it's in the top 20 most richest cities in America, next to the seat city of the 7th Congressional District in Alabama, which is the third-poorest U.S. congressional district in America, right? So there's just a massive amount of inequity right here.\n\nDEMBY: Right next to each other.\n\nWOODFIN: Right? In housing, in education, in transportation and employment opportunities and on and on and on. One of the things we're doing around racial equity is we want to create an equity tool to assess equity in each department. We then as a - as an administration can be intentional about how we create more equity for the services we deliver for - make sure it touches all 99 neighborhoods, regardless of socioeconomic, regardless of race.\n\nDEMBY: So one of the things that leaders all over the country are wrestling with is - you know, the president of the United States has used some very divisive rhetoric, right? And I'm curious as to how that's played out in Birmingham. Has that sort of animated and agitated a lot of these deep-seated inequities that you're talking about, this centers of power not being evenly distributed?\n\nWOODFIN: I think it has. This trade war is real in the state of Alabama, not just Birmingham metro area, where Bibb County is next door and Tuscaloosa County's next door. And we have residents who are employees of these organizations where the auto industry - it works very well for the state of Alabama. That doesn't work either for Birmingham or for our state.\n\nMERAJI: President Trump has a zero-tolerance policy on illegal immigration. We know this. And we also know that here in Birmingham, you've gotten a little bit of criticism from the immigrants' rights community...\n\nWOODFIN: I have.\n\nMERAJI: ...Because they really want you to sign an executive order to basically put in writing that you won't use your city's resources for immigration enforcement, that you won't use your city's resources to surveil Muslim residents. Can you respond to that criticism?\n\nWOODFIN: First thing is this - is that I'm not. Like, we're not going to use our police to do anything around what I call rounding up people. We just don't believe in that. I don't believe in that as mayor. I've had a clear, direct conversation with my police chief. I've had a clear and direct conversation with my chief of our city jail. We're not in that business.\n\nMERAJI: So they're not going to ask...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: ...People their immigration status?\n\nWOODFIN: No. No. We're not going to do that. I believe in welcoming cities. That is something that we are past exploring. That is something we're going to actually do. They put a paper in my hand and said, sign it. That's not how I necessarily govern. I read it. I turned it over to my legal department. But I also turned over to my legal department welcoming cities. And when we look at both of those, I think not only protecting our immigrant community but making sure we do things beyond ICE is important.\n\nMERAJI: Welcoming cities - what do you mean by that? What's the discrepancy between the two things because you were talking about there's these two things?\n\nWOODFIN: I think sanctuary city is narrowly tailored and isolated towards don't have your police enforce certain things of rounding up and hurting people, which I agree with. We're not going to do that. But welcoming cities is more broad about, how do we help our immigrant community? And as I go to Birmingham city schools, I can tell you our immigrant community continues to grow. So it's - for me it has a broader positive impact, whereas sanctuary is don't do this. Welcoming is, this is what we're going to do.\n\nDEMBY: I want to ask a clarifying question, too. You mentioned that you've said to immigrants' rights groups that you would not enable ICE through the police force there.\n\nWOODFIN: That's correct.\n\nDEMBY: But you would not codify that?\n\nWOODFIN: They want me to codify it in signing sanctuary. I'm going to do welcoming cities.\n\nMERAJI: You have a long political career ahead of you. What's next for you?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: You going to run for governor? What's next? Because we know you're thinking ahead.\n\nWOODFIN: So...\n\nDEMBY: I just want to serve the good people of Birmingham and focus on my job...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: There we go.\n\nDEMBY: No. No. No.\n\nWOODFIN: He just answered my - he just answered for me.\n\nDEMBY: No, no, no. Just trying to get that one out of the way.\n\nWOODFIN: That's a really good answer.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWOODFIN: As far as I'm concerned, being a mayor period but then being the mayor of your hometown is probably the best political job you can ever have. I don't necessarily have to ever run for office outside of mayor again - like never.\n\nMERAJI: Are there term limits here?\n\nWOODFIN: No term limit.\n\nMERAJI: Oh.\n\nWOODFIN: But should there be term limits? Yes.\n\nMERAJI: Oh.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDEMBY: He said at CODE SWITCH that he wanted to be mayor for life.\n\nWOODFIN: No one should be in this job forever.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: This is recorded. So if you're still mayor 20 years from now...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: ...We will be playing this back to you...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: ...To remind you what you said here on CODE SWITCH.\n\nAll right. This was awesome.\n\nDEMBY: This was very dope.\n\nMERAJI: This was great.\n\nDEMBY: Thank you for coming.\n\nMERAJI: Thank you. We're going to go to our next segment, but we were wondering if you would actually stay and join us and help us answer some listener questions.\n\nWOODFIN: They're going to be harder than yours?\n\nMERAJI: Oh, yeah.\n\nDEMBY: Probably. Yeah.\n\nWOODFIN: All right. I'll do it.\n\nMERAJI: All right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nMERAJI: We're about to do a segment that people love. It's kind of like an advice segment. We call it Ask CODE SWITCH. And we have listeners write in to us with questions about race and identity in America, and we try to answer their questions.\n\nDEMBY: We get in people's business. It's fun. It's fun.\n\nMERAJI: We do get in people's business, and it's really fun.\n\nDEMBY: Our expert guest is WBHM's news director, Gigi Douban.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: So Gigi's going to be our expert guest. Mayor Woodfin is also going to say smart things.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: But before we go on, Gigi Douban is not from Birmingham, Ala.\n\nGIGI DOUBAN, BYLINE: That's right.\n\nMERAJI: She's actually from Staten Island.\n\nDOUBAN: Shaolin.\n\nDEMBY: Shaolin.\n\nDOUBAN: For the Wu-Tang Clan fans among us.\n\nDEMBY: Gigi Douban could be a Wu-Tang name.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDEMBY: It could be.\n\nMERAJI: You were supposed to be here for two years.\n\nDOUBAN: That's right.\n\nMERAJI: That was, what, 19 years ago? More than that?\n\nDOUBAN: '97. Yeah. I am one of those damn Yankees that stayed. Birmingham is just - it's just a town that does that to you. It just draws you in. It's easy to live here.\n\nDEMBY: The food is ridiculous.\n\nDOUBAN: The food is ridiculous.\n\nWOODFIN: Ridiculously good.\n\nDOUBAN: People are nice to you. In the street, people make eye contact with you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDEMBY: That does not happen in New York...\n\nDOUBAN: You know...\n\nDEMBY: ...Does not happen.\n\nDOUBAN: I mean, people wave. You know, my parents come down to visit and they're like, why is he waving at us?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: Do I know...\n\nDOUBAN: Do you know him? I don't know him. So it's just a really friendly place. It's easy. It's home.\n\nMERAJI: Yes.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: Sounds amazing.\n\nAll right. Let's get started. Our first question comes from a listener named Lisa Garaya (ph). She's 21 years old. She's Indian-American. And she grew up right here in Birmingham. She says everything she knows about how to treat people comes from growing up in Alabama, comes from her childhood here in Alabama. But things have changed for Lisa. And we're going to listen to her question.\n\nLISA GARAYA: When I came to college, I learned about various theories surrounding race such as microaggressions and power dynamics. These are words that I had obviously never heard, but I began to feel like these examples of casual racism hit a little too close to home. For example, growing up, it was a pretty normal occurrence to be asked what kind of Indian I was - red dot or feather. I thought back on how time after time my white peers made me feel uncomfortable with their comments about my racial background, except at the time they were saying it, I didn't know why I was uncomfortable. Learning about microaggressions provided clarity but also introduced a lot of anger in my life. It's frustrating. Do any other people of color who go through this epiphany feel this way? How do you decompress your past with this new outlook on it?\n\nMERAJI: So we have somebody who has some newfound information. It's making her angry and a little bit agitated. And she doesn't quite know what to do with that information. Gigi?\n\nDOUBAN: So this goes way back for me. So when I was in high school - and this was - I've got to add - this was in New York - both my parents are from Egypt. And my high school economics teacher said, so, Gigi, are you going to grow up to become a terrorist one day?\n\n(GASP)\n\nDOUBAN: Right? In the moment, it just kind of like - I don't know, it just didn't really register. And then you have that moment later where you're like - you're thinking, did that really just happen...\n\nDEMBY: ...Just happen. Did that actually happen? Yeah.\n\nDOUBAN: Did this person just say that? And that - you know, since moving here, I've gotten a lot of, what are you?\n\nDEMBY: Where are you from?\n\nDOUBAN: Where are you from? And where are you from is kind of, you know, for me, I never know what they mean, whether people mean where are you from geographically - because I might not sound like I'm from the South - or ethnically. And so I'll say, well, what do you mean? And then they have, you know, sort of, you know - oh, I meant you don't sound like you're from the South, or ethnically, I mean, what's your ancestry, what's your heritage? I feel like sometimes it is a little jab, but other times, sometimes people just might not know, right?\n\nMERAJI: So you ask a clarifying question.\n\nDOUBAN: Yeah.\n\nMERAJI: When you run into something that you feel like might be what Lisa calls a microaggression, you ask a clarifying question to figure out, all right, was that really a microaggression or was it an honest question...\n\nDOUBAN: Yeah.\n\nMERAJI: ...An open question?\n\nMayor Woodfin, Randall.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWOODFIN: Yeah. Definitely. So I would agree with her that microaggressions exists in Birmingham. But I think college is one of the best places to explore issues of race and ethnicity, et cetera because, even from Morehouse - being an all-male, all-black campus - it's one of the most diverse places I've ever been to. I spent four years there. This is the time for her, personally, to address that microaggression, but at the same time, colleges and universities across our nation - I think UAB can be a center of that to talk about this.\n\nMERAJI: That totally touches on what I was thinking.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: I'm Puerto Rican and Iranian.\n\nDEMBY: I don't know if you heard that before.\n\nMERAJI: (Laughter).\n\nDEMBY: I don't know if - has anyone heard it?\n\nMERAJI: If you listen to the CODE SWITCH podcast, they say it every episode. But it's a very confusing thing for people, and I feel like my whole life has been navigating - what are you, where are you from? - these type of questions. And it was in college when I decided I am going to learn as much as I can. And so I took a bunch of ethnic studies courses, and I really made answering these questions and dealing with these kinds of overt and maybe not so overt microaggressions - I made this my life's work. She can - Lisa, you can do this, too. You know, you can get paid to have these conversations.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: It's not all horrible if that's what you want to do. And, I mean, another thing is she talked about really caring about what Alabama taught her and what she learned here in Birmingham. So to me, that sounded like she really cares about this place, and she really cares about the people here. And I feel like if that's the case, and she really wants to maintain these friendships, if someone says something to her that feels off or feels like a microaggression, yes, ask the clarifying question, and then if she still feels like it was a microaggression, explain how to ask this question in a better way - if she feels like doing it - you know, if she wants to maintain these relationships because sometimes people say things, and they have no idea what they're saying. So yeah. If she's open to having these conversation with friends and family here in Birmingham, I would say do that.\n\nDEMBY: But I would say that, sometimes, people say those things and they're invested in not knowing what's wrong with it. You know what I mean? Like...\n\nWOODFIN: Being comfortable in their ignorance.\n\nDEMBY: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, and it's not just ignorance, right? There's, like, power behind a lot of it, right? So, I mean, I do think that there should be space for her to cut her friends off. I mean, I do think that there's so much psychic energy that comes along with trying to shepherd your friends. I mean, you can have that conversation with somebody, right? It doesn't mean they want to come along with you - right? - and see what was janky about what they asked. And so, you know, you should feel empowered. I know it is really hard in some cases. So cut people off. Their enlightenment is not your responsibility, especially when it comes at the cost of your, like, you know, psychic health, right?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: All right. Let's go to the next question.\n\nDEMBY: The second question is from a listener named Leah Abrams (ph). She's 20. She's of Middle Eastern Jewish descent. She moved to Alabama in May for a summer internship. And here's Leah's question.\n\nLEAH ABRAMS: I grew up and I spent my whole life in North Carolina, where race and identity played integral roles in my upbringing. Yet, being in Alabama, I feel like I've noticed that race and segregation are more explicitly entrenched in daily life. In particular, a friend talked about being warned from a young age not to talk to white women because of his county's violent legacy of lynching black men for even looking at white girls. I feel like I haven't met many interracial couples in my time here at all. Is it really that taboo to be in an interracial relationship in Alabama? If so, why?\n\nDEMBY: So when we got this question, we decided to do a little digging. And according to a report from the Pew Research Center, metro areas in the South are the least likely to have new marriages be between people of different races. The Birmingham Hoover Metro, in particular, was in the bottom 10 for new interracial marriages in the whole country. Only about 6 percent of newlyweds in Birmingham are interracial couples. Anybody want to guess where the No. 1 - No. 1 metro area for interracial marriages is in the United States? Just take a wild guess.\n\n(SOUND OF AUDIENCE CHATTERING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: D.C.\n\nMERAJI: D.C., I heard.\n\nDEMBY: You heard D.C.? I heard Seattle, which is crazy. Have you been to Seattle? What...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: New York.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: New York.\n\nMERAJI: New York, I heard.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Atlanta.\n\nMERAJI: Atlanta, Texas.\n\nDEMBY: Y'all are like thousands of thousands miles off. It's actually Honolulu.\n\nMERAJI: Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nDEMBY: Something like 44 percent of the new marriages in Honolulu, Hawaii, are between people of different races.\n\nMERAJI: Gigi.\n\nDOUBAN: Yeah.\n\nMERAJI: Report on the city.\n\nDOUBAN: Let's just keep in mind that Alabama was the last state to overturn its ban on interracial marriage. That was in 2000, which when you think about it, was not all that long ago.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDOUBAN: Right? So, you know, I've talked to a lot of people about this - a lot of interracial couples, and there's a lot going on. Long story short, it is not all that common, although it kind of depends on where you are. So if you are in the city Birmingham, if you are on the campus of UAB, not that big a deal, not that uncommon. But if you're in maybe Coleman County or someplace like that...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDOUBAN: ...Probably not going to find very many interracial couples.\n\nDEMBY: It was a knowing laugh.\n\nDOUBAN: So it kind of depends on where you are. I spoke with a woman who is white whose husband is from Kenya. And she told me that when they married back in the '90s here in Alabama, her grandmother said to her, I'm glad at least that your grandfather has passed away already because this would've killed him.\n\nDEMBY: Wow.\n\nDOUBAN: That's deep. But it's on the other side as well, where, you know, a lot of African-American men might still have that sort of - you know, maybe have been told by their fathers not to talk to white women, not to look at white women, not to get into relationships with white women because it's just not going to go over well. It's just not something that you do. And it wasn't that it was just inconvenient or anything like that. But, I mean, there was a point in history - and it was not all that long ago - where your life would be in danger if, you know, you were a black man pursuing a white woman.\n\nAnd so I spoke to a sociologist at UAB who studies race and culture. And she said there are a lot of young people who feel like that was 200 years ago in their minds, but in reality, we're not all that far removed from that part of history. So that still lives on in a lot of people. That said, the vast majority of people told me that, for the younger generation, it is more and more commonplace, and it's OK by them as opposed to their parents who might still be resistant to interracial relationships.\n\nMERAJI: Mayor Woodfin, there's a lot of nodding happening right here.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMERAJI: Were you discouraged from having interracial relationships growing up?\n\nDEMBY: He went to a white high school.\n\nMERAJI: Is this a conversation that happened for you?\n\nDEMBY: How did that work in high school? I mean...\n\nWOODFIN: If I reflect back when I was 15 and 16, 17 in high school, I don't think that's something that you actually did for real. Was it explicit not to do it? No. Was it something that you just - that you felt? Yes. Now, she's right. I don't know how much more I can add to what she just said. My mother is married. She's in an interracial relationship. Her husband is white. They've been married over a decade now. I think it's interesting watching my own mother, from a personal standpoint, be in an interracial relationship. I think for each generation we see, not just in Birmingham, but in the state, things have changed for each generation for the better.\n\nDEMBY: And, Gigi, I mean, this is still - like, this a lot of - this is about the segregation we see elsewhere - right? - the segregation we see in schools and elsewhere, right?\n\nDOUBAN: Yeah. I mean, pretty much all of our public spaces, you know? Kids from a young age mostly go to segregated schools, so...\n\nWOODFIN: Church.\n\nDOUBAN: ...Churches, parks, restaurants. You know, a lot of times, there's - pretty much segregated, right? So you don't have to work that hard to stay away from somebody in another race. It's almost kind of done for you in the circles that you kind of grow up in.\n\nMERAJI: Leah, this is real.\n\nWOODFIN: It is.\n\nMERAJI: You're not making things up. All right. We have one last question. It comes from a listener named Mallory Mitchell (ph). She's 26. She's black. She's originally from Alabama, and she has a question regarding Mayor Woodfin's election. Let's hear it.\n\nMALLORY MITCHELL: When you look at Alabama's largest cities - Birmingham, Montgomery, Mobile and Huntsville - they all have very different histories and demographics. Of all four, Birmingham is the one city that seems progressive enough to elect a young black man to the office of mayor. However, that looks like it might be changing. What makes Birmingham different from other large cities in the state?\n\nMERAJI: Mayor Woodfin, you've got to take this first.\n\nWOODFIN: I think one of the things that makes our city different is that we're the economic development engine of the entire state. When you think about workforce that the organizations, whatever lane they're in, whether it's health care or whether it's financial services, manufacturing, which are some of our top three industries here in our city, I think about their workforce becoming younger. So all my friends - when I moved back here 15 years ago, no one my age at 22 and 23 wanted to be in the city. They wanted to go to Atlanta. They wanted to go to Nashville. They wanted to go somewhere else.\n\nBut I think the same cohort of people now, who are 22 and 23 - they want to stay here. And so it's good to see our city be a part of the national trend of people wanting to be in the urban core in the central city. With that, that's bringing a whole new flavor of young people and new people, I think, from a governing standpoint. People want their municipal government to reflect the same thing we're seeing in the private sector. They want it to reflect the same thing they're seeing on the social scene, which is something new. And that's what our candidacy and campaign represented.\n\n(LAUGTHER)\n\nDEMBY: Now, does having a city that is as black as Birmingham is - does that just make it bluer to start with, right? Like, are you starting a little bit - you just - you have this, like, very deep Democratic base here, I imagine?\n\nWOODFIN: It does - it is a very - it's a huge Democratic base here, but that that goes for the entire city, black and white.\n\nMERAJI: Gigi, is there anything you want to add to that?\n\nDOUBAN: So, I mean, if you - just listening to him speak, he mentioned young voters so many times. And that was key, I think - not just young African-American voters but white millennial voters as well. I think - yeah. Young people were and are a big part of this city's moving to the next level.\n\nMERAJI: All right. Listen. How about this? There were over 5,000 18 to 35-year-olds who participated for the first time in a municipal election in the city of Birmingham because of what I said earlier. Like, millennials definitely want to be here.\n\nMERAJI: All right. So I want to sum this up for Mallory. She wants to know what makes Birmingham different, and what you're saying is there is more economic opportunity here, there's an economic engine that's moving. It's drawing in young people. It's also a predominantly African-American city, which makes it tend towards being more democratic and progressive, and, you know, you've got young millennials who are out exercising their right to vote. Would I have summed that up for Mallory?\n\nWOODFIN: Sounds good to me.\n\nMERAJI: Well, that's great. That was our final question. And both of you were awesome on the stage. Incredible.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: WBHM's Gigi Douban. She's the news director. She's fabulous. And Mayor Woodfin, thank you so much for doing this...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMERAJI: ...And being here for both segments. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPJ SPRAGGINS: (Playing drums).\n\nMERAJI: We thought, since we have an amazing drummer on this stage, PJ Spraggins, we'd let him take it away on the drums.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nDEMBY: All right, y'all. Before we go tonight, special thanks to WBHM for generously inviting us to Birmingham.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDEMBY: In addition to Chuck Holmes and Gigi Douban, who you met earlier, we need to give a special shoutout to Audrey Atkins for her...\n\nMERAJI: Thank you, Audrey...\n\nDEMBY: ...Logistical prowess...\n\nMERAJI: You're amazing.\n\nDEMBY: ...Her love and knowledge of Birmingham and her amazing attitude.

Russian-American Masha Gessen Sees Putin In Trump, Trouble In Future\n\nSurviving Autocracy by Masha Gessen Hardcover, 240 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nAmericans are suddenly consumed with multiple crises. Even before the outbreak of social unrest following yet another African American's death in police custody, the ravages of COVID-19 and economic free fall had disrupted the national life.\n\nAll of which means conditions are ripe for President Trump to assume more power and move closer to the status of autocratic ruler, says New Yorker writer Masha Gessen in a new book Surviving Autocracy.\n\nGessen's viewpoint may be head-spinning for many, especially those who believe today's maelstrom of disease, unemployment and racial violence represent failures by the incumbent president. Yet Gessen argues that Trump may see it all as an opportunity, not just in his pursuit of re-election, but in what Gessen believes is his longer-term concept of his own career trajectory.\n\nHe may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation, Gessen writes, a climate of more anxiety and fear of change. Gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar Hannah Arendt, author of The Origins of Totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability while at the same time dangling the promise of stability.\n\nIn uncertain times, the aspiring autocrat promises a restoration, a return to greatness — all the while reaching for more power and permanence. Gessen suggests Trump will seek to use all that has happened in his tumultuous term to achieve a breakthrough to unlimited power on the model of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFor many readers, comparing an elected American president to a Russian dictator is simply beyond the pale. But if the comparison seemed strained a week ago, it seems less so on the morning after Trump dressed down the governors of the affected states and brandished the threat of federal troops taking over their streets.\n\nGessen clearly regards Trump not only as a Putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a Putin impersonator. The author argues that Trump models himself on Putin, not because he expects to replicate Russian political culture here but because he wants America to see him the way Russia sees Putin — as someone who can return his country to the glories of an imaginary past.\n\nGessen says Putin and Trump were elected president without really wanting the job. They ran not for president but for autocrat, and they did not expect to settle for anything less. Putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. Trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say TRUMP 2024 and TRUMP 2028 and so on into the future.\n\nBorn in Moscow in 1967, Gessen has won acclaim largely for writing on this native land, including winning a National Book Award for a 2017 examination of Putin's rise and suppression of democracy. And while the Putin-Trump link has been made elsewhere, it is forged here in Gessen's own personal history.\n\nBrought to New York by immigrating parents in the early 1980s, Gessen returned to this birthplace on journalistic assignment a decade later. Gessen then spent most of the next 20 years as a writer, editor and activist in post-Soviet Russia, observing the rise of the former KGB officer who now holds that nation's highest office.\n\nGessen wrote books on a wide array of subjects, including a grandmother's struggles to survive the Nazis and the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin. Another is about the female punk band Pussy Riot, sentenced to prison for its protest songs.\n\nGessen cites an array of scholars in this, the writer's 11th book. One is Hungarian sociologist Bálint Magyar, who has described the present condition of his own country as a mafia state, ruled by a crime family in which one man distributes money and power to all other members. (Viewers of The Sopranos will understand how this model works.) Magyar also identifies three stages by which a ruler is transformed into an autocrat: the attempt, the breakthrough and the consolidation.\n\nGessen sees Trump's term so far as the autocratic attempt, his re-election as a prospective breakthrough and a second term as the green light to consolidate his power.\n\nThe first three years [of Trump's term] have shown that an autocratic attempt in the U.S. has credible chance of succeeding, Gessen writes. Worse than that, they have shown that an autocratic attempt builds logically on the structures and norms of American government; on the concentration of power in the executive branch, and on the marriage of money and politics.\n\nGessen says the institutions and traditions Americans thought would protect them have proven weak because they were not built to withstand a personality such as Trump. The author had little faith that Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would be the magic bullet that would rid Washington of Trump. Instead, Gessen writes, it drew attention away from what Trump was doing in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories.\n\nSince 2013, Gessen has been back in the U.S., writing and also teaching at Amherst College. Although Gessen's been widely published, the writer's main main outlets have been in the Big Apple — The New York Times, The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker, where Gessen has been a staff writer since 2017. Regular readers of that magazine will recognize some of Surviving Autocracy from columns in The New Yorker.\n\nGessen brings to all work a unique blend of intellect and manifold passions — for math and science, for language and politics, and for the cause of LGBTQ people in both homelands. (Gessen also identifies as nonbinary.) The writer flashes the fierce attitude and language of the partisan activist one moment, returning to the cooler mien of a public intellectual the next.\n\nGessen is particularly sensitive to issues of linguistics and the subtle shifts of wording that can mean so much — noting how the words immigrant and refugee (both relatively sympathetic terms for most Americans) have been systematically replaced by such terms as migrant or invasion.\n\nGessen is also exercised about the change Trump has wrought in the perception of reality. In a chapter titled The Power Lie, Gessen explains the difference between an ordinary lie that may collapse in the face of facts and the Trumpian lie.\n\nThe latter is the power lie, or the bully lie ... the lie of the bigger kid who took your hat and is wearing it — while denying that he took it. There is no defense against this lie because the point of the lie is to assert power, to show 'I can say what I want when I want to.' \n\nThe media generally assist in this, Gessen argues, even when serious news organizations fact-check the president, by presenting two notions of reality side by side and inviting the audience to decide. Right there, the president has won, Gessen says. The lie has been given equal standing with verifiable facts, and the concept of truth has been devalued.\n\nGessen objects repeatedly to the reluctance of legacy newspapers and broadcasters (including NPR) to call the president a liar (or for that matter, a racist). Even when pointing out the inaccuracies and falsehoods the president peddles, traditional journalists balk at terms such as lie and liar. In part, the idea is to keep the door as wide open as possible to attract and retain as wide an audience as possible. Gessen understands this reasoning but says it allows the liar or the racist to persist and normalizes such behavior until it appears less objectionable — or simply not objectionable at all.\n\nBut getting back to the word surviving and its implicit promise in the title, Gessen gives us this:\n\nRecovery from Trumpism — a process that will be necessary whenever Trumpism ends — will not be a process of returning to government as it used to be, a fictional state of pre-Trump normalcy. Recovery will be possible only as reinvention: of institutions, of what politics means to us, and of what it means to be a democracy, if that is indeed what we choose to be.\n\nAt this point, of course, one must wonder who Gessen means by we. One impression easily taken from Surviving Autocracy is that Trump has been visited on Americans by some mysterious force or personal magic. There is a lack of focus on the manner by which Trump, as opposed to Putin, came to office.\n\nGessen's perceptions about Russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of Americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). But by the same token, average Americans might well ask how much Gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most Americans.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Gessen volunteered an empathetic reference to those Trump has called the forgotten man and the forgotten woman, the middle-aged and older members of the middle class who felt less at home in their own country in recent decades.\n\nWhat if Gessen had spent more time in the country these people feel they have lost? It would not likely change Gessen's mind about Trump. But it might alter the writer's perspective on Trumpism. It might help translate a deep empathy for the plight of ordinary Russians and relate it to the fears and frustrations of their American counterparts — the millions who voted for Trump and now accept his authoritarian tendencies as being in their own interest.
Who's Bill This Time\n\nBill Kurtis reads three quotes from the week's news...You're Fired!, Return of the Mac, Real Women Have Curvy Bottles\n\nBILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. U-tah (ph), me-Bill (ph).\n\n(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)\n\nKURTIS: I am Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Abravanel Hall in Salt Lake City, Utah, Peter Sagal.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\n\nThank you, Bill. Thank you, everybody. It is great to be back in Salt Lack City. Salt Lake, of course, is a beautiful city surrounded by mountains. Later on, we're going to be talking to somebody who specializes in descending those mountains rather quickly, Olympic gold medalist Hannah Kearney. But first, we want to congratulate our friend Terry Gross and her staff on this week's 30th anniversary of the show Fresh Air. It is an awesome thing.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: Every week, we at WAIT WAIT try to rise to her level of skill, grace, honesty and professionalism, and then we shrug and say nah (ph), let's just stick to our fart jokes. I mean, she does her thing, we'll do ours.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Another difference - you do not have to write a brilliant novel to get on our show, just give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAITWAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. Now, let's welcome our first listener contestant. Hi, you are on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.\n\nLANDON GROVE: Hi. This is Landon Grove from Smithsburg, Md.\n\nSAGAL: Landon Grove in Smithsburg, Md.\n\nGROVE: That's right.\n\nSAGAL: How do I know it's not Smith Burg from Landon Grove? So where is Smithburg, Md.?\n\nGROVE: It's in Western Maryland. It's a little small town. And we just got a second gas station, so we are rapidly...\n\nSAGAL: Oh, congratulations. Well, Landon, welcome to our show. Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First up, it's a comedian performing this upcoming week - May 15 to the 21 - at the Brad Garrett Comedy Club at the MGM Las Vegas. It's Alonzo Bodden.\n\nALONZO BODDEN: Hello, Landon.\n\nSAGAL: Next, it is the author of the book How To Make White People Laugh and the host of the podcast Fake The Nation. It's Negin Farsad.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: And finally, a correspondent for CBS Sunday Morning and host of The Henry Ford Innovation Nation Saturday mornings on CBS. It's Mo Rocca.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMO ROCCA: Hi, Landon.\n\nSAGAL: Landon, welcome to the show. You're going to play Who's Bill This Time. Bill Kurtis is going to perform for you three quotations from the week's news. Your job - correctly identify or explain just two of them. Do that, you will win our prize, the voice of scorekeeper emeritus Carl Kasell to do whatever you will with. Are you ready to play?\n\nGROVE: I'm ready.\n\nSAGAL: All right. Your first quote is from naturally, inevitably, the president of the United States.\n\nKURTIS: Look. He's a showboat. He's a grandstander. You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: So who did our modest, thoughtful president fire for being a, quote, showboat?\n\nGROVE: I think President Trump said James Comey, you're fired.\n\nSAGAL: Oh, whoa.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nROCCA: You already won the game.\n\nSAGAL: Yeah.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: That was scary good. On Tuesday afternoon, the president fired James Comey, the head of the FBI. He did this, the White House said, because Mr. Comey had treated Hillary Clinton so unfairly. And if there's one thing we know about Donald Trump, when there's a woman being mistreated, he won't be far away.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: But on Thursday of this week, we heard that the president had really fired Comey because he didn't like him, and he thought that he was making too much noise about the Russia investigation. The White House dismissed that though because it came from a completely unreliable source - President Donald Trump.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nROCCA: Comey found out by - right - somebody was watching TV right behind us him or something, right?\n\nSAGAL: Yes. He was in an event in Los Angeles. He was speaking to the agents. And there was a TV on, and it said, you know, Comey fired. And apparently Comey thought it was a prank. You know, one of those jolly little jokes where you sneak up behind somebody with an inflated balloon and then subvert the rule of law.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBODDEN: Well, the great thing about the event, it was actually a recruiting event. So can you imagine as you're recruiting - does anyone here need a job?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBODDEN: They're kind of like, well, you do.\n\nSAGAL: Comey's like, well, we have 41 openings - oh, 42.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nNEGIN FARSAD: And can you imagine, like, Hillary Clinton having fired James Comey if she was president? People would like, oh, my God, emails, Benghazi, evil lady. She would have had to wear like a scarlet letter C on her pantsuit. There would have been like a burning at the stake. Like, it would've been a whole thing. But with Donnie, we're just like, it's kind of funny, you know?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nROCCA: He fired Gary Busey with more tact.\n\nSAGAL: He did, actually.\n\nBODDEN: Do you think it took Trump this long to fire Comey because he just found out he could?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBODDEN: The whole investigation's been going on, and it's getting closer and closer. And then somebody said something to him, he's like, wait, I can just fire him? Done.\n\nFARSAD: Eventually he'll read the entire Constitution, and then we'll really be screwed.\n\nBODDEN: No, he won't. He won't.\n\nSAGAL: Here is your next quote.\n\nKURTIS: He's so handsome, and his name sounds like my favorite dessert.\n\nSAGAL: That was a commentator on deadline.com celebrating the election of whom as president of France?\n\nGROVE: I want to say Macron.\n\nSAGAL: Well, that's good enough.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Emmanuel Macron, the new president, he's a rich businessman who has never held office before. And he ran for the presidency saying that politicians have failed the people, and it was time to return when France was great. All true. He's just like Donald Trump, except Macron can speak better English.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nROCCA: Yeah. When Macron meets with Justin Trudeau, I mean, gay Twitter is going to explode.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: This is very strange. In some way, Emmanuel Macron is President Trump's mere image. Trump is 70, the oldest American president ever. Macron is 39, the youngest French president ever. Macron, like Trump, is in a May-December marriage. Well, in Trump's case, it's more like May of the following year marriage. But in his case, Macron is the young one. Did you know this? When he was 16, he fell in love with his 40-year-old drama teacher.\n\nROCCA: Right.\n\nSAGAL: And then he was sent away by his parents, who tried to break up this forbidden romance. And he said, I will return and marry her. And he did it. And everybody's like, whoa, this kind of salacious. But it's covering up the real interesting thing, which is that a drama geek is now the president of a major Western power.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Yes.\n\nFARSAD: And his wife is a MILF, a mother I'd like to French.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Yeah.\n\nFARSAD: But the thing about Marine Le Pen, she didn't ever scare me as much as Trump, I think, because she spoke in complete sentences. And her, like, white nationalism had a certain je ne sais quoi.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nROCCA: How - I mean, not that there's anything wrong with it, but Macron's wife is how much older?\n\nSAGAL: She is...\n\nBODDEN: Like 20 years older.\n\nFARSAD: Twenty-four years.\n\nSAGAL: Twenty-four years older, which by coincidence again, is exactly the same difference in age between Donald Trump and Melania.\n\nROCCA: And Melania. So - OK.\n\nBODDEN: The difference is his wife will live with him.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Landon, we're going to leave politics behind, thankfully, if just for a second. Your last quote is a reaction to yet another failed marketing campaign this week.\n\nKURTIS: Finally, consumers without arms, legs or heads can buy a soap that truly represents them.\n\nSAGAL: That was Derek Thompson, a senior editor at The Atlantic, writing about Dove soap's decision to make their new soap bottles look like what?\n\nGROVE: A jar of margarine? I have no idea.\n\nSAGAL: No, it's OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: You've already won, so we'll just give it to you. They're making their soap bottles look like bodies.\n\nGROVE: Bodies?\n\nSAGAL: Right, different kinds of female physiques. Some companies looked at the failed Pepsi ad campaign of a few weeks ago and said, oh, thank God that wasn't us. But Dove soap said, oh, yeah? Watch this.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: So Dove this week introduced a line of soap bottles that are intended to look like different types of women's bodies.\n\nROCCA: You're going to get ripped off if you get the Kate Moss one.\n\nSAGAL: I know. There's hardly anything in it. Yes, there are some that are tall and thin. There's narrow. There's shapely. There's short and round, pear-shaped, you know. The idea is that it's soap for all types of women, but no woman basically wants to be stopped at the checkout counter and be told, you sure you don't want that fat bottle?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: If you are a man - and I know some of you are - and you're finding it hard to understand why this is so offensive to women, just imagine going into the shaving cream aisle where they have those tubes of shaving cream. And imagine that in order to represent different kinds of men, all the cans are different lengths.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBODDEN: Peter, I hate to say it, but we know men, and only one size can was going to sell.\n\nSAGAL: That's true.\n\nROCCA: Wait, what are you guys shaving?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: Bill, how did Landon do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: Landon won. Good going, Landon.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: Thank you so much for playing.\n\nGROVE: Thank you very much for having me.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, GENIE IN A BOTTLE)\n\nCHRISTINA AGUILERA: Come on.

2020 Democrats Talk Faith; Conservative Christian Leaders Respond\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP\n\nAs Democratic presidential hopefuls work to position themselves as the candidate to unify the country and win over supporters of President Trump, an influential Iowa evangelical leader is inviting them to a forum on religion and politics traditionally reserved for Republicans ahead of Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\nBob Vander Plaats, president of The Family Leader, said he's sending invitations Friday to the top seven Democratic primary candidates in current polls.\n\nA lot of them are using faith as kind of a focal point, as a centerpiece, Vander Plaats said. So we'd like to find out what makes them tick.\n\nThe invitees to the Family Leadership Summit, scheduled for July 12 near Des Moines, are California Sen. Kamala Harris; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; former Vice President Joe Biden; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. NPR reached out for comment to all seven campaigns, but most declined to respond on the record.\n\nA spokesman for Buttigieg, who was criticized by a prominent conservative Christian leader this week for being gay, said he would consider attending.\n\nIn a statement to NPR, a spokesman for O'Rourke said the former congressman would not accept the invitation. Vander Plaats and the Family Leader have unapologetically provided a forum for dangerous anti-LGBTQ hate speech on numerous occasions, Chris Evans said. They are the antithesis of the unifying, inclusive, welcoming atmosphere that our campaign prides itself on in Iowa and across the country. We will not be participating in this forum.\n\nThe event has loomed large in past Republican caucus campaigns, drawing about 3,000 voters in 2015, when then-candidate Donald Trump famously criticized the late Republican Sen. John McCain's military service at the event.\n\nIt's the first time The Family Leader has invited candidates actively seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to the event, a spokesman said. Vander Plaats acknowledged that the group – known for fighting same-sex marriage – is an unlikely venue for Democrats, but added, If you're going to cast a vision of unity, I think you need to be able to have the courage then to go to that venue ... and cast that vision.\n\nVander Plaats noted that in recent weeks, several candidates have woven their personal faith into their pitches to voters. Warren has made the case that her Christian faith helped shape her liberal political values. Harris opened her campaign by calling for unity and speaking of her faith in God during her announcement speech in January.\n\nButtigieg has spoken openly about his Episcopal faith, his sexuality and his marriage to his husband Chasten — and has sparred with conservatives including Vice President Pence.\n\nThis week, Franklin Graham, son of the late Rev. Billy Graham, questioned Buttigieg's claim to Christianity in a series of tweets, saying in part, As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized.\n\nI agree with what Franklin tweeted; my guess is the base that is gonna show up at the Family Leadership Summit is gonna agree with what Franklin tweeted, Vander Plaats said. But why run from that conversation?\n\nLarge majorities of Christians in the U.S. support same-sex marriage, though a majority of white evangelicals oppose it, according to a 2018 survey by PRRI.\n\nVander Plaats is a controversial figure, who has been regarded as a kingmaker among white evangelicals in Iowa, where the conservative Christian vote is a vital voting bloc for Republicans. During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Vander Plaats sparked criticism — including from within the Republican Party — for asking candidates for the GOP nomination to sign a marriage vow promising fidelity to one's spouse, rejection of Sharia Islam and support for robust childbearing and reproduction, among other things.\n\nAfter widespread condemnation, The Family Leader issued an apology and removed language stating that slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an African-American baby born after the election of the USA's first African-American President.\n\nVanderPlaats also has been, at times, a critic of Trump's character and rhetoric — though he has largely supported Trump's policies on issues like restricting abortion.\n\nDaniel Hoffman-Zinnel, executive director of One Iowa, an LGBTQ rights group, expressed mixed feelings about the invitation to Democratic candidates.\n\nI would be a little surprised if any of them really took him up on this offer to engage in this conversation, Hoffman-Zinnel said.\n\nBut he added that if a candidate like Buttigieg were to accept, it could open a door to important conversations.\n\nIt potentially could show the audience of The Family Leader a visible, positive representation of an out gay man who's running for the highest office in our land, he said. So maybe it could potentially change people's hearts and minds — or at least get them to think more broadly.\n\nHoffman-Zinnel added that if candidates accept the offer, Vander Plaats has a responsibility to create a very safe environment where folks feel comfortable being there.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Iowa, Hoffman-Zinnel noted, Buttigieg was met with anti-gay hecklers. At one stop, a protester dressed as Buttigieg pretended to whip a man dressed as Jesus Christ while he carried a wooden cross, while another protester dressed as the devil looked on.\n\nAfter those protests, The Family Leader said in a tweet, Shouting protests, namecalling are NOT how Christians are called to engage with our culture.\n\nVander Plaats said that it would not be our intent for candidates to face a hostile audience and that he hopes to model civil conversation, even in areas where we have deep disagreements.\n\nYou get points just for showing up, Vander Plaats said. And so I think our audience would embrace them.\n\nJenna Ellis, an evangelical attorney and adviser to Trump's 2020 campaign, said she would like to see Democrats engage in a public conversation about faith. But she doesn't think many conservative white evangelicals would be won over.\n\nTheir position is completely hypocritical to what it actually means to be a Christian, she said. If they're reaching out to evangelicals and saying, 'I am a Christian, but I support gay marriage; I am a Christian, but I support abortion,' that's being hypocritical.\n\nDespite the opposition Democrats may face in such a crowd, Christopher Hale, a faith adviser to President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said he hopes they will reach out to religious voters in surprising places.\n\nHale noted that more than 80% of white evangelicals supported Trump in 2016 — and evangelicals make up a significant share of voters in many key Midwestern states.\n\nI don't know a pathway forward for a Democratic candidate to win back the states we lost in 2016 without winning a higher percentage of the evangelical vote, Hale said.\n\nHale believes the Democratic Party has largely failed to speak the language of religious voters but says some of the 2020 candidates are making overtures.\n\nDemocratic candidates oftentimes talk about Jefferson, and Madison, and founding ideals – but we need candidates that can talk about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Hale said, referring to the first four books of the Christian New Testament. A Democrat's not going to win a majority of the evangelical vote, but you can't win 10 or 15% and expect to win this election.
When The Conversation Doesn't Include You: LGBTQ+ Sex Ed In A Small Town\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jarod Lew for NPR Jarod Lew for NPR\n\nQuinn Robinson is only 18 years old, but she has already learned some hard lessons about the world. It's scary being a trans person because I know there are people out there who just hate me for being myself, she says. There's been kids who have approached me and say, 'Hey, you should burn in hell.' \n\nRobinson is a high school senior in Allendale, Mich., a small but growing town about 30 minutes outside Grand Rapids and smack dab in the middle of what's known as the state's Bible Belt. Drive off the main road and you quickly find yourself in farm country.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jarod Lew for NPR Jarod Lew for NPR\n\nThis is where, for the past year, parents have been fighting over sex education. Specifically: any mention of LGBTQ+ identities in the school district's curriculum.\n\nEveryone's so conservative, and they're like, 'You must be this way,'  says Robinson, who has lived in Allendale almost all her life. But I don't want to be that way.\n\nWhen we met her, Robinson had long, platinum blond hair with blue tips. Since then she has dyed it a deep brown. A pink and blue transgender pride flag hangs above her bed, which is adorned with a comforter covered with giraffes and zebras.\n\nThe focal point of Robinson's room is a massive, flat-screen TV, where she spends hours each day playing video games. Her most recent obsession is a Western-themed, action-adventure game, where she can play other gamers remotely.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jarod Lew for NPR Jarod Lew for NPR\n\nI think being behind a screen when people don't see my face, it's way easier to talk to people, she explains. So I can just be this Westerner running around and no one cares — like that's just me now.\n\nBig fight in a small town\n\nThe fight began last spring, when some parents agitated to update the district's current sex ed program with something that they hoped would be more science-based and inclusive of LGBTQ+ people. (LGBTQ+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer, with the + denoting a broader inclusion of sexual and gender minorities.)\n\nThe current curriculum does not mention sexual or gender identity. But other parents pushed back hard, saying they felt it was important to keep the sex ed message focused on abstinence — saving yourself for marriage.\n\nAt the very center of this debate stood Tiffany Harp. Parents discovered that Harp, the teacher of a high school elective class called Family and Relationships, had discussed both sexual and gender identity with her students.\n\nI would explain to them how gender identity is your internal sense of what it is to be male or female. And then, for some people, their gender identity sometimes doesn't align with their biological sex, Harp says. And kids — when they asked those questions — they were like, 'Oh!' Like it made sense to them.\n\nIt did not make sense to a lot of other people. Outraged parents started showing up at public hearings to protest, forming long lines to speak in front of the school board and sex ed advisory board. At one meeting, a parent named Sylvia Rhodea stood at the podium and said, When you fundamentally discredit the very nature of God's creation of our youth as male and female, you are seeking to discredit God.\n\nOther parents agreed, insisting that the idea of gender fluidity didn't match the values of the vast majority of the town. They said discussing LGBTQ+ issues with kids could put ideas in their heads and argued that families — not schools — should be responsible for these conversations.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jarod Lew for NPR Jarod Lew for NPR\n\nThese parents formed a group called CAST — Conservatives of Allendale Stand Together. In a 29-page complaint to the school board, they accused liberals of trying to indoctrinate their kids with radical sexual ideology. They demanded that the district ban any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in sex ed — or any other class. Not only that, they also called on the superintendent to throw out a reference to queer and trans kids in the school district's anti-bullying campaign.\n\nWe believe leading our children to explore LGBTQ issues may have significant physical and mental health ramifications, the complaint reads. It goes on to say that including queer and trans kids in the anti-bullying materials may increase discrimination against students in our schools who do not agree with LGBTQ.\n\nNPR reached out to several members of CAST multiple times over a period of months, but no one from the group agreed to be interviewed. They did send a statement, though.\n\nIt is every parent's natural right to teach their OWN children what they believe in regards to sexuality, part of the statement reads. It is not the right of a minority of our community to impose their desire for comprehensive sexuality education inclusive of LGBTQ subjects to be taught to OTHER people's children.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jarod Lew for NPR Jarod Lew for NPR\n\nThis kind of struggle is playing out in communities across the country. In a recent national survey by the nonprofit GLSEN, less than 1 in 10 LGBTQ+ students said they received sex ed that was inclusive of their identities. In some places, laws expressly prohibit teachers from discussing LGBTQ+ people or topics in a positive way — in other words, promoting homosexuality. Activists commonly refer to these as no promo homo laws.\n\nDo they look at me as a bigot?\n\nThough no one from CAST agreed to be interviewed, one family who sympathizes with the group's views did agree to share its perspective. Kim and Steve VanderHelm have lived in Allendale for 21 years; they have two kids who graduated from Allendale Public Schools a few years ago. The VanderHelms still care a lot about what the district is teaching.\n\nThey recently invited us into their home on a cold night, to talk about what's been going on in town. The VanderHelms say for them, this conversation is shaped by their faith. I come from a biblical worldview, says Kim. We were just, as you guys pulled up, we were reading the Bible together as devotions. So we do not believe God created people to have these desires.\n\nThe VanderHelms say they believe that being gay or trans is a sin — a sin that a person can resist. Steve compares being homosexual to lying, overeating, lust. He says it's no different than me in my younger days looking at pornography.\n\nHe says this belief is laid out in the Bible and he is following it to the best of his ability. I try to live my best to God's word, he says. But then for somebody that doesn't believe, do they look at me as a bigot? Do they look at me as a hater?\n\nThe VanderHelms are deeply troubled by the idea that anyone in Allendale would feel hated because of their views. By the end of the conversation, Kim's brow is furrowed, and she is near tears.\n\nI want you guys to know that our belief does not mean that we hate these young kids, she says, voice quivering. Our belief is not about the fact that we think there is anything awful about them. But love does not mean that we accept certain things also.\n\nWhat's missing for Quinn Robinson\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Quinn Robinson\n\nAllendale Public Schools maintains that the sex education program it has used for a decade, called Willing to Wait, meets the requirements of Michigan law, emphasizing the benefits of abstaining from sex until marriage. The superintendent, Garth Cooper, believes that LGBTQ+ kids get the same thing from it as everybody else.\n\nIt doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is, says Cooper. The bottom line is that abstinence is the best and only proven way to keep yourself from getting a sexually transmitted infection or from getting pregnant. And so whether you're straight or trans or bi, the message is the same.\n\nIn response to this story, Willing to Wait sent a statement to NPR, which says that the program includes topics such as reproductive anatomy, STDs, healthy relationships, dating violence, consent laws, setting boundaries, refusal skills, goal setting, contraception methods including efficacy and limitations, and communicates the intrinsic value of every student without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nRobinson remembers taking Willing to Wait in eighth grade and believes the program is tone-deaf. She says it sent a message of, Don't have sex — or else. Even though it's called sex ed, she says, no one wanted to say the 'sex' word.\n\nAs Willing to Wait notes, the program does teach about contraceptives and STDs, but Robinson says all the discussion is focused on heterosexual relationships.\n\nI knew, of my own friends who were lesbians, this wasn't gonna help them at all, Robinson says. There's no way you can help a lesbian prevent STDs in this kind of format.\n\nNPR spoke with other LGBTQ+ students who agree with Robinson. Most wanted to remain anonymous because they aren't out to their parents, but they described Willing to Wait as having religious undertones and being shame-based. One student said it left her feeling dirty. Another said, The only thing we learned about gay sex was it gives you STDs and you shouldn't do it.\n\nBeyond that, Willing to Wait failed to address one issue that weighed heavily on Robinson: how gender dysphoria can make sex for a trans person really complicated — married or not.\n\nThe idea of having sex as a trans person is weird because your brain is disconnected from your physical body, she explains. So when you look at your body, you don't want this, you know? So the idea of having sex in this body is hard ... because maybe I'll just look down and see this disgusting body of mine and cry or something, you know?\n\nThis is the kind of thing Robinson wishes her sex ed program had talked about.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Pride Center\n\nHalf an hour away, though, people are having these kinds of conversations.\n\nAt the Grand Rapids Pride Center, a rowdy group of about 40 teens gathers every week, and they talk about sex, gender and relationships. They have a rotating cast of adults called facilitators, who lead discussions and pull questions out of a hot pink box.\n\nThe kids write things like, Is gender a social construct? And, For any of our facilitators with dysphoria, how does that affect your sex life? And, How does being sexually active affect you emotionally?\n\nFor most of these teens, the Pride Center is the only place they can ask these questions.\n\ntoggle caption Jarod Lew for NPR\n\nHigh-schoolers Siona Wilson and Everett Mabry met here, and they affectionately call each other besties. Wilson (whose pronouns are they/them) is a high school freshman with a shock of pink hair, who says sexuality-wise, they're questioning, and gender-wise, they're nonbinary. Mabry's a sophomore with a big smile, who is gay and cisgender. They both say that the sex ed they have gotten at the center has made them realize they used to be clueless about some of the most basic things.\n\nThere's this whole myth of, 'Oh, if you're a lesbian, honestly, just, like, go for it 'cause you can't get pregnant LOL!'  jokes Wilson. But it's not true — there's, like, risks and stuff that go into that, and I know that from going here. And like, lesbians wear condoms when they're having sex. People should know that. Lesbians should know that!\n\nMabry says he didn't know about PrEP, an HIV-prevention pill.\n\nI didn't know that HIV was technically preventable cause of, like, PrEP, he says. It's possible to have HIV but not be able to transmit it. So, when I first found out, I was like, 'Are you joking?' And I found out at the Pride Center, which is honestly shameful to the public school system.\n\nMoving on\n\nBack in Allendale, the school district has removed any mention of gender and sexual identity in school materials. It has also removed the mention of LGBTQ+ students in the anti-bullying campaign, and it has no plans to include queer and trans issues in a new sex ed program that it's working on now.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jarod Lew for NPR Jarod Lew for NPR\n\nFor her part, Robinson cannot wait to leave. She is headed to Chicago for college, where she says she hopes to finally find a community that will accept her for who she is.\n\nI just wanted them to understand that I'm a normal person, she says. I want to be treated just the same as everybody else. I want to get some job, and I want to be seen as just the register lady or something, you know what I'm sayin'? I don't wanna be looked at as 'Oh, the trans girl.' I just wanna be me.
Trump Endorses George P. Bush's Re-Election Bid For Texas Land Commissioner\n\nThe only member of the Bush political dynasty still in office is Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush. Although President Trump vanquished Bush's father, Jeb, and has criticized former presidents George H.W. and W. Bush, Trump has endorsed George P.'s re-election bid.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nTexas holds the first-in-the-nation primary next week. Voters will make choices in hundreds of races, including governor and U.S. senator. Further down the ballot, there's a race that could decide the future of one of America's political dynasties. From member station KUT in Austin, Ben Philpott reports.\n\nBEN PHILPOTT, BYLINE: Voters usually don't spend much time considering their choice for Texas Land Commissioner. The office plays several important roles, but, yeah, it's kind of the bottom of the barrel when it comes to statewide races. But the office has received plenty of attention over the last three years because there's been a Bush holding the job - yes, as in that Bush family.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nGEORGE P. BUSH: Hi, I'm Commissioner George P. Bush. The last four years of the Texas General Land Office have been the most conservative in the agency's history. Before...\n\nPHILPOTT: Grandson to president number 41, nephew to number 43 and son to Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and presidential candidate. That's a lot to live up to, but it was a mantle that, Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson says, George P. appeared ready to take up.\n\nCAL JILLSON: He was a young, vibrant, good-looking guy. So he looked like a central-casting, next-generation Bush candidate starting in Texas but with national possibilities.\n\nPHILPOTT: But this member of the fourth generation of the Bush political dynasty hasn't quite lived up to the expectations. There are questions about how well his office has handled Hurricane Harvey relief. Even worse, he's received bad press over his handling of the Alamo - you know, the one we're supposed to remember all the time. So facing an unexpectedly tough primary, George P. Bush has sought out the most coveted endorsement in Republican politics.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: President Trump said, Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.\n\nPHILPOTT: It might be a political marriage of convenience. Back when Jeb Bush was running in the Republican presidential primary, he was candidate Trump's whipping boy.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I defined him. I gave him this term, low energy. I said he's a low-energy individual. We do not need, in this country, low energy.\n\nPHILPOTT: That's Trump speaking on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2016. Trump said Jeb Bush supported illegal immigration because his wife, George P.'s mother, was born in Mexico. That didn't stop George P. from endorsing Trump after he became the Republican presidential nominee. As President Trump has rejected much of what the Bush family stood for in politics, whether it's on immigration or foreign policy, Jillson wonders whether George P. Bush can evolve in what's now Trump's party.\n\nJILLSON: And now I think people have real questions about what the upside of George P. Bush as a politician and an officeholder actually is.\n\nPHILPOTT: And a Bush loss? Well, that would have pundits across the country talking about the end of the Bush political dynasty. Still, it's a big family. For NPR News, I'm Ben Philpott in Austin.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Lawsuit Alleges Seattle Mayor Ed Murray Raped Teen 30 Years Ago\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Elaine Thompson/AP Elaine Thompson/AP\n\nSeattle Mayor Ed Murray is being sued by a man who claims Murray raped and molested him three decades ago, when the man was 15 years old.\n\nThe mayor held a brief news conference Friday to deny the allegations.\n\nTo be on the receiving end of such untrue allegations is very painful for me. It is painful for my husband and for those who are close to us, he told reporters. I understand the person making these accusations is troubled, and that makes me sad as well.\n\nThe Seattle Times has investigated this claim in depth, along with the stories of two other men who also say Murray abused them when they were young. According to the Times report, too much time has passed to file criminal charges, but the same is not true for a civil suit.\n\nEarlier in the week, the mayor's spokesman said the suit was politically motivated. It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline, Jeff Reading said in a statement reported by The Associated Press.\n\nMurray, 61, is a progressive mayor, and has been serving in that role since 2014. He had previously served in the state legislature for 18 years, where he led a long campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington. As mayor, he pushed through a measure to raise Seattle's minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nThings have never come easy to me in life but I have never backed down and I will not back down now, Murray said in his news conference. I will continue to be mayor of this city. I will continue to run for re-election.\n\nHe declined to take questions, saying this is now a matter for the courts to resolve.
Before North Carolina, There Were Other Contentious 'Bathroom Bill' Fights\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sara D. Davis/Getty Images Sara D. Davis/Getty Images\n\nThe debate over bathrooms and who should use them picked up steam after North Carolina's recent law requiring people to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. But the debate started years before North Carolina took it up.\n\nOne of the first battles was in New Hampshire in 2009 and started out as, a really very simple extension of nondiscrimination protection to a class that isn't covered and needs to be covered, said state Rep. Ed Butler, a Democrat.\n\nIn 2009, he proposed the state expand its anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression to address transgender citizens' concerns about housing, employment, even physical safety.\n\nThe debate didn't play out the way he expected.\n\nAfter the public hearings, it became more of a public discussion. And within that public discussion, the issue of bathrooms became the core of the opposition, said Butler.\n\nButler's legislation quickly became dubbed the bathroom bill by socially conservative opponents such as Ann Marie Banfield, who characterized the backlash in terms of privacy.\n\nWhen you're talking about opening up restrooms and schools and in public places, it is just uncomfortable, unnatural and unwelcoming to many, many women and girls out there and I think that's what this really boils down to, said Banfield.\n\nBathroom battles\n\nBathrooms have been a regular site of political conflict around gender and sexuality issues, said Amy Stone, an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Trinity University in Texas who studies political rhetoric.\n\nA year earlier in Colorado, socially conservative groups such as Focus on the Family used similar language in an unsuccessful attempt to halt a similar transgender rights bill.\n\nVery few would argue that they'd want a man in a girls' bathroom, right? So it becomes very hard to counter them, said Stone, who noted that some of the same language was used by opponents of gay rights in the 1970s.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Stone said the opponents' framing of the issue became a powerful shorthand in the debate about the transgender rights bill.\n\nNews outlets in New Hampshire media began using the phrase bathroom bill in their coverage of the bill, which focused the debate even further on bathrooms.\n\nThe more the debate focused on bathrooms, the more contentious it got. During the debate on the floor of the New Hampshire House, then-state Rep. Nancy Elliot, a Republican, claimed child molesters would be able to choose their gender identity and and prey on small children in restrooms.\n\nYou couldn't say anything to them, charged Elliot. If you did say something to this person, you could be accused of a hate crime.\n\nSupporters of the bill tried to push back against the rhetoric, noting that the bill permitted no such thing.\n\nI'm tired of being called a child molester, because I'm not. I've never met a transgender person who is or have been. And I know that if I was in a bathroom and some pervert came in, he would be sorry about it, said Gerri Cannon, a transgender woman who met with lawmakers every day to keep the bill moving forward.\n\nThe state House eventually passed the bill by a single vote, but the tide was turning and a month later the state Senate voted unanimously to kill the bill.\n\nLGBT supporters put the blame squarely on the rhetoric over bathrooms and the media.\n\nTo those among you who repeatedly used the label 'the bathroom bill,' who incorporated this into every headline and story lead and failed to tell the whole and complete truth of this legislation, I say you are not journalists. You have served merely as stenographers to ignorance, hatred and discrimination, said then-state Sen. Jackie Cilley.\n\nThe bill's original sponsor, Ed Butler, notes that while the focus on bathrooms certainly didn't help his bill, it wasn't the only factor in its defeat. New Hampshire lawmakers were also passing a marriage equality law at the time. For some, Butler said, also passing a transgender rights bill as well was too much, too soon.\n\nThe environment for LGBT rights in New Hampshire has changed in the intervening years, said Butler. The LGBT community is more visible and better organized, and public attitudes are changing about transgender people.\n\nI think people are finally realizing the absurdity of the argument. We have been going to the bathroom with transgender people for all of our lives, it hasn't been a problem, and I think people are starting to realize that, said Butler.\n\nThat said, Butler notes there has been no recent attempt to add gender identity to New Hampshire's anti-discrimination law.
United Methodists Face Fractured Future\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sid Hastings/AP Sid Hastings/AP\n\nFor decades, the United Methodist Church has officially judged homosexual activity to be immoral, barred gays and lesbians from serving as clergy, and opposed same sex marriage.\n\nThose conservative doctrinal positions went against prevailing cultural and social trends, at least in the United States, but they didn't split the church into rival conservative and progressive camps because church leaders rarely enforced them.\n\nNo more.\n\nDelegates at the church's General Conference, meeting in St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 23 to Feb. 26, adopted several resolutions that not only reaffirmed the church's longstanding conservative positions but also introduced tough new measures for their enforcement. Methodist clergy who officiate at any marriage not involving a man and a woman will now face a one-year suspension for the first offense and permanent removal from the ministry for any subsequent offense.\n\nIn the aftermath of the conference action, the United Methodist Church is likely to lose some of its unity.\n\nWe are very clear that we will stand by our LGBTQ students, staff, faculty, alums, and friends, says Jay Rundell, president of the Methodist Theological School in Ohio, one of 13 official United Methodist Church seminaries. We will resist what we see as a narrow misuse of scripture and tradition.\n\nInfluence of the Global South\n\nThe ramifications of the General Conference action are not yet fully evident, but fractures are likely — between progressive clergy and conservative laity, between young and old church members, and between Methodists in the United States and those in Africa, Asia and other parts of what's known as the Global South, mostly less-developed countries where conservative social views and a more strict interpretation of the Bible are prevalent.\n\nA majority of U.S. delegates at the United Methodist General Conference opposed the conservative resolutions on sexuality and marriage, but the U.S. share of global Methodism is declining while the church is growing in the Global South, especially Africa.\n\nThe old ladies in the villages, the old men in the villages, the young boys in the towns and villages, are all celebrating that the United Methodist Church has maintained its traditional view of the Bible, says Dr. Jerry Kulah of Liberia, general coordinator of the church's Africa Initiative. Other denominations all across Africa are celebrating the United Methodist Church. That is the kind of euphoria being expressed right now across Africa.\n\nI think it's unfair for Americans to blame Africa or South America or the Philippines for this decision.\n\nSome United Methodists in Africa say they hear U.S. and European liberals lecturing to them on what positions they should take on issues of sexuality, family and marriage, and it strikes them as the latest example of a colonialist attitude.\n\nThe chickens have come home to roost, says Valerie Bridgeman, the academic dean of the Methodist Theological School in Ohio.\n\nColonialism is a real thing. But I also want to point out, having talked to several of my friends in Africa, that not all Africans agree with this decision, she says. I think it's unfair for Americans to blame Africa or South America or the Philippines for this decision.\n\nIn fact, there were many U.S. Methodists who joined United Methodists from Africa and elsewhere in supporting the new resolutions at the General Conference.\n\nInfluence of the evangelical subculture\n\nThere has always been a large evangelical subculture in U.S. Methodism, says Mark Tooley, president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, even though the hierarchy of the church for many decades has been more on the liberal side.\n\nTooley, who personally identifies with the evangelical tendency in the United Methodist tradition, says the long-standing church positions on matters of sexuality and marriage in the past reflected the influence of conservative Methodists in the United States.\n\nThe evangelicals and institutional moderates voted to reaffirm the church's teachings, and then the institutional moderates moved to the more liberal side, Tooley says. But then they were replaced by the rising global church, especially in Africa.\n\nIn fact, if the United Methodists split into liberal and conservative wings as a result of the church's new direction, it could be evident first in the United States.\n\nIt's very rare to find a purely conservative or a purely liberal congregation.\n\nIt's very rare to find a purely conservative or a purely liberal congregation, Tooley says. So if there is some sort of a division, or if there's the creation of a new liberal Methodist church, that almost inevitably will generate painful divisions in local congregations. Often the clergy are more liberal than the laity. So in many situations, you may have pastors who would like to join the new, more liberal denomination, but a majority of the lay people in their church may prefer to stay in the old denomination.\n\nEffects on United Methodist seminaries\n\nAnother split may occur between the United Methodist Church as a whole and some of the 13 official Methodist seminaries, many of which are institutionally committed to an LGBTQ-inclusive approach.\n\nIf the seminaries refuse to abide by the church's more stringent positions, they could conceivably lose some of their church funding. On the other hand, if they go along with those positions and alienate prospective students, they could also suffer.\n\nI can't speak for all the [United Methodist] schools, but one thing we've learned is that we have students who are struggling right now with their church, says Rundell of the Methodist Theology School in Ohio. For our younger students in particular, [LGBTQ equality] is a matter that, in most of their lives, is no longer debated.\n\nRundell says the 13 official United Methodist seminaries generally cover between 10 and 20 percent of their operating budget with direct church funding, but he says the loss of that funding is not necessarily the biggest danger.\n\nWhat would challenge us financially more is if enrollment is hurt, he says. If we have fewer students seeking ordination in the United Methodist Church, that affects us financially as well. We are living in some pretty serious tension right now.
Comic Mike Birbiglia On His Best Failure And The 3 Rules Of Improv\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Bryan Bedder/Getty Images\n\nComic Mike Birbiglia's new film, Don't Think Twice, was inspired by an observation his wife made when she attended one of his improv shows.\n\nShe goes, 'It's amazing that everyone is equally talented in this show, and yet this one person is on Saturday Night Live and this one person is a movie star and this one person lives on an air mattress in Queens,'  Birbiglia tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. And I thought: Not only is that true and a great observation, but it's also a movie.\n\nDon't Think Twice tells the story of an improv comedy group that is splintered when one member gets a job on a popular TV sketch comedy show, and the other members feel like failures by comparison.\n\nBirbiglia's first feature film, Sleepwalk With Me, came out in 2012 and was based on an autobiographical story that the comic told on This American Life.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how the failure of his sitcom pilot affected his career\n\nThere's a way in which, when I look back in my 20s, I'm embarrassed because I was, I think, kind of sprawling in every direction looking for any kind of success at all: I'll audition for commercials; I'll audition for voice-overs; I'll audition for movies or TV shows or anything! And I was kind of cast in nothing. Where that crescendoed was when I was about 30 years old, it was 2008, I got my own sitcom pilot with CBS based on my life. I couldn't believe it. Bob Odenkirk played my brother and Nick Kroll played my cousin, Frances Conroy played my mom. It was like a dream come true. I thought, Oh, this is it. I've made it in this certain way. And when it didn't get picked up to air, I was crushed.\n\nIn that space of time where my calendar was empty, I decided: Why don't I go and kind of double down on my own projects? I had been working on Sleepwalk With Me, the one-person show, for seven years as sort of a side project. And I was like: Why don't I produce that with the level of production that these networks and studios bring to their movies and TV shows? So that's when I mounted Sleepwalk With Me off-Broadway. Since then, I've made three off-Broadway shows and directed two movies, and I feel actually so happy for that failure. I feel like that sitcom not being picked up is financially the worst thing that ever happened in my life, and artistically the best.\n\nOn how he applied the rules of improv to directing his first film\n\nThe rules of improv, I believe, are so profound because they apply to almost any kind of collaboration. ... No. 1: Say yes. Two: It's all about the group. And three: Don't think.\n\nIn retrospect, when I look back on directing Sleepwalk With Me, I didn't know how to direct a movie. There's no way to teach someone how to direct a movie. You can go to film school, you can direct a short, but to direct a feature film, it's like waiting tables for the first time — you have to sort of lie and say that you've waited tables before. Which of course leads to a lot of incompetent waiters who are liars. But directors are like that, too. You really don't know what you're doing, and I think in a lot of ways these ideas [of improv], these principles, are what got me through — this idea of, like, listen to people more than you talk. ... I don't know anything about costume design, but I hired someone whose work I admire and then I listened to her when she made recommendations. ... I think those are just really good rules for collaboration.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jon Pack/The Film Arcade Jon Pack/The Film Arcade\n\nOn the process of writing Don't Think Twice\n\nSo I wrote a note next to my bed ... I wrote, 'Mike! You have an appointment at Café Pedlar at 7 a.m. with your mind!' It's so corny, and I would show up!\n\nI was procrastinating. I had the movie in my head, but I wasn't writing it. But I noticed this trend in my life, which was that I was showing up to lunch meetings or business meetings, but I wasn't showing up to meet myself. So I wrote a note next to my bed — this is so corny, but I wrote, Mike! You have an appointment at Café Pedlar at 7 a.m. with your mind! It's so corny, and I would show up! I never didn't show up, and I wrote this movie [in] spurts of essentially three hours, like I'd write from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., and the reason why I would do that is because I was essentially barely awake. Because I feel like that moment, at 7 to 10 a.m., you're not afraid of the world yet.\n\nOn why he doesn't go to screenings of Don't Think Twice anymore\n\nI can't watch it anymore because I get too choked up. It's very emotional for me, much more so than Sleepwalk With Me. Sleepwalk With Me ... never got to me in the way that [Don't Think Twice] does, because it's really these six characters that Keegan[-Michael Key] and Gillian [Jacobs] and Kate [Micucci] and Tami [Sagher] and Chris [Gethard] and I play. They're not me — they're these people who I believe exist. And I cry every time. I mean, I have nothing against crying, I just don't want to do it every day. I feel like once a week is fine, but if it becomes every day, after a while people are like, Mike, what's going on with you?\n\nOn how getting in a car accident inspired him to get married\n\nIn the wake of that accident — it turned out to be a drunk driver, and I assumed that that driver would pay for my car, but it wasn't that. It was the opposite. Somehow in the paperwork and the police work or whatever, I was made to pay for the other driver's car. The unfairness of it really spun me out. I ended up in this crazy — I mean, I got a subscription on NetDetective.com, where I'm looking up the other driver's name and I considered calling him at one point, directly, being like, This is insane! And there's lawyers involved, and it really spun me out, and at a certain point I realized that this is not going to resolve.\n\nMy now-wife, Jenny, who is much more calm and wise than I am, said, I think you should give up the case and pay for the guy's car. And I said, Why? And she said, I'm just so glad you're alive and I think we should focus on that. ...\n\nI gave up the case and I paid for his car, and then a few months later we went to city hall and got married. And I still don't believe in the idea of marriage, but I believe in her, and I've given up on the idea of being right.
Donald Trump Unveils New, More Diverse Supreme Court Short List\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump expanded his list of potential Supreme Court nominees Friday.\n\nThe new list consists of 10 more possible nominees, including a U.S. senator who has refused to endorse Trump.\n\nTrump's additional list, coming just days before the first debate, suggests he wants to add diversity to his earlier all-white list of eight men and three women. The second list, like the first, consists of bedrock conservatives, many with records hostile to abortion rights, same-sex marriage and federal regulations.\n\nWhile the new list adds the name of just one more woman, it is more racially and ethnically diverse — one African-American state court judge, a Venezuelan-born federal judge and another federal judge of South Asian descent.\n\nThe only non-judge on the list is Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Ted Cruz supporter during the primaries who has refused to endorse Trump and continued that position Friday, even in the face of a change from Cruz.\n\nReaction to the new list was predictable.\n\nCarrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network, praised the Trump lists as unprecedented steps that should please conservatives if Trump is elected and delivers on the type of nominee he is promising. The Network says it has spent millions of dollars on ads opposing President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.\n\nNan Aron, of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said that the new list, like the first one, consists of ultraconservatives who espouse a backward view of the law. Adding some racial diversity, she said, doesn't change the fact that these individuals' track records suggest they would endanger the cherished rights and freedoms of Americans.\n\nTrump's list includes none of the conservative lawyers who practice regularly before the Supreme Court, nor does it include any of the highly regarded conservative judges who sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the court that the late Justice Antonin Scalia served on, and on which Obama nominee Garland now serves as Chief Judge.\n\nIn the past, the D.C. Circuit, as it is known, has been something of a farm team for the Supreme Court. The current chief justice, John Roberts, and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas, all served on the D.C. Circuit before being elevated to the Supreme Court.\n\nExcept for Sen. Lee, Trump's list is drawn from other courts around the country, both state and federal. Friday's additional 10 include:
Tom Hanks Says Self-Doubt Is 'A High-Wire Act That We All Walk'\n\nNo matter what we've done, there comes a point where you think, ... 'When are they going to discover that I am, in fact, a fraud?'  Hanks says. Originally broadcast April 26, 2016.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Today, we start our end of summer series featuring some favorite recent interviews. We begin with Tom Hanks who plays Captain Sully Sullenberger in the new film Sully, which opens next week. I'll just do an abbreviated recitation of his films - Splash, Big, Sleepless In Seattle, Philadelphia, Apollo 13, Toy Story, That Thing You Do, Saving Private Ryan, You've Got Mail, Charlie Wilson's War, Captain Phillips and Bridge Of Spies.\n\nHe's won two Oscars. His production company, Playtone, also has a long list of credits, including the recent film Hanks starred in, A Hologram For The King, which was released when I spoke with him in April. It's adapted from a novel by Dave Eggers.\n\nHanks plays Alan Clay, a middle-aged American businessman who's sent to Saudi Arabia where the king is planning to build a new city in the middle of the desert. Clay's job is to convince the Saudis to let the company he works for provide new state of the art IT technology and support for this new city. In this scene, he shows up at the desert location to find his IT team is being housed in a large tent with no food, spotty Wi-Fi and no one to complain to.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, A HOLOGRAM FOR THE KING)\n\nTOM HANKS: (As Alan Clay) The king is not coming today, so you guys can just relax.\n\nDAVID MENKIN: (As Brad) Shouldn't we call corporate, and let them know the conditions here are untenable?\n\nHANKS: (As Alan Clay) No, Brad, we should wait until I talked to Karim al-Ahmad at 3 o'clock.\n\nUNIDENTFIED ACTOR: (As character) Do you know why we're not in that building?\n\nHANKS: (As Alan Clay) Well, maybe all the vendors are in here, and maybe we're just the first.\n\nMENKIN: (As Brad) Kind of weird being Relyand and being out here.\n\nHANKS: (As Alan Clay) It's a brand new city. It's uncharted territory, and we are the trailblazers.\n\nCHRISTY MEYER: (As Cayley) Where are we supposed to eat?\n\nHANKS: (As Alan Clay) Guys, come on. We are in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia with the deserts and the camels and the sheikhs and the tents.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CHAIR BREAKING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character, screaming).\n\nHANKS: (As Alan Clay) Oh.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Oh, my God. Are you OK?\n\nHANKS: (As Alan Clay) Yeah, don't you know they can only kill me with a golden bullet. Golden bullet, you know? You get it? It's Lawrence Of Arabia.\n\nMEYER: (As Cayley) Who?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nGROSS: Tom Hanks, welcome back to FRESH AIR.\n\nHANKS: Wonderful to be here, Terry.\n\nGROSS: So what was it about the Dave Eggers novel that made you want to adapt it into a film?\n\nHANKS: Well, first it's the dilemma that Alan Clay is in, which is a dilemma, I think, of our time. If you're going to sum it up in one word and one word only, you would say, Alan Clay is dealing with China. The fact that China has taken away the companies that he's worked for, the living that he used to make, and it's representative then of all the other failings that he's experienced in his life. He's divorced. He's got a kid. He can't afford college - college for her. And he's now taken whatever skill set he had, which is really, basically, selling things, and he is going to have to go off to a place as alien on the planet Earth as I think Mars is in the solar system, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia - accent on kingdom.\n\nGROSS: So what did you identify about this person, who is emotionally and geographically alone and lost, who's lost his confidence? It's kind of the opposite of the position we think of you as being.\n\nHANKS: Well, you know, I have been alone in a lot of hotel rooms around the world for long periods of time in which I know I have to get up in the morning and create something that I may have an instinctive ability to do or may fail miserably at. I do recognize that sensibility of 3 o'clock in the morning in a foreign land in which you have to have a passport in your briefcase in order to allow yourself entrance and exit. That is one aspect of it, too.\n\nThe other one is, I think, something that is real to all of us, the shark terror of a loss of confidence in ourselves. No matter who we are, no matter what we've done, there comes a point where you think how did I get here and am I going to be able to continue this? When are they going to discover that I am, in fact, a fraud and take everything away from me? It's a high-wire act that we all walk. And I do this in the work that I do because there are days when I know that 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, I am going to have to deliver some degree of emotional goods. And if I can't do it, that means I'm going to have to fake it. And if I fake it, that means they may catch me at faking it. And if they catch me at faking it, well, then it's just doomsday.\n\nGROSS: So you're shot in the desert of Morocco. What were some of the things that went wrong in the desert?\n\nHANKS: Well, you have your average sandstorm. That's a fascinating thing.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nHANKS: That literally comes in like they know it on the weather. They say tomorrow there will be a sandstorm that will last for 18 hours. And, sure enough, in the morning, there is a thick orange cloud, and there is the finest particles of sand, more like chalk or flour that seeps in through every crack in the window and underneath every door sill. I went back to my hotel room. We were shooting out in the middle of the desert near a place called Tan-Tan, Morocco, but we were very much out in - as deserty as you could possibly ask for. Everything in my room was covered with a fine layer of golden slash orange grit, so that wreaked havoc with some of the eyeballs of the crew and some of the sprockets of the machinery.\n\nThere is that, which is, you know - it's kind of an adventure, actually, in order to be a part of. There was also the - Morocco is not unlike Saudi Arabia in that it is also a kingdom. A king runs the place, so it has the patina of being a recognizable - almost a nation with, you know, Western customs. And, you know, there's Burger Kings and things like that are there - Pizza Huts. But it is also still very much a - an Islamic nation. My hotel room had a view of the biggest mosque I believe in all of North Africa, if not maybe the second biggest mosque in the world there in Casablanca.\n\nNow, you think, well, that's an intimidating prospect. But we ended up shooting in it (laughter), so we used it as a location for one of the - a couple of the scenes from our movie. So right there it's like - it's a mosque - are we allowed to be there? Well, in fact, yes, you are. And, in fact, you can bring your movie crew and shoot a scene in there.\n\nGROSS: So the film is produced by your production company, Playtone. Why did you start your own production company?\n\nHANKS: I didn't want to be the actor who just sat at home and waited for the phone to ring. I was very lucky that Jonathan Demme directed Philadelphia, and through that, I met the man who is now my producing partner, Gary Goetzman, who has worked long and hard with Jonathan on all the movies that Jonathan has made.\n\nJonathan said, well, if you really want to do something, why dont you guys start producing? You should get together with Gary and produce some stuff and make it. And from that union came - from that suggestion came That Thing You Do, which was the first thing I wrote and directed as a film. And that then began a constant state of creativity.\n\nGROSS: So not only did Playtone, your production company, come out of That Thing You Do - the title came out of it, too - because in That Thing You Do - it's a movie about a band. And you play an A&R guy from a record label who signs the band and tries to kind of bring them into the big time. And how did you come up with Playtone? You wrote the script.\n\nHANKS: I did.\n\nGROSS: How did that become the title for the record company?\n\nHANKS: I was trying to come up with what was the blandest, most odd...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nHANKS: ...Kind of like merchandising-hit-thing, and there used to be a record player that you could buy for kids, and every kid wanted. It was called a close-and-play record. You would just put a record on the turntable, you would close the lid and somehow, magically, the needle would land in the groove. And so I took that and turned it into Playtone. But I never thought anything of it until I saw what the graphic artist did with the name. When you make a movie as a director, they'll throw you all this reference material. They say, hey, you need to pick out a logo for the company Playtone so we can start putting it up on the walls and use it in the stationery and what have you. And as soon as I saw the logo that they had I said, oh, well if I ever form a company, I got to call it Playtone.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, yeah. So I love that film. I wonder why you never wrote and produced another theatrical release again?\n\nHANKS: Well, in fact, I made another movie called, Larry Crowne. But there is value in the affection, I think, that a filmmaker has for the subject matter. And 1964 was a very, very powerful year for me because I was a conscious being who witnessed the - as any kid did, I was 7 years old - at the assassination of John F. Kennedy. And I was confused for months by what had happened to the country, but also by the demeanor of every adult that was in my life. There was a sadness. There was a crippling mystery that had gone on because of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. There were still dark clouds and furrowed brows of my dad and the teachers and their friends and every adult that I knew. And to be 7 years old, it was like a vibe, an eggshell vibe, that was part of daily life, and I was uncomfortable by it. And I was saddened by it, and - but I was also mystified by it.\n\nThen on February 11 of 1964, The Beatles were on television, and it all went away before the first commercial break of The Ed Sullivan Show. To see these guys on TV, in which everybody on the planet stopped what they were doing in order watch it, 1964 became, I think, the most joyous year of my life. And it was all because of them and everything that followed. So when I began having these stories rattle around inside my head, I selfishly wanted to recreate that same joy that I experienced as a 7-year-old kid in February and March and April and the entire summer of 1964.\n\nGROSS: But you wrote it from the point of view of, like, teenagers in a band.\n\nHANKS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: And they're at this turning point of their lives 'cause they're teenagers entering adulthood or maybe college or maybe the military and maybe fame. And, like, you don't know, through most of the movie, which direction this is going to go in. And you're the person who's kind of, like, experienced in it. You're the A&R guy. So why did you choose to do it from the point of view as a band? I assume you love music, in part because of this movie and also, like, your company has produced the telecasts of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions.\n\nHANKS: Right. Yes, yeah.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) So...\n\nHANKS: Gary - my producing partner, Gary, is a - he's got all sorts of gold records from when he produced records for people like Robert John, The Lion Sleeps Tonight. He's done, like, Smokey Robinson records. So he's well-versed in the music business. Some time in - not too long before I started writing the movie - I heard the saga of a drummer by the name Jimmy Nichols. Do you know the name Jimmy Nichols at all?\n\nGROSS: No, I don't.\n\nHANKS: Well, here's the deal. Jimmy Nichols was, you know, a hired hand-drummer in the British music scene. And when The Beatles did their Asian and Australian tour, Ringo Starr got sick - tonsilitis or something - and he could not make a certain number of dates in Australia and Japan. So he became the drummer of The Beatles for a section of their tour. Jimmy Nichols, live from the Budokan with The Beatles.\n\nAnd I saw photographs of him, and I saw a little bit of footage of this guy picked out of total obscurity to play drums between three of the most famous musicians in the world at the time. John, Paul and George were up front, and Jimmy was playing the drums, and I just thought, what did that guy experience for a few months?\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nHANKS: You know, he was put in the same clothes, he rode in the same cars, he was on the back of the same trucks. He was treated like one of The Beatles because...\n\nGROSS: And I don't know his name (laughter).\n\nHANKS: And you don't know his name. And I just thought, well, that is a brand of serendipity that might be the backbone in order to put into this movie that I wanted to make that was about music, that was about growing up. So what happens in That Thing You Do! is Guy Patterson has to replace the drummer in The Wonders because he broke his arm. And it's because of that serendipity, that circumstance, that he ends up having six of the greatest months of his life. So it was taking something that had happened in real life and turning it to my own devices.\n\nGROSS: We're listening back to the interview I recorded last April with Tom Hanks. There's more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Tom Hanks. What was the first record you ever bought?\n\nHANKS: Well, I never bought 45s. The first record I actually bought was an LP named Aerie, as in an eagle's nest aerie, by John Denver (laughter). So I didn't buy - I didn't get around to that 'til - I was not a - the radio gave me all the musical satisfaction that I need - needed. The big deal for me was getting my first AM/FM radio - was by a company called Sun Mark. It was made in Korea. And that now is actually - it is now known as Samsung, but it was called Sun Mark at the time. And to have a radio of my own next to my bed where I could go back and forth between my favorite stations at Oakland and San Francisco - that was the bigger deal for me.\n\nGROSS: Did you ever put it under your pillow and pretend to be sleeping when you were actually listening to the radio?\n\nHANKS: My parents were so disinterested in what was going on in my bedroom that I didn't have to pretend anything. I could stay up as late as I wanted to.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nHANKS: Well, actually, no, it was a very good thing. I mean, my parents were so - my dad was married to the love of his life, finally. It took him three marriages to get there. But when they landed together, they were so busy having fun and dealing with their own Sturm und Drang that I could have been a tenant who lived downstairs.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Oh, gosh.\n\nHANKS: I just came and went on my own accord, and they never said boo. There was one time in high school, I had the flu and I spent two weeks at a friend's house. And when I finally came home, my dad said, where have you been? I said, oh, I had the flu. I slept at Kirk's (ph) house. He was like, oh, I figured you'd take care of yourself. So that brand of freedom is not - it wasn't a cruel brand of disinterest, but they were just very busy doing other things.\n\nGROSS: Oh, that's hilarious (laughter).\n\nHANKS: Yeah, it - that along with Attention Deficit Disorder made me what I am today.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) Did you have Attention Deficit Disorder?\n\nHANKS: I think - don't all American boys my age or all Americans have some degree of an Attention Deficit Disorder. Understand, I knew what time it was by what was on television. I don't think I - there was a clock in our house, and I never had a watch. Because if Love Of Life was over, it was time to go to school. If the Hogan's era - when the Hogan's Heroes hour was halfway through, I knew that dinner was going to be ready upstairs. And because of that, about every 12 minutes, when the commercial came on, my attention went somewhere else, and I think I still have trouble - I have to be utterly hypnotized by something to truly concentrate on it for anything more than 20 minutes at a time.\n\nGROSS: What did you want to watch? What were your favorite TV shows that made a lasting impression on you?\n\nHANKS: Then Came Bronson. It was on for one year. It starred Michael Parks as a iconoclastic reporter who gives up everything and rides across the country on a motorcycle. It was like a one-man version of Route 66. It was...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nHANKS: ...It was a very odd television show that was on for one season on NBC, and I just thought it was the hippest thing in the world because sometimes there'd be no dialogue in one of the shows. It was not like an episode of Mannix or Medical Center or Gunsmoke. It was something else.\n\nGROSS: So you were probably too young to have seen the real Route 66 in its time?\n\nHANKS: I remember it vaguely, but I was too young to appreciate it. When I was really young, it was Fireball XL5. It was Mayor Art. And I actually - in Oakland, Calif., KTVU channel 2 was on an independent station, and it started running a - very intelligent movies on Saturday nights and Sunday. It was called the Premiere Movie, and there all of a sudden I'm seeing a marriage Italian-style on channel 2, you know, with commercials on it.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nHANKS: I remember seeing Kurosawa's the Seven Samurai and Les Strada on TV, and I'd - look, these things all went over my head, but without a doubt this was counter-programming that hit a very fertile audience, which was my brain. And I think actually the time I spent alone watching television when I was in, you know, fifth - from fifth grade on, that was really quite an education for me because I was alone. And I was - for 20 minutes at a time, I was very concentrated on the subject matter.\n\nGROSS: So in a lot of your movies, you portray men in life and death situations, you know, war in Saving Private Ryan. You produced Band Of Brothers, also about World War II. You were Jim Lovell in Apollo 13. You were the captain of a ship taken over by pirates in Captain Phillips. You're finishing production on a movie called Sully in which you play the pilot who remarkably landed - made an emergency landing on the Hudson River after birds flew into the engines of the plane, disabling the engines. So these are men with like nerves of steel under pressure. Do you feel like you have ever been tested like that in your own life?\n\nHANKS: I think, first of all - they are not men with nerves of steel. The thing that has attracted me to all of those characters is they are fighting the terror that is inside them. For example, in all the reading and all the - much of the research I did for Saving Private Ryan was the terror that men in command felt in combat. And I have this verbatim from a number of people is that they were afraid of making the mistake that was going to get other people killed.\n\nNow, that's a huge burden of command, and it's something that you have to fight and tamp down, and you can't even begin - you can't allow yourself a moment of hesitation. And that faith in oneself is a very - that's the difference between success and failure, and it's not easy to do. And all of these guys have some degree of accomplishment, but it's been learned and earned at the same time. You know, no one is made a captain of a cargo ship without, you know - without an extraordinary amount of experience behind them. And that brand of of terror or loss of your own self-confidence, look - that's something that everybody goes through at some point. I have - my life has never been in jeopardy ever once.\n\nBut the artistic, creative process of one is still based on your ability to fight down those doubts of yourself, and you have to move forward. You have to move forward with a degree of confidence, and you cannot sweat too much the possibility that you are making a wrong mistake. It sounds almost like a paltry comparison to a lot of the characters that I've been able to play in these big movies, but, you know, that type of a battle of self-worth is something that everybody goes through at some point.\n\nAnd the fact, look - I'm not a muscle-bound guy. I don't strike fear in the hearts of everybody, you know - when I have to, I try to unleash some sort of inner charm monster in order to get out of any uncomfortable circumstance.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nHANKS: So that's about the only decent self-defense mechanism I have that I'm any good at it. But for all the characters I play, I think - I would like to think that the audience is able to get the same thing that I seek for from an audience, which is the question of seeing a movie and then go what would I do? What mistakes would I be afraid of making in the same circumstance?\n\nGROSS: We're listening back to the interview I recorded with Tom Hanks last April. After we take a short break, he'll talk about the different parents and different religions he grew up with. Here's the title song from his film That Thing You Do. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, THAT THING YOU DO)\n\nTHE KNACK: (Singing) You don't mean to be cruel. You never even knew about the heartache I've been going through. Well I try and try to forget you girl, but it's just so hard to do. Every time you do that thing you do. I know all the games you play, and I'm going to find a way to let you know that you'll be mine someday...\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded last April with Tom Hanks. He plays Captain Sully Sullenberger in the new movie Sully which was directed by Clint Eastwood and opens next week. Hanks is famous for a range of roles from romantic comedies to heroic figures in films like Bridge Of Spies, Captain Phillips, Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nGROSS: You've had your wars, in terms of movies, you've never fought in one in real life. When you were introduced to war, through your parents' generation and through TV movies, what was your reaction to the possibility that maybe one day you'd have to fight in one?\n\nHANKS: I get this question a lot because, yeah, I - not only do I go to it in my work, but I also read about it constantly, about the war and the war years - is because when I was a kid - I grew up in Alameda, Calif. I spent a lot of years there.\n\nAnd the Alameda Naval Air Station meant that most of my friends were in the Navy, their dads were in the Navy, their parents were dealing with that. And this was during Vietnam, so I had - my schoolmates all had dads on the USS Ranger and the Iwo Jima and the enterprise, aircraft carriers and what have you. And they were all in the Gulf of Tonkin, and they were flying missions in this war that was going on.\n\nThat was in parallel to the reality that a couple of teachers that I had, and also an awful lot of the adults, is that they talked about the war in a - literally - a three-act structure. And they described their lives, they told stories about their youths that were divided up into act one, before the war. Well, you know, before the war, I lived in Los Angeles. And before the war, my dad was a farmer. And before the war, I was enrolled at Mills College.\n\nThen they will tell stories about act two of their lives, which is, well, that was during the war. And that was during the war meant, is that we were in stasis. We didn't know what was going to happen. I found myself - my dad found himself studying hydraulic engineering for the Navy in Pocatello, Idaho. And then was shipped off to some place in the South Pacific. And during those five years, the future was a big X. It was a mathematical formula that had not been seen through.\n\nThen they go on with the rest of the lives, and it's act three. And it was always, well, you know, that was right after the war. Well, after the war, I became a dry cleaner. And after the war, I got my teaching credential. And after the war, you know, I got married and had kids or after the war, so and so had developed a terrible alcohol problem and was never the same when he came back.\n\nGROSS: So in terms of growing up surrounded by people who'd been in the war and whose lives were divided by before, during and after the war, what did that leave you with in terms of what war means and whether you really were, like your parents said, really lucky to be spared?\n\nHANKS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Or did part of you think, that sounds like such an incredible, life-changing experience, I hope to have something that dramatic in my life some day?\n\nHANKS: I never hoped to have something that dramatic in my life.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nHANKS: But I what I did recognize is that something like that - and I guess it's all relative for all of this - might have been good for me. And I use the word good in the form of, it would've been transforming for me. Let me tell you - when we were doing Forrest Gump in South Carolina, which is right next to Parris Island, you know, Camp Lejeune, south - the Marine Corps training camp.\n\nI got Captain Dale Dye, who was our adviser, took myself and Mykelti Williamson and Gary Sinise, and we went off and we toured Parris Island. And I saw guys who were probably anywhere from 12 to 15 years younger than me going through their boot camp. And it is hot, and they are miserable. And they're getting yelled at, and they look like they're scared and exhausted.\n\nAnd I could not help but think, you know, that would have been good for me if I had been an 18-year-old who had joined the Marines and had to go through 13 weeks of boot camp. Without a doubt, that would have been a transformative experience for me that, you know, I think about that, sure, all the time.\n\nGROSS: That might be true, if you lived, if you had all your arms and legs when it was over...\n\nHANKS: True.\n\nGROSS: ...If you didn't become an alcoholic, if you didn't have post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nHANKS: The story that has to come out, now, is all of what you're talking about. That yes, of - I've talked to guys with missing limbs, and I visited with a bunch of wounded guys a while back. And there was two guys that had lost limbs, and they were still in wheelchairs. One guy was going to be in the hospital for probably about another three years, missing two arms and - two legs and an arm. And I was talking to another fellow who was in the same condition, suffered the same wounds, but he was going to be getting out in a couple of weeks.\n\nAnd I said, well, what's the difference? And you know what the difference was between the two of them? Infection. And I thought, so let me get this straight, this isn't just about the fact that an IED took off your limbs and almost killed you. It's about that same IED picked up germs and microbes from the dirt and the dust of Afghanistan or Iraq, and put it so deep inside you that your body is now fighting centuries-old infections that still might kill you because we haven't figured out a way in order to make - itself infection-free.\n\nLook, it's a lot easier and it's a lot happier in order to talk about, and then they won the war and went home and became dry cleaners. But it's something else that when those infections are inside you, how in the world does somebody come back from Afghanistan after three tours and just pick up right where they left off? I think that - boy, you're in the high country when you're talking about that kind of stuff that rattles around inside your brain.\n\nGROSS: So I remember the first time you and I talked in 1988 when you were on FRESH AIR, you were talking about how in the early days of your career, you read parts as the weird guy, the insecure guy who compensated for his insecurity by being funny. And you said they were pretty one-dimensional characters.\n\nHow did you make the transition from that kind of role to playing these, you know, kind of, like, courageous men, like the men we've been talking about, courageous men who might have been scared inside, but they rose to the occasion?\n\nHANKS: I enjoyed the confidence of actually, Penny Marshall. I had made two movies with her. The first one was Big, which, you know, (laughter)...\n\nGROSS: You're an overgrown boy in that.\n\nHANKS: ...I played an overgrown - 13 years old, which your listeners might recognize from today's interview, as a matter of fact. But then we - I fell into a movie called League Of Their Own in which I was playing, essentially, a washed-up big leaguer. And after I'd had that experience, I was still in my mid-30s. I had an awful lot of opportunities and offers in order to go off and make a certain type of film, which is, you know, some brand of light comedy, some brand of, you know, quasi-romantic drama that all ended up being under the rubric of, will I ever find the person of my dreams?\n\nAnd it was a lucrative living, without a doubt. And there were some people that were going to be exciting to work with. And I had stacks and stacks of versions of those movies that were kind of just versions of other people that I'd played before. And after playing Jimmy Dugan, the washed up baseball player, in League Of Their Own, I don't think I have an awful lot of moments of clarity in regards to anything, but I did sit down with my crackerjack team of showbusiness experts - a guy named Richard...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nHANKS: ...And I said, you know, I just don't want to play these guys anymore. And I said, no, for quite a while. I said no for about a year to things that I could've done instead. And the end result of - out of that, literally, that conversation, came the sort of the first movie of my modern era, I think, which was Apollo 13. And then along - going to that, I think I established a degree of credibility so that other people were willing to throw their lot in with me and trust me in order to take other films to their fruition.\n\nGROSS: Well, I think we need to take a short break here. So let me reintroduce you. My guest is Tom Hanks. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Tom Hanks. So I want to ask you something about your childhood. When you were young, your parents divorced.\n\nHANKS: A lot (laughter).\n\nGROSS: Yes. I'm talking about the first divorce, right.\n\nHANKS: Yeah, they pioneered the marriage dissolution laws for the state of California. It was like, when I went to school, I was divorced. I was - you know, the only people who had divorces were, like, Elizabeth Taylor and Zsa Zsa Gabor and my mom and dad.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter) I know what you mean. It was pretty taboo back then.\n\nHANKS: Yeah, yeah.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, so what year was this?\n\nHANKS: My parents separated when I was 4 or 5 - 1960, '61.\n\nGROSS: Right. OK. OK. And you went...\n\nHANKS: For the first time.\n\nGROSS: ...You went with your father...\n\nHANKS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...And that was really unusual back then. Did your father insist on taking the kids? Did your mother reject having you, or did you get to choose yourself? Like, how did that work out?\n\nHANKS: No. It was - it literally came down to this - just simple. There was only one way that it could economically work. My mom and dad - God bless them - you know, they were together for a while. But when it was (laughter) - when it was time for them to divide, boy, did they know it. They needed to break up, and they did.\n\nWe were not traumatized by the reality of them getting the divorce. We were just confused by the geography of it all because my mom could not afford to have four kids. My younger brother was born. She could take care of the baby. And my dad - he - at that time, he had to go off to Reno and establish residency for six weeks. But - and he had a job, so he could afford to take the three of us. And so off we went, and we ended up living with a lady, and she had kids. And they ended up getting married, and they were married for a couple of years.\n\nAnd it was not painful other than it was occasionally lonely because I was the youngest of the group, and, you know, everybody else went off to school. And I was left to my own devices for a couple hours every day. But, really, it was just confusing because - look, Oprah was not on TV at that point, and nobody over the age of 27 knew how to communicate their feelings or explain to their children what was going on all around them, so we just kind of...\n\nGROSS: Right.\n\nHANKS: ...Like, went with the flow, and we moved around an awful lot. And, by the time I was 10 - I was actually kind of proud of this, as a matter of fact - by the time I was 10, I had lived in 10 different houses.\n\nGROSS: Whoa.\n\nHANKS: I'd had 10 different homes, two sets of families, a bunch of stepbrothers and stepsisters, and now, my dad was starting all over again with a woman who turned out to be the great love of his life - his - my - how do I put this - my second stepmother? Yeah, my second stepmom and her kids. And, of course, then we - that happened right in the teeth of the beginning of the 1960s, so we had all of that in order to go through, as well.\n\nGROSS: Well, having several families also exposed you to several religions. I think I have this right - that your mother was Catholic.\n\nHANKS: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Your stepmother became a Mormon for a while.\n\nHANKS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: You had an aunt who was a Nazarene. Did you try all those religions yourself?\n\nHANKS: We were forced to in a couple of circumstances. I was the only one in my family who did not get a first communion because my parents broke up before they could put me in the catechism. But I remember masses in Latin. But we - I thought, of course, well, that's what church is. But then these guys, literally like the Book Of Mormon, they came around in white short-sleeved shirts and black ties, and they rode bicycles. And they convinced my dad's second wife that being a Mormon was just the greatest thing in the world. And my dad said, you know what? If you - Winnie - that was her name - sweet lady. He said, if you want your kids to be baptized in the Mormon church, you go right ahead, but no way are my kids going to go through that.\n\nSo we just kind of, like, sat around and enjoyed some good Mormon family home evenings that were choreographed by, you know, Elder Paul and Brother Bob and a few other people who knew magic tricks with coins and were really funny. And, all the time, my dad would sit in the living room with his hands around a can of beer that were...\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nHANKS: ...Holding the label to himself. Then we lived - when we lived with my aunt, my dad was separating from his second wife, and we went and lived with his sister. And my dad grew up in a very, very strict Methodist household that had been transformed for his sister then into the Nazarene church. And that was - they didn't speak in tongues, but it was a very strict, fundamental, Christian social circle that we lived in.\n\nWe went to church. Church on Sundays was, like, two hours. Bible school was a very prescribed thing. Dinnertime was the parson coming over with - and he would - parson, would you do the honor of us asking the blessing? My sister and my brother and I would roll our eyes because that'd mean that guy was going to talk for 40 minutes. You know, he'd have his head bowed and the operatic voice would come out. Dear Heavenly Father, we ask bountiful blessings on the Hanks family. Here we are. He would talk for - and eyes closed, the food's getting cold, we're all hungry. We didn't quite really understand what was going on.\n\nGROSS: So you were exposed to several religions as a kid. And now, is there any that you practice? Is there any kind of faith or religion through which you kind of contemplate the great mysteries?\n\nHANKS: I am a Chrismated Hellenic in the Greek Orthodox Church. I do like, on occasion, going to Sunday services. Nothing is really expected of you in the Greek Orthodox church. You don't sing. You don't have hymnals. You might take part in some of the same choral chants that goes on. But I go, and I like to ponder the great questions of the universe when I go. And, I think, I embrace it as cleanly as I do because of the background that I had in all these other theologies that came at me.\n\nAnd every single one of them were presented to me as the only way to go. This is - we are the only ones that have this right. And when you have had four versions that are very, very different from each other of this brand of spirituality and theology, and four of them have all said we're the only ones that matter. Well, you kind of think at the age of 13, 14, well, you know, it's not the only one (laughter). You could say you're the only one, but not according to the people that were in charge of me when I was 6...\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nHANKS: ...Or the people who came around the house when I was 9.\n\nGROSS: So something about your health - you've publicly said that you not long ago were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes...\n\nHANKS: Yes.\n\nGROSS: ...Which means, you know, having to regulate your diet. Are you obsessive about your body when something goes wrong or can you just kind of keep that in the background and not worry about it?\n\nHANKS: I wish I was obsessive about it. And I don't worry about it because you always kind of feel normal. Type 1 diabetes is a very serious thing. Type 2 diabetes, I think for me, it's like a lifestyle malady. I knew that I grew up with a horrible diet, the American diet of candy bars, milkshakes and hamburgers and fries. But I was still surprised when after many, many visits to the doctor and being told I don't like the level of your blood sugars, young man, Tom, you've got to do something about these blood sugars. And when I was told, my doctor said, well, congratulations. You made it.\n\nGROSS: (Laughter).\n\nHANKS: And I said what? What did I do? He said you now officially have type 2 diabetes. And I - all I could think of - well, what did I do? Well, what I did was I ate very badly, and I didn't take any of that stuff seriously. Now, look, I'm going to be 60 years old this summer. It's time and order. I want to be around for at least another 20 years, so I've gotten much more rigorous about what I eat and how - the exercise that I get.\n\nAnd the truth is, luckily for me and I think for a lot of people that do have type 2 diabetes, you can control it with what you put in your body and how much you sweat out. I've been told by my doctors if you weigh exactly these many pounds, you will not have type 2 diabetes, which is the horrifying and dangerous conceit of putting my fate in my own hands, which means I'm just going to have to pony up and start taking it seriously. I'm lucky, of course.\n\nGROSS: You're putting this in the future tense as if you hadn't started doing it yet.\n\nHANKS: Well, no, I've been doing it for the last five years, but with varying levels of concentration.\n\nGROSS: Tom Hanks, it's just been fabulous to talk with you. Thank you so much.\n\nHANKS: I've really enjoyed it, Terry. Thanks for having me.\n\nGROSS: Tom Hanks recorded last April. His mother died last month. Hanks tweeted she was the difference in many lives, many lives. Our end of summer series featuring some favorite interviews continues tomorrow with Sarah Paulson.\n\nComing up, Ken Tucker reviews the soundtrack for the new Netflix series The Get Down.

Heavy Student Loan Debt Forces Many Millennials To Delay Buying Homes\n\nEnlarge this image Jon Marchione for NPR Jon Marchione for NPR\n\nStudent loan debt in the United States has more than doubled over the past decade to about $1.5 trillion, and the Federal Reserve now estimates that it is cutting into millennials' ability to buy homes.\n\nHomeownership rates for people ages 24 to 32 dropped nearly 9 percentage points between 2005 and 2014 — effectively driving down homeownership rates overall. In January, the Fed estimated 20 percent of that decline is attributable to student loan debt.\n\nWhether that will shift with time as the millennial generation marries and has children is the big economic question.\n\nThat's also a big question for Michael McHale, who says as a child, he pictured a suburban, picket-fenced home he eventually wanted to own. I can remember wanting that since I was 6, 7 or 8, he says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Michael McHale Courtesy of Michael McHale\n\nBut at age 31, McHale isn't living that dream. Instead, he and his wife rent in Danbury, Conn., an hour's drive from the elementary school where he teaches, across the state line in New York.\n\nNot owning a home makes him feel he has made a mistake that has kept him short of a key milestone — and his piece of the American dream. McHale says he feels trapped by his and his wife's combined $1,200 monthly student loan bills, which prevent them from saving enough for a down payment.\n\nAnd he says renting means he isn't free to plan his life, even as their first child — a boy — is on the way. One example: decorating the baby's nursery. We can't really make any actual changes. We can't really paint too much, McHale says.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above? Click here\n\nIt seems like there's like a debt spiral or something. When you get into a little bit of it, it just feeds back in on itself, and for us that started with student loans — that was our first debt, he says.\n\nIt feels especially bad when he compares himself with his father's generation. Neither his father nor his uncles were burdened by student loans. They all owned a house and had their full-time jobs by the time they were like 21, McHale says.\n\nYet many economists say this younger generation will eventually be able to buy — just later than previous generations.\n\nIt's not that they're not going to buy homes. It's just that they'll purchase these homes later in life, says Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at real estate research firm First American.\n\nBaby boomers were 25, on average, when they purchased their first homes; millennials, by comparison, are waiting almost a decade longer, Kushi says.\n\nMany factors are contributing to this delay: People are staying in school longer, delaying marriage and having children later. This generation is just starting to buy homes, and Kushi expects to see a wave of young buyers in coming years.\n\nThis generation will still yield the wealth benefits from becoming a homeowner, which I think is the key point, she says.\n\nThis might already be starting to happen.\n\nIn the past two years, homeownership rates have increased largely because of young buyers, who are benefiting from the good economy, says Jonathan Spader, a researcher at Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nStudent loan debt is still a headwind, but they're at least being buoyed by stronger incomes and employment, he says.\n\nPeople with degrees have higher incomes, which offset the debt burden. But it's also true that people are taking longer to get their degrees, and many don't finish school.\n\nApproximately 40 percent of those who start college do not finish within six years. ... That's a huge number, says Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\n\nFor those people, it is the worst of all worlds — they have the school debt without the higher wages to show for it.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Christina Ward Courtesy of Christina Ward\n\nChristina Ward did finish her schooling, but her chosen profession in social work doesn't pay enough for her to overcome her student debt.\n\nI thought that I would be able to at least make enough money to make the payments, which wasn't true at all, she says.\n\nWard racked up nearly $200,000 in loans for college and graduate school. Then she was laid off in December. At 36, she moved back into her parents' apartment in Newark, N.J.\n\nWard says she and her girlfriend have had to postpone not just buying a house; her girlfriend is also putting off her graduate education.\n\nWe definitely wanted to get married, and that's probably going to end up taking priority over the house, because you can't afford both, Ward says.\n\nBut at the moment, there's no target date for getting married either.
Hollywood Wakes Up Early To Hear Oscar Nominations\n\nNominations for this year's Academy Awards will be announced in Beverly Hills Monday morning. There could be as many as 10 films nominated for this year's Best Picture Oscar.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nAll right. From the royal family to Hollywood, this morning the stars woke up before dawn to see if they were named as nominees for the 92nd Academy Awards. The nominations were announced by actors Issa Rae and John Cho. They were at the soon-to-open Academy Museum here in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd NPR's Mandalit del Barco is here with me at NPR West to talk through the news. Hi, Mandalit.\n\nMANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Hello, David.\n\nGREENE: Got to start with the Joker. Right?\n\nDEL BARCO: Yes.\n\nGREENE: Eleven nominations. This is the psychological thriller about a mentally ill comedian, earning nominations for star Joaquin Phoenix and also the director, Todd Phillips.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, JOKER)\n\nJOAQUIN PHOENIX: (As Arthur Fleck) People are starting to notice.\n\nBRETT CULLEN: (As Thomas Wayne) You think this is funny?\n\nPHOENIX: (As Arthur Fleck, laughing).\n\nCULLEN: (As Thomas Wayne) Is this a joke to you?\n\nDEL BARCO: While people are starting to notice Joker, it also...\n\nGREENE: Apparently.\n\nDEL BARCO: Yes - it also earned nominations for costume design, cinematography and score. But David, it's worth noting - it's worth taking a closer look at that directing category. The nominees include Martin Scorsese for his gangster film The Irishman, Quentin Tarantino for his nostalgic take on 1970s Hollywood Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, Sam Mendes for his World War I film 1917 and South Korean director Bong Joon-ho for Parasite. And you'll notice, though, that not a single woman was nominated for directing. Announcer Issa Rae quickly noted that after the category was read.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nISSA RAE: Congratulations to those men.\n\nGREENE: Oh, wow (laughter). She didn't hold back at all.\n\nDEL BARCO: Right.\n\nGREENE: All right - something to note there, obviously. Well, those films you just noted for best director, all also nominated for best picture. And can't that be a funny category. You can have, like, five. You can have 10 nominations due to this ranked voting system. And this year, they settled on nine.\n\nDEL BARCO: Nine, yeah. And besides the other films that we mentioned, that list also includes Ford V Ferrari, Jojo Rabbit Marriage Story and Little Women.\n\nGREENE: OK. So now to the actors - and I mean, as we know, one of the things Oscar has been criticized for for a long time is lack of diversity. What are we looking at this year?\n\nDEL BARCO: Well, in the leading actor category, Antonio Banderas was nominated for Pain And Glory along with Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver, Joaquin Phoenix and Jonathan Pryce. And in the supporting actor category, well, it was all white men. And that group includes Tom Hanks, who was nominated for a supporting role as Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood - his first nomination in 20 years. It also has Joe Pesci and Al Pacino going up against each other for their parts in The Irishman.\n\nAnd for actresses, Scarlett Johansson was nominated twice, once for supporting for Jojo Rabbit and again for lead in Marriage Story. She'll be competing against Cynthia Erivo for Harriet, Saoirse Ronan in Little Women, Charlize Theron in Bombshell and Renee Zellweger for her turn as Judy Garland. Here is a clip from that movie, Judy.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, JUDY)\n\nRENEE ZELLWEGER: (As Judy Garland, singing) There's a land that I've heard of...\n\nYou won't forget me, will you?\n\n(Singing) Once in a lullaby...\n\nPromise you won't.\n\nGREENE: Gives me chills. That's beautiful.\n\nOne other category I wanted to ask you about - it looks like it'll be especially competitive. It's the newly named best international feature category. And one movie competing is Honeyland, nominated for doc. Right?\n\nDEL BARCO: Right. That's right. Honeyland, the film from North Macedonia, is about a woman in the mountains who is keeping the tradition of beekeeping for honey alive. And in that very competitive international feature category, Honeyland will go up against France's Les Miserables, Spain's Pain And Glory, Poland's Corpus Christi. And perhaps the biggest competition will come from South Korea's Parasite, which earned a total of six nominations.\n\nGREENE: All right. There are the Oscar nominations from NPR Arts correspondent Mandalit del Barco here at NPR West. Mandalit, thanks so much.\n\nDEL BARCO: Thanks, David.\n\nCopyright © 2020 NPR. All rights reserved.

Not My Job: Comedian Neal Brennan Gets Quizzed On Guys Named Mike\n\nBrennan has a Netflix special called 3 Mics so guest host Jessi Klein asked him questions about three Mikes (as in, three guys named Mike.) Originally broadcast March 11, 2017.\n\nBILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.\n\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\n\nThank you, Bill. Thank you, everybody.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: This week we are off at a meditation retreat, staying away from the news, breathing the fresh air and living in a complete fantasy.\n\nKURTIS: I can't believe President Oprah balanced the budget and gave everybody a car.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nSAGAL: While we are daydreaming, we are offering up some soothing segments from recent shows for your enjoyment. Back in March, our show was hosted by Jessi Klein, who did such a great job that I hurried back as soon as I could.\n\nKURTIS: She interviewed comedian Neal Brennan, whose new special, 3 Mics, had just come out on Netflix.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nJESSI KLEIN, HOST:\n\nSo, Neal, for people who haven't seen your special yet, tell us - just give us a basic rundown of what the concept of the three mics is.\n\nNEAL BRENNAN: There are three mics on stage, just, like, mics on stands, and they're just basically spaced out. Like, they each have, like, a little area. And I just go from one mic to the other. I basically do, like, 10 minutes of stand-up, then 10 minutes of, like, more emotional honesty, I guess, and then, like, two minutes of one-liners. And then I just repeat.\n\nKLEIN: Now, at what point in your stand-up did you start thinking, I got to start adding mics? One mic can't hold everything Neal Brennan has to offer.\n\nBRENNAN: Well, no, I had to - it was between emotional mics or just doing - becoming a mime.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBRENNAN: So in stand-up you can't really be that honest. And you can kind of just - you're honest a little bit in the set-up where you'll be like, my dad's deaf or whatever, and then you'll go from there. And then my - dad's not really deaf. But you know what I mean.\n\nKLEIN: Your dad's not really deaf. He's - it's even worse. Your dad's dead.\n\nBRENNAN: Yeah, my dad's dead. Yeah. That's correct.\n\nKLEIN: We're really selling your stand-up special.\n\nBRENNAN: So - but it's - but how he died is hilarious.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nALONZO BODDEN: Neal, have you ever had an audience confused? Like, why you keep doing this sad stuff? Can't you stay funny?\n\nBRENNAN: Yeah. Yeah. I was doing - I didn't - someone came to my show in Chicago and a woman didn't know what the premise of the show was, so she went on my Instagram, my Facebook and my Twitter during the show and was basically like, dude, you got to stop doing this emotional stuff, thinking that I would somehow, like, get a note on stage and be like, you know what? She's right.\n\nKLEIN: You tweeted recently that women are more interested in you since your special. And I wanted to know - how is that manifesting? Like, are women coming up to you and just saying, like, oh, my God, you are so hot when you talk about your lifelong struggle with depression?\n\nBRENNAN: (Laughter).\n\nKLEIN: Tell me more about your dead dad and your depression.\n\nBRENNAN: Not exactly, but I will say, like - Jessi, do you know what sliding into someone's DMs means?\n\nKLEIN: Yes.\n\nBRENNAN: OK. I get a lot of women sliding into my DMs. I don't know if you want to explain that to...\n\nKLEIN: I don't. I definitely want you to do it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBRENNAN: Sliding into the DMs is when someone on Instagram especially direct messages you and it's of a sexual nature, hence the slide. Do you understand?\n\nHELEN HONG: Oh.\n\nADAM FELBER: Oh.\n\nBODDEN: Neal, was that the plot behind the whole special?\n\nBRENNAN: (Laughter) Yeah.\n\nBODDEN: Just to get more women?\n\nBRENNAN: I was trying to get more women to slide.\n\nBODDEN: (Laughter).\n\nKLEIN: Neal, where do you rate your special on the Netflix and chill scale? Like, how chillable (ph) is your special?\n\nBRENNAN: It - are you talking about, like, are you going to do some live sliding? Is that what you mean?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, I actually think it's exactly what I mean.\n\nFELBER: That's exactly what you mean.\n\nKLEIN: That's exactly what I mean.\n\nHONG: Oh, yeah.\n\nBRENNAN: I - it's - do it early.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: Do it...\n\nBRENNAN: If you're going to do it.\n\nKLEIN: Yeah, do it before you get to that third mic.\n\nBRENNAN: Yeah, 'cause my ex said that three mics is the biggest red flag in the history of red flags. Do you agree?\n\nKLEIN: You do have a lot of red flags just up and down.\n\nBRENNAN: (Laughter).\n\nKLEIN: I mean, I think the red flagness (ph) is balanced out by the fact that you do present - and I mean this as a compliment - like, there's a wounded bird quality that I do think - I will say as a woman that I did also find appealing.\n\nBRENNAN: Yeah. OK. Good.\n\nHONG: A lot of women like a fixer-upper project.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: Yeah.\n\nBRENNAN: Yes. Oh, I need - you know, what I need is a good woman to save me.\n\nHONG: Yeah.\n\nFELBER: (Laughter) And now you're just trolling for them.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: Well, Neal, it's time to play a game that we're calling...\n\nKURTIS: Three more Mikes.\n\nKLEIN: Your stand-up special, as you know, is called 3 Mics, as in microphone. We're going to ask you about three Mikes as in Michael, the name. Do like what we did there?\n\nBRENNAN: I - yeah, I get it and I love it.\n\nKLEIN: So get two right and you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Neal playing for?\n\nKURTIS: Jon Paddock of Portland, Maine.\n\nKLEIN: OK, Neal, your first Mike is a Canadian 17-year-old high school student named Mike Rowe. Young Mike Rowe ended up in court why? A, he started a software company called Mike Rowe Soft and he was sued by Microsoft...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: ...B, he was sued by the other Mike Rowe for his web series, Really, Really Dirty Jobs; or C, he regularly made small insults to marginalized groups? You know, Mike Rowe aggressions.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBRENNAN: I'm - I don't think you can sue for microaggressions even in Canada. So...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBRENNAN: ...I'm going to go with A.\n\nKLEIN: A, he started a software company called Mike Rowe Soft?\n\nBRENNAN: Yes.\n\nKLEIN: You are correct.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)\n\nFELBER: Yeah.\n\nKLEIN: The answer was A, Mike Rowe Soft. He settled in exchange for an X-Box. Your next Mike is Mike Malloy. He came to prominence in the 1930s and earned a nickname. What was it? Was it A, Mike the Durable - gangsters repeatedly tried to kill him by poisoning his whiskey, but he'd been drinking bad whiskey so long it only made him stronger?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: B, his nickname was Killer Mike - he wasn't a rapper, though, he just murdered a lot of people?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: Or C, he actually invented the Hitler mustache, earning him the name Third Reich Mike?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBRENNAN: I want this so bad. Let's go with A.\n\nKLEIN: A, you're right.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)\n\nBRENNAN: Yes.\n\nKLEIN: Mike the Durable.\n\nFELBER: Very good, Neal.\n\nKLEIN: They tried antifreeze, turpentine, rat poison. Later they just tried running him over, but that didn't work either.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: And I will say when I read that the first time I was, like, oh, that doesn't seem funny to me. And they were like, no, that really happened. They tried to run him over. So here is your last question, Neal, about a Mike. Famous candy brand Mike and Ike caused a religious outcry when they did what? A, briefly ran an ad campaign where a nun prayed to a rosary made out of Mike and Ikes; B, implied that Mike and Ike were a gay couple; or C, were used in a public school sex ed class to illustrate conception?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBRENNAN: Well, by the way, this is - we already won the game. So this is just - we're - now we're just having fun, right?\n\nFELBER: Victory lap.\n\nKURTIS: Frosted.\n\nBRENNAN: I know.\n\nKLEIN: Neal, I'd like you to just do this for the journey.\n\nBRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nKLEIN: And it's not about winning or losing.\n\nBRENNAN: Great. Let's go with B.\n\nKLEIN: Yes.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)\n\nKLEIN: B. In 2012, the Family Research Council accused Mike and Ike of, quote, unquote, sexualizing candy and, quote, chipping away at the value of marriage in an impassioned radio address critiquing the unholy and fruity union of Mike and Ike.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKLEIN: Bill, how did Neal do on our quiz?\n\nKURTIS: You know, not many people get all three right, but Neal Brennan did. Congratulations, Neal.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKLEIN: Neal Brennan's great stand-up special 3 Mics is available on Netflix. Neal, thank you so much for joining.\n\nBRENNAN: Thank you for having.\n\nKLEIN: Thanks, Neal.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

Bluff The Listener\n\nOur panelists read three purrfectly amusing stories about felines in the news, only one of which is true.\n\nPETER SAGAL, HOST:\n\nThis is our all-animal edition of WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.\n\nBILL KURTIS: Translated into cat, that would be (imitating cat meowing).\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: And we do hope that cats are listening because a short while ago with special guest panelist Rosie Perez, we featured a Bluff The Listener game about cats.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nANDY DRACE: Hey, this is Andy Drace from Hickory, N.C.\n\nSAGAL: Hey. How are things in Hickory, N.C.?\n\nDRACE: They are great. They're wonderful, and I can't complain.\n\nSAGAL: Now what do you do there in Hickory?\n\nDRACE: I am a truck driver. I am a disc golf player. And I'm a father of four cats with my wife.\n\nAMY DICKINSON: Wait.\n\nSAGAL: Did you just say father of four cats?\n\nDRACE: I'm the only person I know whose pets have pets.\n\nSAGAL: You know what? They were right. We have gay marriage, now everything's gone to hell.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: People are having cats.\n\nADAM FELBER: Wow.\n\nSAGAL: This is terrible. Andy, it is nice to have you with us. You're going to play the game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction.\n\nDRACE: Yes.\n\nSAGAL: Bill, what is Andy's topic?\n\nKURTIS: Here, Kitty, Kitty.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSAGAL: We talk a lot in the news about man bites dog, but when do the cats make the headlines? This week, our panelists are going to read you three stories of felines in the news. Guess the real story and you'll win Scorekeeper Emeritus Carl Kasell's voice on your very own voicemail. Are you ready to play?\n\nDRACE: Oh, yeah. Let's do it.\n\nSAGAL: All right. Let's do it. Let's hear from Amy Dickinson first.\n\nDICKINSON: Cat lovers know there are times - special times - when the Friskies just go down wrong, and your kitty produces explosive, nuclear poo. And that's why we rely on clumping kitty litter. It turns out the industry controlling actual nuclear waste - not the stuff produced by my tabby Chester - has been using kitty litter for years to stabilize and store toxic sludge because they just can't pretend to ignore the smell or blame the dog the way we do.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDICKINSON: Contractors at Los Alamos made the big switch recently from clay-based litter to the organic green kind. And like so many well-intentioned ideas, this one blew up, literally, in a mini mushroom cloud of blame.\n\nTurns out, while the organic litter might make the technicians feel greener and more virtuous, it does a terrible job of stabilizing nuclear waste. The drums almost immediately started leaking radioactive goo. Their frightening solution falls into the it's-so-stupid-it-might-just-work category. They're storing the drums now inside bigger drums. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nSAGAL: A nuclear meltdown.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: Leaky nuclear waste caused by the wrong kitty litter. Your next story of extreme cattiness comes from Rosie Perez.\n\nROSIE PEREZ: New Yorker Jonas Elfin (ph), a top venture capitalist on the Upper West side and proud male cat lady, hated coming home to cat litter strewed throughout his Fifth Avenue high-rise. He especially hated how his two Siamese cats, Bai Ling (ph) and Jackie Chan Ling (ph)...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPEREZ: ...Kept getting kitty litter stuck in between their toes. Knowing that his beloved felines hated water and would freak out every time he dug into their little paws, he was perplexed.\n\nThen, one stormy night, while sipping a glass of Malbec, as Ling and Chan were enjoying their catnip, Ling jumped up on Jonas and rolled over on her back, paws up. Taking advantage of the situation, Jonas grabbed a Q-tip and some Wet Ones and figured out a way to give Ling a waterless pedicure. He was elated, but felt that something was missing. What his cats needed was a nice color of nail polish to complete the look.\n\nThe following day, Jonas called up his good friend Essie Weingarten, president and founder of Essie Nail Polish. She loved the idea of a catnip pedicure. This summer, they will open six cat salons across the city, offering pedicures in 10 toxin-free colors, including Purrfect (ph) Pink, Commonly Calico and Litter Box Lemon.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: Cats in Manhattan getting a mani-pedi or, I guess, since they're cats, a pedi-pedi. Your last story of cats in the news comes from Mr. Adam Felber.\n\nFELBER: Remember Smudge, the hero cat who was caught on video saving his toddler friend from a vicious dog a couple of weeks ago? Of course you do. More than 130 million people watched it on YouTube. Well, the happy story has kind of a sour coda because in addition to being a hero, it now turns out that Smudge is a huge racist.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nFELBER: It seemed just random when Smudge and his family made an appearance on the Today show, Smudge was happy to be stroked by Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie, but started hissing and clawing whenever Al Roker tried to get close.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nFELBER: But it wasn't random. Smudge wasn't just Rokist (ph). He was full-on racist.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nFELBER: In appearance after appearance since, Smudge has consistently bristled and spat at blacks, Latinos and even his local Bakersfield news anchor who is Asian.\n\nQuote, we're mortified, said Smudge's owner Allegra Brandano (ph). We're an inclusive, loving, tolerant family. We don't know where Smudge learned this stuff, but it wasn't here. Embarrassed, the Brandanos were forced to put Smudge up for adoption. But the good news is that he was immediately adopted by Donald Sterling.\n\n(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: Here then are your choices of the cats in the news. Was it, from Amy Dickinson, how the wrong cat litter led to a nuclear meltdown at a nuclear waste facility; from Rosie Perez, how somebody annoyed with cat litter on his floor came up with a business for cat manicures, pedicures and other salon services in New York; or from Adam Felber, how the hero cat of YouTube turns out to be an unreconstructed racist?\n\nDRACE: Let's go with the nuclear meltdown.\n\nSAGAL: You're going to go for the nuclear meltdown. That would be Amy's story. Well, we spoke to somebody familiar with this story.\n\nJIM CONCA: The absorbent, which you usually add in inorganic kitty litter, and they added organic kitty litter for whatever reason, but the wrong reason chemically.\n\nSAGAL: That was Jim Conca. He's a geochemist who has spent decades in the nuclear waste business explaining why organic kitty litter just wouldn't work the way the normal stuff does. Congratulations, Andy. You got it right.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSAGAL: You earned a point for Amy Dickinson. You've won our prize. Carl Kasell will record the greeting on your home answering device, whatever it may be. Congratulations, Andy.\n\nDRACE: Thank you, Chicago. I love you.\n\nSAGAL: Thank you playing with us today. We love you, too. Bye-bye.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Trump Administration's Stance In Cake Refusal Case Is The Latest Letdown For LGBT Advocates\n\nThe Justice Department has sided with a baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. For the LGBT community, it's the latest disappointment from the Trump administration.\n\nMICHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nThis week, the Trump administration weighed in on an important civil rights case heading to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Justice Department sided with a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. To advocates in the LGBT community, it is just the latest disappointment from the Trump administration. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here to tell us more. Carrie, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nCARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: My pleasure.\n\nMARTIN: So take a step back for a moment, if you would, and tell us the background on this case that the Supreme Court is, in fact, preparing to hear.\n\nJOHNSON: Sure. The owner of a Colorado shop called Masterpiece Cakeshop refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple several years ago. Colorado, like a lot of states, has public accommodation laws that are designed for businesses that interact with the public to prevent discrimination. And this baker, Jack Phillips, said no. He violated the statute on the books in Colorado, saying he didn't want to be compelled to violate his First Amendment rights, his deeply held religious beliefs, by celebrating this gay couple's marriage. But the same-sex couple said the baker was violating their rights.\n\nAnd now we're into this tug of war. This week, the Justice Department and the Trump administration sided with the baker, said the government couldn't compel him to engage in free speech. And in their brief, said an artist cannot be forced to paint. A musician cannot be forced to play, and a poet cannot be forced to write. A baker can't be forced to make a wedding cake.\n\nMARTIN: So in this country, laws saying you can't discriminate against people and offering public services were very hard won, as I think many people will remember. But they've been on the books for decades, so I think some people might ask, why is this any different from someone who is refusing to serve black people at a lunch counter, for example, or at a restaurant? What's the difference?\n\nJOHNSON: Well, and the Justice Department briefing anticipated this argument. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall says race is different. There's a compelling government interest in eradicating discrimination based on race. Laws that target racial bias can survive very strict scrutiny, strict review under the First Amendment. But those same classifications aren't so clear, the Trump DOJ says, for sexual orientation. Colorado only began issuing same sex-marriage licenses in 2014. And a divided Supreme Court only ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. There's still a lot of litigation out there on how and if old civil rights laws that mention sex actually covers sexual orientation too.\n\nMARTIN: So what have you been hearing about reaction to the Justice Department's decision to weigh in on the baker's behalf?\n\nJOHNSON: More than 80 Republican members of Congress say they're going to file their own briefs supporting this cake shop owner. He even appeared on Capitol Hill this past week with Utah Senator Mike Lee. But this matter has been getting a very different reception in the LGBT community. The American Civil Liberties Union says it was shocked that the Justice Department would support what it calls a constitutional right to discriminate. And at Lambda Legal, which fights for LGBT people, Sharon McGowan, who directs strategy for Lambda Legal, says the Trump White House has put a target on the backs of LGBT people in order to score points with its political base.\n\nMARTIN: You know, on the campaign trail last, year some might remember that President Trump - oh, then-candidate Trump - made certain statements that at least some gay and lesbian supporters took as assurances of his support for them. So how is his record now bearing out that point of view?\n\nJOHNSON: His record in office has not quite backed that up according to gay rights advocates. Early on in this administration, the Justice Department revoked guidelines for how schools should treat access to bathrooms and locker rooms for transgender people. In July. The president tweeted would ban transgender people from the military. And his Justice Department also went out of the way to file a brief in another case. That case said the Civil Rights Act, which provides protections against discrimination for people in the workplace, did not cover sexual orientation according to Trump's DOJ.\n\nMARTIN: That's NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson.

'There's No Map': Glennon Doyle On Living An 'Untamed' Life\n\nUntamed by Glennon Doyle Hardcover, 320 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nAuthor and blogger Glennon Doyle has something to tell all the women out there trying to put a brave face on a terrible situation, juggling home life with all the other expectations placed on them as the world seems like it's falling apart: I think every woman on earth needs to lower her expectations for herself, exponentially. At this point, we're not trying to be amazing. We are just trying to make it through the day. Her new book is called Untamed, and it details how she found her truest self — ending an unsatisfying marriage, and falling deeply in love with a woman while discovering how to be brave.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn when women start losing themselves\n\nAround 10 years old, we begin to lose who we are, when we start learning how to please ... when we start to internalize our social programming. So that's when we learn how to be a good girl, a strong boy, a good Christian, a good woman. And, you know, over and over again, we hear from women that their taming, their social programming, came when they learned how to be quiet, and kind, and sweet, and accommodating, and pleasing, and pretty.\n\nOn her first marriage\n\nWhat I would say is that I had a bad marriage to a good man. Right? I had a kind of marriage where I was not happy, and there was a lot going on that was less than freeing and less than true. But because he was a good man ... I had the kind of marriage that women are trained to be grateful for. ... I think, over and over again, there's sort of a gaslighting of women. It's everywhere. It's every time we admit that we want more, we're told we should just be grateful for what you have. It's the first story I ever learned about women, like the story of Eve: If you want more and you go for it, you will destroy yourself and the world.\n\nOn meeting her partner Abby Wambach\n\n... we can let go of the expectations, and shoulds, and supposed-tos that the world gives us and just honor who we actually are and have always been.\n\nWhen I met Abby, there was a voice inside of me that I finally recognized as my own. ... And following my love for her was a turning point in my life, but not just because I chose her. It was because I finally honored myself. Right? I chose to, for the first time, abandon everyone else's expectations of me instead of abandoning myself. And I think that's what I'm trying to get out of this book, which is this idea that we can let go of the expectations, and shoulds, and supposed-tos that the world gives us and just honor who we actually are and have always been.\n\nOn modeling marriage and motherhood for her children\n\nI decided to stay in a less than healthy marriage for a long time because of my children. ... One day I was braiding my daughter Tish's hair, and I looked at her and I thought, oh, my God, I'm staying in this marriage for her. But would I want this marriage for her? And if I would not want this marriage for her, then why am I modeling bad love and calling that good mothering?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amy Paulson/Random House Publishing Group Amy Paulson/Random House Publishing Group\n\nAnd that's when I realized, oh this idea of mother as martyr — that mothers have to prove their love by slowly dying, by burying their own needs, and their own ambition, and their own desires, and their own emotions ... this is just another way we get women to disappear. ... Don't take culture's definition of good mothering, because all culture will tell you is to keep disappearing. What I decided is that a good mother is not a martyr, a good mother is a model, right? That children will only allow themselves permission to live as fully as their parents do. And so we must not settle for any relationship, for any community, for any nation less true and beautiful than the one we would want for our babies.\n\nOn resisting the urge to run everything by your girlfriends\n\nI have a boy and two girls — until they tell me otherwise — and my son had a bunch of friends over and I walked into the room and I said to them, is anybody hungry? And all the boys answered, yes, without taking their eyes off the TV. The girls said nothing, took their eyes off the TV and started looking at each other's faces. And I'll never forget it, because I thought: Oh, we girls, in every moment of uncertainty are trained not to look inside themselves, but to look outside of themselves for approval, for permission, for consensus. ... A girl who at 10 years old can't tell you if she's hungry or not, becomes a woman at 40 years old who is still asking her friends if they approve of the person she's dating. ...There's decisions that we can make as a community that we can call our friends about. And there are decisions that can only be made by going inward and deciding for ourselves. Because in the end, when we're talking about our lives, there's no map. Right? We're all pioneers.\n\n... children will only allow themselves permission to live as fully as their parents do. And so we must not settle for any relationship, for any community, for any nation less true and beautiful than the one we would want for our babies.\n\nOn the coronavirus\n\nWomen taking care of everything during extraordinary circumstances is nothing new. Right? We've been doing this since the beginning of time. This is just a different iteration of it. And so, you know, every woman that I know right now is juggling work, relationships, home, her own anxiety, her own fear, which is what we do every day.\n\nThis is a hell of a lot too much family togetherness for me. ... what I'm saying to my people is: We just lower expectations right now. Right? Our children are not going to learn what they would have learned in school. You know what they'll learn? They will learn that sometimes things are completely out of our control. And in the end, what matters is how we take care of ourselves and each other. So whatever you need to do to take care of yourself and each other. Do it right now.\n\nOn her strategy for finding her inner voice\n\nOne of the reasons it is so hard to find our inner voice is because the voices outside of us are so loud. Over time, we have lived more and more of an exterior life. Right? We are always looking at our phones. We are always listening to the TV. We are always listening to outer voices. And so one of the things that changed my life is a practice of spending a few minutes a day just with no other voices, and just listening. Getting back in touch with the inner voice ... I do not think that everyone needs to leave their husband and marry a female Olympian — although I highly recommend it — but what I do think is that everyone needs to practice honoring that inner voice.\n\nThis interview was edited for radio by Hiba Ahmad and Hadeel Al-Shalchi, and adapted for the Web by Beth Novey and Petra Mayer.

Washington Democrats Reverse Course, Shed JZ Knight Contributions\n\nOLYMPIA, Wash. – The Washington Democratic Party says it will donate contributions from controversial spiritual leader JZ Knight to the Anti-Defamation League and the campaign to uphold gay marriage. That announcement late Friday follows the release of new video clips that show Knight making offensive and at times bizarre comments about gay people and people from Mexico.\n\nThe latest video clips were released by the conservative Freedom Foundation. In them Knight says gay men were once Catholic women. And attacks people from Mexico.\n\nThe invasion of the Mexicans who just breed like rabbits. They're poison, Knight rails in the video.\n\nThe video appears to have been shot last year at Knight's School of Enlightenment near Olympia. Knight claims to channel an ancient spirit named Ramtha. Earlier this year she started giving generously to the state Democratic Party and Democratic candidates. For several days, Democrats have resisted Republican calls to return the contributions. But Benton Strong, a spokesman for the state Democratic party, says after the most recent videos came out.\n\nIt's pretty clear that the vitriol in this is not the kind of thing that we support as a Democratic Party. We strongly believe in equality and inclusiveness, Strong says.\n\nStrong says the Party will donate a total of $70,000. Washington Senate Democrats will also donate their contribution from Knight to the campaign to uphold gay marriage. In a statement, the Ramtha School says the release of the videos may violate copyright law and it may sue.\n\nCopyright 2012 Northwest News Network

Can Businesses Turn Away LGBT Customers? Court Battles Bubbling Back Up\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Allison Sherry/CPR Allison Sherry/CPR\n\nThe original story behind the Masterpiece Cakeshop case is both undisputed and well known: a gay couple in Colorado walked into the bakery in 2012 and asked for wedding cake. The owner and master baker Jack Phillips declined to make a custom cake for their party because he said their union violated his religious beliefs.\n\nThe couple filed a complaint with the state's civil rights commission, which found Phillips was violating the state's anti-discrimination laws that prohibit businesses from discriminating against LGBTQ people.\n\nThe battle between the two sides, the state and Phillips, eventually landed in the high court.\n\nLast summer, the court narrowly sided with Phillips — and admonished the state's commission for showing animus against religion.\n\nBut because it didn't settle the looming question on whether the First Amendment guarantees of religious freedom are more important than a state or city's anti-discrimination laws, similar cases are again simmering in lower courts — including Arizona and Colorado.\n\nAmong the questions: when does an invitation or a cake qualify as free speech?\n\nThe main question is do you get to object to that kind of anti-discrimination law because it's forcing you to convey a message? said Ilya Shapiro with the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank that has supported some businesses that have turned customers away.\n\nOnly two justices would have held that the baking of a custom wedding cake is protected as speech by the First Amendment, said Kaipo Matsumura, who teaches law at Arizona State University.The other justices refrained from commenting on the issue and just reserved that question for future decisions in other cases.\n\nIn Arizona, Brendan Mahoney was one of the lawyers in town who people would call when they were fired from a job or refused a room because they were gay.\n\nIt really happened all the time, Mahoney said.\n\nMahoney, who was openly gay, would explain the reality of the law in Arizona.\n\nThere are no federal protections, no state or city protections, Mahoney said. Your best solution is to get involved and change the law.\n\nMahoney eventually took his own advice.\n\nHe went to work for the city and advocated for a Phoenix law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The ordinance would apply to housing, employment and other public accommodations — just as the law already did for categories like race, sex, marital status and religion.\n\nThe measure did ultimately prevail. More than five years later, Mahoney said the law has made a huge difference in the lives of LGBTQ people.\n\nI think the impact was profound, he said.\n\nBut one Phoenix business argues it cannot in good conscience follow that law — because they say it violates their freedom of speech and religion.\n\nBrush & Nib Studio designs custom invitations for events like weddings. The shop owners say making an invitation for a same-sex wedding would violate their Christian belief that marriage is only between a man and a woman.\n\nThe government shouldn't be telling artists what they can and can't say, Breanna Koski, a co-owner of Brush & Nib, said. We're challenging this law not just for us, but for all artists to be able to create freely.\n\nThe owners are asking the Arizona Supreme Court to excuse them from the city's anti-discrimination law. Those who break it face thousands of dollars in penalties — and even possible jail time.\n\nLast year, the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled against the duo, which is represented by the Scottsdale-based Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nThe influential Christian law firm also has offices in Washington, D.C. and has become nationally known for challenging nondiscrimination protections. The Alliance has logged nine high court wins in just seven years.\n\nThey also represent Colorado's baker Jack Phillips, who is again suing Colorado's commission on civil rights for harassment.\n\nBack in 2017, the day the Supreme Court announced it was taking up the first Masterpiece case, Phillips declined to bake another cake. The cake was requested to be pink on the inside and blue on the outside, celebrating a gender transition.\n\nPhillips said the message about sex and gender identity conflicted with his Christian religious beliefs.\n\nI believe that God made male and female and we don't get to choose that and we don't get to change that, he said. And it's wrong for the state to force me to create artistic products.\n\nThe state found Phillips had violated the state's anti-discrimination law and filed an administrative complaint against him. Phillips' attorneys are seeking an injunction to halt the state from moving forward on that complaint.\n\nThe pending case is an obvious attempt to harass the baker, said Jim Campbell, Phillips' attorney from the Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nWhile both cases make their way through lower courts, both sides anticipate the high court taking the issue up again — for the sake of clarity.\n\nIt may very well might end up at the nation's highest court again, Campbell said.\n\nAlready, powerful forces are divided.\n\nIn Arizona, the state's attorney general and Republican leadership are siding with the business, while major companies are backing the city of Phoenix. Arizona has no statewide protections for LGBTQ people.\n\nIt's a much different political reality in Colorado where the state's new Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser will defend the state against Phillips.\n\nWeiser was elected in a giant blue wave that swept the state last year, along with a new, and openly gay, Gov. Jared Polis. Weiser says the high court, in its opinion, never challenged the state's anti-discrimination laws.\n\nEquality for all is something that we here in Colorado are committed to, the laws will be enforced, Weiser said. We will just have to play a few more innings before we win this game.
'I'm Living In The World With No Secrets,' Says Trans Activist Jennifer Finney Boylan\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dan Haar/Celadon Books/Macmillan Dan Haar/Celadon Books/Macmillan\n\nWhat does it mean to be a woman who had a boyhood? That's the question LGBTQ activist Jennifer Finney Boylan set out to explore her new memoir, Good Boy: My Life in Seven Dogs.\n\nAfter Boylan came out as trans in her 40s, she felt estranged from her previous life. She describes her new book as a memoir of masculinity, kind of told the way an expatriate might speak of the country of their birth.\n\nBoylan acknowledges that some in the trans community might take issue with the notion that she had a boyhood.\n\nThere are many people who feel that they always were who they are, and to refer to an earlier part of your life differently is really disrespectful, she says. But even though I respect that view, for me, ... I had this experience and it's an experience that I now struggle to connect to.\n\nMore with Jennifer Finney Boylan Books 'Trans Bodies, Trans Selves': A Modern Manual By And For Trans People 'Trans Bodies, Trans Selves': A Modern Manual By And For Trans People Listen · 43:32 43:32\n\nBoylan writes that when she was living as a boy, and then as a man, there were times when she found it impossible to express the thing that was in her heart. But she never had to hide what she felt for dogs. Her memoir is told through the lens of seven different dogs she loved throughout the years.\n\nThere are times when I struggle to remember what it was like to live in that world, but then I remember the dogs, and it becomes really clear, she says. There was the dog that I had when I was a boy. There was a dog for when I was a teenager. And there's one for when I was a cool college boy, and there was one for when I was a husband, and a boyfriend, and a father.\n\nInterview highlights\n\nOn her first dog\n\nGood Boy My Life in Seven Dogs by Jennifer Finney Boylan Hardcover, 249 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nThe first dog we had was this mulish, snarling, resentful Dalmatian who was named — and I can't believe we named the dog this — Playboy. ... Playboy would steal the Thanksgiving turkey off the table and chase after motorcycles and bite your friends. So, it was a difficult relationship. However, the one person in the world who loved Playboy without reservation — and the feeling was mutual — was my father. ... He would just get down on the floor and ask that question that has haunted me my entire life: Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? And I remember being very jealous in some ways of that dog, because my father could love this horrible dog without condition, whereas for me, it was harder, because I didn't know who was a good boy, but I knew it wasn't me.\n\nOn why she didn't come out as trans or take hormones until she was in her 40s\n\nIn those days, coming out as transgender was unknown territory, at least it was for me. I barely even had a word for the thing that I felt. And as much as I knew I wanted to live my true life, I also felt that if I lived that life, it would almost surely lead to a life of marginality, of violence. I just thought, I might well be killed, that there was no place in the world in which I could live. There is no place in the world for me to be. ...\n\nIf I'd gone to a doctor and been given the chance to take the medication that I needed, I probably still would have been very reluctant to do it because I was just too afraid. And I thought that I would be wrecking the rest of my life, that I would never be loved by anyone except for maybe my dog. I thought that I would never have a family, I would never have a job. It seemed like my best life might well cost me my life. I just soldiered on, hoping that it would all get better.\n\nOn the process of coming out to her wife\n\nIt was not exactly one day. It was less of a decision than, like, an erosion, maybe. ... But I remember there was one day when a barrier came down at a railroad crossing and it was snowing. It was probably January of 2000. So it was the new millennium. I remember that it felt like we were in a new era. And I just watched the cars of the freight train going by and started kind of daydreaming and thinking that question: How long are you going to wait before you leave your actual life? Eventually, the barrier went up, the train disappeared down the tracks, but I was just sitting there in my car in this kind of daze until cars behind me started honking and wondering what was wrong with me. So that was the day I came home and I said to my wife, I think I'm gonna get back into therapy. We talked a little bit about the gender question before that moment, but that was the moment that I thought, I cannot keep living a life in which I'm not really myself.\n\nOn her wife's reaction\n\nShe's a social worker, so her first reaction was, Good! Therapy's a good thing. She wanted me to be happy, but she also felt, once it became clear that transition was coming right ahead, that she had a dilemma where she had to think: I have to help the person that I love most in the world at this moment of their crisis. But in so doing, I might lose the person that I love. It's kind of an unsolvable dilemma. And, yet, here we are still together, after 32 years of marriage — 12 as husband and wife, and 20 as wife and wife.\n\nOn the process of figuring out what kind of woman she is as she transitioned\n\nI was essentially going through a second adolescence at age 40. And a lot of the kind of trial-and-error things that girls go through and women go through when they're 5 and 10 and 15 were things that I was having to figure out. And even now, there are some things that I'm still trying to figure out. Like doing a French braid. I'm 61. I'm beginning to think that that ship has sailed. I'm probably never going to learn how to do that now. ...\n\nI think to live in this culture means that you're constantly being influenced by what the culture wants you to be, and if you're a woman, it means you're supposed to be thin. You're supposed to care about how pretty you are. You're supposed to care about a lot of things that maybe you shouldn't care about as much as the culture says you ought. ... There's a way in which I felt: If I want to fit in, if I want to pass in the world, then this is all the junk that I have to do. And it took me a while before I realized, actually, no, you can fight against that stuff. You've gone to all this trouble to become female. Why would you become anything less than the person you want to be?\n\nAuthor Interviews Trans Woman Reflects On Love, Loss And The Fight For Equality Trans Woman Reflects On Love, Loss And The Fight For Equality Listen · 36:25 36:25\n\nOn how being trans affected her reaction when her son came out as trans and became her daughter\n\nI'll simply say that when I came out as trans, my expectation was that people should be happy for me, and I knew it was asking a lot of people, but I still had the hope that people would understand that I was doing a difficult thing that was necessary that would enable me to survive in the world.\n\nLater, when my own child came out as trans, I was surprised at how much I struggled, at least at first, with it. I suddenly had this insight into what I'd been asking other people, and including my own mother, to understand. In the end, I think I was glad for her, and I love my daughter and I'm really proud of her. But it's funny how I think having me as a parent didn't make my daughter's transition easier. In some ways and think it may have made it harder.\n\nWe have a lot of our dreams tied up in our children, and it is hard to understand the obvious, which is that your children aren't here to live your dreams. Your children are here to live theirs. When I came out to my own mother 20 years ago, she was 85. She was an evangelical Christian. She was a Republican, and I had a pretty good sense that my coming out as trans was not going to strike her as the greatest thing that had ever happened to her — and yet I came out to her. I told her the story and I started to cry. And she got up out of her chair and she put her arms around me and she said, I would never turn my back on my child. I will always love you. And I said, But, mom, won't it be a scandal when everyone finds out that I'm your daughter now? And she said, Well, quite frankly, yes, but I will adjust. And then she quoted First Corinthians and said, The greatest of these is love. She said to me, love will prevail, and in large measure, it has in my life. So in some ways what I'm trying to do for my own daughter is to follow the example that my own mother set for me and to allow love to prevail.\n\nOn what she considers to be the biggest differences between her life before her transition and now\n\nIn some ways, the biggest change is not going from male to female. The biggest change is going from someone who has a secret to someone who doesn't have a secret. And if you have a secret that is as profound as the question of who you are, it's something that's going to eat at you all the time. So it used to be I'd wake up in the morning and I'd think, OK, we're gonna do the guy thing again now. And now I wake up in the morning and I don't think about it. In a way, gender has become something I think about a whole lot less.\n\nIn some ways, the biggest change is not going from male to female. The biggest change is going from someone who has a secret to someone who doesn't have a secret.\n\nI think it's not just the difference to male and female, it's the difference between being young and being middle aged. So maybe I'm the wrong person to observe those changes, but I try to live my life with courage as best I can. I'll be honest and say that tears live very close to the surface now when they didn't used to. Maybe it's estrogen. Maybe it's simply being older. ... You live long enough, you end up with a lot of arrows in your side. Whatever the reason, it doesn't take much to get me weeping, and quite often weeping just because something wonderful has happened. So my emotions are definitely closer to the surface, but then everything is closer to the surface — and not only because of hormones, but because I'm living in the world with no secrets.\n\nSam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited the audio of this interview.

A Royal Marriage Gone Wrong\n\nNPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro asks the BBC's Frank Gardner why Haya Bint al-Hussein, the wife of Dubai's ruler, is said to be in hiding in London.\n\nLULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nAnd now to the story of a royal marriage gone wrong and the geopolitical wrangling that has ensued because of it. Princess Haya Bint al-Hussein is the sixth wife of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. The tale that follows involves allegations of kidnapping, possible infidelity and much more. To fill us in is the BBC's Frank Gardner, who has been following the story.\n\nGood morning.\n\nFRANK GARDNER: Good morning, Lulu.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: So Princess Haya is in London right now as far as we know. Why?\n\nGARDNER: So there are different versions to this. The rumor - and we're not in the business of spreading rumors. I'm only going to tell you that this is what people are saying from the Dubai side is that she has been having some kind of an affair or got too close to one of her bodyguards - a British bodyguard. But what her friends who know her very well have told me is that she is deeply concerned and afraid for her life after discovering details of the escape last year of her stepdaughter Sheikha Latifa, who is one of the daughters of Sheikh Mohammed. She was a 33-year-old Dubai princess who put a video out online saying if you're seeing this, then I have not managed to escape. And she fled by sea. She got as far as the coast of India. And there she was, essentially, recaptured by Indian and Emirati commandos.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: In fact, we have some of that video. Let's listen to a little bit of it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLATIFA BINT MOHAMMED AL MAKTOUM: They put me in prison and they tortured me. Basically, one guy was holding me while the other guy was beating me. And they did that repeatedly.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, this is very dramatic testimony from her. And so how does this intersect with Princess Haya?\n\nGARDNER: Because in December last year, Princess Haya invited Mary Robinson, who's the former Irish president and also human rights commissioner for the UN, formerly, to come and see for herself the state of Princess Latifa. And they both vouched for her, saying she's fine. She's clearly a troubled young lady. So basically, the official version was that she was mentally unstable and needed looking after. And Princess Haya, according to her friends, feels that she was, in some way, hoodwinked and given a wrong version of events. The bottom line is that Princess Haya is now in hiding in London, preparing for a legal battle, which we don't know exactly what it's going to be about - whether it's custody or money or whatever. But that is coming up at the end of July. So this is pretty embarrassing for the Dubai government. Why does it involve several countries? Princes Haya is the daughter of the former king of Jordan, King Hussein. And she is - that makes her the half-sister of the current king of Jordan. She has chosen to come to England, to Britain, where she was educated. Britain has very close ties to the UAE, so this is, potentially, a very awkward diplomatic spat between two close allies - Britain and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nGARCIA-NAVARRO: And just finally, it also brings into question the treatment of women in Dubai and particularly by Sheikh Al Maktoum.\n\nGARDNER: Arab ruling families are particularly watchful over the female members of the family. The men have a - far more freedom, but the honor of the family rests with the women. This is why it's really kind of lifted a bit of a lid on the gilded palace life. It's very clear from the testimony in the video of Sheikha Latifa that she was in a kind of gilded cage. Now, many people would say she had every possible luxury, what - she wanted for nothing. But she, obviously, didn't want to be there. She wanted to get away and live a normal life, and that wasn't being offered to her.

'Watergate Girl' Offers An Inside Look At The Investigation Into Nixon\n\nDAVE DAVIES, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who has a cold today. My guest, Jill Wine-Banks, is a familiar face to cable TV audiences. She's appeared frequently as a legal analyst for MSNBC, often commenting on the Mueller investigation or the impeachment and trial of President Trump. But turn back the clock a few decades and you'd find her on the inside of another historic investigation into presidential misconduct. As an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation, she confronted associates of President Nixon in court and extracted evidence from White House records and presidential tape recordings.\n\nAs a young woman in an overwhelmingly male legal world, she faced demeaning comments in offices, courtrooms and the media, including a New York Times profile of her titled A Lawyer In Miniskirts. And while she was investigating the Watergate break-in and cover-up, her own house was mysteriously burglarized twice. FBI agents said a tap on her phone had been installed, then removed.\n\nHer new memoir details her experiences in the Watergate probe and her personal struggles with a failing marriage. I spoke to her yesterday about the book called The Watergate Girl: My Fight For Truth And Justice Against A Criminal President.\n\nWell, Jill Wine-Banks, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's talk about your experience in the Watergate investigation. You were hired at the age of 30 for the special prosecutor's office. You are an attorney with some experience. You'd done criminal prosecutions for the Justice Department. You were, I guess, the only woman trial lawyer on the team there. How were you regarded by all of these other men - the attorneys, the agents, others?\n\nJILL WINE-BANKS: Well, it depends on what part of my career you're talking about. When I first started at the Department of Justice, again, I was the only woman trial lawyer. And no one really knew how to deal with me because they weren't sure whether to call me a woman lawyer, which is something I've always objected to. I think that distinguishes me in a way that's unfair from any other lawyer. I was a trial lawyer, not a woman lawyer. And so I've always corrected people on that particular thing.\n\nI really ended up being very much accepted in the Department of Justice organized crime section, but it took me over a year to get my first trial, and that was because I was not even aware - I had no role models and no one to look to. And it took me a while to realize that the men I started with were starting to try cases. We all start doing appeals, but they had moved on to trials, and I hadn't. And so I had to confront my boss and say, how come? And he said, well, because you're a girl, and you'd be much more vulnerable in a courtroom. In appeals, you're just with lawyers. But in the courtroom, you'd be with Mafia members. And I simply said, well, what didn't you notice about me when you hired me as a trial lawyer? And that's how I got my first trial.\n\nWhen I got to Watergate, I had only a few years of experience.\n\nDAVIES: But they accepted you once you were on the team?\n\nWINE-BANKS: Oh, at Watergate, I never felt unaccepted. There were a number of episodes where you would have to say gender played a role. Judge Sirica made several, I would have to say, sexist comments. One was during my questioning of Rose Mary Woods when he said, now, ladies, we have enough problems in this courtroom without two women arguing. And that was while I was cross-examining her, not arguing with her. He also said during my cross-examination of one of the defendants, Robert Mardian, Mr. Mardian, don't you know you can never win an argument with a lady?\n\nAnd part of the trial strategy for cross-examining him was to get him angry and to get him arguing with me because we really felt that if he yelled at me and showed his true personality, it would definitely hurt him much more than if he yelled at Rick Ben-Veniste. And my strategy had worked. He was getting angry. The jury was hating him. And Judge Sirica stopped him.\n\nMy law school - I went to Columbia in New York. The students there wrote a letter to him complaining about his treatment of me, and he did apologize for that.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah. It's interesting because there are a lot of circumstances where if a lawyer says something to you in an office, you can call him on it. You don't call out a judge in public.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWINE-BANKS: No, you don't. You just smile and stand there, all the blood draining from your face and in total horror. I mean, it was very hard to be the first. And I always felt that as the first, if I screwed up that I was going to make it harder for anyone to follow me. It would be easy for someone to say, well, women just can't do it. And so I really felt that pressure to perform well so that other women could follow me.\n\nThat's been one of the things I'm proudest of is, for example, when I was general counsel of the Army - another first as a woman - my successor was a woman. And that meant that I had done a good enough job that they were willing to hire another woman.\n\nDAVIES: All right, let's talk about the Watergate case. One of the interesting things about this is that in May of '73, when the special counsel's office is organized and you begin this criminal investigation into Nixon and his associates, the U.S. Senate forms a committee and is beginning to hold public hearings on this. And a lot had come out on this because the Watergate burglars - one of them, James McCord - had begun talking about the cover-up, in effect. What effect did it have to U.S. prosecutors to have these Senate hearings going on at the same time? Did it reinforce what you were doing? Did you learn things from it?\n\nWINE-BANKS: It mostly complicated things, I would say. We had to be very careful to pay attention to what the Senate was doing because we didn't want them giving immunity to anyone we felt should be prosecuted. We had to make sure that no one told us one story and the Senate something else.\n\nIt did make a big difference, though, in terms of acceptance of what we were doing because you had a public disclosure of information so that the American public could hear John Dean testify. And I have to say at the time when he testified, he had no notes because he had been escorted out of the White House and had left without his diaries and messages. So he testified from memory.\n\nDAVIES: And let's just explain for people who aren't Watergate buffs. Remind us who John Dean was - yeah.\n\nWINE-BANKS: John Dean was the White House counsel to President Nixon. And he ended up being one of the ringleaders of the cover-up and had a very major role in doing it, although he did not know how much President Nixon knew before he started telling President Nixon.\n\nBut he testified from memory for days, and his memory was really incredibly accurate, as he testified about hush money payments and about perjury and the White House suborning perjury and about the approval of the break-in to begin with, which was done by members of the White House staff and the Committee to Reelect the President. So it was quite remarkable testimony.\n\nAnd basically, if you had polled America, people believed the denials. So he said, for example, that the chief of staff had done certain things. And the chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, testified that he hadn't. And people believed Haldeman rather than Dean.\n\nDAVIES: While Dean was telling this story to the Senate and on television to the world - I mean, I remember this very clearly - he was also talking to you in the prosecutor's office and giving you...\n\nWINE-BANKS: Yes.\n\nDAVIES: ...And was prepared to testify in court about what he knew, which was a lot and had a lot of detail. In July, a couple of months into this investigation, you discover something that practically no one knew - that Nixon had been taping his conversations. This did not come from your own investigators, right? Where did this come from?\n\nWINE-BANKS: No, that came from the testimony at the Senate. And we heard it the same way that all Americans heard it, which was on television. Alexander Butterfield was an aide to Richard Nixon who had been instrumental in installing the taping system. And a sort of happenstance question by one of the Senate staffers on a Friday revealed this, and it remained confidential and secret until Monday, when it was publicly revealed in Senate hearings.\n\nAnd Butterfield had debated with himself what he would do if he was asked, and he had said if he was asked a direct question, he would give an honest answer. He wasn't going to volunteer the information, but he was asked a direct question. And it was based on a document that had been found that sounded like it could have been a transcription of a conversation. It was not, but it led to the question of whether there was a taping system, and Butterfield said, yes, there was.\n\nDAVIES: So, you know, you're in the position in the prosecutor's office where you've been gathering all this information. And how are you going to prove whose version is right? You hear there are tapes. And it's interesting how that impacted you. You're - the guy who was head of your team, Jim Neal, was suspicious of this, right?\n\nWINE-BANKS: Yes. He thought that it was a trap. And I am much less skeptical. Maybe I was more naive, but I believed that it was a make or break for us. I knew that it either was going to confirm what John Dean said and make our case, or if it deviated from what he said, we would have been in serious jeopardy of not being able to prove the case because then there would have been serious doubt about his credibility. And so the only question we had was not if we would subpoena tapes, but which ones. And we foresaw executive privilege claims being raised.\n\nDAVIES: You said that lead of your team in the special prosecutor's office thought that this revelation of a recording system might have been a trap, meaning what? What was he suspicious of?\n\nWINE-BANKS: He, Jim Neal, thought that possibly they were either fake tapes that would exonerate the president or - I'm not really sure exactly what he had in mind, but he really thought it was a trap. He agreed we had no choice but to subpoena them because that was just how it was, and we were going to have to fight it. But I never doubted that it was legitimate. The confirmation that we got from John Dean was he was thrilled to know there was tapes because he believed he had been accurate in recounting all of the conversations he had, and he was relieved that he might be able to be proved correct. So his reaction to it led me to believe that this was good news for us.\n\nDAVIES: Now, what's interesting, you initially request - I think - nine tapes, and you had to ask for specific dates. And this is an interesting fact that occurred to me as I read this. It helped in asking for specific dates to have White House logs, which you had been provided by whom?\n\nWINE-BANKS: We got them from the White House. It was something that helped enormously. We had all sorts of call logs and meeting logs. And it is something that is very important in developing our case to have had that kind of information. So, for example, on one of the conversations that we subpoenaed in that first nine, we at first thought that it was from, like, 10:30 to noon. But when we checked the logs, we sent an addendum by letter to the White House saying this conversation actually took place from this time to this time. And we were very precise because we had the call logs. And we knew who came into the meeting and when they left and who entered the meeting after that person left. And it made it much easier to identify the exact times of conversations.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And it's interesting when you compare that to the recent investigations into the Trump administration, when special counsel Mueller was looking into looking into, you know, the deeds that he was looking into it. And initially the White House did cooperate and provide a lot of documents. Once the impeachment inquiry began, they refused to honor subpoenas. It really makes a difference whether some of this basic information is provided, doesn't it?\n\nWINE-BANKS: It does, and it's something that needs to be brought back to the Supreme Court to get a final ruling because there's no question that these are public records that should be turned over. There's no privilege and no reason not to have the witnesses and the documents. And it's very important if the American people are going to be able to know the truth and the facts. I'm very fact-based. And I can see information. People can evaluate and judge what it means to them, but at least they have the facts. And if the facts are withheld, you have nothing.\n\nDAVIES: Jill Wine-Banks is a legal analyst for NBC. Her book about her days as a lawyer in the special prosecutor's office investigating the Watergate scandal is called Watergate Girl. We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JEFF COFFIN & THE MU'TET'S LOW HANGING FRUIT)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And our guest is Jill Wine-Banks. She's an attorney and legal analyst for MSNBC. She was an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation in the early '70s. She has a new memoir called Watergate Girl: My Fight For Truth And Justice Against A Criminal President.\n\nYou know, it's interesting. So you requested those nine tapes. The Nixon administration said, no, these are private conversations of the president's, that they're subject to executive privilege. And one of the things you write is that as this unfolded in public, his refusal to supply the tapes hurt his support even with his base of supporters. That's again, a difference from what we're seeing today, isn't it?\n\nWINE-BANKS: Yes, although in the Watergate case, there were a lot more complications. At first, he said, this is a hoax in a witch hunt, which sounds dramatically familiar to listeners today. He also simply refused. He just said, I'm not turning them over. Eventually we went public. Archibald Cox, who was the special prosecutor, had a press conference and, in a very moving and dramatic and - full of integrity, said why we needed the tapes and why we had a legal right to have them, which led to the president ordering the attorney general to fire Archibald Cox.\n\nThe attorney general said I promised Congress I would not do it without cause, and there is no cause. I will not do it. So he was fired. And the deputy attorney general became attorney general and was ordered to fire Cox. And he also refused, and he was gone. The third person in charge was the solicitor general, who became the acting attorney general, and he carried out the order.\n\nThree days later, public protest was so dramatic, our office and the White House were inundated with bags of mail. This is in the era before email. There were telexes, but other than telexes, there was actual postal mail that we received and the White House received that led Nixon to do a U-turn and say, OK, I'll hire a new special prosecutor. And I'll give you the tapes.\n\nDAVIES: Right. Now, this was the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, right?\n\nWINE-BANKS: Yes.\n\nDAVIES: In October of 1973. As it happens, you were away on a wedding then, so you weren't in the office. But you did go back. And I want to just focus on that few days when, you know, two people - ranking people had been fired. The president was determined to shut down this investigation. You had an office with files and statements and all kinds of evidence. And you didn't know what was going to happen. Were you - what kinds of conversations did you have among each other, and what did you do to protect yourselves?\n\nWINE-BANKS: Well, before this happened, in anticipation that it might, we had copied some of the most significant documents. And each of us had taken briefcases of documents to our homes and stored them there just in case. We hoped we would never have to use it because it would have been illegal because they were grand jury materials. And we didn't want to violate any of our ethics and any of the rules. But we felt that there might come a time when our morals required us to do something to protect the country and to protect democracy. Luckily, it never came to that, but we did have that at home.\n\nAfter it actually happened, the discussion was, first of all, were we fired or was only Archibald Cox fired? And it appears that the office had been abolished, but we weren't actually fired. And so the discussion was, shall we quit in protest? And we basically decided, and Archibald Cox advised us, do not quit. That would give the president exactly what he wants. You know this case. You should never leave it unless you are forced out. As long as you can do your job, do it.\n\nDAVIES: So after the Saturday Night Massacre, after Nixon fired people attempting to shut down the investigation, it wasn't successful. Leon Jaworski was appointed to - the new special prosecutor, and the case went on. You were tangling with Nixon over the tapes, whether he would supply the nine tapes. Turned out two of them, they said, were missing. And you had to have court hearings over who exactly had custody of these things and what happened to them. You end up in a couple of confrontations with probably the only woman among the Nixon insiders, Rose Mary Woods. Tell us about her.\n\nWINE-BANKS: Rose Mary Woods was eventually called his executive assistant. At the time, she was his secretary. But she had been with him from the time he was elected to the Senate. She had met him when he was in the House of Representatives and had been very impressed with how he turned in his reimbursement forms. He thought - she thought he was extremely neat and accurate. And he was impressed with her as well and was one of the first people he hired when he became a senator and one of the first people he brought into the White House after he was elected. And she was much more than an assistant to him. She really was an adviser.\n\nAnd listening to the tapes that aren't relevant to the criminal prosecution, you can hear a lot of conversations between them that show their close personal relationship. Her brother, by the way, was the sheriff of Cook County. And he - Joe Woods - exchanged suits with Richard Nixon, and she exchanged clothes with Pat Nixon. She was known as Aunt Rose by both of the Nixon girls, Tricia and Julie. And she was really a part of the family.\n\nDAVIES: Jill Wine-Banks is a legal analyst for MSNBC. Her new book is The Watergate Girl. After a break, she'll describe her courtroom confrontation with Rose Mary Woods about a mysterious 18-minute gap in the tape of a critical White House conversation. And Maureen Corrigan reviews the unconventional debut novel of Deepa Anappara telling a story of child kidnapping in India. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF CHARLIE MOLE'S IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST FRONT TITLES)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who has a cold today. We're listening to my interview with Jill Wine-Banks. She's a legal analyst for MSNBC, and she has a new memoir about her days in the 1970s as an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate investigation. It's called The Watergate Girl. When we left off, she was talking about President Nixon's longtime secretary and executive assistant, Rose Mary Woods, who was close to the first family and an integral part of the administration.\n\nNow, she ends up being a very important figure in this case. People would know her name because it turned out that one of the critical conversations just a few weeks - a short time after the break-in - conversations in the Oval Office had an 18 1/2-minute gap where only a hum appears on the tape, very suspicious. A lot of people in the White House had access, but she ends up on the stand having to explain this. And you were the one cross-examining her. Tell us about that.\n\nWINE-BANKS: Rose Mary Woods was basically thrown under the bus by the White House counsel. They said we have now discovered as part of the drip, drip, drip of bad news - after the hearing on the first two missing tapes, they came back on the day before Thanksgiving and said, whoops (ph), there is a problem in a third tape. There's an 18 1/2-minute gap, and only Rose Mary Woods can explain it. And we can find no innocent explanation for it, which was really a dramatic announcement. And I had cross-examined her when she first testified about the two missing tapes as basically just a chain of custody witness because she had handled them.\n\nDAVIES: And she was tough, wasn't she?\n\nWINE-BANKS: She was feisty for sure. We definitely had a situation where I knew that nothing that I got from her would be easily obtained, that I was going to have to be very precise and careful in my questioning to get information. But at the first time, she wasn't suspected of having done anything. I, by some amazing coincidence, asked her questions that turned out to be devastating once we found out that she had possibly erased 18 1/2 minutes of a tape because she had told me about working on it for 29 hours at Camp David - that very tape - without ever mentioning that, oh, by the way, there was an 18-minute gap in that tape.\n\nAnd she also - I had asked her about precautions that she had taken to avoid erasing. And she basically screamed at me, well, I used my head. It's the only thing I had to use. And it turned out that wasn't very effective, obviously, because the mistake was made. And when she finally was called the second time to testify, I had to give her her Miranda warnings, which is something that lawyers seldom ever do. But she was now a suspect in a criminal investigation, and so I had to do it before I could ask her any questions.\n\nDAVIES: Right. So she ends up giving this explanation of - and people who remember Watergate will remember this - that it seems the only way she could have erased this, she said the phone rang and she went to pick up the phone but somehow kept her foot on a pedal that was connected to the recording. And then that's what caused the erasure. But what's remarkable about this is that she says, well, it was different in my - when you made a comment about that's awkward, and she says, well, it's different in my office.\n\nWINE-BANKS: Right.\n\nDAVIES: And then you did what?\n\nWINE-BANKS: I said, well, then let's go to your office and continue the questioning. And for some reason, the court agreed. The White House lawyers agreed. And her lawyers agreed. And so we went to the White House. It was my first time ever in the White House. And she demonstrated they would not - they, the White House - would not let us bring in a photographer.\n\nSo I had to rely on Ollie Atkins, who was the president's White House photographer. And the pictures are dramatic proof that her story didn't hold up. She also, just to make it clear, she said she had to make two mistakes. She had to push the wrong button and keep her foot on the pedal, which was a physical impossibility, certainly for 18 minutes. You might have been able to do it for one second but not for any prolonged period of time. So it just wasn't possible.\n\nThe pictures made her basically a laughingstock. There were a lot of cartoons about the Rose Mary Twist or the Rose Mary Stretch that were really hard on her, I am sure. It must have been a very devastating thing for her. I got a lot of mail from secretaries around the country saying, I've used that same equipment and it's not possible. No one could do that. It wouldn't work that way.\n\nAnd then to make it even worse, when the court ordered that we have the tape investigated, we hired a group of professionals in this field, first of all, hoping that we could recover the erased material. But we couldn't. But also what they discovered was that it was not one erasure. There were multiple erasures.\n\nDAVIES: Now, this photo, ironically taken by White House photographers, kind of made Rose Mary Woods a laughingstock because it showed her in this incredibly contorted position where she's stretching, holding her foot on a pedal and reaching for a phone. It just seems kind of ridiculous. Did you have sympathy for her?\n\nWINE-BANKS: Probably at that moment I didn't. I have an ability to sort of compartmentalize. And I was really compartmentalized on, what questions do I have to ask while listening to her answers so that I can follow up and make sure she's not evading my questions? In retrospect, I definitely have sympathy for her because I know that she may actually believe that she did that, but she certainly didn't.\n\nAnd I feel badly that the president let her believe that she did it, that the White House blamed her. They withdrew. She was represented initially by White House counsel. They withdrew that and made her hire a private attorney and - which is probably the right thing because if they actually were blaming her, ethically, they shouldn't represent her.\n\nBut I'm sure that was an expense and an embarrassment to her. She was certainly more deflated in the second hearing than when she had been called in the first time to testify about how she had handled the tapes.\n\nDAVIES: And the 18 1/2-minute gap was never officially explained. There was a lot of speculation about it. You write in the book that you have a theory that places Richard Nixon himself as the prime suspect. Why?\n\nWINE-BANKS: There's a lot of reasons why. He has the motive to erase it because it was the very first tape on our subpoena. Likely, in preparation for whether he was going to give them to us or not, he listened to the tapes. And logically, he would have listened to that one first. My theory is he listened to them and went, oh, this is bad. It shows that I know everything just a few days after the break-in. I can't let people hear that. So he erases it. Then he goes to the second tape and goes, oh, my gosh, they're all bad...\n\nDAVIES: (Laughter).\n\nWINE-BANKS: ...I can't erase them all, so I'm just going to have to stonewall and refuse to turn them over.\n\nDAVIES: Jill Wine-Banks is a legal analyst for MSNBC. Her book about her days as a lawyer in the special prosecutor's office investigating the Watergate scandal is called Watergate Girl. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ROBBEN FORD & BILL EVANS' CATCH A RIDE)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and our guest is Jill Wine-Banks. She's an attorney and legal analyst for MSNBC. She was an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation in the early '70s. She has a new memoir called Watergate Girl: My Fight For Truth And Justice Against A Criminal President.\n\nYou know, eventually, the special counsel's office asks for 64 more tapes, and there's a battle that goes all the way to the Supreme Court. And eventually, the court rules that they must be turned over. And that meant that you and the special counsel's office got the tapes. You could hear them themselves.\n\nAnd I'm just wondering, you write in the book about the people who listened to them - I mean, both you and women who were employed by the FBI later who had to transcribe hours and hours of them. The emotional impact of listening to these tapes, just share that with us.\n\nWINE-BANKS: Even to this day I remember how devastated and disappointed I was listening because imagining can never be as bad as actually hearing the president committing crimes. And it's not just the expletives, deleted language that was disturbing, but it was the fact that in the Oval Office, these conversations were taking place about paying hush money to make sure that the Watergate burglars never said that they were hired by the White House and the Committee to Reelect, that they were told to commit perjury. One of them was told to leave the country.\n\nAnd as they planned all this and used unaccounted campaign money, which led to legislation that's been undone by Citizens United, the Supreme Court case, they had so much money that they could spend it. And it's just very disturbing because I was raised to respect the president and the presidency, even if it wasn't someone that I agreed with politically. And so that was a - what I now see as a childhood vision that was just destroyed listening to the president committing crimes.\n\nDAVIES: And you mentioned that some of the women who were transcribing the tapes just...\n\nWINE-BANKS: Yes.\n\nDAVIES: ...Literally had tears on their cheeks.\n\nWINE-BANKS: They did. They cried because they couldn't believe what they were hearing as they listened to this horrible series of conversations. And it's available to anyone who wants to listen through the National Archives. You can listen to these tapes. And it's proof beyond doubt of the president's culpability.\n\nDAVIES: You know, one of the things that occurred to me as I read this was the power of being the first to set a narrative in a controversy like this. And in particular, there's this tape on March 21 of 1973 where, in Nixon's office, they're talking about raising a million dollars to ensure the loyalty and silence of the Watergate burglars.\n\nAnd Nixon says, yeah, we could get a million dollars. And the version that we first heard of this came from one of the president's, you know, inner circle, Bob Haldeman, at the Senate hearings in which he said, yeah, the president said, yes, we could get a million dollars, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong.\n\nWINE-BANKS: (Laughter).\n\nDAVIES: Now, I paid a lot of attention to this. And I remembered that as being what he actually said - yes, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong. When you actually got the tape, it didn't say that, did it?\n\nWINE-BANKS: It didn't, and John Dean had told us it didn't. So we knew that it didn't say that. But again, when you listen to it and you're waiting for those words and they don't come, you not only know that Bob Haldeman committed perjury, but you also know that the president was part of a conspiracy to pay hush money. And it proves your case in a way that almost nothing else could have done.\n\nDAVIES: But the interesting thing to me is that millions of Americans, me among them, believed that the president said it would be wrong, and that's because that was the first narrative we heard. It really matters who gets out in front of a story, doesn't it? (Laughter).\n\nWINE-BANKS: It does. And I hate to draw parallels to today, but how can you not when you look at what Attorney General William Barr did in terms of the Mueller report and so many other things? He misled the public and withheld the actual facts until the narrative had been set and people accepted it. And then when the truth came out, people were - well, he said, and I believe that, even though that was completely untrue.\n\nDAVIES: Just for the record, the actual quote from the tapes. The president says, you could get a million dollars, you could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten. It is not easy, but it could be done. But the question is, who the hell would handle it? Any ideas on that? Nothing about it being wrong.\n\nWINE-BANKS: Exactly.\n\nDAVIES: You have a poignant description of Rose Mary Woods after Nixon resigns. After the Supreme Court insists he turn over the tapes and it's clear he doesn't have the political support to survive a trial in the Senate, he resigns. She's around a bit. Tell us a bit about what she does.\n\nWINE-BANKS: She was moved out of her office adjacent to the Oval Office to a remote office in the Executive Office Building where she maintained a shrine to Richard Nixon until she was eventually, under President Ford, moved to a separate building, a little townhouse on Lafayette Square across from the White House. And she wasn't allowed to send mail to the president or communicate with him and eventually became - she said it was like being a B-list celebrity instead of an A-list. It's ironic, but she lived in the Watergate complex and had a nice lifestyle, eventually moving back to her hometown in Ohio and basically being out of the limelight.\n\nI very much would have loved to have interviewed her. I would have loved to have interviewed friends of hers because I really wanted to portray her not just as the stereotypical way she's portrayed. I wanted to portray her as her friends knew her, but none of them would talk to me. They felt that I was the enemy, and I felt I just was doing my job and now would like to portray her fully. I did as much research as I could, tried so many people. Bob Woodward advised me to stop calling people and to actually knock on their door because it would be harder to slam the door in my face. And guess what? I went to interview someone who knew her quite well, and they slammed the door in my face.\n\nDAVIES: You said that she had - when she was at the Executive Office Building in the days following Nixon's departure that she maintained a little shrine to Nixon. What was it?\n\nWINE-BANKS: She kept all of his personal belongings exactly as they were, including an ashtray with a half-smoked cigar.\n\nDAVIES: I wanted to just ask about the current president. I mean, it's clear that you believe from the facts and the law that impeachment and removal for office was warranted. As it turned out, you know, the refusal of the Senate to consider additional testimony and evidence and the swift acquittal of President Trump has left him in a perhaps stronger position than he might have been without it. Certainly, that's the view of Mitch McConnell, who said that this was a political blunder for the Democrats. You know, your area is law, not politics. But I'm just wondering, was it wise, do you think, for House Democrats to pursue the course they did?\n\nWINE-BANKS: I think it was. And it's easier to say that as a nonpolitician, but I don't think that leaving a president who does the things that President Trump has done unaccountable is acceptable. And yes, his acquittal means that he is now with no guardrails and may do even worse things in the next few months before the election. And if he happens to be reelected, his second term will be even more horrible in terms of violations of the law. So I think it was the right thing to do. I don't think it leaves him any stronger. Over 80% of the country believes that there should have been witnesses, that there should have been documents, that this was a sham trial. And I think that what we're going to find is that Americans are going to hold their senators responsible for cutting this off. To me, one of the most painful things was listening to the not guilties after senators had said, well, yes, he's guilty, he's done these things. Yes, the evidence is overwhelming. They weren't just saying unimpeachable. They had to say the words not guilty, and that was just not correct.\n\nDAVIES: Well, Jill Wine-Banks, thanks you so much for speaking with us.\n\nWINE-BANKS: Thank you. It's been a pleasure, Dave.\n\nDAVIES: Jill Wayne Banks is a legal analyst for MSNBC. Her new book is The Watergate Girl: My Fight For Truth And Justice Against A Criminal President. Coming up, Maureen Corrigan reviews an unconventional debut novel telling a story about child kidnapping in India.

Making Sense Of Charlottesville: A Reader's Guide\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nA rally with white nationalists chanting phrases like Jews will not replace us and end immigration, one people, one nation was, as many expressed online, disturbing yet not really all that surprising.\n\nWithin hours of the tragedy in Charlottesville, journalists, scholars and other leading voices weighed in around the Internet, with analysis and deeper understanding of how this unfolded.\n\nBelow are some of the most revealing pieces we read.\n\nHere at Code Switch, my teammate Gene Demby wrote about about how white nationalists are edging their movement out of the shadows:\n\nRichard Spencer, the white nationalist leader and University of Virginia alum who coined the term 'alt-right,' would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. 'If you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs,' Spencer told The Atlantic last year, not long after the election. 'By 2015, gay marriage is popular. What is possible has shifted. That's what the alt-right is doing. It's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.' \n\nCode Switch alum Matt Thompson, now executive editor at The Atlantic, riffed on the brazenness of the white supremacists who marched this weekend, compared with Klan members of decades past who hid under white hoods. The shameless return of white supremacy into America's public spaces seems to be happening by degrees, and quickly, Thompson wrote.\n\nDara Lind, a reporter at Vox who wrote an explainer of the rally and its origins, described it as a coming-out party for resurgent white nationalism in America.\n\nNathan Guttman, a reporter with Forward, an online news site aimed at Jewish Americans, penned a vivid piece about covering the march. He recounted watching as Spencer launched into a rant about the mayor of Charlottesville, Michael Signer.\n\n '[L]ittle Mayor Signer — SEE-NER — how do you pronounce this little creep's name?' asked Richard Spencer, a right-wing leader who dreams of a 'white ethnostate,' as he stood on a bench under a tree to rally his troops, deprived of their protest. The crowd knew exactly how to pronounce his name: 'Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew' some shouted out. The rest burst out in laughter. And that was one of the only moments of levity the alt-right audience gathered under the tree enjoyed.\n\nAnd Jia Tolentino, a writer for The New Yorker and a graduate of the University of Virginia, meditated on Charlottesville's progressive guise and ability to hide its dark racial past. While I was at U.V.A., the fact that slaves had built the school was hardly discussed, and the most prominent acknowledgment that Jefferson was a slave owner came on Valentine's Day, when signs went up all over campus that said 'TJ ♥s Sally.' \n\nMany writers also took on the response from President Trump, whose initial reaction to the violence in Charlottesville criticized equally both sides of the protest. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, Trump said, in remarks that brought condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nWriting for The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb parsed Trump's initial response further:\n\nWe have seen a great number of false equivalencies in the past two years, and the most recent Presidential election was defined by them. Yet it remains striking to hear Trump imply that Nazis and the interracial group of demonstrators who gathered to oppose them were, in essence, equally wrong. It would have been naïve to expect the President to unambiguously condemn neo-Confederates (Heritage, not hate, etc.), but Nazis? For reasons that are not hard to discern, the swastika, at least in the United States, has always been more clearly legible as a symbol of racial bigotry than the Confederate flag.\n\nMichael Gerson, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, lambasted Trump in a Washington Post piece, writing that the current president was incapable of speaking for the nation in the face of tragedy:\n\nIf great words can heal and inspire, base words can corrupt. Trump has been delivering the poison of prejudice in small but increasing doses. In Charlottesville, the effect became fully evident. And the president had no intention of decisively repudiating his work. What do we do with a president who is incapable or unwilling to perform his basic duties? What do we do when he is incapable of outrage at outrageous things? What do we do with a president who provides barely veiled cover for the darkest instincts of the human heart? These questions lead to the dead end of political realism — a hopeless recognition of limited options. But the questions intensify.\n\nOn Monday, Trump responded to the increasing pressure to react more forcefully, and gave a stronger rebuke. Racism is evil, Trump said. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\n\nIn a piece for Commentary Magazine, John Podhoretz, a former speechwriter for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, cast a skeptical eye toward Trump's remarks on Monday:\n\nYou can choose to have whatever opinion you have on the president's statement today condemning white supremacists, but it's hard to believe he would have read it out if he'd had his druthers. No, the real Donald Trump was the one we saw on Saturday when he decided to condemn violence 'on many sides' in response to the deliberately provocative and intentionally violent neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia; when he decided to refer to the events as 'sad' in tweets; when he wished 'best regards' to those injured by the car that was deliberately smashed into them, killing 1 and injuring 20. When he acted in that way, he was operating according to his instinct. And his instinct said: Do not attack the white supremacists.\n\nWhat Trump's comments Monday mean for how, exactly, he will handle the resurgence of white supremacists, remains unclear.\n\nAs Maggie Haberman of The New York Times tweeted shortly after Trump's remarks on Monday:
Campaign Finance Law And The Stormy Daniels Scandal\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST:\n\nNow to the deepening confusion over payments made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels by - well, was it Donald Trump, his presidential campaign, his lawyer Mr. Trump says is really a businessman? And did that $130,000 payout violate campaign finance laws? Matthew Sanderson is an attorney for Caplin and Drysdale. He minded those campaign finance regulations for John McCain's presidential campaign. Mr. Sanderson, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nMATTHEW SANDERSON: Thanks for having me.\n\nSIMON: What's the essential detail here - when the payments were made, who made them or why? And can you ever really determine why?\n\nSANDERSON: Yeah. So this comes down to two things. One is - and this is the most important - what was the intent behind the payment? Was it related to the election? The second is what the source - what was the source of money? And I think what's interesting about the last 48 hours is that there's been - the waters have been muddied considerably. So there was an existing narrative about why the payments were made, about the source of the money. And now...\n\nSIMON: That Michael Cohen had made them and the president knew nothing about it, right?\n\nSANDERSON: Correct. And...\n\nSIMON: Yeah.\n\nSANDERSON: ...That it was not related to the election - that it was purely to help him personally and to save his marriage, et cetera. But now with the entrance of Rudy Giuliani and his appearances in media, I think that that narrative is now much less clear than it was previously.\n\nSIMON: Well, let me ask you about precedents. And a lot of people have referred to the John Edwards defense. This, of course, former Democratic presidential candidate who was acquitted by a jury and convinced them that he had made payments. Gosh, I'm trying to remember. It involved the birth of a child to a campaign aide who decided that he would identify himself as the father. And he said, look, that wasn't to save my campaign. It was to save my marriage and the mortal embarrassment of my wife, Elizabeth Edwards, who was, then, mortally ill.\n\nSANDERSON: Yeah. So there have been a number of commentators that have drawn comparisons with that case. I think the differences are that this - the circumstantial evidence - the timing of the payment, most notably - seems to be much more related to the election. Michael Cohen had an opportunity. When Stormy Daniels was originally making noise about their affair several years ago, he could've made a payment back then. He chose not to. They sent just a letter. But shortly before the election, Michael Cohen did make that payment, apparently.\n\nAnd so the - just the circumstances are much different than the Edwards case. They couldn't ever tie it directly to the election. And there was really no smoking gun. We have - it remains to be seen now in this case whether there is a smoking gun. But certainly, the circumstances surrounding the payment would back up the fact that this was related to the election.\n\nSIMON: In the under a minute we have left, ethics and morality aside, if I might make that a parenthetical, how big a legal problem would this be for President Trump?\n\nSANDERSON: Well, it is a - fundamentally, a reporting problem. And the whole reason we have these reporting obligations for candidates is that voters are supposed to be able to look at the finance reports and base their votes on information. That's a potential problem for him, that the report - this payment was never reported. If it was related to the election, it should've been disclosed to the American people in advance of their vote.\n\nSIMON: Matthew Sanderson, who advised the McCain-Palin campaign on campaign finances, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nSANDERSON: Thank you for having me.\n\nCopyright © 2018 NPR.

Sci-Fi Saga 'Arrival' Asks: Can Humans Learn To Speak The Language Of Aliens?\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. Film critic David Edelstein has a review of the new sci-fi drama Arrival starring Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, co-star.\n\nDAVID EDELSTEIN, BYLINE: Have you ever thought about the idea that in American space-alien-invasion movies, extraterrestrials have no problem mastering the King's English? Well, Arrival is different. Communication between earthlings and aliens doesn't happen at the start. It's the source of the suspense, what the movie builds to, because you can't know what ETs want if you can't ask and they can't answer. Are they here to exterminate us? To save us? Who can interpret their weird burbles? A linguist maybe. Her name is Dr. Louise Banks, played by Amy Adams. The aliens have arrived in vessels that look like titanic, mile-high wedges, which hover in seemingly random spots all over the planet. No one knows their intentions. Out of nowhere, Forest Whitaker as a military colonel descends on Louisa's very nice lake house in a very loud chopper and plays her a recording.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ARRIVAL)\n\nFOREST WHITAKER: (As Colonel Weber) I have something I need you to translate for me.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Why are you here? Can you - can you understand us?\n\n(UNIDENTIFIED ALIEN SOUND)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Where did you come from?\n\n(UNIDENTIFIED ALIEN SOUND)\n\nWHITAKER: (As Colonel Weber) And now you heard it. What do you make of it?\n\nAMY ADAMS: (As Dr. Louise Banks) Is that...\n\nWHITAKER: (As Colonel Weber) Yes.\n\nEDELSTEIN: Louise's intrigued. Who wouldn't be? And what follows is a tantalizing puzzle. She goes to the alien ship. Her body is sucked into a long, vertical entryway where she has to adapt to changes in pressure and gravity. Then she moves into a dark chamber where the aliens - they're dubbed heptapods - melt out of a mist behind a transparent partition. The strangeness is intoxicating. The director, Denis Villeneuve, has a gift for making that kind of strangeness seem like the human condition, the real reality. As in his films Incendies, Prisoners and Sicario, he mixes penetrating closeups with chill, blurred backgrounds. It's as if his characters live in a void where they're forced to rethink everything they thought they knew. What Louise senses is that her job won't be to learn a new vocabulary. Mastering the heptapod syntax might require a change in our brains, which might even end up challenging the concept of linear time. Arrival is based on The Story Of Your Life, a short story by the brainy sci-fi cult author Ted Chiang, and the part of the movie that's closest to its source is great stuff. Chiang's story isn't really about an invasion. The invasion is a device for exploring what happens as we move from a universe of Newtonian cause-and-effect into the realm of quantum physics. That idea is in the film, and it's riveting. But there's another equally insistent plot straight from the '50s sci-fi B-movie playbook. Before Louise even figures out how to talk to the heptapods, she must square off against a hawkish military. For some reason, the fate of the entire world comes to rest on a stereotypical warmongering Chinese general named Shang who wants to start blasting before he even knows the aliens' intentions, let alone capabilities. It's so clunky. Thank heaven for Amy Adams who makes even the silliest parts of the movie work. She's a grounded actress, direct, plain-spoken, but there's also something brittle about her, mysteriously brittle, as if there's been some trauma in her past and she can't quite breakthrough into the moment. That quality is perfect for Louise, who seems to be searching for self as well as scientific knowledge. When the aliens arrive, she's in mourning for a lost daughter who's seen in dislocating flashes. Somehow the heptapods hold the key to her past. Her eyes come alive when she first beholds their writing, which looks like exquisite ink paintings on air currents that seem like water, as if squids were doing Japanese calligraphy. When the revelations come, they're shocking and very moving. You just have to put that other part of Arrival with the B-movie general out of your mind. The film is an inadvertent demonstration that Hollywood studios and visionary science fiction writers inhabit a different time-space continuum.\n\nBIANCULLI: David Edelstein is film critic for New York Magazine. On Monday's show, we speak with actor and singer Anna Kendrick. Her new memoir is called Scrappy Little Nobody. Hope you can join us. We'll end today's show with music by Leonard Cohen, whose death at age 82 was announced last night. We'll rebroadcast Terry's 2006 interview with him on the Friday after Thanksgiving. For Terry Gross, I'm David Bianculli.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ANTHEM)\n\nLEONARD COHEN: (Singing) The birds, they sing at the break of day. Start again, I heard them say. Don't dwell on what has passed or what is yet to be. Yeah, the wars, they will be fought again. The holy dove, she will be caught again. Bought and sold and bought again, the dove is never free. Ring the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering. There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in. We asked for signs. The signs were sent - the birth betrayed, the marriage spent. Yeah, the widowhood of every government - signs for all to see.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Trespass, Jail, Repeat: How One Man Has Spent 575 Days in Jail\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Emily Corwin/NHPR Emily Corwin/NHPR\n\nMichael Treadwell sat at the back of a courtroom in New Hampshire. He wore a windbreaker and khaki pants and leaned over his work boots with his elbows on his knees. At first it looked like he was chewing gum — a bold choice in a courtroom. But when he spoke it was clear: He wasn't chewing gum, he was chewing his own gums. Michael doesn't have any teeth.\n\nTaxpayers in Hillsborough County, N.H., have spent $63,000 over the last six years keeping Treadwell in jail for little more than trespassing.\n\nLaw Investigation Into Private Prisons Reveals Crowding, Under-Staffing And Inmate Deaths Investigation Into Private Prisons Reveals Crowding, Under-Staffing And Inmate Deaths Listen · 36:40 36:40\n\nFor years now, his life has looked like this: Trespass in an apartment building, spend 30 days in jail; bother restaurant customers, spend 42 days in jail; panhandle aggressively, spend 30 days in jail.\n\nWhen you live in a town like Nashua, there's not a lot of homelessness there, and it kinda like focuses, puts you in the spotlight, Treadwell says. Especially if you drink alcohol and stuff.\n\nHis charges all come from some combination of being homeless and getting drunk. Still, he says, jail is no worse than the streets.\n\nPeople kill homeless people, violence and everything else, Treadwell says. It can be a very dangerous life to live in. I don't suggest jail as an alternative. Ain't no kinda life.\n\nAt the courthouse, he pleads guilty to public urination. He says he didn't think life would be like this when he was younger.\n\nTreadwell did do time for drug charges in the early '90s. But for years, his ex-wife Sherri Treadwell says his life was on the right track. He traversed the country driving trucks — a job he loved. They had two daughters. She says she remembers the man she married.\n\nHe's the first one to give you the shirt off his back. If you need any help, he's right there, Sherri says. And he has a really good sense of humor. When he has his teeth he has the biggest, brightest smile. It just covers him, covers his whole face.\n\nTo Sherri, the drinking, the homelessness, the stints in jail — they're all symptoms of his schizophrenia.\n\nShe says it started just a year or two into their marriage when Michael began acting strange.\n\nHe would think there's people listening in on our conversations, Sherri says. He would whisper to me in the car, 'Shhh the car is bugged!' No, the car's not bugged. He wouldn't talk on the phone.\n\nSherri says Treadwell turned to alcohol to cope. They divorced in 2007.\n\nA year after getting divorced, Michael walked into a church looking for bus money, and met Jarretta Copeland. Nine years later, Copeland knows him better than anyone — including how bad he can get when he drinks.\n\nHe gets to yelling and screaming and hollering, and he's talking and he's cussing people out, swearing and carrying on and so forth and whatnot, Copeland says. It scares people because they don't know what his intentions are.\n\nIt was Copeland who got Treadwell diagnosed with schizophrenia. Over and over, she's tried to get him into New Hampshire's state mental hospital, and failed. Even a judge's order couldn't get him from jail to the hospital.\n\nInstead, Treadwell continues to cycle from the streets to court, to jail and back again.\n\nHis story is not uncommon. Half of jail inmates nationwide have a combination of mental health and substance use problems, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nSherri says the system isn't just failing people like Michael. It's failing their families as well. Her daughters don't have a dad around. She works two jobs and is rarely home. They miss him.\n\nHis liver is gone now because of the alcoholism, so we know he's not going to be around for too much longer. And this hurts the girls and I, Sherri says. And it hurts me more, because I know the system could have done something.\n\nTreadwell last said he wanted to go down to South Carolina, where he grew up, to get his trucking license back in order. Ultimately, he did make it to South Carolina — he ended up in a jail there.
In Religious Freedom Debate, 2 American Values Clash\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nThe collision of two core American values — freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination — is prompting a showdown in legislatures and courts across the country.\n\nFor some conservatives, religious freedom means the right to act on their opposition to same-sex marriage and other practices that go against their beliefs. LGBT advocates and their allies, meanwhile, say no one in the United States should face discrimination because of their sexual orientation.\n\nPresident Trump is said to be considering an executive order to bar the federal government from punishing people or institutions that support marriage exclusively as the union of one man and one woman. The language is similar to a bill expected to be reintroduced by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah called the First Amendment Defense Act.\n\nAfter a widely circulated draft order aroused considerable opposition from the LGBT community, no further action was taken. Asked recently whether such an order might still get signed, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said only that Trump will continue to fulfill commitments he had made. Advocates for executive action say they do not expect new developments until Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, has been confirmed.\n\nThe debate's heart: What exercising one's religion means\n\nUnder the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Congress is barred from enacting an establishment of religion, but neither can it prohibit the free exercise thereof. The question under current debate is what it means to exercise one's religion.\n\nIf a football coach is not allowed to lead his team in a public prayer, or a high school valedictorian is not given permission to read a Bible passage for her graduation speech, or the owner of a private chapel is told he cannot refuse to accommodate a same-sex wedding, they might claim their religious freedom has been infringed. Others might argue that such claims go against the principle of church-state separation, or that they undermine the rights of LGBT people to be free from discrimination.\n\nLegislation either to uphold LGBT rights or to limit them in the name of protecting religious freedom has advanced in several states, and further court battles are likely.\n\nOne of the thorniest cases involves Catholic Charities, whose agencies long have provided adoption and foster care services to children in need, including orphans. Under Catholic doctrine, the sacrament of marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman, and Catholic adoption agencies therefore have declined to place children with same-sex couples.\n\nWhen Massachusetts (and other jurisdictions) redefined marriage to include same-sex couples, making it illegal to deny adoption to them., the Catholic agencies closed down their adoption services and argued that their religious freedom had been infringed.\n\nOne of the major activities of the [Catholic] church, going way back, was to look after the orphans, says Stanley Carlson-Thies, founder of the Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance. For that to be illegal unless the religious people change their standard, seems to me ... unfortunate.\n\nBut to the LGBT community and its supporters, a refusal to place a child for adoption with a same-sex couple is unacceptable discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation. Those who oppose anti-discrimination efforts are often portrayed as out of step with the growing public acceptance of same-sex unions.\n\nI can't think of a single civil rights law that doesn't have some people who are unhappy about it, says Karen Narasaki, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. But once the country has said, 'Well, we believe that people who are LGBT need to be protected from discrimination,' then how do you make sure that happens?\n\nThe commission's report on the religious freedom vs. anti-discrimination debate, published last September, came down squarely on the anti-discrimination side. The commission recommended that civil rights protections ensuring nondiscrimination were of preeminent importance and that religious exemptions to such policies must be weighed carefully and defined narrowly on a fact-specific basis.\n\nWhen you have two important American principles coming into conflict with one another, our goal as Americans is to sit down and try to see if we can uphold both.\n\nThe commission chairman at the time, Martin R. Castro, went further with a statement of his own, saying, The phrases 'religious liberty' and 'religious freedom' will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Christian supremacy or any form of intolerance.\n\nThe commission report sparked a protest letter signed by 17 faith leaders, arguing that the report stigmatizes tens of millions of religious Americans, their communities and their faith-based institutions, and threatens the religious freedom of all our citizens.\n\nOne of the signers, Charles Haynes, director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum Institute in Washington, says religious conservatives are entitled to make claims of conscience.\n\nWe may not like the claim of conscience, Haynes says, but you know, we don't judge claims of conscience on whether we like the content of the claim. We are trying to protect the right of people to do what they feel they must do according to their God. That is a very high value.\n\nHaynes himself says LGBT rights and same-sex marriage are very important but that supporters of those causes cannot simply declare that one side wins all.\n\nNondiscrimination is a great American principle — it's a core American principle — as is religious freedom, Haynes says. When you have two important American principles coming into tension, into conflict with one another, our goal as Americans is to sit down and try to see if we can uphold both.\n\nExercising freedom to worship in life\n\nNot all faith leaders are convinced, however, that the push for LGBT rights is jeopardizing the religious freedom of people who hold conservative beliefs about sexuality and marriage.\n\nDuring a recent appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations, Bishop Michael Curry, leader of the Episcopal Church in the United States, said he has witnessed the persecution of Christians in other parts of the world and doesn't see anything comparable in the United States.\n\nI'm not worried about my religious freedom, Curry said. I get up and go to church on Sunday morning, ain't nobody stopping me. My freedom to worship is protected in this country, and that's not going to get taken away. I have been in places where that's been infringed. That's not what we're talking about.\n\nCurry's reference only to freedom to worship, however, missed the point, according to some religious freedom advocates. They say they want the freedom to exercise their faith every day of the week, wherever they are — even if it means occasionally challenging the principle of absolute equality for all.\n\nWe can't use equality to just wipe out one of the [First Amendment] rights, Carlson-Thies says, or say you can have the right, as long as you just exercise it in church, but not out in life.\n\nCarlson-Thies is one of several conservatives who support a Fairness For All initiative to forge a compromise between advocates for LGBT rights and religious freedom, but the effort has had little success so far. The LGBT community and their allies have been cool to the notion of compromising their cause, while a group of more strident religious freedom advocates made clear their own opposition to the recognition of sexual orientation as a status worthy of civil rights protection.\n\nLegal analysts are divided in their assessment of the debate. A federal judge, ruling on a Mississippi religious freedom law, concluded that by protecting specific beliefs, the bill constitutes an official preference for certain religious tenets, and may therefore be unconstitutional. Other laws and proposals, however, are written in support of beliefs held by several different religions and thus may not run afoul of the First Amendment's bar on an establishment of religion.\n\nJohn Inazu, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, whose book Confident Pluralism lays out an approach that might help bridge differences between LGBT and religious freedom advocates, says efforts at reconciliation face long odds.\n\nThere were efforts early on about some kind of compromise, he tells NPR in a recent interview. I think those are less and less plausible as time goes on and as sides get factionalized. It's hard to see in some of these cases how there would be an outcome that is amenable to everyone, and so I think we're seeing these cases with us for a long time.

These produced stories including wartime black humor in Iraq, musical diplomacy by the New York Philharmonic in Pyongyang, North Korea, a kerfuffle over the plumbing in Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Pakistani artists' struggle with religious extremism in Lahore, and the Syrian civil war's spillover into neighboring Lebanon.\n\nPrior to joining NPR, Kuhn wrote for the Far Eastern Economic Review and freelanced for various news outlets, including the Los Angeles Times and Newsweek. He majored in French literature as an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis, and later did graduate work at the Johns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American studies in Nanjing.
Crisis Counselor Recalls Losing Fiancé In San Bernardino Attack\n\nNPR's Kelly McEvers talks to Mandy Pifer, program manager of Los Angeles Crisis Response Team. Pifer is the former fiancé of Shannon Johnson, one of the victims of the December 2015 shooting at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nNow from our colleague Kelly McEvers, a story about a man and a woman.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: They met a few years ago online.\n\nMANDY PIFER: I was in my late 30s. He was in his early 40s when we met. So it was a very kind of mature relationship. We didn't jump into anything. We shared stories. We went to concerts. We were best friends. And then kind of really turned it up a notch the last six months of his life.\n\nMCEVERS: That's Mandy Pifer talking about her fiance Shannon Johnson. She was a marriage therapist working here in Los Angeles. He was a county health inspector who worked about an hour away in San Bernardino. One year ago today, Mandy was at work.\n\nPIFER: I was giving a therapy session.\n\nMCEVERS: Right.\n\nPIFER: And I was probably on my third client of the day. And as we were leaving the room, that's when I checked my - I just looked at my phone. And a friend had sent a text. It just said, you know, mass shooting out in San Bernardino. I hope you're OK. And my first thought was I don't work in San Bernardino, you know, I'm fine. So I thought, well, Shannon's out there. But it's a large county, and that's just kind of when it all started.\n\nMCEVERS: It was around 11 a.m. A husband and wife wearing ski masks had walked into the holiday party for the county Public Health Department and started shooting people. The Public Health Department is where Shannon worked. Mandy started calling his phone. Because she had worked as a crisis counselor helping witnesses and survivors of traumatic events, Mandy knew from her training that something wasn't right.\n\nPIFER: I knew when I called Shannon's phone and it went straight to voicemail. And this is after calling it dozens of times. And I just knew first responders turn off cellphones so they don't hear them ringing after an event like this. So I kind of knew he was dead. I mean, that really confirmed for me that he was one of the victims.\n\nMCEVERS: Oh, you mean first responders will turn off the victim's cellphones.\n\nPIFER: Right, so they don't hear all the cellphones ringing.\n\nMCEVERS: Oh, yeah, right.\n\nPIFER: So...\n\nMCEVERS: So you knew when he didn't pick up?\n\nPIFER: Yeah - well, I had a feeling when he didn't pick up. But when it went straight to voicemail...\n\nMCEVERS: Uh-huh.\n\nPIFER: ...I thought, well, this is weird.\n\nMCEVERS: Oh, wow. What did you come to learn about what happened, you know, that day and what he did?\n\nPIFER: I always knew - we talked about his response - what his response would be during a situation like this. I always had a feeling that you wouldn't run or hide. So he just did what came natural to him and covered the person closest to him and shielded her from a lot of bullets. You know, when they got down in his low Southern drawl he just said, you know, I got you. It was just natural. The shot that killed him was to his right thigh. But I wasn't surprised that he shielded somebody.\n\nMCEVERS: Her name is Denise Peraza, is that right?\n\nPIFER: Denise Peraza, yeah. So...\n\nMCEVERS: And she survived?\n\nPIFER: She survived. She's going to be having a baby girl after the first of the year - Olivia Shannon (crying), so...\n\nMCEVERS: After that day, Mandy stopped working as a therapist. She transferred all her clients to other counselors.\n\nPIFER: Every note in my client's file says, due to catastrophic events in the therapist's life, this case has been transferred. I'm not able to hold another's pain right now in such an intense setting, week after week after week. So...\n\nMCEVERS: Mandy says even though she was trained in how to treat trauma, she had no idea how she was going to react to Shannon's death. She says she was in la-la land (ph) for the first month or so, planning all kinds of events and memorials and going to meet the president, which she says was just surreal. After that, the way she got through it was to keep working as a caregiver for her friend.\n\nPIFER: My friend still needed care. And so I just kind of upped the hours I worked with her. She's a person living with Alzheimer's who experienced the loss of her best friend. So together, I mean, we were just a bunch of Debbie Downers (ph).\n\nMCEVERS: (Laughter).\n\nPIFER: But, you know, we have a garden together. We have a dog together. So I just spend a lot of time in flip-flops and sweatpants gardening. My landlord still wanted his rent check. So as much as I wanted to stay in bed and not ever get out, luckily, I had this friend to get me out because she still needed help. And she helped me.\n\nMCEVERS: Yeah, what do you do for work now?\n\nPIFER: So now, as of October, I'm a program manager working out of Los Angeles City Hall, managing the Crisis Response Team. And now I have some insight into what surviving victims go through.\n\nMCEVERS: You coordinate crisis responders.\n\nPIFER: Correct.\n\nMCEVERS: Do you yourself go out sometimes...\n\nPIFER: I have, sometimes...\n\nMCEVERS: ...And do some crisis response work? - yeah.\n\nPIFER: Yeah, you know, sometimes I have gone out. And you know what? It's - it was - the first time wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be because I'm not going to hijack their experience with my own experience. I just know that they have a long road ahead of them, the people we respond to. And keeping them safe in the moments after the horrible accident is really helping me heal, to an extent. It's giving back. And it's a huge word, people were dropping it. I didn't agree at first. But I think it's destiny now.\n\nMCEVERS: I guess when you talk about destiny, do you think about him when you're out there doing this work?\n\nPIFER: Oh, (crying) I think about it every day. Yeah, I hear his voice all the time. He wasn't - listen, he wasn't the softest...\n\nMCEVERS: (Laughter).\n\nPIFER: (Laughter) You know, like, sometimes he was so blunt. And I hear that often - you know, like, good lord, Mandy. Just - this is your job, just do it. And I hear that, and it helps. I hear his voice all the time. Most of the time it's telling me to stop being ridiculous.\n\nMCEVERS: (Laughter) Sounds like a good voice. Can I borrow it?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPIFER: (Laughter) Yeah, you can have it - yeah. Yeah, he was always very encouraging. But he made it clear that he couldn't be the one encouraging me. I had to find my own voice encouraging. I'm blessed to have been left with that. If I talked back to the number of times I hear him talk to me...\n\nMCEVERS: (Laughter).\n\nPIFER: ...(Laughter) I would - I would probably be asked to have an evaluation of sorts. But...\n\nMCEVERS: Mandy Pifer, thank you so much.\n\nPIFER: You're welcome, thank you.\n\nMCEVERS: That's Mandy Pifer, who now manages crisis response teams in Los Angeles, remembering her fiance, Shannon Johnson, who was killed one year ago in San Bernardino.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

How The Diversity Visa Lottery Works\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Michael Noble Jr./AP Michael Noble Jr./AP\n\nSayfullo Saipov, the suspect in this week's New York terrorist attack, is a native of Uzbekistan who came to the U.S. through the diversity visa lottery. It's a system for people from countries that have sent relatively few immigrants to the United States in the past five years.\n\nNow, the attack that killed eight has brought heightened scrutiny to the program and prompted calls to end it.\n\nThe diversity visa lottery program goes back to the 1980s when its earliest version was created largely to benefit Irish immigrants. In the 1990s Congress changed the program so that anyone from a country that doesn't already send many immigrants here can apply.\n\nIn 1995, Darakshan Raja's Pakistani parents applied to enter the U.S. through the lottery. Her mother, a professor of English, wanted to pursue her career here. Raja recalls the long list of documents and certifications her parents had to provide: birth certificate copies, entire academic history, government reference letters, family and marriage records, financial statements, multiple English test results and certificates from the police that the applicants don't have a criminal record.\n\nAnd there was something else. At the age of 6, Raja herself was questioned by an American Embassy official in Islamabad. She says she was asked: Do you believe in democracy or do you believe in communism?\n\nNow you can imagine at that age? I had no idea what the word meant, she recalls.\n\nAfter Raja's parents were vetted, they were entered into a computer lottery.\n\nFifty thousand visas are administered each year through an Internet site and the application period is open until late November.\n\nThe program has its critics. Some say the diversity visas could better be used to reduce the current backlog of people who have been waiting many years to enter this country.\n\nIf I'm a U.S. citizen and I have a brother or sister in the Philippines that I want to sponsor for a green card, that brother or sister will have to wait over 20 years, says Cornell Law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr. And why should they have to wait that long when someone else can waltz into the United States in one or two years under the diversity program?\n\nSecurity has been a concern, too, since the spouse of a diversity visa holder from Egypt shot and killed two people at Los Angeles International Airport in 2002. And now after the terrorist attack in New York, President Trump is calling on Congress to shut it down.\n\nIt's a disaster for our country, Trump said Thursday. The program grants visas not on the basis of merit but simply because applicants are randomly selected in an annual lottery. And the people put in that lottery are not that country's finest.\n\nIn 2016, nearly half of the visas were granted to immigrants from Africa. The highest-ranking individual countries were Nepal, Egypt and Iran, followed by Uzbekistan, the home of the New York terrorism suspect.
Why A Day Like Sunday Hasn't Been Seen In 900 Years\n\nMaybe symmetry is inherently pleasing. Perhaps it is the whiff of cosmic clout. Or it could be that in our divided times, uniting over something as indisputable as the date is just the divertissement we crave.\n\nWhatever the case, Sunday's super-rare date of 02-02-2020, the only eight-digit global palindrome of the century, has people talking, with #PalindromeDay trending on Twitter.\n\nPalindrome derives from the Greek word for running back again, and defines a number, word or phrase that is the same read forward and backward. (Think: Madam, in Eden, I'm Adam.)\n\nPalindromic dates have long been viewed as carrying special significance and even spirituality. Adding to the universal appeal and rarity of Sunday's date is its achieving the eight-digit palindrome pinnacle, working in the cross-cultural formats of MM-DD-YYYY and DD-MM-YYYY.\n\nAziz Inan is professor of electrical engineering at the University of Portland and a palindrome aficionado. Tracing back and looking ahead over centuries, he mines palindromes like gems and says the last time we had an eight-digit palindrome date was 908 years ago on 11-11-1111.\n\nI tell my students they are lucky to have such a date in their lifetime, Inan tells The Oregonian.\n\nWhile the U.S. was marking the palindrome of 11-02-2011, in the U.K., it was 02-11-2011, or just another Wednesday.\n\nBut on Sunday, the Brits got in on the fun. The math department at the Solihull School in the U.K. calculated some palindromic bonuses; Sunday also happens to fall on the 33rd day of the year, with 333 days remaining in the year. (2020 is a leap year and with the added day in February has 366 days.)\n\nIvanka Trump points out to her 7.6 million Twitter followers that most of us won't be around on the the next eight-digit palindrome date of 12-12-2121.\n\nAfter that, it will be 908-year wait until the next one on 03-03-3030.\n\nOther palindromes using fewer digits, like 8-10-18, are more commonplace.\n\nSome couples view palindromes as dates to seize the day and take the plunge.\n\nLittle Vegas Chapel tweeted Sunday, Today marks the first specialty date of the month! Congratulations to all the wonderful couples getting married on this day of 2/2/20!\n\nBut in China, where officials are trying to get ahead of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, the date saw a surge of couples registering to wed, spurring the government to advise couples to postpone their weddings.\n\nThe civil affairs administration said the registration process involves an official portrait, requiring people to remove their masks, a move deemed too risky in the outbreak that's infected more than 14,000 people and killed more than 300.\n\nWhere marriage registrations have been announced or promised for February 2 this year, you are advised to cancel it and explain the situation to others, the notice said, according to VOA.\n\nThe ministry also asked for funerals to be held in a simple and expeditious manner to avoid gatherings of people.
Utah Bill Decriminalizing Polygamy Clears First Hurdle, Moves To State Senate\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rick Bowmer/AP Rick Bowmer/AP\n\nA Utah bill that would reduce polygamy among consenting adults from a felony to an infraction — on par with a traffic ticket — was unanimously endorsed by a state Senate committee earlier this week, despite opposition from critics who argue the law could potentially protect abusers.\n\nThe move advances Senate Bill 102 to the full chamber for a vote.\n\nVigorous enforcement of the law during the mid-twentieth century did not deter the practice of plural marriage, Sen. Deidre Henderson told NPR.\n\nThe Republican senator, who sponsored the legislation, contends strict government regulations have only served to drive polygamous families underground into a shadow society where the vulnerable make easy prey.\n\nThere are an estimated 30,000 Utahans currently living in polygamous communities, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints officially disavowed the principle of plural marriages in 1890, though the church acknowledges that the practice continued and was condoned for decades afterward.\n\nToday, the church excommunicates practicing polygamists.\n\nUnder existing state law, it is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Those also convicted of fraud, child abuse, sexual abuse, domestic abuse or human smuggling or trafficking could also face an additional 15-year sentence.\n\nBranding all polygamists as felons has facilitated abuse, not eliminated polygamy, she added, urging lawmakers to lift the veil of secrecy around the practice.\n\nHenderson also notes the bill increases penalties for bigamy in concert with abuse or other serious crimes, including fraud and child-bride marriages.\n\nWe are basically codifying the long-standing practice of the Utah Attorney General's office: don't prosecute otherwise law-abiding polygamists unless other crimes are being committed, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, other advocates for victims of polygamous communities say the bill also provides protections for abusers, pedophiles and traffickers.\n\nSound Choices Coalition, a nonprofit organization working to end polygamy, is leading a campaign to defeat the bill.\n\nMormon polygamy is NOT A CHOICE, as fundamentalists would like you to believe, the organization's statement reads.\n\nOffenders use Section 132 [of the LDS book of scripture called Doctrine and Covenants] to justify crimes and deviant behaviors; to subvert and oppress their wives and their numerous offspring who have been indoctrinated from birth into believing that a loving God commanded such suffering and disparity, it adds.\n\nAngela Kelly, the group's director, spoke against the bill before the panel's vote on Monday.\n\nTo make this an infraction? You're essentially saying this is an OK lifestyle, Kelly said, according to Salt Lake City's Fox 13.\n\nThe church did not respond to NPR's requests for comment.\n\nIn 2013, polygamist and reality TV star Kody Brown and his four wives, Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, Christine Brown and Robyn Sullivan, challenged Utah's criminal polygamy law. The family stars in the TLC series, Sister Wives.\n\nWhile the family won in a district court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit dismissed the case in 2016, saying the Browns faced no credible fear of future prosecution because local prosecutors had adopted a policy of not prosecuting cases in the absence of additional crimes.\n\nThe following year the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the Brown case challenging the law.
Trump's Election Raises Host Of Issues For Supreme Court\n\nStatements from President-elect Donald Trump raise questions about the incoming administration, big issues before the Supreme Court and progress toward nominating a ninth Supreme Court justice.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nAnd now some questions about the incoming Trump administration - some potentially big issues before the Supreme Court and Trump's progress toward nominating a ninth Supreme Court justice. For this, I'm joined by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Hi, Nina.\n\nNINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: Hi, Robert.\n\nSIEGEL: And first, I'd like you to sort out for us two apparently conflicting statements that Donald Trump made on 60 Minutes. One was about the Supreme Court and abortion.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I'm pro-life. The judges will be pro-life.\n\nSIEGEL: And as for overturning Roe v. Wade...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: If it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states.\n\nSIEGEL: Meaning states could criminalize or legalize abortion. Another legal issue he was asked about - does he support same-sex marriage?\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: It's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it's done.\n\nSIEGEL: So, Nina, in one case, he says a Supreme Court decision ought to be overturned. In the other case, the court's decision ends the discussion. Is there anything different about those two issues in Supreme Court rulings?\n\nTOTENBERG: No. They're both constitutional decisions.\n\nSIEGEL: Marriage equality was taken up a lot more recently than abortion. Is there any typical bias in favor of recent rulings, as opposed to old ones?\n\nTOTENBERG: Actually, the opposite - the longer a decision is in place, the more weight it has. And in the case of abortion, that decision has been repeatedly reaffirmed over a period of 43 years - versus the same-sex marriage decision, which is just 17 months old. And, indeed, while the court has fleshed out how far states can go in regulating abortions, it's not fleshed out how far states go in discriminating against same-sex couples on religious grounds.\n\nSIEGEL: Now, if President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland had been confirmed, that would've made an immediate difference in the ideological makeup of the court. But that's not going to be so with this nomination, now that Trump is going to be president, whoever it ends up being, right?\n\nTOTENBERG: Right. We get a conservative for a seat previously held by a conservative, as opposed to the centrist liberal Garland likely would have been. This, in some ways, is the dress rehearsal for the next nomination, which, if it happens, will make all the difference in the world. Two of the justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Anthony Kennedy, are over 80. Justice Breyer is 78.\n\nGinsburg and Breyer are among the court's liberals. The third, Justice Kennedy, is a generally conservative justice. But he's the author of the court's same-sex marriage decision. And he's been the deciding vote in upholding the right to abortion. So if any of those three goes, you will see dramatically more conservative rulings on these and other issues for a generation to come, at least.\n\nSIEGEL: So how soon do you think it'll be before the incoming president announces his nominee to fill the current vacancy?\n\nTOTENBERG: I don't expect the nomination until we have an official President Trump, until he's sworn in. He has a government that can vet candidates. He can officially give them to the FBI to do a thorough background check.\n\nSIEGEL: And what do you know about what Donald Trump really wants in the way of a Supreme Court justice?\n\nTOTENBERG: Well, people around Trump acknowledged that he's no Supreme Court expert. But he knows what he doesn't want. And he doesn't want surprises. And by that, he means somebody like Justice David Souter, who was appointed by the first President George Bush, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who is anathema to many conservatives because he voted to uphold the ACA.\n\nSIEGEL: Now, during the campaign, Trump actually released lists of people who would be the kind of people he would nominate to the Supreme Court - 21 names I believe. What - who are they?\n\nTOTENBERG: Both these lists were compiled largely by the conservative Heritage Foundation. And the names range from very conservative to very, very conservative. None is a household name. Indeed, some of the most well-known conservative judges and lawyers in the country aren't on the list. But I'm told this nominee will come from the lists.\n\nAnd I would expect that the older ones and the younger ones will get knocked off. And the person will have a track record that attracted Trump and, therefore, will unattract a lot of Democrats and their constituencies.\n\nSIEGEL: NPR's Nina Totenberg, thank you.\n\nTOTENBERG: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR.

For Tennessee Governor Weighing Religious Objection Bill, It's All About Values\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Humphrey/AP Mark Humphrey/AP\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Haslam says he is deciding whether to sign legislation that would allow therapists to refuse service based on religious objections.\n\nIn an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, he said he is talking to a lot of folks to get some input on the bill and that he had boiled his thinking down to this central question: whether therapists could truly leave their values out of their work.\n\nOn one hand, he points out that the American Counseling Association says you should always counsel from a valueless position. In other words, you don't put your own values into the conversation; you're there to help.\n\nBut, he added, I personally wonder ... regardless of whether you're a religious person or not, everybody comes into every conversation with a particular worldview and things that you believe are right or wrong. The question is can you counsel from a totally non-value-based position?\n\nThe bill was approved by Tennessee lawmakers in April and would stipulate that licensed counselors not be punished if they refer clients to other therapists over sincerely held principles, as Nashville Public Radio has reported. LGBT advocates say the bill would make it harder for gays and lesbians to get counseling.\n\nAsked about the argument that therapists should have an obligation to serve everyone, Haslam said, Lawyers don't serve everyone. ... Lawyers right now can say, 'I'm not the person to help you on that issue; I don't agree with what you're trying to do'; and they can turn down that person and they can go somewhere else.\n\nThe bill is part of a widespread reaction to the national focus on same-sex marriage and transgender rights. The state's governor is the latest chief executive to be placed at the center of that national debate.\n\nHaslam last week vetoed a proposal to make the Bible the official state book. He told NPR it trivializes the Bible. He also successfully urged lawmakers to withdraw a so-called bathroom bill, Tennessee's version of legislation that would require students to use restrooms according to their gender assigned at birth rather than one that matches the gender with which they identify. North Carolina and Mississippi have both approved such laws amid widespread criticism.\n\nIn general, everybody should admit the world is changing really fast and it's hard for the conversations to keep up. I mean, it's hard to remember now, but when Barack Obama ran for president he was against gay marriage, he said.\n\nThe nation is trying to catch up with a rapidly changing world. And people aren't quite sure how to define where we stand.\n\nListen to NPR's interview with Haslam above.
4 Things To Know About The South Carolina Primaries\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Bazemore/AP John Bazemore/AP\n\nThe political world is already turning its attention to South Carolina, where the remaining Republican presidential candidates debate tonight. The Palmetto State votes Feb. 20th in the GOP primary and Feb. 27th for the Democrats.\n\nSouth Carolina is famous for its rough-and-tumble politics — in 2000, for example, there was a whisper campaign that John McCain had fathered a black child. He wound up losing to eventual President George W. Bush. It derailed his candidacy. With as wide a field as this one, and the stakes being so high, watch out for more dirty tricks. The primary will likely further winnow the GOP side. Donald Trump has a big lead in the polls; Ted Cruz is hoping to win over socially conservative voters in the northwestern part of the state; Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and John Kasich are contending for the significant portion of establishment Republicans.\n\nDemocrats head to Nevada first, Feb. 20th, but they are already trying to appeal to the largest block of voters in the state — African Americans. That was apparent at the Democrats' debate Thursday night. Hillary Clinton hopes to rebound from a drubbing in New Hampshire at the hands of Bernie Sanders.\n\nHere are four things to know about the state and watch for in the coming weeks:\n\n1. The state contains significant numbers of both evangelicals and moderates\n\nIowa was tailored for a Christian-conservative candidate, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and New Hampshire gave a jolt to centrist, establishment figures like Kasich, the Ohio governor, and it solidified Trump's dominance across the board. In South Carolina, all of those elements combine.\n\nIn 2012, two-thirds (65 percent) of GOP primary voters described themselves as born-again, evangelical Christians. But almost one-third also described themselves as moderate. In Iowa this year, a similar 64 percent of caucus-goers were evangelical, but only 14 percent were self-described moderates. In New Hampshire, just 23 percent of voters were white evangelicals, while a lower 24 percent were moderates.\n\n2. Geography and the state's three regions matter\n\nAs NPR's Sarah McCammon has explained, there are clear, regional splits in the Palmetto State:\n\n-- The Upstate: The most socially conservative, religious voters are clustered in the Upstate, anchored by Greenville and Spartanburg and home to fundamentalist Bob Jones University. On Friday, most GOP candidates were at the famed college for a Faith and Family Presidential Forum, talking up their socially conservative values on abortion and same-sex marriage. Only Trump, who's come under fire for his obscenities and previous support of same-sex marriage, didn't attend.\n\n-- Lowcountry: The more moderate, heavily military and veteran Lowcountry is where Bush, the former Florida governor, is focusing most of his attention. It's where strategists in the state say he could be surprisingly strong.\n\n-- Midlands: In 2008, conservative candidates split support in the Upstate, and Arizona Sen. John McCain ran strong in the establishment-minded Midlands and Lowcountry for a win. In 2000, McCain was also strong in the Lowcountry, which includes Charleston and Hilton Head, but George W. Bush beat him out in the rest of the state to claim victory.\n\n3. Debates could sway the race\n\nSouth Carolina prides itself on being the decider in GOP politics. Before 2012, it had correctly picked every eventual since 1980. But struggling former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had a breakout debate performance just days before the primary there in 2012. He defended against questions about his personal life and wound up breaking the streak. That helped sway much of the support statewide toward him and helped him earn a decisive victory. (Gingrich looked like he had momentum coming out of South Carolina, but a flush-with-cash superPAC supporting Romney, tore down Gingrich as the contest moved to Florida.)\n\nRubio's poor performance last Saturday hurt him in New Hampshire, where he finished a disappointing fifth. He needs a strong performance tonight to assuage concerns he's too scripted and too inexperienced. But if another candidate has a breakout performance, they could grab the momentum in South Carolina. Trump, for example, is already being attacked over his own personal life, much like Gingrich was, but good parrying of those attacks could give him a lock in a state where he's already leading in polls.\n\n4. Black voters will be decisive on the Democratic side\n\nThe South Carolina primary for Democrats will be the first significant measure of African-American voters in a state. Eight years ago, black voters made up 55 percent of the Democratic electorate in the state. Polls have shown that's a demographic Sanders, the Vermont independent, has struggled with compared to Clinton. But coming off strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, and closing the gap with Clinton nationally, Sanders could well be competitive.\n\nHis campaign believes the more non-white voters hear his message, the more they'll be open to voting for him. There's at least some evidence that Sanders is benefiting from a generational divide even among non-white voters, NPR's Sam Sanders reports. There hasn't been any South Carolina polling on the Democratic side yet after Iowa and New Hampshire, though.\n\nClinton has been emphasizing her support in the African-American community, touting the endorsement of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC this week. Civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis was dismissive of Sanders, saying he had seen evidence of the Clintons' work to gain equal rights but not Sanders's.\n\nClinton also led in South Carolina in 2008, but those leads evaporated once Barack Obama proved he could win in lily-white Iowa. He not only carried the black vote 78 percent to 19 percent over Clinton, but he also won with women (also a majority) and young voters. Sanders has been beating Clinton by huge margins with young voters, and even won women in New Hampshire.
Chinese Universities Are Enshrining Communist Party Control In Their Charters\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption TPG/Getty Images TPG/Getty Images\n\nIt wasn't just the fact that one of China's best universities had changed its charter last December to emphasize loyalty to the ruling Communist Party that raised eyebrows. Shanghai's Fudan University also deleted principles like freedom of thought, and did so publicly, as if expecting praise.\n\nFurious students staged a rare and risky protest in the school cafeteria in December. They sang the school's anthem, which praises academic freedom.\n\nEveryone was enraged, one of the student protesters told NPR. She withheld her name because of the almost certain repercussions for speaking publicly on the matter.\n\nTo disguise their protest plans, the students publicized the event as a marriage proposal.\n\nFudan is one of at least three universities that have revised their charters since 2018, emphasizing unswerving loyalty to the Communist Party, an NPR analysis found. They have downgraded or erased language about academic freedom from their charters, while adding a new clause: The university Communist Party committee is the core leadership of the school.\n\nThe move is part of a broader trend that has been growing since 2013, the year Xi Jinping became China's president. From 2013 to 2017, at least 109 universities unveiled their first-ever charters, affirming party leadership, according to NPR's analysis.\n\nThe new charters effectively hand the party ultimate control over the schools' administration, mirroring how the party dominates government agencies.\n\nA Foot In Two Worlds Pushing For Academic Freedom In China Pushing For Academic Freedom In China Listen · 6:56 6:56\n\nSome of China's most prestigious universities, including Beijing's Peking University and Renmin University, have new charters. And Nanjing University, which amended its charter in December, has a prominent international studies program jointly administered with Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAcademic freedom has always been precarious in China, although the 2000s saw a brief liberalization. But since Xi took office, academics say, ideological constraints have intensified, stifling discourse and innovation at home even as China seeks a global footprint in academia.\n\nThere are still some holdouts. For example, East China Normal University and Wuhan University — which have joint-venture campuses in the Shanghai area with New York University and Duke University, respectively — have not amended their charters, which still contain commitments to academic freedom.\n\nBut at the universities that have adopted pro-party charters, say academics interviewed by NPR, the rule change encapsulates some of the difficulties that educators face in China.\n\nI think it is a good thing that charters now reflect reality more accurately, says Qiao Mu, who once taught journalism at Beijing Foreign Studies University. He left China for the U.S. in 2017 after his career was stymied because of his political outspokenness. Why include all this pretty language about democratic freedom and freedom of thought if there is none of that?\n\nTeachers punished\n\nCao Zhenhua has experienced the restraints firsthand. In 2018, he was fired as a lecturer at Guizhou Minzu University after being accused of questioning the current relevance of Marxism in a seminar.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe university party secretary, institute director and local party officials tried to move me to library duties because of my political problems, but I put up a huge fight, Cao remembers. Four professors were docked pay, but because Cao pushed back on his punishment, he was dismissed.\n\nThis kind of ideological thinking is like that of the class-struggle sessions during the Cultural Revolution, Cao says, referring to a violent period in the 1960s and 1970s in China when Chairman Mao Zedong sought to root out political enemies.\n\nUniversities' local party representatives, backed by an emboldened public security apparatus, increasingly call the shots at school. When Yang Shaozheng, a former economics professor at Guizhou University, came under fire in 2018 for writing and commenting critically on Chinese politics, public security officials called him in and reprimanded him.\n\nThey said, 'You can no longer use case studies drawn from reality in your lectures. You also must stop publishing political essays online.' They told me, 'Shut your stinking mouth.' I told them, as a university professor, what I choose to talk about is my right, Yang recounts, his voice rising in anger at the memory.\n\nUniversity administrators did not defend him. Yang was fired that August.\n\nCampus party informants\n\nMuch of the control on campuses is implemented through low-tech means: human monitors. Students say classes are quietly seeded with student party members, who secretly report what teachers and students opine during lectures to party committees and school counselors.\n\nIt took so much effort to say even one phrase. You had to pay attention to people's expressions. One person might hear me and agree. But another person might hear me and report me. I could not give lectures in such circumstances, short of simply reading from the textbook, says You Shengdong.\n\nYou, an economics professor, was sacked in 2018 from Xiamen University, he says, after unknown students reported him for criticizing slogans used by Chinese leader Xi and the growing role of inefficient state-owned enterprises in the economy. Administrators, threatening to draw on footage taken from cameras installed in his classroom, sided with the students who reported him.\n\nNotices at Shaanxi Normal University, one of the three universities that publicly changed their charters to reflect party loyalty in December, detail the responsibilities of student spies, or information officers, as they are officially called. These informants must possess a certain level of political sensitivity, the notices say, and must report on student and teacher opinions regarding school and national policies as well as any major social events.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWe simply keep an eye on things, says an undergraduate information officer at Peking University who declined to be named because of the political sensitivity of this work.\n\nDecember's anthem-singing protest at Fudan University illustrates just how such a monitoring network can mobilize to quickly control small-scale incidents.\n\nA student who created the chat group to organize the protest deleted the group from WeChat, a popular Chinese social media app, in the early morning hours before the event, after his school counselor got wind of the scheme and pressured him to withdraw.\n\nUniversity counselors assigned to students are responsible for their political thought education, to make sure they are both on track academically and also steering clear of political activities, according to university hiring notices.\n\nThe day after the singing protest, members of the party youth league at Fudan University posted a prewritten statement on WeChat: The school anthem remains the same. Not only does Fudan have academic independence and freedom of thought, but it also educates the country's future leaders, strengthens the university and protects the country. The determination that led us to Fudan in the first place hasn't changed. If given a second chance, I'd still choose Fudan. Professors who posted veiled statements of support for the protest on WeChat were told to take their posts down.\n\nI thought Fudan was relatively free. But oftentimes, what the students are told has already been censored from above, says the Fudan student protester.\n\nHow can innovation happen in a society like this? asks Shi Jiepeng, a classical-Chinese expert who is now a visiting scholar at the University of Tokyo. Shi was also singled out by party inspectors three years ago because of remarks he had made about deceased Chinese leaders such as Mao and Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty.\n\nAnonymous calls from people allegedly offended by his comments also began pouring into his department's office phone. Online trolls heaped abuse upon Shi on WeChat and another popular social platform, Weibo. Shi was eventually fired in July 2017 from his position as assistant professor of classical Chinese at Beijing Normal University.\n\nHe says his managers had received numerous complaints from students about remarks he had made in lectures in previous years, but his managers only quietly reprimanded him before dismissing the claims. The problem is not that Chinese students and colleagues are reporting their professors. That phenomenon has always existed, says Shi.\n\nBut now, Shi says, China's political environment has changed in such a way that university administrators are receptive to such complaints and are pressured to take immediate action. The problem is that the political winds have shifted at the top, Shi says, and that shift has been orchestrated by the political leaders themselves.
A 'Home Baked' Childhood: When The Family Business Is Marijuana Brownies\n\nGrowing up in San Francisco in the '70s, Alia Volz's family ran a booming weed-laced brownie business. I had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning, she says.\n\nDAVE DAVIES, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. Our guest, Alia Volz, writes that before she could spell her own name, she knew she was from an outlaw family. In the late '70s when she was a baby and a toddler, her parents had a roaring business baking and selling marijuana-laced brownies. Thousands a month to hippies, artists, office workers and activists in San Francisco. Volz often made the rounds with her mom, selling their wares to grateful customers every Friday. As colorful as that sounds - and it was - it's no less interesting than another story told in her new memoir, the tale of her parents' relationship.\n\nTwo free-spirited psychics who made their way in a city of enormous cultural and social change - the explosion of the counterculture, the growth of the Gay Liberation Movement, the horror of the AIDS epidemic, as well as the assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk and the suicides in Guyana of the followers of Jim Jones, whose Peoples Temple was an influential presence in the city for years. Alia Volz's writing has appeared in The Best American Essays 2017, The New York Times and other publications. Her new book is Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco. Like many of you, I'm working from home these days. I spoke to Alia Volz, who was at her office in San Francisco.\n\nAlia Volz, welcome to FRESH AIR. This book is, in part, about the city of San Francisco. And your mom was there, I guess, in the mid and late '70s. It was a city undergoing remarkable change. Just paint a little bit of a picture. What was going on at the scene at Fisherman's Wharf, the performances? Give us a sense of it.\n\nALIA VOLZ: Of course. Well, San Francisco in the 1970s was coming out of the Summer of Love, this huge influx of young people who'd come out to experiment with new lifestyles. That was very much over. But all kinds of new subcultures were flourishing. The way that I think about it sometimes is if the '60s were a sketchpad, the '70s would be the box of crayons. There was just wonderful and crazy experimentation. Some of it went horribly awry. And some of it was spectacular.\n\nSo the scene down at Fisherman's Wharf was one of the spectacular emergences. There were, actually, at the time, thousands of artists and crafts people who sold to tourists on the street all kinds of things they made themselves. And there was a busking scene of people like Robin Williams and Penn and Teller and magicians and tap dancers and musicians and whole dance troupes - this really elaborate scene that was called the New Vaudeville.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And then, through all this, there was your mom with Sticky Fingers Brownies, the marijuana-laced brownies, which, at its height, was, you know, moving something like 2,800 brownies a week - your mom and an interesting crew of others that distributed these. What's interesting is that this wasn't the kind of operation where you'd knock on the door and get a password. Explain how this enterprise connected with its customers.\n\nVOLZ: My mom came up with this really innovative business plan where she sold exclusively to people on the job. So she would go around to boutiques and restaurants and real estate offices and even medical offices and only sell to the people who were working. They would buy at large volume and then redistribute the brownies through their own social circles.\n\nAnd in this way, the brownies were really all over town. By late 1977, I think, is when they were doing 10,000 brownies a month. It was smart in that there was no fixed location for police to find. The brownies seemed to come from everywhere. And at the same time, it enabled them to reach all of the little culture pockets that were flourishing in the late '70s.\n\nDAVIES: You were born while the business was going. And after your mom recovered from the birth, she started bringing you along on her deliveries. What was that like? What did you learn about how she carried you, kind of how you fit into this whole thing?\n\nVOLZ: My mom, from the beginning, she just sort of took me everywhere. And so in the early days of Sticky Fingers, this meant that I went on brownie runs with her. First, she had me in a front carrier, then on a Gerry carrier and, eventually, in the stroller. And she would hang duffel bags of brownies from the back bars of the stroller because they were very heavy.\n\nSo she would use the stroller to transport the brownies. And we'd go from business to business. And her customers just absolutely adored me and fawned over me. So I was very little. Obviously, I don't remember much clearly from this period. But I do have these flashes of memory. And there's a certain feeling that comes to me when I think of it. It was a very exuberant period in the city and especially in the Castro, where my mom was mostly working. And there was, I think, a lot of cheek-pinching and fawning and a lot of joy around it is the feeling that I get, anyway.\n\nDAVIES: The business was still going when you were a toddler and, I guess, into kindergarten, right?\n\nVOLZ: Yes. Well, in some form or another, it continued until I was an adult. But this original iteration carried on until about second or third grade.\n\nDAVIES: Which meant that you as a kid had to keep a really big, important secret, a family secret. Do you remember being told what the stakes were or how you knew?\n\nVOLZ: No. And I know that seems strange. But it was something that I learned so young that I don't have a specific memory about it. It was always who we are. So I had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning.\n\nDAVIES: And did you know that that could mean prison and, you know, foster care for you? Or...\n\nVOLZ: To an extent. My parents weren't trying to scare me with it. But from a practical standpoint, they needed me to understand that what we were doing was illegal and that if I told anyone, including other children - who might tell an adult - it could have very serious consequences for our family. So I did know from the very beginning that if I told anyone what my parents really did that they could go to prison.\n\nDAVIES: And do you remember ever finding that hard, you know, as you got a little older and had friends?\n\nVOLZ: Not in a very conscious way. Although, I think it did affect me. I was a child who always enjoyed hanging out with adults and was awkward around other children. And I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. As an adult, I look back at it and wonder how much of that might have come out of the idea of carrying a big secret and how that makes you build walls around it and how that makes you shut down, in some ways. At the time, I wasn't very conscious of it. I just - I had a pat answer for when people asked what my parents did. And I knew very clearly that there were huge parts of our home life that I couldn't talk about.\n\nDAVIES: What was the pat answer when kids asked what your parents did?\n\nVOLZ: Artists.\n\nDAVIES: OK.\n\nVOLZ: Which is also true. So it wasn't an outright lie. It was a withholding of information.\n\nDAVIES: And so while you had this secret and you knew that you were an outlaw family, it was illegal, did it ever seem wrong to you?\n\nVOLZ: No. My parents, I think, like a lot of hippies, a lot of people from their generation, saw marijuana as wholesome and harmless. And I was taught that the legislation around it and the government's view of it was wrong and that what they were doing was right. So I grew up with that idea that we were outlaws, but good outlaws - kind of like Robin Hood outlaws. And I didn't question that for a long time.\n\nDAVIES: Well, it came from the people you loved and trusted, right?\n\nVOLZ: It did. And I think that by the time I was maybe old enough to really question those ideas myself, the role of marijuana had changed so much culturally that I had a whole different answer.\n\nDAVIES: You know, you write in the book that brownie crumbs blanketed the floor where you played. Between secondhand smoke, secret finger swipes of batter and stolen crumbs, you - the tots probably consumed a significant amount of cannabis. And there was some drug use among your parents and your friends beyond marijuana, you know, a lot of cocaine. You know, there are people who would be appalled reading this. What's your take on this? Did you ever feel like any of this seemed irresponsible in retrospect?\n\nVOLZ: In retrospect, sure, of course. I feel in general that marijuana is relatively harmless. It's certainly not something that should be consumed by children. And I want to be clear that I don't think I was tottering around stoned during my childhood. I was certainly discouraged from consuming marijuana as a kid. It was grown-up stuff. That was something that I understood.\n\nBut it was around. It was so much a part of the environment that it would be unreasonable to assume that I didn't inhale it as secondhand smoke. And of course, the brownies taste like chocolate, so I'm sure I snuck some. But it's not like I was - you know, it's not like my parents were feeding me pot brownies. I want to be really clear about that. Where I think it might be more damaging is with the harder drugs. Cocaine is a substance that alters one's personality in a fairly significant way. So there's that. But I also want to say that all of the kids growing up in the Sticky Fingers warehouse came out just fine. We're all responsible adults and contributors to society. So...\n\nDAVIES: And it sounds like...\n\nVOLZ: I don't want to be an apologist, either. So, you know, clearly, this was not an ideal situation.\n\nDAVIES: On the other hand, I mean, it sounds like you felt very much loved and accepted, which probably has a lot more to do with how a kid grows up than what they necessarily inhale or eat.\n\nVOLZ: Absolutely. I - you know, I want to say that I was so well cared for and surrounded by love and affection. I was not left to run wild. I was looked after - basically, at my mom's hip through my entire childhood. So there's no neglect in that.\n\nDAVIES: Alia Volz's new memoir is called Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF THE KINKS SONG, THE VILLAGE GREEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with writer Alia Volz. She has a new memoir about her mother's business selling pot-laced brownies in San Francisco in the 1970s. It also deals with Volz's parents' relationship and some remarkable events in San Francisco in the period. The book is called Home Baked.\n\nYou know, the relationship between your parents, as described in the book, is just fascinating. These are two really interesting people, and this is a very intimate portrait of them - their courtship, their marriage - involving events that were, in many cases, before you were born. And I know you did lots of interviews. I'm wondering what it was like to kind of get in your parents' heads, your parents-in-their-20s' heads, and kind of - almost, like, kind of reconstructing a 360-degree view of your early life a little at a time.\n\nVOLZ: So I have a very intimate relationship with my mom, and it's nothing unusual for us to talk about her very personal feelings about things both from the past and today. But I started this book having been estranged from my dad for many, many years. And really, for the first couple of drafts, I didn't ask his side of the story because I didn't know how.\n\nI finally realized that I could not write an honest book without spending as much time on his thoughts and feelings and motives as I had with my mom. And what surprised me so much is how ready he was to go there. We dug through boxes together. We talked about some of his actions from back in the day that were really hurtful to other people. And he was, I think, very brave about it, acknowledging his role in it and also having a certain curiosity himself about both how he had acted and what drove him to act that way.\n\nDAVIES: You write about the first night they had sex, which is interesting both because you know about it...\n\nVOLZ: (Laughter).\n\nDAVIES: ...But also for what happened during the night. Tell us about this.\n\nVOLZ: How awkward is that, writing about your parents having sex? (Laughter). I tried to skip it, and my writing group - that's wonderful - kept saying, look; you can't cop out on this (laughter). But what's - so my father is a grand mal epileptic, and my mom didn't know he was an epileptic. They had slept together for the first time.\n\nIn the middle of the night, my mom wakes up and the bed is shaking like crazy. Here we are in San Francisco. She thinks it's an earthquake. She sits up, realizes that nothing else in the room is moving, that it's Doug shaking wildly in bed, and she thought he might be having a drug overdose. But then he stopped and was sleeping calmly. And it wasn't until weeks later that he told her he had grand mal epilepsy, and he'd had an epileptic seizure in the middle of the night.\n\nDAVIES: Your parents were really interested in the occult, both, you know, psychics, I think. They thought of themselves as psychics. Your mom read tarot cards. Your dad was a graduate of the Berkeley Psychic Institute. He at some point describes a vision that he has for a child. You want to describe this?\n\nVOLZ: (Laughter) Yes. And it was very early in there dating, in fact. He told my mom at dinner that he was carrying a child, and she's like, what are you talking about? (Laughter). But he explained that he was carrying a spirit child. This is a spirit that he felt was traveling with him and waiting to be born into the world. Ostensibly, this is me (laughter).\n\nMy mom, upon receiving this information, after only dating the guy for three weeks, was a little taken aback. She wasn't looking to have a child. So there became a little push-pull between them for a while around the idea of this spirit child, which is, obviously, kind of a crazy thing to write about years after the fact, but I wanted to be true to my parents' visions of what was going on in their lives.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And so he actually, the night of conception - at least he thinks - he told your mom, OK, that's it; you're pregnant.\n\nVOLZ: Yeah.\n\nDAVIES: And I guess they both expected that the spirit child was on its way to the earth. You want to share that?\n\nVOLZ: Sure. And I want to say that my mom also confirms and describes that my dad identified the moment of conception and didn't even bother getting a pregnancy test. She believed him, and it turned out that he was right. She began to show. It became obvious. So that is a kind of a story, kind of a myth that I grew up with. I don't know how many people have these really high and magical myths about their births (laughter), but I sure had one. My dad, however, was convinced that I was going to be a boy - absolutely certain. And because he'd been right about everything else, my mom went along with it, too.\n\nDAVIES: The description of the delivery is really something. I mean, your mom wanted a natural childbirth, and it turns out you were breached. And it was long and arduous and painful. And then the doctor declares, she's a girl.\n\nVOLZ: Yeah.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDAVIES: What was your dad's reaction to this? I mean, he was so sure.\n\nVOLZ: I think it was a blow to him. I think it was a blow to his ego. And the story that I had grown up with in my family - and I don't - I'm not even sure when I was told this - but was that he left the hospital and went to a gay bathhouse and spent the day there, which is a difficult moment to begin with. That was one of the more challenging conversations I had with my father in writing this book, I have to admit.\n\nDAVIES: You said - that was the story in your family. Your mom didn't know it at the time, right?\n\nVOLZ: No, but she found out. So apparently, what happened is that my dad - who can't keep a secret - told Cheryl (ph), the other salesperson, at a point. He just had to get it off his chest. And I think that she told my mom. And then he, later on, during a big fight, he told her in an angry way. So my mom found out fairly shortly thereafter. This wasn't something I was told about as a kid. But I think as a teenager - was when I found out. And it is the kind of story that sticks in your craw.\n\nDAVIES: Well, and what's fascinating is that, you know, your dad - I mean, you write about this in the book - because he would sometimes not take his medication, he's had some really difficult mental episodes, and his memory is not reliable. And when you went to ask him, is this true that you went to a gay bathhouse after your child was born, what was his reaction?\n\nVOLZ: He didn't remember, which seems convenient and perhaps was. But I should say about my dad and his epilepsy that the grand mal seizures would wipe out huge chunks of his memory, and there are many things that he wishes he remembers that he can't. He's a good custodian of the memories that he has, and they check out with my research and with the stories that other people I interviewed told. But there are huge episodes, huge swaths that are simply not there, and this was part of what wasn't there.\n\nSo I talk about my father and I reconciling, and confronting him about this moment was very difficult. It was difficult for me, and it was difficult for him. It upset him. And one of the things that I think really helped us come back together is that when this happened, he got very quiet, and he asked who was saying it. And when I said that it was both Cheryl and my mom who had told me this, he accepted it and took some ownership for the action. It made him very sad, you know, to think of having done that, right? I thought it was very brave of him to allow that to be the story.\n\nDAVIES: We're speaking with Alia Volz. Her new memoir is called Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco. We will talk more after a short break. Also, Maureen Corrigan reviews the compelling memoir of a Vietnamese refugee who fled the fall of Saigon with his family and grew up in a Pennsylvania town. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GUY VAN DUSER'S VIPER'S DRAG)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're listening to my interview with writer Alia Volz. Her new memoir describes her mother's successful business serving marijuana-laced brownies in the 1970s in San Francisco and her parents' relationship at a time of cultural and social change in the city. Volz's book is Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco.\n\nThis operation got pretty big. Your mom was moving something like 2,800 brownies a week at its height. How did she manage the risk? I mean, this was, after all, a Class 1 narcotic. You know, these were felonies every day or every week. How did she manage the risk of it?\n\nVOLZ: OK. So this is kind of, I want to say, a ridiculous part of the story. Although, I think my parents would disagree. But my mom - both of my parents, actually, believed strongly in the occult and specifically the I Ching, which is a 4,000-year-old Chinese divination method rooted in Daoism and Confucianism. And you would consult it in the way that you might consult tarot cards. And my mom believed wholeheartedly in this practice.\n\nAnd so every week, she would throw the I Ching coins and ask about their safety and ask about the risk. And she always did what the I Ching said. I mean, the business opened following an I Ching hexagram. There was a point when the business closed following an I Ching hexagram. There was no question too big or too small to run past the I Ching.\n\nDAVIES: You know, your dad had a habit of not taking his medication for epilepsy, which led to some really troubling and bizarre incidents at times. It was one point where he said he had to go off hitchhiking to meet the Dalai Lama. And other things like that happened. Do you have insight into why he chose not to take the medicine for the epilepsy?\n\nVOLZ: I've done a lot of thinking about this. And I think it's pretty interesting. My dad has a spiritual relationship - or had a spiritual relationship with his epilepsy. He described that in the moments leading up to a seizure, his pre-seizure aura would appear in his peripheral vision as a multi-colored mandala with all colors of the spectrum, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He describes it as being like looking at God. And my dad is such a spiritually serious person that this really attracted him.\n\nAnd so I think he would kind of edge up to it. He didn't want to deny himself that connection with the Godhead that he felt was there. And so he would try to control his seizures internally. At a point, he had a method where he thought that if - when the mandala appeared, if he shifted his eyes hard in the opposite direction, he could stop himself from having a seizure. So he kept trying to control it.\n\nBut he would have these grand mal seizures. And sometimes they led to psychological instability, as well as memory loss. But I find it fascinating because the idea of a spiritually associated seizure is not new. Dostoyevsky wrote rapturously about seizures. And some pretty interesting historical figures have been posthumously diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. So I don't know if my dad might be in that category. In any case, it was a strong force in his life.\n\nDAVIES: Yeah. Does he still have seizures today?\n\nVOLZ: He takes, not Dilantin, but another medication. I think it's Tegretol. And he says he hasn't had a seizure in 20 years.\n\nDAVIES: You know, you mentioned that your mom would often make business decisions and life decisions often by consulting the I Ching, you know, this way of tossing these coins to get a reading on what should be done. I'm wondering, as a kid, did you ever feel like your life was being governed by these forces that couldn't be seen? That ever bother you?\n\nVOLZ: (Laughter) That question makes me laugh a little bit. So as a child, I was pretty accepting of especially my mom's worldview. I had a lot of trust in her. She was always cool in a crisis. And I believed that she knew what she was doing. My parents, I would say, did not use the I Ching to decide what I should or shouldn't be allowed to do. I didn't have a whole lot of rules as a child. I kind of felt like I was part of the decision-making process to a degree that, I think, is pretty unusual.\n\nBut my relationship with the I Ching as a kid was that I trusted it. And the fact that my mom felt confident using it made me feel confident as well. So I sometimes think about how, you know, the knowledge that my parents could have gone to prison at any time, how that should have been terrifying to me as a kid. And yet, it didn't keep me awake at night because I trusted my mom's decision-making abilities. And I trusted the I Ching then. It was later, more as a teenager, that I was like, oh, no. Wait. Science (laughter), you know? And I started to rebel more against the idea. But it's really only as an adult that I look back at the situation we were in and worry about the kid I was.\n\nDAVIES: Alia Volz's new memoir is called Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco. We'll be back after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BROTHERS OSBORNE SONG, 21 SUMMER)\n\nDAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with writer Alia Volz. She has a new memoir about her mother's business selling pot-laced brownies in San Francisco in the 1970s. It also deals with Volz's parents' relationship and some remarkable events in San Francisco at the time. Her book is called Home Baked.\n\nOne of the things that you do in the book is you talk about kind of the history of San Francisco. And in the 1970s, there was all of this kind of explosion of creativity and art and experimentation. But there was also some really dark stuff. You know, the Peoples Temple, which was led by Jim Jones, was active in the city and very connected to a lot of the liberal politicians. And then there was the horrific assassinations of the mayor, Moscone, and then the supervisor, the councilman, Harvey Milk that, I guess, was not a customer of your mom, but somebody that she met on her rounds a lot. How did all of that affect her?\n\nVOLZ: Well, first of all, so Harvey was not a customer. He had sworn off drugs. But his camera shop, which was also his campaign headquarters, was one of my mom's regular stops because other people around him and who were working on his campaign were customers. So that was how that connection happened. But he was very much out in the neighborhood walking around, talking to people. He was very personable and very connected to the community. And so my mom knew him.\n\nThe Jonestown Massacre and the assassinations of Milk and Moscone happened within 10 days of each other. It was like a one-two punch. It just knocked San Francisco completely sideways. I mean, 918 people dead in one day. And then these two very important and beloved civic leaders ten days later. For my mom, it was a seismic shift, a feeling of everything is changing. She describes becoming aware, in an instant, that the wave that they had been riding was about to crash.\n\nDAVIES: Right. And so not so long after, there was - finally, the business came to an end - or at least its first end. Do you want to describe the circumstances of that?\n\nVOLZ: Sure. We were talking about the I Ching earlier. And suddenly, in mid-1979, my mom goes to throw her usual weekly hexagrams. And the passage is really dark. The results are bad. And the imagery in the passages has to do with imprisonment and punishment and things like that. And she became fairly convinced - well, very convinced very quickly that they were going to be busted. And the business was huge at this time. And, I mean, everybody knew about them. It was a little - maybe a little too high-profile. And she became sure that they were going to get busted. So my parents, taking this extremely seriously, packed up, closed up shop. And we moved out of San Francisco within two weeks.\n\nDAVIES: You moved out of San Francisco. And there's an eight-year stretch of your childhood. And you described them as pretty tough. You know, your parents' relationship fell apart, in part, because, you know, your dad would not take the medicine for his epilepsy and had some pretty strange experiences. Your mom ends up reviving the business kind of with once-a-month trips into San Francisco from where they were living outside of town.\n\nAs you moved into the '80s, the brownie business changed in a way, right? It wasn't just recreational because it became a way to ease the suffering of people afflicted with AIDS. And this was at a time when the epidemic was, you know, poorly understood scientifically. There was little treatment. And it was, you know, deeply associated with homophobia. As your mom made these trips to the city, how did the epidemic present itself to her?\n\nVOLZ: She remembers one day in December of 1981 walking down Castro Street, making her deliveries. And in the window of Star Pharmacy, there was a poster that said gay cancer. And it had photographs of a man's legs and feet with little purple spots on them, which turned out to be Kaposi's sarcoma. And my mom saw that poster and just thought, that's strange. I saw one of those spots on one of my friend's wrist today. It just was a little thing. And then, pretty quickly, people started to get sick.\n\nBut the illnesses varied a lot. And there was a long time when nobody knew what it was. Some people got the Pneumocystis carinii. Some people had the wasting syndrome and terrible diarrhea. Some people had the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. The variety of presentations of the symptom made the onset very mysterious. And it didn't get a lot of press at first because it emerged first within the gay male population. And this was a community that broader society was maybe eager not to look at and not to acknowledge.\n\nDAVIES: As you and your mom made these deliveries, did you find people who you had known for years and years getting sicker and sicker?\n\nVOLZ: Yeah. Of course. So as a kid, it was something that I was - of course I was aware of it. You would see - the presentation of AIDS was so dramatic physically. And it could happen very quickly. We'd be gone for a month and come back the next month. And somebody who had been a beautiful 30-year-old would look 70.\n\nIt was really striking, you know, the weight loss and the way that it transformed how people carried themselves. Suddenly, a young man would be using a walker. It was terrible. And then people started to disappear. As a child, I only understood so much, you know? As the years passed, I came to understand what was going on. And people began to disappear from our lives.\n\nDAVIES: And part of the business was actually finding people who needed the relief that marijuana would bring. There was another woman named Mary Jane Rathbun, who had been making and distributing marijuana brownies. She became known as - what? - Brownie Mary, as supposed to your mom, who was the brownie lady. And they kind of got...\n\nVOLZ: Right.\n\nDAVIES: ...Fused (laughter) in the civic consciousness. But...\n\nVOLZ: Yeah.\n\nDAVIES: ...In a way, they had a place in the sort of recognition of the medical benefits of marijuana, didn't they?\n\nVOLZ: Oh, absolutely. So there had been, since maybe the mid-'70s, the beginnings of a medical marijuana movement. But it really had not made it into the press in a significant way. And it was very small. And marijuana was still, in the American consciousness, not considered a medicine. It was considered a party drug. Well, the situation with HIV/AIDS was that the first effective drug treatment didn't come out until 1996. It was 15 years. And this is a disease with an 80-plus percent fatality rate. Let that sink in for a moment.\n\nSo during that span of time when there was just nothing for people to do to take care of themselves, cannabis emerged really early on as helpful with some of the symptoms. Nobody thought weed was going to cure AIDS (laughter). But it helped with the wasting syndrome, which manifested with a total loss of appetite and crushing nausea. Cannabis was good for that. It helped with insomnia, depression, pain. So people began to turn to cannabis to help feel a little better while this horrible, horrible thing was going on. And in the case of the wasting syndrome, it helped them eat. It helped them hang on longer. It became very important.\n\nDAVIES: Was your mom ever recognized, officially, for any of this stuff?\n\nVOLZ: Not back then, and I'll tell you why - she never got busted. And so she certainly wasn't going to announce herself in the press. And one of the things that's interesting in the Brownie Mary and Mer the Brownie Lady confusion - so they were both part of the same zeitgeist. Well, poor Brownie Mary kept getting busted. And she had a wonderful way of handling the press. She was grandmotherly and funny, very, very witty and adorable. And the press just loved her. They just ate it up. And so she, possibly more than anyone, was responsible for bringing the concept of medical marijuana to broader society. And my mom, meanwhile, stayed underground. She didn't get busted. She didn't go to the press. But she worked throughout all of these years to get edibles to people who needed them.\n\nDAVIES: You're in San Francisco today, when the rules are all so different. I don't know. Just reflect on that, how different it is, the attitude towards cannabis and its availability.\n\nVOLZ: Well, yeah, San Francisco has changed quite a bit. With respect to cannabis, it is now legal for adult use. And San Francisco and then California were first in denoting cannabis as an essential business during coronavirus, which was a watershed moment. Nothing like that has happened before. So cannabis is very accessible to people. I feel that, at least for adults, that it should be. I think this is a good thing. But the culture has changed so much around it in ways that I find very heartbreaking.\n\nSo for - you know, my mom had the first really high-volume delivery service. Now you can use an app to summon a company like Eaze and a complete stranger will show up to your door with a lanyard. You don't exchange more than five words, and you pay for it with a debit card. The community aspect has completely run out of the process. The current canna-business (ph) laws are also extremely harmful to small farmers, who were the ones who kept this all going during the '70s and '80s. So some of the changes have really stripped the community-building feelings out of it. At the same time, I'm glad that people have access, especially those who use it for medicinal purposes.\n\nDAVIES: Well, Alia Volz, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nVOLZ: It has been an absolute pleasure, Dave.\n\nDAVIES: Alia Volz's new memoir is called Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco.\n\nComing up, Maureen Corrigan reviews the compelling memoir of a Vietnamese refugee who fled the fall of Saigon with his family and grew up in a Pennsylvania town.

'The Salesman' Offers A Brilliant Portrayal Of Marriage And Vengeance\n\nIranian director Asghar Farhadi's latest film is one of the five nominees for this year's foreign-language Academy Award. Critic David Edelstein says The Salesman is tense and powerful.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. The Iranian film The Salesman is one of the five nominees for this year's foreign language Academy Award, which will be presented at the end of February. But the writer and director, Asghar Farhadi, has said he won't attend the ceremony because of President Trump's travel ban. Farhadi won an Oscar for his 2011 film A Separation. Film critic David Edelstein has this review of The Salesman.\n\nDAVID EDELSTEIN, BYLINE: A woman is brutally assaulted in the early part of Asghar Farhadi's gripping Iranian drama The Salesman. The woman, Rana, is washing up in the bathroom of her new apartment in an unfamiliar part of Tehran, just home from acting in Arthur Miller's Death Of A Salesman, where she plays Willy Loman's wife. She hears the buzzer from downstairs and thinks it's her husband, Emad, who plays Willy. So she unlocks the door and returns to what she was doing.\n\nLater when Emad does get home, he sees blood everywhere. He finds Rana in the hospital where the wounds on her face are being stitched. She won't talk about what happened, not then, not a few days later. The nature of the assault, a description of the assailant, the motive, it's a blank to be filled by Emad's churning suspicions and fears. That blank is central to many of Farhadi's films. His Oscar-winning A Separation turns on a woman's unseen fall in a staircase.\n\nNot knowing what happened makes us consider the destructive social forces that helped put that woman on that staircase at that time. In my favorite movie of Farhadi's, About Elly, a young female teacher disappears while visiting colleagues at their beach house. As they learn more about their absent guest, the focus subtly shifts to the trauma of her life and by implication, the lives of many working single women in modern Iran.\n\nAs much as whodunits, Farhadi makes what-done-its and why-done-its. The director has a detached, rather clinical style, as if he's photographing specimens in a terrarium, the terrarium being a city in which artists have to watch their backs because of hovering sensors. His own social criticisms are oblique. The movie begins with the imminent collapse of Rana and Emad's lovely apartment, a literal collapse, the result of apparently careless citywide construction.\n\nTheir new shabbier apartment has items belonging to the evicted previous tenant and her small child, whose bike is still there. That tenant apparently had clients, meaning johns, and Emad suspects the person who assaulted his wife might have been one or else was sent by the woman to harass the new tenants. When he finds a set of keys dropped by the attacker and the van parked nearby they belong to, Emad wants vengeance. But Rana is impossible to pin down.\n\nHer devastation lingers. She even insists on showering in her old, collapsing apartment. But she doesn't want to go to the police. The inaction in the middle section of The Salesman is excruciating. And there's a broader aspect to the film. Slowly, we begin to see the parallels between this event and Death Of A Salesman, in which Willy's son learns that his dad is seeing a prostitute, which helps drive the old man to suicide. More, I cannot say, except that I didn't draw too many breaths during the last half hour.\n\nI can't praise too highly the performances of Shahab Hosseini as the increasingly fevered Emad and longtime Farhadi collaborator Taraneh Alidoosti as Rana, whose wordless despair gives the movie's final section so much of its power. Farid Sajjadi Hosseini plays an older man who shows up late and all but owns the movie. The Salesman is nominated for this year's foreign language feature Academy Award, but it's unclear if Farhadi would be able to attend the ceremony given the presidential order banning citizens of certain countries from visiting the U.S. He has said, in any case, that he won't come.\n\nThe good news is that the controversy has stirred up even more support for this brilliant and deeply humanist film.\n\nGROSS: David Edelstein is film critic for New York magazine. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we'll talk about the Trump administration's relationship with the alt-right and the divisions he's created in the Christian right. Our guest will be investigative journalist Sarah Posner. I hope you'll join us. I'm Terry Gross.\n\nCopyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

What 4 Voters Want To Hear From President Trump In His Address\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tamara Keith/NPR Tamara Keith/NPR\n\nWhen 2011 began, the worst recession in two generations was technically over, but Annica Trotter, Ray Meyer, and Jennifer and Brian Barfield were unemployed and searching for work. Six years later, their experience demonstrates life doesn't just snap back to normal after a job loss. Their economic recovery remains incomplete and in some ways their story is America's story.\n\nNPR first profiled Trotter, Meyer, the Barfields and two others in the St. Louis area in 2011 as part of a long-term project called The Road Back to Work. For a year, they kept audio diaries documenting their quest for employment. There were successes and failures, health scares and relationship troubles, jobs secured and lost.\n\nIn the past we've mostly talked about the economy generally, and their personal economies, but this time, we asked about politics, too: their view of President Trump, his first month in office and what they hope to hear him say in his address to Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Barfields, both Trump supporters, want to hear more of what he's already promised. Annica Trotter didn't vote for Trump; she wants to hear humility from the president. Ray Meyer, who has mixed feelings about Trump, is looking for a measured address with hard evidence.\n\nThese are their stories.\n\nBrian and Jennifer Barfield\n\nWhat they want to hear Tuesday night:\n\nBrian Barfield: I want him to come out and say, 'Here's what I've done. That was the start folks. And here's what I am going to do. I'm going to put Hillary behind bars. I'm gonna build up our military. I'm going to make sure that wall gets built and Mexico will pay.' ... Everything he said in his campaign, just keep going right with it.\n\nJennifer Barfield: I want to hear him say he's crumpling up other trade agreements and changing that ASAP. That's what I really want to hear. Even though I know he's got a lot of big fish to fry on his plate, that's the one that I want the most.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tamara Keith/NPR Tamara Keith/NPR\n\nThe Barfields met in what was at the time a booming support group for unemployed people in St. Louis. They didn't immediately find jobs, but they did find love.\n\nBrian Barfield, 59, has long considered himself a conservative, a Reagan Republican, and he jokes that his wife is liberal. Jennifer Barfield, 53, did vote for President Obama in 2012, a choice she made after he approved the raid that killed Osama bin Ladin, but she bristles at her husband's description.\n\nBoth feel strongly that politicians, at the national and local levels, have failed them. When we spoke in late 2011, Brian Barfield said there was no such thing as a politician that knows how to bring jobs back. Elected officials were so worried about winning partisan squabble, he said, that America's losing.\n\nIt's no wonder he took one look at candidate Trump and was sold on the brash businessman who didn't always tow the Republican Party line. Jennifer Barfield wasn't far behind. Trump sold her with his tough talk on ISIS and bashing of trade deals like NAFTA.\n\nFor the Barfields, Trump's focus on the forgotten man and woman and getting American factories humming again hit home.\n\nFor Brian Barfield, it's almost as if candidate Trump was channeling his very thoughts.\n\nIt's about time someone stand up for us, he said.\n\nHe was particularly fond of Trump's promise to build a wall on the border with Mexico. You've got new ideas, you're willing to protect American workers. You're willing to help us out, you've got my vote, Brian Barfield said.\n\nBrian traces his employment problems back to 2007, when the Chrysler plant where he worked closed up. He's worked off and on since then but never really recovered from it.\n\nNever have, and I never will, he said quietly.\n\nHe's doing everything I sent him to Washington to do, everything. ... When the press gets upset with him, I know he's had a good day.\n\nHis shoulders and knees are busted from years of physically demanding work. And unable to find a job after years of searching, he finally gave up and got approved for federal disability payments. So I am officially retired, he said.\n\nBrian Barfield has felt forgotten for years:\n\nI have been unemployed so long they just said, 'Well, you don't count.' You don't receive benefits, you don't file anymore, so you're one of the ... 9 percent that just don't count anymore.\n\nThe unemployment rate would rise to about 9.4 percent if those who are marginally attached to the workforce or working part time for economic reasons are added to those still looking for work.\n\nJennifer Barfield is currently among the 4.8 percent officially counted as unemployed.\n\nUnemployed and looking and available, she said with an eager lilt in her voice.\n\nShe works in IT and just scored an interview with the company that is her top target.\n\nThe irony is Jennifer Barfield spent most of the last five years gainfully employed. But at the end of November, a temporary assignment ended, putting her back in the all-too-familiar position of searching for work.\n\nWhen she lost her job, she also lost her insurance. So, on the last day in January, Jennifer Barfield signed up for health insurance — through Obamacare.\n\nShe and Brian go back and forth about whether her Obamacare plan is any good. Because she is unemployed, there are enough subsidies to make her plan affordable (though Brian adds they wouldn't be able to pay for it without his disability money). But if she gets a good-paying job, she'll have to pay the government back. Brian is skeptical and calls it the unaffordable care act. Jennifer said she's thankful to former President Obama for making this option available, even if it is imperfect.\n\nHe went in high gear, and it was so fast for me. I was saying in my head, 'Slow down, slow down ... let some dust settle here from that last thing you signed before you sign another big thing.'\n\nPresident Trump is pledging to repeal and replace the program with the help of Congress. Jennifer Barfield doesn't know how she feels about that. It all depends on what Obamacare is replaced with.\n\nOn this, and other matters, she's willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.\n\nLet's give him a chance, she said. Let's see what he does. He'll work it out.\n\nA month into Trump's presidency, Brian Barfield is elated.\n\nHe's doing everything I sent him to Washington to do, everything, Barfield said, his face lighting up. When the press gets upset with him, I know he's had a good day.\n\nBarfield watches the NBC Nightly News and it usually starts with a story about Trump. The more bad things they say about him, the better I enjoy my day because that means Trump did something right, Barfield said. When [host] Lester Holt's upset with Trump, Trump — I could just go hug him.\n\nJennifer Barfield says she loves Trump, too, but maybe not absolutely everything about him.\n\nHe went in high gear and it was so fast for me, Barfield said, referring to the president's flurry of executive actions in the early days of his presidency. I was saying in my head, 'Slow down, slow down ... let some dust settle here from that last thing you signed before you sign another big thing.' \n\nAsked whether they think Trump will be able to do something to improve their lives directly, the Barfields give very different answers. Brian said it's too late for him. At this point it's about his children and grandchildren. But Jennifer does have hope that I will see changes that will affect me directly before I am retired, and I don't want to retire anytime soon.\n\nAnnica Trotter\n\nWhat Trotter wants to hear: I would like to hear some kind of humbling statement that addresses the elephant in the Oval Office. I want to hear something that says, you know, 'I do understand the power of my position. I do understand the needs of the American people and that I am working hard to remain connected and do what I can to serve.' You know, to actually serve the people and not run the people ... or dictate the people. But that's a pipe dream. I'm not going to hear that from him.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tamara Keith/NPR Tamara Keith/NPR\n\nAnnica Trotter, 31, was the youngest person we met in 2011. And she doesn't just have a job six years later, she has a career. She is working overnights as a registered nurse, making a difference in people's lives one shift at a time.\n\nPart of being a new nurse also is teaching myself that it's OK to prioritize and ask for help and delegate and do the best you can in 12 hours, Trotter said.\n\nBut getting to this point wasn't even remotely easy. She went to nursing school while still working to support her two kids. In December Trotter earned her degree and started working right away, which is a pretty remarkable shift for someone who at one point was convinced she would never even go to college.\n\nThat was the bar that I had set for myself, but then I realized I can move that bar, Trotter said. It's not fixed in place.\n\nOf the four people NPR visited in St. Louis last week, Trotter is the only one who didn't vote for Trump in November.\n\nHe's not my president, she said.\n\nTrump's first month in office seems like a clown show to me, Trotter said, though one with very serious implications.\n\nTrotter finds the flurry of executive orders coming from the Trump White House unnerving.\n\nYou don't play with people's lives, Trotter said, referring to the potential impact of Trump's orders on immigration and federal hiring. I think that before anyone makes decisions so concrete, much more thought needs to be put into it.\n\nI feel that if I came across President Trump, he would disregard me. Who am I to him? I'm a poor person, even though in my world I've done what I need to do to elevate my income and financial status.\n\nHer daughter is named Malia and was born shortly after President Obama won in 2008, though Trotter and her boyfriend picked the name before they knew one of Obama's daughters was also named Malia.\n\nIt felt kind of magical, Trotter said, that I was witnessing history and also that my daughter would have a connection to that history by having the name of one of the first daughters.\n\nUntil January, Trotter's daughter Malia had grown up with a president who looked like her in the White House.\n\nTrotter is concerned about the rhetoric coming out of the administration, the message that Trump's travel ban sends. Not all Muslims are terrorists, and I really think that he finds those two terms synonymous, said Trotter.\n\nShe is worried about what that type of thinking could lead to. It's really sickening because when you have people in power that have those kinds of ideas it can be very dangerous for some and then eventually all, she said.\n\nShe doesn't want her daughter to experience another side of history that we don't ever want to revisit.\n\nWhat she hopes, though doesn't expect to hear from President Trump on Tuesday, is some humility and an effort to make her feel like she is part of his America.\n\nI feel that if I came across President Trump, he would disregard me, Trotter said. Who am I to him? I'm a poor person, even though in my world I've done what I need to do to elevate my income and financial status.\n\nAlthough Trump speaks frequently about the forgotten men and women of this country, Trotter doesn't think he's talking about her.\n\nFrom my short experience with him in government, he's not that kind of leader, Trotter concluded.\n\nRay Meyer\n\nWhat he wants to hear: I would like to see him remain calm, and not go off on a tangent, and focus — focus on the problems at hand and what he's done so far and what he hopes to accomplish. I want him to get up there and act presidential and look presidential and don't pass buck and don't start slamming anybody and just tell it like it is. ... I want to hear what he thinks he's accomplished. And I don't need him to necessarily be optimistic, to sugar-coat it, but tell me what you really are doing. Tell me what progress he's seen, real progress he's seen. I would like to see some hard mechanics.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tamara Keith/NPR Tamara Keith/NPR\n\nAt 61 years old, Ray Meyer has worked in banking for some 40 years, except for the three-year gap where he struggled to find any work at all. In January 2009, the bank where he had worked for five years laid off more than a third of its staff.\n\nI was terminated and I set home and watched [Obama's] inauguration, Meyer said. At one point he even sent his resume to then-President Obama, asking what the president could do for him. He didn't get a response.\n\n\n\nMeyer has been working at his current job for almost two years, not making what he did before, but it's enough. Meyer's marriage, however, did not survive. The extended unemployment, the financial stress, they all took a toll. But he insists he's happy now.\n\nLife goes on, he said.\n\nFor Meyer, the feelings about Trump are mixed. He is thrilled about the way the stocks in his retirement account are performing. He figures the economy will continue improving under Trump. But he is worried about race relations. A Jewish cemetery in St. Louis had been recently vandalized, and he was puzzled why anyone would want to do that.\n\nMeyer said when he voted for Trump, he was voting to have someone run the country like a business. The status quo hadn't been working for him, and he thought Hillary Clinton would just be more of the same.\n\nI just wish that he would kinda get a little bit thicker skin and get on with what he's got to do. He's got a job to do, you know? He's got all of us looking up to him with hopeful eyes thinking that he's going to be not our savior, but that he's going to get where we need to be and on the right track again.\n\nHe's been happy with some of the president's choices, including some of his Cabinet picks and the nomination of Judge Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. I really like that guy, Meyer said. But others like, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, make him shake his head.\n\nAnd then there's Trump's tweeting, the constant talking about his Electoral College win, the claims of widespread election fraud with no proof.\n\nMeyer figured once he took office, Trump would be more presidential than he had been.\n\nI just wish that he would kinda get a little bit thicker skin and get on with what he's got to do, said Meyer. He's got a job to do, you know? He's got all of us looking up to him with hopeful eyes thinking that he's going to be not our savior, but that he's going to get where we need to be and on the right track again.\n\nComedians have been mocking presidents forever, Meyer said, wondering why this president feels compelled to respond.\n\nNo, you don't do that. You're a step above all of us as far as I'm concerned, Meyer said. Who cares? He's the president of the United States. He needs to act like it.\n\nMeyer accidentally slips into the past tense when talking about his hopes for the Trump administration, before correcting himself. Meyer still hopes President Trump can get the country moving in the right direction. But he just wishes the president would stop tweeting.\n\nEvery time he tweets something, I just shake my head and say, 'Oh God, please don't tweet anymore.' Maybe they should take and dismantle his tweet account, Meyer said.
Beyoncé And Jay-Z Present A Unified Front On 'Everything Is Love'\n\nThe Carters, who married in 2008, celebrate their union with a heavily autobiographical new album. Critic Ken Tucker is impressed by the record's easy shifts between hip-hop and R&B.\n\nTERRY GROSS, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. The new album Everything Is Love is credited to The Carters - Shawn Carter and Beyonce Knowles Carter, better known as Jay-Z and Beyonce. The married couple has released a new album that's heavily autobiographical and blends hip-hop and R&B in a way that our rock critic Ken Tucker finds very intriguing.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, APE [EXPLETIVE])\n\nTHE CARTERS: (Singing) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Stack my money fast and go fast, fast. Fast like a Lambo. Scoot, scoot, scoot. Jumping off the stage. Crowd better savor. I can't believe we made it. This is what we made, made. This is what we're thankful. This is what we made. I can't believe we made it. This a different thing. Have you ever seen a crowd going ape [expletive]? Give me my chain.\n\nKEN TUCKER, BYLINE: You can listen to Everything Is Love as the completion of a trilogy. In 2016, Beyonce released her album, Lemonade, which, among many other things, discussed an extramarital affair committed by a husband commonly thought to be her own. Then in 2017, Jay-Z released his album, 4:44, in which, among many other things, he agonized and apologized for being unfaithful. Now we get an album from The Carters, Jay-Z and Beyonce presenting themselves as a united front. Husband and wife, committed partners and musicians.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, SUMMER)\n\nTHE CARTERS: (Singing) Let's make love in the summertime. Yeah. On the sands, beach sands, make plans to be in each other's arms. Let it breathe. Let it breathe. I want to drown in the depth of you, yeah, when the water's so blue, so blue. I need to take my time, oh, yeah, show you something real, so real, so real, so real. Let it breathe. So real. I want to you come inside right now so you know just how I feel, how I feel.\n\nTUCKER: There are sultry grooves all over this album like that one, a song called SUMMER. There's another alluring rhythm in BOSS, a song dominated by Beyonce singing about being successful and in charge. She's the boss of the song title. As a soul music horn section toots affirmatively, she rattles off a verse about how the success and wealth she has is important to her not least for what she can leave behind for future generations of African-American children.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, BOSS)\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) Ain't nothing to it - real one. Ain't nothing to it - boss. Ain't nothing to it - real one. Ain't nothing to it - boss. I pay the cost. Who's gonna take it off? I record then I ball. I've ignored a lot of calls. Click, click. You ain't talking about nothing. I ain't got no time. Got that dinero on my mind. Oh, I got real problems just like you. Tell that trick I don't like you.\n\nTUCKER: It's very impressive the way the music here shifts easily between hip-hop rapping and R&B vocalizing, between Beyonce's deep-voice croon and Jay-Z's high-pitched exclamations. On LOVEHAPPY, the duo swaps lines back and forth, the lyrics playfully pointed. The first words of the song are happily in love, and they seem to have reached a point in their relationship where they can joke - very ruefully - about Jay-Z's infidelity.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, LOVEHAPPY)\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) Happily in love.\n\nJAY-Z: (Rapping) Haters, please forgive me. I let my wife write the will. I pray my children outlive me.\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) I give my daughter my custom dresses, she gonna be litty (ph). Vintage pieces by the time she hits the city, yeah.\n\nJAY-Z: (Rapping) Vintage frames, I see nobody [expletive] with him.\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) Pretty thug out the third ward, hit me.\n\nJAY-Z: (Rapping) Sir acid, like his dad's, [expletive] is trippy.\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) Twinning - Blue and Rumi, me and Solo, how fitting.\n\nJAY-Z: (Rapping) Sitting - dock of the bay with a big yacht.\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) Sipping Yamazaki on the rocks.\n\nJAY-Z: (Rapping) He went to Jared, I went to JAR out in Paris.\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) Yeah, you [expletive] up the first stone, we had to get remarried.\n\nJAY-Z: (Rapping) Yo, chill, man.\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) We keeping it real with these people, right? Lucky I ain't kill you when I met that...\n\nJAY-Z: (Rapping) Y'all know how I met her. We broke up and got back together. To get her back, I had to sweat her. Y'all could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather. Move the whole family West, but it's whatever.\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) In a glass house still throwing stones.\n\nJAY-Z: (Rapping) Hova.\n\nBEYONCE: (Rapping) Beysus. Watch the thrones.\n\n(Singing) Happy in love. You did some things to me. Oh, you do some things to me.\n\nTUCKER: There's been a lot of pop music made about marriage. I'm thinking about Richard and Linda Thompson's corrosive breakup album Shoot Out The Lights, Marvin Gaye's alimony concept album Here, My Dear, and the ups and downs charted in the many songs written separately by split spouses Loudon Wainwright and Kate McGarrigle. This Carters album is very much in that tradition with a significant difference - the classics I just listed were about marriages that fail. This one is about a marriage that prevails years on.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, HEARD ABOUT US)\n\nBEYONCE: (Singing) No need to ask, you heard about us. No need to ask, you heard about us. Already know you know about us. No need to ask, you heard about us. No need to ask, you heard about us. Watch your mouth when you're around us.\n\n(Rapping) Pull up, hop out, wreck. Got no time, but we got Pateks. I come around stepping around on necks. My chica got nicas (ph) upset. Why? Oh, why these - so mad for? They don't want Yonce on their door, Louis slugger to your 4-door. Careful, you get what you asked for. We go to Cuba, then Aruba...\n\nTUCKER: The music on Everything Is Love relies on a constant contrast between instrumental lushness and verbal starkness. This is mass-market hip-hop designed to reach the widest possible audience. And I mean that as a compliment. It's a big, complex goal, one that very few music stars even try to attempt anymore.\n\nGROSS: Ken Tucker is critic at large for Yahoo TV.

Travis Scott's Fortnite Event Draws Record Audience\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Neilson Barnard/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Grammy-nominated rapper Travis Scott performed to millions of fans worldwide — not during a living room set or from an empty venue, but via the massively popular video game Fortnite.\n\nFortnite's developer Epic Games says the virtual concert drew in 12.3 million players, setting an all-time record for an in-game event.\n\nOver the course of the performance, Scott appeared as a towering version of himself which transformed into different globe-headed avatars transported through a series of impossible landscapes. The performance also featured the debut of a collaboration with Kid Cudi, The Scotts.\n\nYouTube\n\nAltogether, the set lasted roughly 10 minutes. (Several encores of the virtual performance are scheduled throughout the weekend.)\n\nIt was a marriage of convenience, brought about by social distancing restrictions and Fortnite's built-in audience, which parent company Epic Games claims stands at more than 250 million players. But even previous to the current distancing recommendations, Fortnite had built a reputation around such events.\n\nLast year, a performance by the electronic artist Marshmello brought in millions of watchers, and other live events such as a Kaiju film-inspired battle between a massive robot and sea monster.\n\nHonestly today was one of the most inspiring days. Love every single one of u guys,  Scott tweeted in appreciation following the event. And I know times are weird for us. But for one moment to be able to have the ragers to rage where ever you are is amazing.
Army Love: A Fallen Soldier's Widow Tells Their Daughter How It All Began\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Mcilvaine(AR News)/U.S. Army /Rob Mcilvaine(AR News)/U.S. Army Rob Mcilvaine(AR News)/U.S. Army /Rob Mcilvaine(AR News)/U.S. Army\n\nDonna Engeman enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1981. About two years later, she left after she got pregnant with her first-born, a son called Patrick. She left having achieved the rank of specialist and having found the love of her life, her husband, Army Chief Warrant Officer John W. Engeman.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Patrick, they had a daughter, Nicole McKenna.\n\nIn January 2006, Officer Engeman deployed to Iraq as part of an embedded special transition team to train and advise Iraqi security forces for a year. One day, while was traveling in his Humvee, an IED exploded nearby. He was instantly killed, at 45 years old. It was Mother's Day - May 14, 2006.\n\n\n\nTen years after his death, StoryCorps features an interview recorded March 2013 with Engeman's widow and daughter, where mom shared with Nicole the couple's great love story, from the very beginning.\n\n\n\nWe were very young soldiers, and we were living in the barracks, Donna recalls. A lot of times those relationships happened, and typically they called 'em a barrack romance, because they didn't last very long.\n\n\n\nNicole: But you and Daddy lasted quite a while, right?\n\n\n\nDonna: We did. We were married in 1983. And Daddy died in 2006.\n\n\n\nNicole: Tell me about Daddy as a young parent.\n\n\n\nDonna: He always had an inordinate amount of patience. The first three weeks of your life you were this tiny delicate little bundle and you just slept on his chest.\n\n\n\nHe would not move at night. And honestly, that was the only three weeks out of our entire marriage that I didn't hear him snore.\n\n\n\nNicole: (Laughs)\n\n\n\nDonna: You know, I always felt so loved, but I always felt so honored by him too. I mean, I was never a gourmet cook. But we could have had mud pies, and he would have said, Thank you.\n\n\n\nNicole: What's your favorite memory about being married to Daddy?\n\n\n\nDonna: Just one?\n\n\n\nNicole: Just one.\n\n\n\nDonna: (Laughs) I remember when we were at a military ball, and we were dancing. And the music had been fast, and then we went into a slow dance. And he was in ... his dress blues. And I remember how he would hold me. Isn't it weird, I still remember what his lips feel like on my neck?\n\n\n\nNicole: If you had a minute, one minute ... what would you say to Dad?\n\n\n\nDonna: I would want him to know, nobody has ever loved me the way he did. And I hope, I truly hope he felt the same way.\n\n\n\nDonna and her daughter Nicole live in Texas. Her son, Major Patrick Engeman, is enlisted in the Army. Following his father's death, he deployed four times.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Slade Walters/IMCOM, U.S. Army/Slade Walters/IMCOM, U.S. Army Slade Walters/IMCOM, U.S. Army/Slade Walters/IMCOM, U.S. Army\n\nAudio produced for Weekend Edition by Von Diaz.\n\nStoryCorps is a national nonprofit that gives people the chance to interview friends and loved ones about their lives.

'Rogue Killers' May Have Murdered Saudi Journalist, Trump Suggests\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nSaudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is still missing, nearly two weeks after he entered the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul. And questions continue to swirl about his disappearance. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was dispatched to Riyadh, while in Istanbul, a team of investigators searched the consulate.\n\nPresident Trump told reporters on Monday morning that he had just spoken with Saudi King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, who he said firmly denied any knowledge of what happened to Khashoggi.\n\nBut Trump had a theory.\n\nI don't want to get into his mind — but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers, he said. Who knows? We're going to try getting to the bottom of it very soon. But his was a flat denial.\n\nThat was a different line than Trump took in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes that aired Sunday but was recorded last Thursday.\n\nIt's being investigated, it's being looked at very, very strongly, Trump said, after CBS's Lesley Stahl asked whether the Saudis had murdered Khashoggi. And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. As of this moment, they deny it and they deny it vehemently. Could it be them? Yes.\n\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment, he added.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, another scenario emerged: CNN reported that Saudi Arabia is preparing to say that Khashoggi was killed in an interrogation that went wrong and that he was supposed to be abducted instead. The network cited two anonymous sources, one of whom cautioned the report could change.\n\nIf the Saudis do offer this sequence of events, they will need to account for why they have claimed, for the past two weeks, that Khashoggi walked out of the consulate.\n\nTrump sent Pompeo to meet with the Saudi king in Riyadh on Monday and said Pompeo may travel to Turkey as well. The president has said he doesn't want the Khashoggi matter to scuttle an arms deal with the Saudis.\n\nIf they don't buy it from us, they're going to buy it from Russia or they're going to buy it from China or they're going to buy it from other countries, Trump said at a news conference on Saturday. From the standpoint of jobs, economic development, a lot of other reasons, I would like to do something where we could maybe look at other things [than canceling the deal].\n\nMeanwhile on Monday, a team of Turkish and Saudi investigators entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, the Associated Press reported. It was unclear whether there would be much of anything to investigate forensically, given that so much time has passed since Khashoggi was last seen.\n\nIt has been 13 days since the event, so surely proving some of the evidence might be difficult, but we believe we will obtain evidence, a Turkish official told Reuters.\n\nTurkish officials have told reporters that they believe Khashoggi was very likely killed or abducted within hours of his arriving at the consulate. One security official told The New York Times that a squad of 15 Saudi men arrived in Istanbul and killed Khashoggi. The official said one of the men had brought along a bone saw for dismembering the body.\n\nThe Saudi government has repeatedly denied any involvement in the journalist's disappearance and in a statement Sunday warned that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action.\n\nKhashoggi, who recently has been living in Virginia and writing columns for The Washington Post, hasn't been seen since Oct. 2, when he entered the Saudi Consulate to handle paperwork for his upcoming marriage.
North Carolina, Justice Department Countersue Over 'Bathroom Law'\n\nA civil rights case over the state's LGBT law proceeds. David Greene talks to Theodore Shaw, head of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina School of Law at Chapel Hill.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nAnd let's turn to that confrontation between the Department of Justice and the state of North Carolina. Each filed lawsuits against the other yesterday over a law known as House Bill Two. That state law says government buildings plus public schools and universities must restrict bathrooms and locker rooms according to one's sex on a birth certificate. Yesterday, North Carolina's Republican Gov. Patrick McCrory announced his lawsuit, saying the Justice Department lacks the authority to intervene.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPAT MCCRORY: We believe a court, rather than a federal agency, should tell our state, our nation and employers across the country what the law requires.\n\nGREENE: And by afternoon, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch answered with a federal lawsuit against the state, saying HB2 violates the Civil Rights Act.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLORETTA LYNCH: This law provides no benefit to society, and all it does is harm innocent Americans.\n\nGREENE: We spoke this morning with professor Ted Shaw. He is head of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina School of Law in Chapel Hill. We asked him to help us understand exactly what's being debated when it comes to civil rights. It sounds like discrimination is against federal law when it comes to genders. Is the central question now whether gender should be interpreted as including the gender one chooses for theirself and not the sex based on the birth certificate? Is that what's really in question here?\n\nTED SHAW: That certainly is in question. And I guess that transgender people would say that they don't really choose their gender, that their gender is a matter of both biology but some other matters that go beyond genitalia. But that's - yeah, that's at the core of this confrontation.\n\nGREENE: Now the state of North Carolina is basically accusing the Obama administration of trying to rewrite laws, suggesting that this should be left to Congress and that the Obama administration has an agenda here that they're trying to put forth. I mean, does the state have an argument there?\n\nSHAW: Well, the state makes an argument, and how strong that argument is is up for grabs. The state cites federal court decisions that say that gender does not include sexual orientation or transgender and that transgender people are not a protected classification of people under federal civil rights laws. So - and it's part of the culture wars that have been going on. For people who are civil rights advocates, they've been clear for some time now that discrimination on the basis of who and what people are goes against our most basic and fundamental laws. And even the Supreme Court, which has been a conservative Supreme Court, has, of course, moved with respect to sexual orientation to ban discrimination in the context of marriage.\n\nGREENE: Well, professor, if I might just ask you about an opinion piece that you wrote for the Charlotte Observer, you said your vision for civil rights has shifted over time and that there was a time when you would've watched from the sidelines discrimination against LGBT people and thought that it wasn't your battle. What's changed now?\n\nSHAW: Well, when I wrote that, what I meant was that I was focused on the battles on behalf of African-Americans. Over time, as a civil rights lawyer, I came to realize that we have to be opposed to the subordination of people because of who and what they are, even if we're not part of that group. But I simply think that discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation and, in this instance, specifically transgender people, is simply wrong. It should be wrong. It's a matter of law. And I think as a country, we've been growing in our understanding of our values and principles with respect to discrimination and how we treat our fellow citizens and how we want to be treated ourselves, all of us, whether it's on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, age, our religion, on and on. It's just growth.\n\nGREENE: When you say it's just growth, it makes me want to ask you if conversations around, you know, same-sex marriage that we've seen in recent years and the Supreme Court decision on that and the conversations around this law, I mean, are - as sensitive and infuriating as some of these conversations can be to some people on both sides, I mean, is there an argument that these conversations are just good for society to have as time evolves?\n\nSHAW: Well, I think these conversations are good to have. I think they're important to have as we deepen our understanding of what our national values and principles are. The question to me isn't whether we have these conversations. It's how we have these conversations. And I guess what disturbs me - I know what disturbs me - is when some people are treated as if they are not legitimate members of our society. That troubles me and its tone and its tenor. So that's part of a larger problem that we're having as a nation in this strange time in which we find ourselves.\n\nGREENE: OK, we've been speaking with Ted Shaw. He's a distinguished professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, where he also directs the Center for Civil Rights. Professor, thanks so much for joining us this morning.\n\nSHAW: Thank you.\n\nCopyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

How To Date During A Global Pandemic\n\nDating during a pandemic is hard. Two experts take listener questions on how to do it well.\n\nAUDIE CORNISH, HOST:\n\nDating during a pandemic is tough. And with Valentine's Day coming up, we asked you what questions you have about finding love or keeping love alive in your current relationship. As a heads up, some of our discussion will be sexually explicit.\n\nAll right. So to help us talk through our questions, I'm joined by Dr. Lexx Brown-James. She's a marriage and family therapist and sexologist based in St. Louis. Welcome back to the program.\n\nLEXX BROWN-JAMES: Thank you for having me.\n\nCORNISH: And we also have NPR host Sam Sanders of It's Been A Minute fame with us.\n\nWelcome, Sam.\n\nSAM SANDERS, BYLINE: Hi. It's good to be here, although I'm still scratching my head saying, why me for romance and love questions?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSANDERS: Because, Audie, we're friends. You probably already kind of know this. My love life is like the end of a Michael Bay movie. A lot of explosions...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSANDERS: ...Destruction and ultimately unfulfilling.\n\nCORNISH: Well, now that Sam has established his credentials...\n\nBROWN-JAMES: (Laughter).\n\nCORNISH: ...Dr. Lexx Brown-James, can I just ask you briefly, have you been getting a lot of romantic questions, issues coming up in your therapy?\n\nBROWN-JAMES: All the therapists, all the sexologists I know who do relationships have been booked and busy since last March.\n\nCORNISH: OK. We'll be leaning on your expertise for sure. But first, I want to start with you, Sam. You've been talking about love in the time of COVID a lot on your show, right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. You know, we had an episode on my show all about how to date in the time of corona. We've talked to mental health experts all throughout the pandemic about how to just deal with life as well. And the one universal theme I've been hearing is the only way to get through this is to forgive yourself and to be kind to yourself. All of this is new. Give yourself a hug and just push forward. I guess, like, that's my generic advice for everything right now, but especially for the love life.\n\nCORNISH: Be kind to yourself. That's a good note to start on. I've got a few questions for you both here from listeners. This one is from Jack Gentile. He's 21 and from Illinois. He says that dating has understandably been unusual, but he's trying. And he recently joined Tinder and went on his first date since quarantine started. Here's how he's feeling about it.\n\nJACK GENTILE: Everyone has spent last year trying to get more comfortable being alone or being by themselves. And so now that the vaccine is starting to come out, we're sort of going back to normal. So how do you start to feel comfortable being with other people?\n\nCORNISH: Dr. Lexx Brown-James, I want to start with you because in a way, this is a hopeful question, right? It's about looking ahead.\n\nBROWN-JAMES: Mmm hmm. Mmm hmm. I would say for Jack and for everybody, learning to be by yourself is actually integral, and I want him to hold on to that. When they start to date, they're not going to lose themselves in somebody else's ish (ph). It's like, well, I don't really like this. I can be by myself and be OK. That is an integral tool to have when starting to seek out relationship.\n\nNow, to start to build relationship, I want him to not, like, scuba dive soul-deep into risk-taking and vulnerability. I want them to dip their toe. So very small risk-taking is a key to start building up trust.\n\nCORNISH: Sam, to you - this question of how one starts to feel comfortable being with other people.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Well, I got to say, as someone who has been living with just my dog and working remotely at home for several months now, I've seen myself change. And a thing that I'm trying to grapple with and be OK with is that, like, our new normal post pandemic probably won't be our old normal. And so as I enter into dating or enter into friendships or try to go back into the world, I have to be OK with myself and forgive myself for things not being the same old normal they were.\n\nCORNISH: All right. Now, I want to move to a question from Rachel Crugg. She got engaged last fall. And to her surprise, the pandemic actually brought her closer to her fiance. They aren't sick of seeing each other, but there is some monotony.\n\nRACHEL CRUGG: How do we keep our relationship fun and special when we see each other every day in kind of our laziest selves?\n\nCORNISH: I love getting this question at the start of their marriage. I don't have the heart to tell her that...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCORNISH: ...This question is relevant in the pandemic age and not.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCORNISH: But Dr. Lexx Brown-James, you've been seeing couples. What are you telling them?\n\nBROWN-JAMES: So one thing - and some people hate me for this, but I'm a go ahead and say it because I tell everybody to do that - I take sex off the table. So we can build up arousal, let's plan to do something funny every day. So we're laughing together. We're touching. Let's look at just making out. Kissing starts to decrease the longer that people are together, which are a million nerve endings that are not being tantalized on a regular basis. So let's just go for broke and have a make-out session midday for our, quote-unquote, lunch. And it doesn't have to go further than that.\n\nCORNISH: Now, staying with the theme of keeping a relationship exciting, our next question comes from someone in a long-distance relationship. Clark is from New York. He asked that we use his first name only because his question has to do with sex. Now, he lives a few hours away from his girlfriend. They just started dating. And they're only able to see each other once a month.\n\nCLARK: One of the things missing is, you know, the sexy times. Like, what's out there to kind of spark that when it is a month between each time we see each other?\n\nBROWN-JAMES: So, yeah, there are a couple of ways we can do this, right? Yes, it can get monotonous through Zoom. And we can spice things up. If you have the affordability to do it, there are long-distance sex toys that you can use that will send a vibration to your partner...\n\nCORNISH: I'm sorry, what now? This is news you can use.\n\nBROWN-JAMES: Yeah. There are long-distance sex toys (laughter) that - they connect to an app. So you can send a, hey, how you doing, boo, to your lover, right?\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nBROWN-JAMES: And then when you're together, you have all of that arousal built up so you can do what you want to do and you can be just a regular couple and hang out. Like, we've done all the sexy things. We're tired. Let's just eat pizza and watch Netflix and hang out.\n\nSANDERS: I have a more practical question or a suggestion for Clark. Like, this pandemic year has changed the ways in which we have to be here or there to work for a lot of us. And so maybe there's a way that they can just build in a little more together time physically, more than once a month. I don't know.\n\nCORNISH: Speaking of which, we got quite a few questions about virtual dates, how to make them less awkward, more fun. Could either of you jump in here with some creative ideas for virtual dates?\n\nBROWN-JAMES: Sam, I'll let you start.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter) I mean, you could...\n\nCORNISH: OK, it sounds like Sam's going to need some help for Valentine's Day weekend.\n\nBROWN-JAMES: OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCORNISH: I'm sensing a theme here.\n\nSANDERS: I should have just brought my questions for the good doctor because I got a few.\n\nCORNISH: You should have just brought your questions.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSANDERS: Listen.\n\nCORNISH: Last word goes to Dr. Lexx Brown-James.\n\nBROWN-JAMES: So Valentine's Day is hard. I've even been thinking about this for my lover and myself, right? Do I put on, like, something sexy and - I don't feel like it. We tired over here. So (laughter) what do we do? Look for things that you can do together. Like, try and maybe send somebody a meal. Maybe you have the same meal together. Maybe you take a cooking class. But you can do things even though you're individually separated, but you're still sharing an experience and working towards the goal.\n\nCORNISH: That's Dr. Lexx Brown-James, marriage and family therapist and sexologist based in St. Louis.\n\nThank you.\n\nBROWN-JAMES: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nCORNISH: And Sam Sanders, host of NPR's It's Been A Minute.\n\nThank you so much, Sam.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you, Audie. This was fun.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF BNNY RBBT'S BIG WORLD)\n\nCopyright © 2021 NPR. All rights reserved.

'Fosse/Verdon' Surges With Creativity, Excitement And Dance\n\nFX's new drama tells the story of the complex partnership between choreographer Bob Fosse and dancer Gwen Verdon. Married, then divorced, their lives remained connected professionally for decades.\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm TV critic David Bianculli, sitting in for Terry Gross. Today's show is dominated by song and dance. First up, we'll listen back to an archive interview with Gwen Verdon, the Broadway actress and dancer who electrified audiences in everything from Can-Can and Damn Yankees to Chicago. Along with one of her husbands, choreographer and film director Bob Fosse, she's the subject of a new FX miniseries called Fosse/Verdon, which premieres next Tuesday. Let's begin with my review of FX's Fosse/Verdon.\n\nIf you're a musical theater fan, just the title Fosse/Verdon is enough to make this new FX miniseries one of the most exciting TV prospects of the year. Gwen Verdon, who originated the onstage characters of Lola in Damn Yankees and Roxie Hart in Chicago, was one of the best dancers on Broadway. Bob Fosse's particular style as both choreographer and movie director was dazzlingly different and, captured in such films as Cabaret, still crackles with energy. This eight-part drama sets out to tell how they met, collaborated, fell in love, got married and had a daughter. But that's only part of the story, which is about a relationship that keeps going long after the marriage has been dissolved.\n\nTwo of the executive producers of Fosse/Verdon should be noted at the start. One is Nicole Fosse, the real-life daughter of Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon. Another is Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose Broadway success with Hamilton has been nothing short of phenomenal. His presence alone suggests that the musical numbers recreated here will be done with precision and reverence, and they are. And while her presence dictates that this biography of her parents is authorized, it is not an entirely flattering portrayal of either of them. The portrayals, however, are so good, it's almost a relief.\n\nGwen Verdon is played by Michelle Williams, who's come a long way from the WB's Dawson's Creek, and she was good even there. In Manchester By The Sea, Brokeback Mountain and My Week With Marilyn, she's shown her versatility and sensitivity. And when I saw her take a turn starring in the recent Broadway revival of Cabaret, she was one of the best Sallys (ph) I saw at the Roundabout Theatre, and I saw them all. And speaking of versatility, Bob Fosse is played by Sam Rockwell, who's done terrific work in everything from Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind and Galaxy Quest to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\n\nIn Fosse/Verdon, these two inhabit their roles completely and convincingly. The story isn't rolled out sequentially. It starts with the filming of Sweet Charity and keeps hopping backwards and forwards, revealing bits of their past a scene at a time. So I'm not doing any spoiling here by presenting a scene from when after the couple is separated but still seeking support and advice from each other. He visits her after a day working on the movie Cabaret, and she welcomes him warmly at first, but not for long. Any worries about this drama taking it too easy on the characters are instantly alleviated.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, FOSSE/VERDON)\n\nSAM ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) I saw a cut in the movie.\n\nMICHELLE WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) What's wrong with the movie?\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) Oh, just a few things. The numbers are flat. The story doesn't make - there is no story. What is the story? I'm going to see if they'll let me reshoot the whole thing. You think they'll spring for it?\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) You felt the same way after you saw the first cut of Charity.\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) Yeah, look how well that turned out. I was thinking maybe you could come to the editing room for a few weeks, you know, and maybe you'd see some things that I don't see. I'm feeling a little lost right now.\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) I can't.\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) Why not?\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Didn't I tell you? I found a play.\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) Oh.\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) I'm going to be in rehearsals.\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) A play, yes. A straight play?\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Yes.\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) Oh.\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) So it's called Children! Children! It's from a brand-new writer. It's a terrific part, and then the play is just phenomenal.\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) Well, that's - congratulations. When do you start?\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Mel is setting up a meeting with the director first. I just want to make sure we have a good rapport and we can establish trust 'cause it's a difficult role.\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) You're going to hate it.\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) I don't know why you would say that to me.\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) When's the last time you acted?\n\nWILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) An hour ago when you walked in the door. How'd I do?\n\nROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) That's very funny.\n\nBIANCULLI: FX has made half of Fosse/Verdon available for preview. That's enough to recommend it highly, but not quite enough to allow for the rendering of a final verdict. I really like that it makes room for some of Fosse's famous friends, like Neil Simon and Paddy Chayefsky, played respectively by Nate Corddry and Norbert Leo Butz. And while I'm intrigued by others, like Margaret Qualley as Ann Reinking, I need to see more to see how this all plays out. That's because Fosse/Verdon, written and directed by a tag team of other producers and executive producers - including Thomas Kail, Steven Levenson, Joel Fields and Charlotte Stoudt - is all over the place, emotionally and artistically. It recreates scenes from classic stage shows and movies while framing them within a frenetic, sometimes fantasy narrative. That's exactly what Bob Fosse himself did while directing the 1979 movie All That Jazz, which was his barely fictionalized story of his own physical breakdown while juggling work on several simultaneous projects.\n\nThis FX series isn't just an homage to All That Jazz. It plays almost like an expanded director's cut, with Verdon's half of the story given equal prominence. But the difference is Bob Fosse's All That Jazz was all Bob Fosse's vision and voice. And I know how he ended All That Jazz - boldly and brilliantly. With Fosse/Verdon, I still haven't seen anything from the Chicago musical or anything else from the later years, yet I'm very eager to see what Fosse/Verdon presents in its second half because the first handful of episodes, like the musical numbers they recreate, are surging with creativity and excitement. It's showtime.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, MEIN HERR)\n\nKELLI BARRETT: (Singing) Don't dab your eye, mein herr, or wonder why, mein herr. I've always said that I was a rover. You mustn't knit your brow.

Trump Fires Acting Attorney General For Refusing To Defend Immigration Order\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 10:30 p.m. ET\n\n\n\nPresident Trump has fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, concluding she has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to defend his executive order that imposes a temporary ban on refugees and visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries.\n\nIn a statement, the White House called Yates, an Obama administration holdover with 27 years of experience prosecuting corrupt public officials and the man who bombed the Atlanta Olympic park, weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.\n\nThe Trump administration immediately named Dana Boente, the top federal prosecutor in suburban Virginia, the interim attorney general. Boente, a veteran government lawyer with decades of experience, will serve until Trump's nominee, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nLess than two weeks after his inauguration, and only hours after Yates sent a message to department lawyers announcing that she would not defend Trump's order restricting travel and immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the new president removed the nation's top law enforcement officer in a move not seen since the Nixon era.\n\nThree sources close to the Justice Department confirmed that Yates, who had been planning to leave the department in a few days anyway after her successor won confirmation, knew her decision to speak out could lead to termination. But, the sources said, after agonizing over the situation, she felt strongly that the immigration order could represent a thinly veiled effort to target a particular religious group, and that was worth taking a stand.\n\nIn a bombshell letter to Justice Department attorneys working on cases filed by refugees and visa holders delivered around 5 p.m. Monday, Yates said she was not convinced about the legality of Trump's decision to block travelers from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia for 90 days; to suspend new refugee admissions; and to ban the acceptance of Syrian refugees indefinitely.\n\nHer letter cited a sense of responsibility for both law and justice:\n\nMy responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful. Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.\n\nJustice lawyers had been in courts all over the country this past weekend on the opposing side of refugees and travelers, sometimes making weak arguments and stating they didn't have enough information about the executive order and its legal underpinnings.\n\nThe Justice Department confirmed its Office of Legal Counsel had done a review of the order to determine whether it was on its face, lawful, and properly drafted.\n\nBut the objections Yates raised in her letter pointed out that the OLC review didn't consider statements made by an administration or its surrogates...that may bear on the order's purpose.\n\nThat passage appeared to refer to comments by Trump about the plight of Christians in the Middle East, and to remarks by Rudy Giuliani, who told Fox News that Trump had wanted to impose a Muslim ban but wanted advisers to find a way to do it legally. Immigrants rights advocates said Giuliani's words could offer them evidence to prove the administration had a discriminatory purpose.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee blasted Trump for trying to silence Yates and predicted the confirmation of his nominee to lead the Justice Department would get tougher. Many top former DOJ officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. and civil rights chief Tom Perez, tweeted messages of support. Person of integrity/attorney with great legal skill, Holder wrote. Her judgment should be trusted.\n\nBut some DOJ veterans and law professors found some fault with how she handled the conflict over the immigration order. On the Lawfare blog, professor Jack Goldsmith pointed out that Yates had not clearly determined the immigration order was unconstitutional or cited other legitimate bases for refusing to defend it.\n\nGoldsmith wrote: she wrote a letter that appears to depart sharply from the usual criteria that an Attorney General would apply in deciding whether to defend an EO in court. As such, the letter seems like an act of insubordination that invites the President to fire her. Which he did.\n\nThe order set off chaos — and protests — across the country as many people with valid visas and legal U.S. residents with green cards were denied entry and threatened with deportation. On Saturday night, federal Judge Ann Donnelly issued a stay on the deportations of valid visa holders.\n\nLee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, said of Yates' action: This is a remarkable but welcome development and sends a powerful message that there's something very wrong with a Muslim ban.\n\nAs the news was breaking of the directive from Yates, Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told MSNBC's Greta Van Susteren that Yates' decision was a further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become.\n\nAnd inside the White House, Trump tweeted about Democratic obstruction of his nominees, Now have an Obama AG. Less than two hours later, Yates was out of a job, notified of the White House decision via a typed letter from an assistant to the president.\n\nHer successor, Boente, pledged to defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected, including the immigration order, which his office in Virginia has been working on for days.\n\nIt's very unusual for the Justice Department to refuse to defend a law or an executive order, though it isn't unprecedented. During the Obama administration, for example, top officials decided not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. The Supreme Court eventually ruled in favor of same-sex marriage.\n\nUnder the law, as acting attorney general, Boente will be able to sign Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants.
'Love, Loss' And Spicy Pickles In Padma Lakshmi's New Memoir\n\nLove, Loss, and What We Ate by Padma Lakshmi Hardcover, 325 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nPadma Lakshmi is probably best known as the host of the TV show Top Chef on Bravo, but she's also worked as a model and an actress. Lakshmi was born in India, and moved to America to be with her mother, who'd moved to the States after the breakup of her arranged marriage.\n\nRaised between two countries, she developed a love of food and family. And then, in her 20s, she met and fell in love with the author Salman Rushdie.\n\nHe's an extremely brilliant and charming and layered and complicated man, she tells NPR's Rachel Martin. If you're someone who's like me, and especially Indian, it's sort of like meeting Hemingway in your twenties, you know?\n\nLakshmi came out the other side of that marriage, had a child, lost a partner to brain cancer — and still kept working on TV and writing cookbooks. She writes about it all in a new memoir: Love, Loss and What We Ate.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn being a supertaster\n\nFrom my earliest childhood memories I can remember being in the kitchen, and my grandmother and my aunts and my older cousins, and my mother, certainly, all taught me about food. I only found out recently from a scientist in Seattle at the Science Museum that I am a supertaster, and I never knew that was actually a thing ... I bring it up because from a very early age, I was always very curious about eating foods that normally toddlers don't eat. Very sour things like mango and tamarind, very bitter things like fermented foods or certain Asian vegetables. And you know, you don't really give a bowl of fiery indian pickles to a 2-year-old! And yet I was climbing up on my grandmother's shelves in the kitchen like a monkey, sort of like a temple monkey, to try and get at the pickle jars ... I think my young palate needed that stimulation.\n\nOn coming to America at the age of 4 and eating nothing but rice\n\nI was very used to a lacto-vegetarian Hindu Brahmin diet, and so I found it hard to eat American foods. So we would have to seek out restaurants that had rice — whether it was a Chinese restaurant or a Mexican restaurant, or whatever. And luckily we lived in New York City, and I experienced the city through my palate, and it was an exciting place to grow up as a child. It gave me great independence, but it also allowed me to really experience a lot of the world in a much less sheltered way than I would if I was living anywhere else.\n\nOn how Top Chef has changed the way she cooks and eats\n\nGetting to rub shoulders with all of these great chefs, from Thomas Keller to Daniel Boulud to Jacques Pepin and on and on, it does inform my thinking about food — I mean, how could it not? But our show is really about professional chefs who command a kitchen that puts out 200 plates of food that are all different, and hot, and come out at the same time. But, you know, it has informed me immensely. I would consider myself a culinary spelunker, and I love nothing more than to go to a new town or city, and discover that city through its food.
There's really no difference, which is actually quite remarkable when you think about the additional layer of stigma these children are growing up with, she said.\n\nCritics of same-sex parenting have frequently pointed to a 2012 study by a University of Texas sociologist that suggests children of gay and lesbian parents are significantly different from children raised by heterosexual couples. That study has been roundly criticized by others in academia.\n\nJudge Nance's decision to recuse himself comes less than two years after Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, defied federal court orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses because it went against her Christian beliefs. She was jailed for her refusal and became a symbol of the resistance to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Family Foundation, a Lexington-based group that says it seeks to strengthen Kentucky families, offered praise for Judge Nance's decision, saying, Judges have a right of conscience like everyone else.\n\nIf we are going to let liberal judges write their personal biases and prejudices into law, as we have done on issues of marriage and sexuality, then, in the interest of fairness, we are going to have to allow judges with different views to at least recuse themselves from such cases, Martin Cothran, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement.\n\nOther judges have faced consequences for similar stances on L.G.B.T. issues. A judge in Wyoming was censured in March for refusing to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, and an Alabama judge was suspended in September for ordering probate judges to defy federal orders to issue marriage licenses.\n\nSome critics called for Judge Nance to resign or face ethics charges after Thursday's order. Chris Hartman, director of the Fairness Campaign, an L.G.B.T. advocacy group, said the order displayed clear discrimination.
Kristoff St. John, who won two Daytime Emmy Awards during his long tenure on the CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless, was found dead early Sunday morning at his home in Los Angeles. He was 52.\n\nSarah Ardalani, a public information officer at the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office, confirmed the death. She said that an autopsy had been conducted but that the cause of death had not been determined.\n\nMr. St. John spoke openly about his depression after his 24-year-old son, Julian, committed suicide in 2014. Mark Geragos, Mr. St. John's lawyer and friend, said in a telephone interview on Monday that Mr. St. John had told him recently that his grief and depression had worsened.\n\nMr. St. John began playing Neil Winters, a cosmetics executive who struggled with infidelity, alcoholism and many other plot twists, on The Young and the Restless in 1991. He most recently appeared as the character in January, completing nearly 1,700 episodes of the show.
Who will win? We'd love to know, too. Our awards-season expert, Kyle Buchanan, has made his Oscar predictions, and the short answer is that the World War I drama 1917 is well-positioned. Then again the South Korean thriller Parasite could pose strong competition. Buchanan also expects the quartet of Joaquin Phoenix (Joker), Renée Zellweger (Judy), Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood) and Laura Dern (Marriage Story) to take home acting trophies, as they have all season long.\n\nWho will be presenting? The academy has announced a long list of household names, including Will Ferrell, Gal Gadot, Salma Hayek, Mindy Kaling, Spike Lee, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Keanu Reeves, Maya Rudolph and Timothée Chalamet.\n\nWhat else should I expect? There will probably be remembrances of Kirk Douglas, who died on Wednesday, and Kobe Bryant, the basketball star who won an Oscar for a short film made after he retired. And there will reportedly be a special performance by Janelle Monáe with Elton John and Randy Newman.
I called the police and was connected to the dispatch office in the county where the avalanche had occurred. The dispatcher asked for my husband's name. I told her. Hold on a minute, she said. She returned to the line. Well, we don't have his name right here, she said. I will have the coroner call you back one way or the other. That should have been my clue. Either she didn't want to tell me or she wasn't authorized to deliver the news.\n\nThe doorbell rang. I opened the door to the three sheriff's deputies. I managed to speak first. It was him, wasn't it? I said. My voice was barely a squeak. My tears started as they asked if they could come in. One of them was a chaplain, who sat on the couch and confirmed my fears. Much after that is a blur. Many other phone calls were made: to a friend who would come over so I wouldn't be alone; to my parents, who would fly out the next day to be with me. The conversation with the deputies came around to informing Chris's mother. She was in Kentucky. One of them called to Lexington. The police there were busy with New Year's Eve festivities. The deputy called a fire chief, who said he didn't feel comfortable with the task. It was left to me.\n\nIt was approaching midnight where Chris's mom lived. I wondered: Should I wait until morning? I dreaded causing her the pain I knew was to come. The wretched cry I had heard from my own mother minutes before would surely be multiplied a hundredfold. For a moment I thought that if I could wait until morning maybe I would think of the right words. There are many gaps in my memories of that night. One comment I do remember was this: I'm a father, one of the deputies said. I would want to know now. I made the call. I told her that, yes, his body had been recovered and passed on the coroner's contact information. She responded with tears and devastation and shared in my disbelief of whether this moment was real.\n\nChris's urge to be in the mountains was related to his postwar adjustments, and it became central to his regeneration and health. But I didn't blame the war for his death. His drive to pursue his passions outside of his first career gave me the resolve to do the same. Six months after he died, I left the Army, moved across the country and started medical school. Becoming a physician requires years of intensive practice and study, and in this early stage of my career, I know I should be more concerned with learning drug names or the proper quantity of fluid boluses. Yet it's the act of communicating bad news to patients and their families that I often ponder. I came to medical school having served around violence and trauma, and having already received and given a death notification. I've learned that the worst moments in someone's life can be a haze with few distinct memories. In these moments it matters less what you say than how you say it. People in pain remember compassion, like the compassion I received from the deputies who sat on the couch with me and didn't leave until I was no longer alone.\n\nI am trying to apply this lesson as I follow Chris's example, knowing that as an emergency-medicine physician, it's inevitable that I will be informing families about a loved one's death. I don't view this as a dreaded duty. It is part of being human and connecting with others. I want to pass this knowledge on.
In Saudi Arabia, all women are required to have a male guardian, whose permission they need to get married, travel and undergo some medical procedures. The guardian is often a father or husband, but can be a brother or even a son.\n\nThe kingdom's day-to-day ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has vowed to make life better for Saudi women. He defanged the once-feared religious police, who harassed women deemed inappropriately dressed, and last year he lifted the ban on women driving. Saudi women can now attend mixed concerts and pursue careers off limits to their mothers.\n\n[Read about the challenges that remained for Saudi women after the driving ban was lifted.]\n\nWhen asked about guardianship laws last year, the prince said that Saudi Arabia had to figure out a way to treat this that doesn't harm families and doesn't harm the culture.\n\nThose moves have increased his popularity among Saudi women, many of whom say guardianship is not a burden because their male relatives take good care of them. Others escape the rules by seeking jobs in neighboring countries like the United Arab Emirates, where social rules are more lax.\n\nBut the system's critics say it gives no recourse to women with controlling or abusive guardians.\n\nThat's what sent Nourah, 20, fleeing for Australia. Her father had divorced her mother before Nourah was born, and she was raised mostly by her uncles, she said. Her father sometimes abused her, but her efforts to get help fell on deaf ears.\n\nLast year, her boyfriend wanted to marry her, but her family refused because they perceived him as coming from a lower social class, said Nourah, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used for her safety. Her father began to arrange her marriage to a man she did not know and who wanted to bar her from working. In October, a day before her prospective groom arrived, she ran away.
The Outsider Art Fair, up at the Metropolitan Pavilion in Chelsea until Sunday, is still one of the best deals in New York: compact, but filled from edge to edge with things to see. You can brush up on the heroes of the genre — work by self-taught artists — with a stunning Henry Darger panorama at Andrew Edlin at booth D14, and a gorgeous, never-before-shown Martín Ramírez drawing of a cowboy on a rearing purple horse at Ricco/Maresca (A11). You can make new discoveries, like the off-center flower paintings of John Maull at Tierra del Sol (B1), or the eye-grabbing shopping-bag paintings of a retired Peruvian parachute trooper who goes by Judá Ben Hur at Gabby Yamamoto/Espacio (B5).\n\nThis year, its 28th in New York, the fair has also introduced a diffident handful of curated booths, including the writer and curator Paul Laster's Relishing the Raw: Contemporary Artists Collecting Outsider Art (A8), in which Mr. Laster teases out suggestive connections between contemporary artists and their own personal collections: It's like listening to a British Invasion rocker talk about his favorite blues records. Below are seven of my own favorite booths to get you started, but you're almost guaranteed, just by setting foot in the door, to find something I overlooked.
Cooper Jameson Kupp Jr. — nicknamed June, as in Junior, by his parents — did not know the significance behind the note his mother asked him to deliver last May. But the 2-year-old eagerly complied, bouncing over to his father.\n\nCooper Kupp, a sure-handed receiver for the Los Angeles Rams, scanned the piece of paper, then leapt past his surprised son to embrace his wife, Anna Kupp. The message: June would soon be a big brother.\n\nDisbelief washed over Cooper.\n\nJune had been a blessing, arriving shortly after the couple decided to start a family. This time, the second time around, it took a little longer, Cooper said during a recent Zoom call. This was something we were trying for and just hadn't happened for us yet.\n\nSuddenly, the couple needed a game plan. Navigating a pregnancy is strenuous for any expectant parent. For professional athletes, unyielding schedules can intrude on family obligations under the best of conditions. In the N.F.L., rigid coronavirus protocols have forced players to make tough work-life decisions as they trudge through the pandemic season.
At its most fundamental, a dinner party is an act of generosity: Come to my place; share my bounty. Of course, it's rarely that simple. Historically, the powerful have used these gatherings to flaunt their resources; social and political intimidation in the guise of hospitality. In the potlatch — a ritual practiced during precolonial times by indigenous tribes of the Northwest Coast, including the Tlingit and the Kwakiutl — the high-ranking host plied guests with enormous amounts of food (like fish oil served via quart-size spoons), often until they threw up. Then he extravagantly gave away his most prized possessions — or destroyed them in a bonfire, just to show that he could. To save face, a guest from a rival village might counter with an even bigger feast.\n\nIn the hermetic kingdom of the dining room, the host is at once benefactor and dictator. Alfred Hitchcock planted whoopee cushions on seats, dyed food blue and reversed the order in which courses were served, beginning with dessert, all to toy with guests. Less whimsically, during the Renaissance, the aristocratic Borgias were rumored to poison them. Even without the threat of assassination, a dinner party can feel like a series of psychological tests: the table set with tiny implements of inscrutable purpose, the small talk like needles through the eyes. The Oxford Dictionary of Psychology by Andrew M. Colman includes a listing for deipnophobia, fear of dinner parties — defined as irrational, although I'd argue it's a defensive response to our divided modern times.\n\nFor if, as some have argued, dinner parties heralded the dawn of civilization, in this brawling era they might soon hasten its end. Anxiety over forced commingling may explain why the trope of the nightmare feast has taken hold in the imaginations of contemporary artists. In the filmmaker Sally Potter's recent farce The Party, guests are at each other's throats before they down a single hors d'oeuvre. Shattering revelations bring a whiff of hell: I smell burning, a guest says. The vol-au-vents, the hostess sighs, momentarily distracted from her disemboweled marriage. Thomas Adès's opera The Exterminating Angel, which had its American premiere this fall, revisits the surrealist Luis Buñuel's 1962 film of the same title, in which socialites at a posh soiree can't muster the will to leave. They stay, trapped by their own ennui, until food and drink run out, until the mask — of who they strive to be in the presence of others — slips, and they wind up slaughtering a sheep and roasting it over a burning cello. (In uncanny synergy, Buñuel's vision has likewise infiltrated both a musical-in-progress by Stephen Sondheim and David Ives, and Darren Aronofsky's vexed 2017 horror movie, Mother!, which ends in cannibalism and an ugly subversion of the Last Supper.)\n\nWhy, then, does it seem as if everybody is throwing dinner parties again? We could glibly dismiss it as an offshoot of the current obsession with food; amateur chefs looking to unleash their inner Yotam Ottolenghi on a captive audience. But these days, when our greatest intimacy is with our iPhones and the spectral kinship of social media has supplanted the immediacy of analog conversation, the true hunger is for earnest connection. And so a new strain of dinner party dispenses with formality in favor of sincerity. Gone are the napkins tortured into swans and the postprandial triage that shunted women to the drawing room while men dealt business. Instead, tables might be strewn with tea lights bought by the hundred at Ikea and dessert might be Klondikes from the corner bodega. In a communal, nigh utopian spirit, guests share in the labor and often bring dishes of their own, rehabilitating the idea of the potluck — which has nothing to do, etymologically, with potlatch: It derives from the 16th-century English pot-lucke, in which unexpected guests made do with whatever was already in the pot. For every dinner party that leaves family bonds and lifelong friendships in smoldering ruins, there is another that unites and reaffirms: Yes, we really like each other.
Arnold L. Lehman is echt Brooklyn.\n\nThe former director of the Brooklyn Museum, who served for almost 18 years, Mr. Lehman, 72, was born in the borough. And he lives there, too, in a spacious Brooklyn Heights apartment with his wife, Pamela.\n\nTrue to form, he has a wisecrack at the ready. Asked about his current job, as a senior adviser to the chairman of Phillips auction house: To me, senior adviser means someone very old with a big mouth.\n\nBut the Lehmans are serious when it comes to collecting contemporary art. They have a Tracy-and-Hepburn-style disagreement about exactly how many works they own: He says 300, she says 120. So they settle on 200. That kind of compromise may be why the marriage has lasted since 1969.\n\nThe Lehmans have filled up not only their high-ceiling floor-through in Brooklyn, but also a house in Maine and an apartment in Miami. So they've finally slowed down. Collecting is a lot easier now that we're not collecting anymore, said Mr. Lehman, who also formerly led the Baltimore Museum of Art.
I\n\nThe horoscope was confounding. If the famous guerrilla revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara was born on June 14, 1928, as stated on his birth certificate, then he was a Gemini--and a lackluster one at that. The astrologer, a friend of Che's mother, did her calculations again to find a mistake, but the results she came up with were the same. The Che that emerged was a grey, dependent personality who had lived an uneventful life. There were only two possibilities: Either she was right about Che, or she was worthless as an astrologer.\n\nWhen shown the dismal horoscope, Che's mother laughed. She then confided a secret she had guarded closely for over three decades. Her famous son had actually been born one month earlier, on May 14. He was no Gemini, but a headstrong and decisive Taurus.\n\nThe deception had been necessary, she explained, because she was three months pregnant on the day she married Che's father. Immediately after their wedding, the couple had left Buenos Aires for the remote jungle backwater of Misiones. There, as her husband set himself up as an enterprising yerba mate planter, she went through her pregnancy away from the prying eyes of Buenos Aires society. When she was near term, they traveled down the Parana River to the city of Rosario. She gave birth there, and a doctor friend falsified the date on her baby's birth certificate, moving it forward by one month to help shield them from scandal.\n\nWhen their baby son was a month old, the couple notified their families. Their story was that they had tried to reach Buenos Aires, but at Rosario Celia Guevara had gone into labor prematurely. A baby born at seven months, after all, is not an out-of-the-question occurrence. If there were any doubts, the couple's story and their child's official birth date were quietly accepted by their families and friends, and remained unchallenged for years.\n\nIf that child had not grown up to become the renowned revolutionary Che, his parents' secret might well have gone with them to their graves. He must be one of the rare public figures of modern times whose birth and death certificates are both falsified. Yet it seems uniquely fitting that Guevara, who spent most of his adult life engaged in clandestine activities and who died as the result of a secret conspiracy, should have also begun life with a subterfuge.\n\nII\n\nWhen, in 1927, Ernesto Guevara Lynch first met Celia de la Serna, she had just graduated from the exclusive Buenos Aires Catholic girls' school, Sacre Coeur. She was a dramatic-looking girl of twenty with an aquiline nose, wavy dark hair, and brown eyes. Celia was well read but unworldly, devout but questioning. Ripe, in other words, for a romantic adventure.\n\nCelia de la Serna was a true Argentine blue blood of undiluted Spanish noble lineage. One ancestor had been the Spanish royal viceroy of colonial Peru; another a famous Argentine military general. Her paternal grandfather had been a wealthy landowner, and Celia's own father had been a renowned law professor, congressman, and ambassador. Both he and his wife died while Celia was still a child, leaving her and her six brothers and sisters to be raised by a religious guardian aunt. But despite her parents' untimely deaths, the family had conserved its revenue-producing estates, and Celia was due a comfortable inheritance when she reached the legal age of twenty-one.\n\nAt twenty-seven, Ernesto Guevara Lynch was both moderately tall and handsome, with a strong chin and jaw. The glasses he wore for astigmatism gave him a deceptively clerkish appearance, for he had an ebullient, gregarious personality, a hot temper, and an outsized imagination. He also possessed Argentine surnames of good vintage: He was the great-grandson of one of South America's richest men, and his ancestors included both Spanish and Irish nobility. But over the years, his family had lost most of its fortune.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century Rosas tyranny, the male heirs of the wealthy Guevara and Lynch clans had fled Argentina to join the California gold rush. After returning from exile, their American-born offspring, Roberto Guevara Castro and Ana Isabel Lynch, had married. Ernesto was the sixth of their eleven children. They lived well, but they were no longer landed gentry. While her husband worked as a geographical surveyor, Ana Isabel raised the children in Buenos Aires. They summered at a rustic country house on her inherited slice of the old family seat. To prepare his son for a working life, Roberto Guevara had sent him to a state-run school, telling him: The only aristocracy I believe in is the aristocracy of talent.\n\nBut Ernesto still belonged by birthright to Argentine society. He had grown up on his mother's stories of California frontier life, and listening to his father's own terrifying tales of Indian attacks and sudden death in the high Andes. His family's illustrious and adventurous past was a legacy too powerful to overcome. He was nineteen when his father died, and although he went to college, studying architecture and engineering, he dropped out before graduation. He wanted to have his own adventures and make his own fortune, and he used his father's modest inheritance to pursue the goal.\n\nBy the time he met Celia, Ernesto had invested most of his money with a wealthy relative in a yacht-building company, the Astillero San Isidro. He worked there for a time as an overseer, but it was not enough to hold his interest. Soon he was enthused about a new project: A friend had convinced him he could make his fortune by growing yerba mate, the stimulating native tea ritually drunk by millions of Argentines.\n\nLand was cheap in the yerba-growing province of Misiones, twelve hundred miles up the Parana River from Buenos Aires on Argentina's northern border with Paraguay and Brazil. Originally settled by Jesuit missionaries and their Guarani Indian converts in the sixteenth century, annexed only fifty years earlier by Argentina, Misiones was just then opening up to settlement. Land speculators, well-heeled adventurers, and poor European migrants were flocking in. Guevara Lynch went to see it for himself, and caught yerba mate fever. His own money was tied up in the astillero, but, with Celia's inheritance, they would be able to buy enough land for a yerba mate plantation, and, he hoped, become rich from the lucrative green gold.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Celia's family closed ranks in opposition to her dilettante suitor. Celia was not yet twenty-one, and under Argentine law she needed her family's approval to marry or receive her inheritance. She asked for it, but they refused. Desperate, for by now she was pregnant, she and Ernesto staged an elopement to force her family's consent. She ran away to an older sister's house. The show of force worked. The marriage was approved, but Celia still had to go to court to win her inheritance. By order of the judge, she was granted a portion of her inheritance, including title to a cattle and grain-producing estancia in central Cordoba province, and some cash bonds from her trust fund--enough to buy a mate plantation in Misiones.\n\nOn November 10, 1927, she and Ernesto were wed in a private ceremony at the home of a married older sister, Edelmira Moore de la Serna. La Prensa of Buenos Aires gave the news in its Dia Social column. Immediately afterward, they fled Buenos Aires for the wilderness of Misiones bearing their mutual secret. Together we decided what to do with our lives, wrote Guevara Lynch in a memoir published years later. Behind lay the penitences, the prudery and the tight circle of relatives and friends who wanted to impede our marriage.\n\nIII\n\nIn 1832, British naturalist Charles Darwin had witnessed the atrocities waged against Argentina's native Indians by gaucho warlord Juan Manuel de Rosas, and predicted: The country will be in the hands of white Gaucho savages instead of copper-coloured Indians. The former being a little superior in education, as they are inferior in every moral virtue.\n\nBut even as the blood flowed, Argentina had spawned its own pantheon of civic-minded historical heroes, from General Jose de San Martin, the country's liberator in the independence struggle with Spain, to Domingo Sarmiento, the crusading journalist, educator, and president who had finally wrested Argentina into the modern age as a unified republic. Sarmiento's 1845 book, Facundo (Civilization and Barbarity), had been a clarion call to his compatriots to choose the path of civilized man over the brutality of the archetypal Argentine frontiersman, the gaucho.\n\nYet even Sarmiento had wielded a dictator's authority to lead the country, and with his death the Argentine cult of the strongman, or caudillo, had not disappeared. Caudillismo would remain a feature of politics well into the next century as government swung back and forth between caudillos and democrats in a bewildering, cyclical dance. Indeed, as if reflecting the sharp contrasts of the great land they had conquered, there was an unreconciled duality in the Argentine temperament, seemingly balanced in a state of perpetual tension between savagery and enlightenment. At once passionate, volatile, and racist, Argentines were also expansive, humorous, and hospitable. The paradox had produced a flourishing culture and found expression in classic works of literature such as Ricardo Guiraldes's Don Segundo Sombra and the gaucho epic poem Martin Fierro by Jose Hernandez.\n\nSince the 1870s, the country had become more stable. And, when the conquest of the southern pampas was finally secured after an officially sponsored campaign to exterminate the native Indian population, vast new lands had opened up for colonization. The pampas were fenced in as grazing and farming lands; new towns and industries sprang up; railroads, ports, and roads were built. By the turn of the century, its population had tripled, swollen by the influx of over a million immigrants from Italy, Spain, Germany, Britain, Russia, and the Middle East who had poured into the rich southern land of opportunity--and still they came.\n\nA dismal colonial garrison on the vast Rio de la Plata estuary only a century before, the city of Buenos Aires now had a melting pot's combustive quality, epitomized by the sensuous new culture of tango, its dark-eyed crooner Carlos Gardel giving redolent voice to a burgeoning national pride. Its population spoke their own creole street dialect called lunfardo, an Argentine cockney rich in double entendres, cribbed from Quechua, Italian, and local gaucho Spanish.\n\nThe city's docks were bustling: Ships carried Argentina's meat, grains, and hides off to Europe while others docked bringing American Studebakers, gramophones, and the latest Paris fashions. The city boasted an opera house, a stock exchange, and a fine university; rows of imposing neoclassical public buildings and private mansions; landscaped green parks with shade trees and polo fields, as well as ample boulevards graced with heroic statues and sparkling fountains. Electric streetcars rattled and zinged along cobbled streets past elegant, bronzed-doored confiterias and wiskerias with gold lettering on etched glass windows. In their mirrored and marble interiors, haughty white-jacketed waiters with slicked-down hair posed and swooped like vigilant, gleaming eagles.\n\nBut while Buenos Aires's portenos, as they called themselves, looked to Europe for their cultural comparisons, much of the interior still languished in nineteenth-century neglect. In the north, despotic provincial caudillos held sway over vast expanses of cotton- and sugar-growing lands. Among their workers, diseases such as leprosy, malaria, and even bubonic plague were still common. In the Andean provinces, the indigenous Quechua- and Aymara-speaking Indians known as coyas lived in conditions of extreme poverty. Women would not be given the vote for another two decades, and legal divorce would take even longer. Vigilante justice and indentured servitude were features of life in much of the hinterland.\n\nArgentina's political system had not kept pace with its changing society and had stagnated. For decades, two parties, the Radical and the Conservative, had ruled the country's destiny. The current Radical president, Hipolito Yrigoyen, was aging and eccentric, a sphinxlike figure who rarely spoke or appeared in public. Workers had few rights, and strikes were often suppressed by gunfire and police batons. Criminals were transported by ship to serve terms of imprisonment in the cold southern wastes of Patagonia. But, with immigration and the twentieth century, new political ideas had also arrived. Feminists, socialists, anarchists, and now Fascists began making their voices heard. In the Argentina of 1927, political and social change was inevitable, but had not yet come.\n\nIV\n\nWith Celia's money, Guevara Lynch bought two hundred hectares (about five hundred acres) of jungle along the banks of the Rio Parana. On a bluff overlooking the coffee-colored water and the dense green forest of the Paraguayan shore, they erected a roomy wooden house on stilts, with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse. They were a long way from the comforts of Buenos Aires, but Guevara Lynch was enraptured. With an entrepreneur's eager eye, he looked into the jungle around him, and he saw the future.\n\nPerhaps he believed he could, as his grandfathers had done before him, restore the family fortunes by intrepidly striking out into new and unexplored lands. Whether or not he was consciously emulating his forefathers' experiences, it is clear that for Guevara Lynch, Misiones was his own Wild West adventure. To him, it was not just another backward Argentine province, but a thrilling place full of ferocious beasts, dangerous work, robbery and murders, jungle cyclones, interminable rains and tropical diseases.\n\nHe wrote: There, in mysterious Misiones ... everything attracts and entraps. It attracts like all that is dangerous, and entraps like all that is passionate. There, nothing was familiar, not its soil, its climate, its vegetation, nor its jungle full of wild animals, and even less its inhabitants.... From the moment one stepped on its shores, one felt that the safety of one's life lay in the machete or revolver....\n\nTheir homestead was in a place named Puerto Caraguatai, named in Guarani after a beautiful native red flower, but its puerto was just a small wooden jetty. Caraguatai was reached by a two-day river journey up from the old trading port of Posadas on the Ibera, a venerable Victorian paddle-wheel steamer that had done prior service carrying British colonials up the Nile. The nearest outpost was the small German settlers' community of Montecarlo, five miles away, but the Guevaras found they had a friendly neighbor who lived a few minutes' walk through the forest. Charles Benson was a retired English railway engineer and an avid angler, and just above the river he had built himself a white, rambling bungalow with its own internal water closet imported from England.\n\nFor a few months, the Guevaras spent an enjoyable time settling in and exploring the area. They sportfished, boated, and rode horses with Benson, or else drove into Montecarlo on their mule-drawn buggy. To eight-year-old Gertrudis Kraft, whose parents ran a little hostel on the Montecarlo road, the Guevaras were admirable, rich and elegant people, whose rustic home by the river was a mansion.\n\nThe Guevaras' honeymoon idyll, such as it was, did not last long. Within a few short months, Celia's pregnancy was well advanced, and it was time to return to civilization, where she could give birth in greater comfort and security. The couple set out downriver and ended their journey in Rosario, an important Parana port city of three hundred thousand inhabitants. There, Celia went into labor, and their son Ernesto Guevara de la Serna was born.\n\nHis doctored birth certificate, drawn up at the civil registrar's office on June 15, was witnessed by a cousin of Guevara Lynch's who lived in Rosario and a Brazilian taxi driver evidently drafted at the last minute. The document says the baby was delivered at 3:05 A.M. on the morning of June 14, in his parent's domicile on Calle Entre Rios 480.\n\nThe Guevaras remained in Rosario while Celia recovered from the delivery of Ernestito. They rented a spacious, three-bedroom apartment with servant's quarters in an exclusive new residential building near the city center, at the address given on the birth certificate. Their stay was prolonged when, shortly after his birth, the baby contracted bronchial pneumonia. Ernesto's mother, Ana Isabel Lynch, and his spinster sister Ercilia came to help out.\n\nIf the couple's families suspected anything, they kept quiet about it. Che's younger brother Roberto says that his mother told him that Ernesto was born in a clinic in Rosario on the 14 of June 1928. The address that appears on the birth register is where he lived the first days, but not where he was born. Possibly it was the house of a friend, or that of the taxi driver who was a witness....\n\nOf course, the truth, as Celia later told Julia Constenla de Giussani (who had arranged for Che's astral chart to be drawn up by their mutual astrologist friend), was that she had actually given birth in May, on the same day, and at the same hour as a striking dockworker nicknamed Diente de Oro (Gold Tooth) died of gunshot wounds.\n\nThe yellowing archives of Rosario's daily newspaper La Capital confirm the story. In May 1928, a strike by Rosario's dockworkers had escalated into violence. Almost every day, stabbings and shootings had taken place, most of them carried out by strikebreaking armed scabs working for the stevedores' hiring agency, the Sociedad Patronal. At 5:30 P.M. on Tuesday, May 13, 1928, a twenty-eight-year-old stevedore named Ramon Romero, alias Diente de Oro, was shot in the head during a fracas at the Puerto San Martin. At dawn the next day, May 14, he died in the Granaderos a Caballo Hospital in San Lorenzo, about twenty kilometers north of Rosario.\n\nV\n\nAfter a whirlwind round of visits with their families in Buenos Aires to show off their infant son, the Guevaras returned to their homestead in Misiones.\n\nGuevara Lynch now made a serious attempt to get his plantation off the ground. He hired a Paraguayan foreman, or capataz, named Curtido, to oversee the clearing of his land and the planting of his first crop of yerba mate. But when it came to hiring laborers, he had to confront the system of labor bondage, still practiced widely in the untamed region.\n\nIn Misiones, loggers and owners of yerbatales usually hired itinerant Guarani Indian laborers called mensu, who were given binding contracts and cash advances against future work. Paid low wages according to how much they produced, mensu received not cash but private bonds, valid only to purchase basic essentials at the overpriced plantation stores. The system virtually ensured that they could never redeem their original debts. Armed plantation guards called capangas kept vigilant watch over the work crews to prevent escapes, and violent deaths by gunshot and machete were frequent occurrences. Fugitive mensu who escaped the capangas but fell into the hands of police were inevitably returned to their patrones. Guevara Lynch hired mensu himself, but he was no yerba baron, and, horrified at the stories he heard, he paid his workers in cash. It made him a popular patron, and many years later, he was still remembered by local workers as a good man.\n\nAs Guevara Lynch worked his plantation, his young son was learning how to walk. To help train him, his father used to send him to the kitchen with a little pot of yerba mate to give the cook for boiling. Invariably stumbling along the way, Ernestito would angrily pick himself up and carry on. Another routine developed as a consequence of the pernicious insects that infested Caraguatai. Every night, while his son lay sleeping in his crib, Guevara Lynch and Curtido crept quietly into his room. While his patron trained a flashlight on his son, Curtido carefully used the burning tip of his cigarette to dislodge the day's harvest of chiggers burrowed into the baby's flesh.\n\nIn March 1929, Celia became pregnant again. She hired a young Galician-born nanny to look after Ernestito, who was not yet a year old. Carmen Arias proved to be a welcome new addition to the family; she would live with the Guevaras until her own marriage eight years later, and remain a lifelong family friend. Freed from child-minding, Celia began taking daily swims in the Parana. She was a good swimmer, but one day when she was six month's pregnant, the river's current caught her. She would probably have drowned if two of her husband's axmen clearing the forest nearby hadn't seen her and thrown out liana vines to pull her to safety.\n\nGuevara Lynch reprovingly recalled many such near-drowning episodes involving Celia in the early years of their marriage. Already, Celia and Ernesto's very different personalities had begun to collide. She was aloof, a loner, and seemingly immune to fear, while he was an emotionally needy man who liked having people around him, a chronic worrier whose vivid imagination magnified the risks he saw lurking everywhere.\n\nBut while the early signs of their future marital discord were already in evidence, they had not yet pulled apart. The Guevaras took family excursions together, either horse rides on the forest trails, with Ernestito riding on the saddle mount in front of his father, or river excursions aboard the Kid, a wooden launch with a four-berth cabin that Guevara Lynch had built at the Astillero San Isidro. Once, they traveled upriver to the famous Iguazu falls, where the Argentine and Brazilian borders meet, and watched the clouds of vapor rise from the brown cascades that roar down from the virgin jungle cliffs.\n\nIn late 1929, the family packed up once more for the long trip downriver to Buenos Aires. Their land was cleared and their yerbatal had just been planted, but Celia was about to give birth to their second child, and Guevara Lynch's presence was urgently needed at the Astillero San Isidro. During his absence, business had gone badly, and now one of its investors had withdrawn. They planned to be away only a few months, but they would never return as a family to Puerto Caraguatai. It was the end of what Ernesto Guevara Lynch recalled as difficult but very happy years.
The solution that we received is a welcome relief to the conflict we have been experiencing, said the Rev. Tom Berlin, who represented groups that opposed discrimination against L.G.B.T. people in the mediation. I am very encouraged that the United Methodist Church found a way to offer a resolution to a long conflict.\n\nConservatives, who seemed to have the upper hand after the vote tightening a ban on same-sex marriage, would get $25 million once their new denomination is formed and incorporated. All current clergy and lay employees of the denomination, even if they affiliate with the traditionalists, will get to keep their pension plans.\n\nIt is not everything that we would have hoped for, but we think it is a good agreement that gets us out of the decades-long conflict that we have experienced and enables us to focus on ministry in a positive way, said Tom Lambrecht, vice president of Good News, one of the conservative groups.\n\nThe factions agreed to allocate $39 million to support communities historically marginalized by the sin of racism, according to the agreement. That sum includes $13 million the traditionalists contributed instead of receiving as part of their portion.\n\nDespite the deep doctrinal disputes that led to the split, the negotiations were largely secular: process, governance, finances, said Kenneth R. Feinberg, the lawyer who helped craft the thorny settlements that arose from the 2010 BP oil spill and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nI'm the last person in the world who's going to help the parties resolve their doctrinal differences, said Mr. Feinberg, who assisted in the church's mediation on a pro bono basis.\n\nLocal churches will choose whether to join any new traditionalist denomination or remain in the United Methodist Church. Several people interviewed on Friday believed that most American churches would stay, though there has not been any formal survey.
There was never any question of Bob stepping down, and so he worked and edited almost to the last. Retirement was for sissies; better to step up to the plate. No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. He had his quirks. He hated the word stance. He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his hand went to the heart of the matter. To edit, for Bob, was to make a writer better and get out of the way. That may sound simple. It's not and it's rare.\n\nI learned of Bob's passing while I was in France, where he'd worked for the Paris Review in the 1950s. I was a friend, not a close one, but I'd written one piece a year or so for him since 2008, and he would take me to lunch at En, a Japanese brasserie near his downtown office. He was gallant, droll and courtly (another description of his accent, reported by Thomas Meaney in The Times Literary Supplement, captured it as Mineola via the Grand Tour). He was also challenging, indignant about all injustice, and a quiet saboteur of every jejune idea.\n\nWhen we talked about Iran, where I'd witnessed the postelection tumult in 2009, he broached human rights, the Iran nuclear threat and the movies of Abbas Kiarostami with effortless authority. What did Iran want? How could its people be brought closer to the world? How might their yearning for liberty be satisfied? Bob probed. He was always ready to learn, even if he always seemed to know more than you. He was the generalist rebuking the specialist. He prodded me, most recently, to write — and then rewrite — a review of Elena Ferrante's work. He liked writers in new territory.\n\nAt a memorial service for him this week at the New York Public Library, the immensity of Bob's loss was palpable. Justice Stephen Breyer sent a note, read by the Review's publisher, Rea Hederman. It extolled the importance of Bob's forum for distinguishing sense from nonsense. Ian Buruma captured Bob's particularly Jewish identification with the oppressed and his decency – that word dear to Camus, who observed in his novel The Plague that, It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency. Mark Danner evoked the love of Bob's life, Grace Dudley, and his sense of not knowing who I am after her death late last year. Still, Bob kept working. There were always things to do.\n\nYes, it is time to fight with decency the indecency seeping from high office; to reject nonsense; to resist contempt for the persecuted and the refugee; to uphold love lived to its limit; to honor industry over ostentation. Bob was the greatest editor of our time. Editors cut; showmen splurge. And one day the showman is unmasked.
Rinaldi was tossing balls and occasional advice to Williams on Friday as Williams exchanged groundstrokes with Vandeweghe during their practice session. Williams crushed certain shots with customary power and precision but mistimed many others, muttering to herself and shadow-stroking between rallies.\n\nShe was in a playful mood, dancing as she walked to the baseline and cracking jokes in her chair during breaks and between deep breaths, but she was all business between the lines.\n\nI'm sure she does want it to go faster, Rinaldi said of the process. She's got high expectations obviously, and it's tough to manage those in the beginning and be patient with herself. But as you can see, I think that's what makes her so great, too, is that she is tough on herself and has that drive. She wants to be back, wants to be playing and wants to be winning titles, it seems, and absolutely nobody knows how to do that better than she does.\n\nSo what is reasonable in terms of expectations? A few months for Williams to get her bearings, drop some more weight and potentially pose a threat at Wimbledon in July? Or something more ambitious?\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if she steps back into it and does well, to be honest with you, Rinaldi said. I've seen her this week, and every day she's better and stronger, and the desire is there.\n\nOlympia, now five months old, is here in Asheville with Williams, who experienced complications after giving birth by emergency cesarean section in September. She has said she spent the first six weeks of motherhood in bed. After her wedding in November, Williams resumed training in earnest in December, a few weeks before she played and lost a lucrative exhibition match to Jelena Ostapenko in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 30.\n\nOstapenko, the reigning French Open champion, kindly stopped hitting many balls to the corners as the match progressed, and Williams looked underwhelmed with her own play.
CASEY STATION, Antarctica — Near a nice, big hole in the ice and beneath the stone gray, midday Antarctic summer skies, six Adélie penguins stared at six men toiling with tools. The chasm in the ice might have been an inviting entry to the krill-rich waters below. None of the members of the tuxedoed recon party dove into the hole, a square about six feet across. The risk of leopard seals was just too great.\n\nBut had they leapt in, the penguins would have discovered not a seal, but a robot.\n\nIn November, scientists and engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully field tested Bruie — the Buoyant Rover for Under-Ice Exploration — beneath the ice of eastern Antarctica. The remotely operated rover was built to crawl along the underside of sea ice and ice shelves. These tests on Earth have a long-term goal of one day seeking evidence of life beneath the thick frozen shell covering Jupiter's ocean moon of Europa. Beneath that ice is three times more liquid water than can be found in all the oceans on Earth.\n\n[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\n\nIt will be years before a spacecraft from Earth lands on Europa, which was most closely studied by NASA's Galileo mission in the 1990s. The next robotic probe to visit that world will be Europa Clipper, scheduled to launch no sooner than 2025. When it arrives some years later, that spacecraft will orbit Jupiter and encounter Europa dozens of times at different angles to thoroughly scan and map the moon, considered one of the best candidates in our solar system to be inhabited by some form of extraterrestrial life.
During a recent interview, the German soprano Diana Damrau and the Italian tenor Vittorio Grigolo tried to describe the chemistry they have together onstage. Reading their comments, I worried that they might be overthinking things. After all, they first worked together only last year, appearing as the lovers in Massenet's Manon at the Metropolitan Opera. The couple thrilled audiences and critics with the smoldering intensity they emitted. So this is a new relationship. In talking about their instinctive connection might they risk making it self-conscious?\n\nNot to fear. On Saturday night for its New Year's Eve gala, the Met introduced a new production of Gounod's Roméo et Juliette starring Mr. Grigolo and Ms. Damrau as Shakespeare's star-crossed adolescent lovers. In scene after scene, these exciting and charismatic artists disappeared into their characters, emboldening each other to sing with white-hot sensuality and impassioned lyricism.\n\nThe production, by the director Bartlett Sher, his seventh for the Met, updates the setting from Renaissance to 18th-century Verona, presenting an essentially traditional staging with some surreal touches that seem a little forced. Still, to whatever degree Mr. Sher shaped the courageous performances of his stars, and this very strong cast, he deserves much credit.
The film is just getting started. Melinda marries Robert anyway, and he continues to drain the money she inherited from her mother. Mr. Perry tracks the major expenses in onscreen text, and puts synonyms for the movie's principal themes (acrimony, of course, as well as deranged and inexorable) in title cards.\n\nA partisan narrator but probably not an unreliable one, Melinda is somehow able to present flashbacks to moments that she didn't see. That's just one of several ways in which Mr. Perry's screenplay feels structurally shaky. Already ungainly in its mix of social realism and parable — Melinda undergoes a series of overwrought, essentially biblical trials in a city vaguely identified as present-day Pittsburgh — Acrimony truly gets muddled once it starts making excuses for its excuse-making antagonist.\n\nAfter all, what if Robert really means well? What if this time will be different? In addition to endorsing the logic that keeps spouses Stockholm syndrome'd in bad marriages, Acrimony also offers poor economic advice (Melinda's enduring devotion to Robert is an illustration of the sunk-cost fallacy — except that the movie suggests she hasn't sunk enough). And the less said about the yacht-based climax, featuring some of the least convincing ship-jumping ever filmed, the better.\n\nMs. Henson does what she can with a role that keeps her anger at a low simmer until requiring her to go full banshee within basically one scene. You can't accuse her or Acrimony of being boring, but the film falls short of a design for living.
Thursday would have been the 100th birthday of the composer, pianist and conductor Leon Kirchner, who died at 90 in 2009. One of the most comprehensive musicians of his day, he was a valued teacher during a long career at Harvard. As a composer, Mr. Kirchner demonstrated that one could write works of rigorous complexity employing modernist techniques but in an instinctive, richly expressive, viscerally dramatic way.\n\nThough steeped in the dodecaphonic music of his beloved teacher Schoenberg, Kirchner never used the 12-tone system strictly. Just hints of the aesthetic run through this mysterious slow movement from Kirchner's Second String Quartet (1958), beautifully performed here by the Orion Quartet. Bartok and Stravinsky where also major influences, as the punchy opening movement of Kirchner's First Piano Concerto (1953) make clear in this 1956 performance featuring the composer at the piano, with Mitropoulos conducting the New York Philharmonic.\n\nSome musical highlights of my years living in Boston were the concerts Mr. Kirchner conducted with the Harvard Chamber Orchestra. He was not the tidiest technician. But he led scores by Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and contemporary giants like a fellow composer who completely understood how the piece at hand worked. ANTHONY TOMMASINI\n\nAny ensemble making its American debut is likely to feel some jitters, especially when the program includes a masterpiece as dense and thorny as Beethoven's Op. 130. But on Sunday, members of the Maxwell String Quartet had an additional reason for feeling a little, well, vulnerable.
Egil Krogh, who as part of President Richard M. Nixon's staff was one of the leaders of the secret Plumbers unit that broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, a prelude to the Watergate burglary that brought down the Nixon presidency, died on Saturday in Washington. He was 80.\n\nHis son Peter said the cause was heart failure.\n\nIn November 1973, Mr. Krogh, known as Bud, pleaded guilty to conspiracy against rights of citizens for his role in the September 1971 break-in at the office of Dr. Lewis Fielding in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nThe Plumbers, a group of White House operatives, were tasked with plugging leaks of confidential material, which had bedeviled the Nixon administration. Mr. Ellsberg, a military analyst, had been responsible for the biggest leak of all: passing the Pentagon Papers, the top-secret government history of the Vietnam War, to The New York Times earlier that year.\n\nThe Plumbers were hoping to get information about Mr. Ellsberg's mental state that would discredit him, but they found nothing of importance related to him.
Joanne Rogers, who as the gregarious wife of Fred Rogers, the influential creator and host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, spread his message of kindness after his death in 2003, died on Thursday at her home in Pittsburgh. She was 92.\n\nHer death was announced by Fred Rogers Productions, which produces children's programming for public television.\n\nSo much a part of me was Fred, Mrs. Rogers said in a TEDx Talk in 2018. One of the things he talked about was making goodness attractive, and I think that's something that we can try to do, and it's quite an assignment.\n\nMrs. Rogers was as comfortable being Fred Rogers's wife as she was performing for nearly 40 years in a piano-playing duo with her college friend Jeannine Morrison. Mr. Rogers was also a trained pianist, but he was not considered as adept as his wife.
Materials/textbooks\n\nCortlandt Anthology of 20th and 21st Century Fiction \n\nGriggs-Massey's Guide to Grammar and Style\n\nNote: The instructor will not be assigning the self-published novel Through the Wild Dreaming Night by Prof. Arnold R. Young. This novel was for many years on the required list for introductory fiction, but this instructor cannot in good conscience continue to inflict it on undergraduates. Through Professor Young's temporary and capricious patronage I have survived on white bread and tuna in an apartment the size of a closet for the past two years; given my nonrenewal of contract, I am no longer obliged to pretend to respect his work.\n\nCourse objectives/goals\n\nVia writing exercises and discussion, students will gain an appreciation for plot, character, setting, mood, tone, dialogue, chronology, structure, tension, etc. They will experience the short story as a brief immersion in the lives and experiences of others — a vehicle for insight. Students may come to understand, for example, why a 39-year-old woman, graduate degree in hand and reasonably attractive, would allow herself to be seduced by a potbellied has-been 20 years her senior, a scholar-cum-novelist who, after buying her a number of drinks at a conference, persuaded her to relocate from a reasonable metropolitan area to a splotch on the prairie, only to reunite, two and a half weeks after her arrival, with an almost-ex-wife he had somehow neglected to mention.\n\nEvaluation/grading\n\nCriteria for evaluating fiction will be discussed in class. To those who would raise the buga boo of subjectivity or instructor favoritism, please see the classroom motto: Life Is Not Fair. Though the instructor promises to do her best to evaluate student work according to clearly defined standards and procedures, students should note that this represents a break from the way in which business is conducted on campus.

The instructor has found that spontaneity is often best, keeping the student reader in suspense and creating the impression that anything might happen: Imagine, for instance, a gloved hand reaching for a knife, and the next thing we know a body is dappled in blood as if in red sunshine, his hoary bulk splayed across a desk in a modest office cluttered with manuscripts … but suddenly the alarm clock erupts with a —\n\nNote: Syllabus and classroom policies are subject to change.\n\nJulie Schumacher, a creative writing instructor at the University of Minnesota, is the author of the novel Dear Committee Members.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.
What's been lost?\n\nI miss the serendipity of bumping into people, crossing paths in a spontaneous way. Some of our best conversations used to take place in an elevator or on our way out the door. Those random things that are the fabric of our lives are so greatly diminished.\n\nDo you compensate virtually?\n\nThe computer screen has no texture. Our lives have no texture. That is why we're so drawn to cooking and eating right now. Those things bring smells, texture and physicality into our lives. That feeling of baking bread, of turning over the dough, that doesn't happen on a screen.\n\nDoes visiting a museum restore some of that sensation?\n\nIt can. Our attendance is pretty strong. I find people come because they feel they can be safe, but also be with other people again, even if they are standing 15 or 20 feet away.\n\nYou once remarked that a museum cannot right all the ills of an unjust world. Do you stand by that?\n\nI believe much of what happens, happens through the art itself, through the voices of the artists. Day's End, our big public art project with David Hammons, will appear in May. It is an open structure, a ghost version of a pier shed that used to exist on the Hudson. In many ways, it is an aspirational project, about reparations. It's symbolic of the resilience of New York. For me it is about the healing of a city and a country that have been battered.
Art can be expected to hold a mirror up to society, but it cannot be expected to hold a mirror up to every individual who is engaging with it. Even with its long running time, there is a lot The Inheritance does not and cannot cover.\n\nNo one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and I believe that is a good thing: It creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives — a thirst that has been evident in audiences for The Inheritance and a thirst that the theater, television and film industries have been too slow to satisfy.\n\nThe Inheritance was not my attempt at a grand summation of the past quarter century of queer history. What I was attempting was an examination of class, economic inequality, and poverty within the gay community — issues I have rarely seen depicted in theater. I have painted on a broad canvas. It is simply not the canvas others might have chosen.\n\nI wanted to write about addiction and alcoholism — a disease I have struggled with, and an epidemic that plagues our community just as perniciously as H.I.V./AIDS did 30 years ago. I also wanted to write about sex: how it can be used as a vehicle for pleasure and intimacy, but how it is also used as a tool to cauterize pain.\n\nSuch examinations run counter to our current desire for affirmative representation. But avoidance of uncomfortable truths is not the role of the artist. Healing is impossible if you don't understand the cause of the injury.\n\nAnd while I examine race in The Inheritance, it is not one of its central themes. This is a decision for which I have been criticized, but it is a decision that I made consciously as a person of color. It is a consideration that is not asked of white writers, but it is one that writers of color must face with every project we begin.\n\nResponsibility to community is the first question we must answer for ourselves. I believe that in writing honestly about my experience as a gay man, I have also contributed one more example of what it means to be a Puerto Rican man.
Dear Match Book,\n\nI need an author I can read front to back, or one who has written five books that I'll want to read without stopping.\n\nI was an English major in college, so I guess what I like is literary fiction. My four favorite books are Blood Meridian, by Cormac McCarthy, Moby-Dick, by Herman Melville, Invisible Man, by Ralph Ellison, and Continental Drift, by Russell Banks — in that order.\n\nI've read everything by Colson Whitehead, so the algorithms led me to Percival Everett's Erasure, but it just didn't click. I've read most of T. C. Boyle, but he's just writing the same book over and over now; and I stopped liking Russell Banks's work a while ago. (I understand his wanting to try different things, but how could the man who wrote The Sweet Hereafter also produce Rule of the Bone?)\n\nI don't just stick to Americans (I love Ian McEwan's writing from the last few years) or men (I've read all of Donna Tartt's fiction and most of Annie Proulx's). Now that I'm older, I'm thinking about going back to Saul Bellow (I grew up in Hyde Park), because back when I started to read his books, I'd always just put them down in favor of something by Philip Roth. I'm just starting my second Magnus Mills novel, so we'll see about him.
Connie Sawyer, who began performing in vaudeville and nightclubs more than eight decades ago and continued to appear on stages and screens until she became known as the oldest working actress in Hollywood, died on Jan. 21 in Los Angeles. She was 105.\n\nHer death, at the Motion Picture & Television Fund's retirement home in Woodland Hills, where she had lived for a decade, was confirmed by her daughter Lisa Dudley.\n\nMiss Sawyer, as she liked to be known, was billed as the oldest member of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-Aftra) who was still working.\n\nHer memoir, self-published last year, was titled, I Never Wanted to Be a Star — And I Wasn't.\n\nStill, since her Broadway debut in 1948, she had accumulated about 140 acting credits in theatrical, movie and television productions.
Mr. Trump's comments about Mr. Cohen on Saturday, made during a friendly interview with Jeanine Pirro of Fox News, were his first extended remarks on the matter since Mr. Cohen's congressional testimony was announced. Asked by Ms. Pirro if he was worried about the testimony, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cohen weak and asserted — in contradiction to filings by federal prosecutors in Manhattan — that Mr. Cohen had no information on him.\n\nHe's in trouble on some loans and fraud and taxicabs and stuff that I know nothing about, Mr. Trump said. And in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, I have an idea, I'll tell — I'll give you some information on the president.\n\nMr. Trump then implied that Mr. Cohen ought to be sharing information instead on his father-in-law, whose name he said he did not know.\n\nBut he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at, he said, adding, That's the money in the family. Pressed by Ms. Pirro for more details, Mr. Trump said, I don't know, but you'll find out, and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there.\n\nMr. Cohen's father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, emigrated from Ukraine in 1975. The year before his daughter's marriage to Mr. Cohen, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. He was sentenced to probation after cooperating with prosecutors in a related case.\n\nSaturday was not the first time Mr. Trump has targeted Mr. Cohen's family. After Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to his crimes, the president said Mr. Cohen had done so only to save his wife and his father-in-law.\n\nAs they prepared to indict him, prosecutors had signaled to Mr. Cohen that his wife could be implicated, since she had also signed his tax returns. That threat helped push Mr. Cohen to plead guilty to the charges, according to a person familiar with the events.
There are echoes of Beggar Boy in the ironically titled story America the Great Equalizer. Biks, a Nepali graduate student living in Illinois at the time of Michael Brown's shooting in Ferguson, Mo., simultaneously develops a heightened awareness of the racism all around him and learns that his beloved Seema, back in Nepal, has married. The death and the marriage, hardly comparable tragedies, intertwine in his mind, sparking a suspicion that Seema rejected him because of his comparatively dark skin. Feeling himself the victim of a terrible injustice due to prejudice, he begins to identify with African-Americans, taking on what he believes to be black mannerisms, including addressing customers at his new job in a gas station as brothah. It's an uncomfortable charade, barreling right through the boundary between empathy and appropriation, and into offensive stereotypes, a fact Biks is initially incapable of seeing, though others try to point it out. 'Am I your brother because we have the same mother, or am I your brother because you're African-American?' one customer asks him. Then he laughed and said he was just giving Biks a hard time.\n\nImage\n\nBiks sees through his own masquerade only after reaching some acceptance about his former lover's marriage, a piece of timing that suggests the great degree to which his supposed empathy has been about managing his own emotional wounds. This was not the life he'd envisioned … trying to be blacker than blacks — 'Blacker than thou,' he muttered to himself — when his history didn't compare to theirs, the brutality, the dehumanization, the violence. He was a fraud, trying to pretend to be someone he was not. … 'I am a pretender,' Biks said to himself. 'A poseur. An impostor.'\n\nThat is clearly true, but as with Ramesh in Beggar Boy, the pretense has to do with enacting something genuinely felt. And while impostors are commonly thought of as assuming a higher status, to which they have no claim, these characters take on the identities of those they perceive to be of lower status, to whose sufferings they have no claim, in order to engage in a kind of theater of pain. Their behaviors are particularly outlandish and so seem particularly egregious, but the wrong of using other people's troubles to soothe oneself is commonplace, a sin most of us commit at some point, which is perhaps why Upadhyay maintains so empathic a stance toward his characters, even as they transgress.\n\nThough he does allow them to be mocked. The specter of foolishness hovers close to many of the people found in Mad Country. The distinction between the questions Who might I actually be? and Just who do you think you are? is repeatedly revealed to be a slippery one. In Freak Street, set in 1970s Nepal, a young American woman decides she is Nepali, changing her name from Sofi to Sukumari, taking to wearing Nepali clothes and calling her landlady Ma. She is ridiculed for doing so, though again, her masquerade is the product of a profound unhappiness. The boy pointed at Sukumari. 'She! She's funny! Look at her. She a kuiriney hippie, but she thinks she's Nepali.' With this drumbeat of mockery, Upadhyay illuminates the unquestioned pressures on us all to remain as we are, a key element in a book about societal constructs, emotional exigencies and identity.\n\nStory collections need not be entirely consistent to triumph. Mad Country is brilliant, daring, memorable — and also uneven. The opening piece, Fast Forward, about a newsmagazine in Kathmandu, is a nuanced study of truth-telling under a repressive regime, while the novella Dreaming of Ghana, in which a young man first dreams about the country Ghana and then meets a young black woman whom he rather presumptuously names Ghana, involves disparate plot lines and symbolic representations that never quite add up. The title story, in which a successful businesswoman finds new forms of contentment while baselessly incarcerated, left me unconvinced. But I would not want any pieces excised. Even the less powerful stories here are original and thought-provoking enough to add something of value to the whole.
Alexandra Levy Olsman and Zachary Isaac Frankel lived across Rittenhouse Square from each other at a young age and went to the same Montessori preschool in Philadelphia. But, when a mutual friend introduced them in October 2016, they had no memory of ever meeting.\n\nMr. Frankel said the mutual friend, Lauren Jacobs, had reached out to him to say, I have this girl for you.\n\nThat woman was Ms. Olsman, an associate specialist then in the antiquities department at Christie's New York. Ms. Olsman was part of an art gallery panel discussion about collecting art, which Ms. Jacobs was attending. The event, in Philadelphia, was where Ms. Jacobs had the inspiration to match the two. After the talk, and over wine and cheese, she mentioned her idea to Ms. Olsman about meeting Mr. Frankel. Minutes later he called Ms. Jacobs, who handed the phone over to Ms. Olsman, and they chatted.\n\nThe next week, while Ms. Olsman was in England at Christie's London, he texted her about meeting in New York when she got back.
SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Tschang-Yeul, who devoted a half century to creating luminous paintings of water drops that are informed by the trauma of war and Eastern philosophy, died here on Jan. 5. He was 91.\n\nGallery Hyundai, which has shown his work since the 1970s, confirmed the death.\n\nRendered with meticulous care, Mr. Kim's drops can seem to sit miraculously atop his raw canvases or be in the midst of gliding down them, leaving a trail of moisture. They glimmer with light and cast shadows, and while vividly present, they are always on the verge of evanescing. They made Mr. Kim one of the most celebrated Korean artists of his time.\n\nVersed in Zen Buddhism and Taoism, he wrote in a statement for a 1988 exhibition that his aim in his tranquil paintings was to dissolve everything into drops of water and return it transparently into nothingness.\n\nWhen we have turned anger, unease, and fear into emptiness, he wrote, we can experience peace and harmony.
The New Wonder Woman\n\nYou might not know the name Gal Gadot right now, but you've probably seen her in The Fast and the Furious movies. Now comes the biggest moment in her career: the title role in Warner Brothers' Wonder Woman, due in June. It will be the first live-action superhero movie in more than a decade led by female talent in front of and behind the camera. Our reporter Roslyn Sulcas was on set during production and asked her whether she was feeling any pressure to prove that men aren't the only ones who can succeed with such a franchise. Ms. Gadot laughed and said, When you put it like that, yes! Read more here.
Season 2, Episode 2: 'Dead Cat Bounce'\n\nAmong other things, Billions is a show about American aristocracy, of two men burnishing a legacy that will etch their families' names in the firmament for generations to come. One of the key distinctions between Chuck Rhoades and Bobby Axelrod is that they approach the same goal from different angles: Chuck is an old-money political climber, on a conventional (if currently twisty) path from United States attorney to the governor's office, boosted by his father's reputation and connections. Axe is a nouveau riche brawler from Yonkers, using hedge fund billions to bully his way to the status his name itself cannot afford. Hence the sizable donation necessary to change an august Manhattan performance space into Axelrod Hall last season — the dubious permanence of which I likened to Enron Field in Houston.\n\nIn a key scene in tonight's episode, Chuck Rhoades Sr. pays a visit to Wendy's home while her husband is away. For Chuck Sr., there's no more important goal than making certain his son builds upon the Rhoades family legacy in the state of New York. And being the connected person that he is, it was only a matter of time before news of Chuck and Wendy's separation made its way through the grapevine. Chuck Sr. doesn't want to hear Wendy's rationale about the lies and deception that led to the separation, which to him are mere bumps in the road. She needs to think about the children. She needs to think about how much harder it will be for little Kevin Rhoades to meet his station in life. They are the future of my name, he tells her, adding, You'd really rather have your three nights a week than be first lady of the state of New York?\n\nHearing Chuck Sr. badger Wendy over her marriage recalled, for me, last year's excellent documentary Weiner, about the former congressman Anthony Weiner's failed campaign to become the mayor of New York City. Among the many casualties of that run — including, in a tangential way, the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton — was the marriage between Weiner and Huma Abedin, who also happened to a top Clinton aide. There was a time when Weiner and Abedin were securing their place in the aristocracy: They married the year after Weiner won the first of his seven terms in the House of Representatives — Bill Clinton officiated their wedding — and their union survived the first sexting scandal, nicknamed Weinergate, which led to his resignation from Congress. Weiner chronicles his attempt at a political comeback, which unravels after another round of sexts, sent under the pseudonym Carlos Danger, torpedoes his campaign for good.\n\nNobody can know for certain what goes on in a marriage, but political unions like the one between Chuck and Wendy — and Anthony and Huma, and Bill and Hillary — plainly involve considerations other than the boring-old conventions of trust, fidelity and happiness. We saw it last season, when Chuck and Wendy dined with a couple that does everything together and recoiled at their lovey-dovey intimacy. Chuck Sr. may seem like a sinister interloper in a relationship he knows nothing about, but he's there to remind Wendy that she entered into a political marriage and that the arrangement calls for a certain amount of flexibility. A couple of scenes later, when Chuck advises Wendy to tell Oliver Dake the truth (I don't want you to lie for me), it may be the most romantic moment they've ever had on the show. They even hold hands!
LOS ANGELES — The composer Matthew Aucoin began working on Crossing, his first opera, when he was in college. It was a work of enormous talent, exciting promise and considerable hubris: Mr. Aucoin wrote his own libretto, inventing a story about Walt Whitman's work with wounded soldiers during the Civil War.\n\nIf Crossing (2015) lacked a certain kind of unity — as Mr. Aucoin, now 29, said in a recent interview — it was still taut, intense and audacious. What would he do next?\n\nThe answer came on Saturday, with the premiere of Eurydice at Los Angeles Opera, where it runs through Feb. 23 before traveling to the Metropolitan Opera next year. This project demanded a very different approach. Mr. Aucoin didn't write the libretto; instead, the text was a collaboration with the playwright Sarah Ruhl, closely hewing to her 2003 play, a modern-day take on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth which tells the story from the woman's perspective.
Bernie Telsey was still a student at N.Y.U. when he met an actor named Robert LuPone and decided to form a theater club. Their duo became a trio when they met Will Cantler, and soon they were putting on shows whenever and wherever they could.\n\nThat was more than three decades ago, and over the years the company they founded — now called MCC Theater, with a focus on new work by living writers — has become one of the more respected Off Broadway nonprofits, attracting such stars as Lucas Hedges, Judith Light and Zachary Quinto to its stages.\n\nBut they have never had their own building, until now. On Jan. 23, the box office opens at their first permanent home, on West 52nd Street at 10th Avenue, with two theaters, two rehearsal studios, and all the amenities (including a bar) one has come to expect from a modern theater. To have a home, it's mind-boggling, Mr. Telsey said.\n\nThe $45 million project has been a long time coming, and brings MCC into a corner of Hell's Kitchen with a growing number of performing arts organizations.
Andrew is so young — and so new to the rigors of Broadway — that he's going to begin his run doing just five performances a week, while taking vocal lessons to shore up his stamina. This will be his first professional production, and the creative team, determined to protect him as well as their smash-hit show, has decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his long-term success; the show's alternate, Michael Lee Brown, will do the other three performances as Andrew builds comfort and strength.\n\nIt's a little scary for all of us — for him, for me, for his mom — because we're asking a lot of him, said Stacey Mindich, the show's lead producer. But in every single moment he has grown with us already — at every passage he has shown us he is uber-capable.\n\nA fan of musicals and more\n\nThis is not one of those stories about someone who happened into theater unwittingly. This is a story about an unabashed theater geek — a child who has adored Broadway since he saw Beauty and the Beast at age 3, who has been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of Mr. Bundles in a community theater production of Annie at age 8; who writes songs and plays the piano, guitar, drums, ukulele and bass; who has been to all four editions of BroadwayCon, including the one last year where he won a lip-syncing competition while performing as Angelica Schuyler from Hamilton.\n\nHis passion for the imaginary goes way beyond musicals. He's a huge fan of Star Wars — We watched 'A New Hope' in English class to learn about archetypes, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is the coolest thing' — and has dressed as General Grievous and Kylo Ren for Halloween. (It's not that he's drawn to the dark side; it's just, he says, that those characters look cooler.)\n\nHe's an even huger fan of Disney (which now owns Star Wars, so maybe that's redundant). He estimates that he's been to Disney theme parks, including Disneyworld, Disneyland and Disneyland Paris, at least 20 times, starting when he was 6 months old. Something draws me to the idea of being able to live in another world, he said.\n\nAnd now he really, really loves Dear Evan Hansen. The first time he saw the musical, a couple of weeks after it opened on Broadway in 2016, he was so overcome he couldn't find the words to talk about it when his mother came to pick him up.
When the writer and director Mike Nichols was young, he had an allergic reaction to a whooping cough vaccine. The result was a complete and lifelong inability to grow hair. One way to read Mark Harris's crisp new biography, Mike Nichols: A Life, is as a tender comedy about a man and his wigs.\n\nHe got his first set (hair, eyebrows) before he went to college. It was dismal. Nichols attended the University of Chicago, where Susan Sontag was also a student. One reason they didn't date, Harris writes, is that she was thrown off by his wig.\n\nNichols moved to Manhattan to make it as a comedian. A friend said that she would enter his tiny apartment and the smell of acetone — wig-glue remover — would just hit you in the face.\n\nNichols found fame in his mid-20s. His improvisational comedy routines with Elaine May, whom he'd met in Chicago, were fresh and irresistible. They took their act to Broadway in 1960, where Nichols met Richard Burton. Through Burton, he would get to know Elizabeth Taylor.
THE CUSTOM OF the Country, Wharton's novel of divorce, was among her favorites. Begun in 1908 and published in 1913, the book took her an uncommonly long time to write. She was distracted by other projects — in those years, she produced Ethan Frome (1911) and The Reef (1912) as well as short stories — but most significantly, Wharton and her husband, Teddy, themselves divorced, after twenty-eight years of marriage, in part because Teddy had stolen significant sums of money from his wife. Although born into an eminent Yankee family with a great deal of wealth, and consequently in a considerably better position than most divorcées (then or now), she nevertheless found herself, as Martin-Wagner puts it, something of a social outcast, and left the United States for France, where she would live until her death in 1937. At the same time, her biographer R. W. B. Lewis writes, she felt propelled out of her metaphorical prison, able to exercise what Henry James had called a fantastic freedom.\n\nUndine's repeated unions and their dissolutions — by the novel's end her full name is Undine Spragg Marvell de Chelles Moffatt, though strictly speaking Moffatt should be listed twice — are on the one hand socially unsettling to (though ultimately accommodated by) New York and Paris societies, and on the other constitute for Undine that fantastic freedom. It's perhaps not totally surprising, then, that, as Lewis notes, Undine shares a number of key traits with her creator, including their childhood nickname, Puss. Wharton understood well the personal costs of marriage for women, and the limits society placed upon them. She surely put something of herself into Undine. At the same time, she knew intimately the suffering of poor Ralph Marvell, scion of old New York, who, upon reading about his divorce in the newspapers, felt that the coarse fingering of public curiosity had touched the secret places of his soul, and nothing that had gone before seemed as humiliating as this trivial comment on his tragedy.\n\nWharton's genius lies in her novelistic ability to allow her characters their perspectives while seeing the situation from all sides. Both in her lifetime and since, she has been maligned for being born rich (Franzen complains that privilege like hers isn't easy to like; it puts her at a moral disadvantage); and Janet Flanner accused her, in a waspish 1929 New Yorker profile, of lacking sensuality and sympathy, of formally proving that the wages of social sin were social death. But in fact Wharton — who could well have sat around in her fancy houses eating bonbons with her feet up rather than writing wonderfully entertaining, humanly true novels that have stood the test of time — turned her critical eye equally upon transgressors and upholders of convention alike. That's not to excuse her snobbery or to overlook the limitations of accounts of high society; but now, as then, we're fascinated by the lives of the wealthy, and shouldn't project our own secret shame about it onto Wharton. Her sharp wit is hard on all her characters, and crucially, she captures also their redeeming qualities, their humanity. She sees and understands Undine's laser-focused ambition, her parents' trembling and self-sacrificing indulgence, Ralph's highly cultured but weak romanticism, Elmer's robust desire for material success. And she appreciates also Undine's splendor, her vitality and allure, Ralph's delicacy and tenderness, Elmer's frankness and generosity. Like the novel's discreet and cheerful Mrs. Heeny, masseuse and manicurist to the rich, who travels from house to house with her bag full of press clippings, Wharton observes and records it all. In this new Gilded Age, when the disparities between rich and poor are again, and disastrously, as great as they were in Wharton's time, we could do with such a novelist, a cultural anthropologist who might hold up a mirror to our failings and our future, with eagle-eyed clarity and a small measure of compassion.\n\nClaire Messud is the award-winning author of eight books, including The Burning Girl and, most recently, Kant's Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write: An Autobiography Through Essays.
CHAPTER ONE\n\nTo Keep the Waters Troubled\n\nThe Life of Ida B. Wells\n\n\n\nBy LINDA O. McMURRY\n\n\n\nOxford University Press\n\nRead the Review\n\nChildhood and Early Adulthood\n\nA happy, light-hearted schoolgirl\n\nThe remarkable journey of Ida Wells began during the Civil War in the northern Mississippi town of Holly Springs. It was not the most auspicious place for an African American to be born, for Mississippi has been the site of horrific incidents of white racism and violence. In the antebellum period, slaves from other states feared being sold down to Mississippi; later, some of the bloodiest chapters of the civil rights movement would be written there. Nevertheless, Ida B. Wells was born at a time and place in Mississippi that offered African Americans cause for hope as well as discouragement. Her parents also emerged from slavery with more opportunity than many.\n\nAlthough slavery was hardly a benevolent institution, as white southerners sought to paint it, some slaves were more privileged than others. Sources of privilege included kinship with the master, acquisition of valuable skills, and the opportunity to be hired out in cities. Ida's father, James Wells, apparently benefited from all three. His master/father owned a plantation in Tippah County and had no children by his white wife, Miss Polly. Like many slave owners, he had a black family with a slave--Peggy. Born in 1840, James Wells was their first child and was cherished by his father, who was relatively old when James was born. Such liaisons were deeply resented by most slave owners' white wives, who felt the bitterness of betrayal and the humiliation of seeing tangible, public proof of their husbands' infidelity in the skin color of the children. These wives' wrath was sometimes unleashed on the slave women who shared their husband's attention, whether or not the bondswomen were willing participants in the relationships. James Wells recalled how Miss Polly had gotten someone to strip and whip Peggy the day after her husband died.\n\nBefore his death, James's father had taken him to Holly Springs, in northern Mississippi, to be apprenticed to a carpenter. Thus at age eighteen, James Wells gained a valuable skill and a measure of independence as a hired-out slave living in town. Masters hired out their slaves to other people for a variety of reasons--usually for compensation or for their slaves to acquire certain skills. Hired-out slaves enjoyed a wide range of freedom, and some received very little. Life in cities and towns, however, gave many hired-out slaves some freedom from supervision, and most found more autonomy than the slaves on their masters' plantations.\n\nIn Holly Springs, Wells learned carpentry and acquired a mate at the residence of a contractor and builder named Bolling. He fell in love with Elizabeth Warrenton, the cook in the Bolling household. As slaves they could not legally marry, but they lived as man and wife and legalized their vows after emancipation--as many slaves did. Unlike James, Elizabeth (born in 1844) had not been sheltered from bondage's worst abuses. One of ten children born to slaves in Virginia, she vividly recalled receiving beatings from her masters. She also suffered one of the worst abuses of slavery: She and two of her sisters were sold and separated from their family. Such separations were painful reminders of slaves' vulnerability and cut them off from the very people who provided comfort and support to cope with the harsh realities of slavery. Like so many others, Elizabeth sent inquiries back to Virginia after emancipation in a vain attempt to find her lost family.\n\nIda Bell Wells was the first child born to the couple. Her birth on 16 July 1862 was in the midst of the Civil War. At first the Union and the Confederacy carefully tried to separate the issue of slavery from their war aims, but the process of the war ultimately destroyed the system of human bondage. When Union troops arrived nearby, many slaves sought to liberate themselves by fleeing behind Union lines. After a period of confusion over the status of these fugitives (at first, slaves were often returned to their Confederate masters), the U.S. Congress directed that escaped slaves of rebel masters could be considered contraband of war and proclaimed free. Nevertheless, when Union troops moved out of a region, some of the newly freed slaves found themselves recaptured in the web of slavery. For many southerners of all shades, the transition from slavery to freedom was chaotic and confusing. Ida Wells's birthplace was the scene of more-than-average confusion.\n\nHolly Springs was captured and recaptured by the two armies, changing hands at least fifty-nine times during the war. Its geography and its history made the city's experiences of the war and Reconstruction both typical and atypical of most of the state. When Ida was born, Holly Springs had existed for only a few decades. In 1832 the Chickasaw ceded the region, known as the Chickasaw Cession, to the federal government. Four years later the territory was divided into counties--the largest of which was Marshall County with Holly Springs as its seat. While still carving the city from the wilderness, its settlers sought to make it a cultural center. Even before the town was incorporated, residents voted in a town meeting to establish the Holly Springs Female Institute, the first of a number of educational institutions. By 1850 the county was spending more on higher education than all the rest of the state, excluding the budget of the University of Mississippi. A history of the state noted that in 1891 Holly Springs, called the City of Flowers, was widely known for the hospitality and culture of its people.\n\nOne reason for the culture and prosperity in Holly Springs was the arrival of successful cotton planters, who had moved west for more fertile soil, as well as many others who grew cotton on a smaller scale. King Cotton demanded slaves; the 1840 county population of 17,536 included 8,260 slaves and 8 free blacks. As a new town with many land claim cases, the city also was the home to numerous lawyers. Both lawyers and planters tended to join the Whig party, which dominated the town's early politics--until the rise of the slavery issue in national debate. The controversy destroyed the party there as elsewhere and no compromise Democrats rose in power.\n\nBy 1860 the county's population had grown to almost 29,000, including 1,295 slave owners and 17,439 slaves; the free black population remained at 8. Now a minority, whites became even more determined to retain slavery as a source of control and power, and Marshall County played an integral role in Mississippi's march toward secession. One of its residents was coauthor of the state's ordinance of secession, and when it was signed on 9 January 1861, the county provided five signatories--more than any other county. Thus a year and a half before Ida Wells's birthday, her parents and the rest of Holly Springs probably waited anxiously for the outcome of the bold move toward disunion.\n\nBecause whites were outnumbered, a constant fear of racial revolt lingered in many minds. Such fear was intensified by the uncertainties of war. Early in the hostilities planters summoned home some of their hired-out slaves. The state legislature also moved to control slaves by penalizing masters who granted their bondsmen and bondswomen too much freedom. Even so, rumors spread like epidemics, fanning the fever of fear with lurid descriptions of insurrection plots. Hysteria required no tangible evidence. The month Ida was born, the provost marshal of Natchez reported the hanging of forty African Americans during the preceding year, foreshadowing the postwar terror and murder of black men to retain white control. By the end of the century only the dominant excuse had changed--from insurrection to rape.\n\nAt first Holly Springs seemed to have been spared the worst of the hysteria and war. Not until about two weeks before Ida's birth in July 1862 did the first significant Civil War skirmish occur near Holly Springs. A considerable number of Confederate troops remained in the area until later that fall when Union General Ulysses S. Grant began moving troops into northern Mississippi in preparation for the Vicksburg campaign. Before his army reached Holly Springs, Confederate forces partially dismantled the local foundry and retreated to a more defensible position. Grant proceeded to establish a large supply depot in the city. Weapons, ammunition, food, and other materials filled every public building as well as churches, the Masonic Temple, and even a few private homes. While he briefly made his headquarters there, the city's black population celebrated a rare degree of freedom.\n\nAs Grant's army moved deeper into slave territory, slaves began coming in larger numbers to the Union camps. To handle the hordes, Grant asked Chaplain John Eaton to establish a camp for the contrabands. Eaton chose Grand Junction, Tennessee, as the camp's location--just across the state line from Holly Springs. Eaton later described the scene of slaves coming garbed in rags or silks, with feet shod or bleeding, individually or in families and larger groups,--an army of slaves and fugitives, pushing its way irresistibly toward an army of fighting men. Although the Wells family and many other slaves chose to remain in Holly Springs, the camp's nearby location had an ameliorating impact on slavery in that city.\n\nLate in the fall of 1862, Grant's army moved south, leaving only twenty-five hundred troops in Holly Springs. Until that time Holly Springs had suffered little damage, although the town and the surrounding countryside had changed hands frequently. On a plantation near Holly Springs, eighteen-year-old Cordelia Scales wrote letters describing the changing parade of Union and Confederate troops that camped in her yard. Both seem to have foraged--but not unduly. Some outlying plantations suffered more than others, but major destruction of the town began with the raid by Confederate General Earl Van Dorn on 20 December 1862. Van Dorn's men quickly routed the outnumbered and unsuspecting federal troops in Holly Springs. Knowing they had little time, Confederate soldiers rapidly looted the easily transportable federal supplies. Then, from early morning until 4:00 P.M., they set fire to the many buildings housing the remaining stores. Exploding ammunition caused further destruction and some deaths. J. G. Deupree, a participant, described the scene as\n\nwild and exciting: Federals running; Confederates yelling and pursuing; tents and houses burning; torches flaming; guns popping; sabres clanking; negroes and abolitionists begging for mercy; women, in dreaming robes and with disheveled hair floating in the morning breeze, shouting encouragement to the raiders; a mass of frantic, frightened human beings.\n\nOf all the frantic, frightened human beings few were more scared than the negroes and abolitionists begging for mercy. James and Elizabeth Wells may well have feared for their six-month-old infant.\n\nThe destruction was not yet complete. Two days later federal troops returned. One Iowa soldier watched sadly as every portion of the fated city seemed given over to pillage and destruction and no hand was raised to save anything from the general sack and ruin. He was especially disturbed by the sacrileges committed in a church and the women and children standing in their homes wailing with the most piteous cries. Before Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered on 4 May 1865, Holly Springs had witnessed more than a dozen major skirmishes. After so much chaos and confusion, the county's slaves must have wondered if freedom had actually come to stay, while whites worried about what would replace slavery. Former masters and former slaves warily sought to redefine their new relationships.\n\nAfter the war was over, James Wells accepted Bolling's invitation to continue working for him. Like most freed people, Wells sought to test and taste the varied fruits of freedom. He first exercised those rights that white southerners had grudgingly conceded--legalizing his marriage and seeking education for his family. The Wells family continued to grow in the years following the war, and eventually Ida had four brothers and three sisters. Both parents were eager for their children to go to school. Former slaves realized that education had been forbidden because it was a key to freedom and a source of white power. Most slave children had worked at an early age; their freed fathers wanted them to have childhoods more like those of their former masters' children. Ida Wells later recalled, Our job was to go to school and learn all we could.\n\nShe began school at such an early age that she could not remember when or where she started. Her earliest recollections were of reading the newspaper to her father and his friends and of her mother going to school with the children until she was able to read the Bible. Students of all ages clustering around a limited number of books in small schools was a common sight to the newly freed slaves during Reconstruction. Whether Ida's father learned to read is unclear. Her reading the newspaper to him and his friends could have represented a father's desire to show off the accomplishments of his offspring or his inability to read for himself. Like many freed heads of households, James Wells was undoubtedly busy and apparently did not attend school with his family. However, he may have learned to read and write from his father or as an apprentice. Regardless, Wells was deeply involved in education because he was one of the trustees of Shaw University, the school Ida attended in Holly Springs.\n\nIn addition to exercising their rights to marriage and education, freedmen eagerly embraced the right to vote. For the entire Republican Reconstruction period in Mississippi (1867-1875), African Americans comprised a majority of the county's population and overwhelmingly supported Republicans despite white Democrats' efforts to win their votes. The Democrats used both carrots and sticks to woo black voters. Many used economic intimidation to persuade African Americans to vote for Democrats. James Wells was one victim of such tactics. When Bolling found out that Wells had not voted Democratic, he locked Wells out of his shop. Wells, however, was not easily intimidated. Without saying a word to anyone, he bought his own tools, rented a house, and moved his family out of the dwelling owned by Bolling.\n\nSome African Americans followed the path of James Wells, but black voters responded in a variety of ways. Like Wells, a number openly demonstrated their independence--a few attended Democratic barbecues and picnics adorned in caps with the Republican insignia. Others dissembled. One man, threatened with eviction by his white landlord if he voted Republican, won a reprieve with the explanation that he had been forced to vote for Republicans by black threats to run him out of town. Many accepted Democratic gifts and then voted Republican anyway. A few did become Democrats either out of loyalty to former masters or employers or because of economic threats and incentives. The leader of a black Democratic club was rewarded with the gift of a small house by his white fellow Democrats.\n\nAlthough a numerical minority in Marshall County, Democrats were able to get most of their candidates elected as late as the election of 1871. To do so, they utilized both intimidation and fraud. Tactics included counterfeiting Republican ballots, attempting to confuse voters by using African Americans to distribute Democratic tickets, hiding in the building to stuff ballot boxes while the election clerks were eating supper, and requiring black voters to present written proof of their age. As a result of reported electoral fraud, the state legislature refused to seat two Marshall County Democrats elected in 1871. In the next election, the Republicans swept all the county's offices. One African American served as state senator and three as representatives. However, two years later in 1875, the Democrats returned to power--permanently. Black Mississippi politician John Roy Lynch later noted, The new order of things was then set aside and the abandoned methods of a few years back were reviewed, reinaugurated, and readopted.\n\nIda recalled that her father was interested in politics and remembered the anxious way my mother walked the floor at night when my father was out to a political meeting. Her mother had good reason to be concerned. Whites resented all black political participation but especially loathed the Loyal League, a black political organization founded and often controlled by white Republicans across the South. The Holly Springs branch of the League was established by A. C. McDonald of Shaw University and Nelson Gill of the Freedmen's Bureau. It usually met in Gill's home or in the black Baptist church. During one meeting, members of the local Ku Klux Klan hid under Gill's house listening to the proceedings and waiting for J. L. Holland, who had been chosen among them by lot, to shoot Gill. When Holland finally decided it was time and aimed his pistol, another Klansman had second thoughts and knocked the gun out of Holland's hand just as he fired it. No one was hurt, but all were scared. Afterward, pickets were posted outside during Loyal League meetings.\n\nHeated campaigns led to physical assaults and fights--apparently instigated by Democrats. Republican speakers were pelted with sticks and brickbats, had their coattails ripped, were buggy-whipped, and had their legs broken. The most serious incident of violence was the fatal shooting of Tyler Williamson, an African American who was called a very turbulent leader and exceedingly impudent to the white people. Despite that incident, Holly Springs remained more peaceful than many towns and cities during Reconstruction. Ida Wells noted in her autobiography that she could not remember any riots in the city, although there were plenty in other parts of the state.\n\nPolitical violence and Klan activities frightened Elizabeth Wells and others, but Reconstruction also brought new hope and opportunity to Mississippi's black population. Although brief, the period of Republican ascendancy in Holly Springs had to be a source of great pride to the Wells's and other black families. Most whites, although they resented black political power, agreed that the city had been blessed with extraordinarily capable and honest black officeholders. Two were singled out for praise: James Hill, who rose from the state legislature to become Mississippi's secretary of state from 1874 to 1878, and Hiram Rhodes Revels, who moved to Holly Springs in the mid-1870s, and became the first African American U.S. senator. Both won white respect by their conciliatory attitudes. But whites also noted that although State Senator George Allbright was a willing and eager tool in the hands of Gill, he was a negro who was above average in intelligence. At the height of black political power in Holly Springs, Ida Wells was a child of about ten. The events she witnessed may have whetted her interest in politics, which remained strong her entire life.\n\nAlthough James Wells was known as a race man who was intensely interested in politics, he apparently never held office but stayed busy running a business and taking care of his growing family. As in many households, however, Ida's mother played the biggest role in the day-to-day affairs of the children. A very religious woman, Elizabeth Wells made sure that her children attended church regularly. The Wells family likely belonged to Asbury Methodist Church, where Shaw University classes were first held. Ida was baptized in that faith at the age of twelve. Ida recalled that her mother won the prize for regular attendance at Sunday school, taking the whole brood of six to nine o'clock Sunday school the year before she died. Elizabeth Wells was a strict disciplinarian who kept close watch over her children. She regularly went to their school to check on their progress, taught them how to do household chores, and assigned each tasks around the home. Ida proudly asserted that her mother brought us up with a strict discipline that many mothers who have had educational advantages have not exceeded.\n\nLike many African American families, the Wells family was part of a network of kinship. Although Elizabeth Wells had been unable to locate her parents and other siblings, her sister Belle, who had also been sold to Mississippi owners, lived out in the country near Holly Springs. James Wells's mother, Peggy, married a black man (probably named Buffer) after emancipation and also lived nearby. They apparently lived as man and wife during slavery and had a daughter named Margaret and at least one other son. The Butlers tilled a number of acres and brought their corn and cotton to sell in Holly Springs each fall. Utilizing that trip for a family visit, they usually brought gifts, some of which Ida called souvenirs from hog-killing time. On one such visit, Ida recalled her father angrily refusing his mother's request to go see his father's widow, Miss Polly, reminding his mother of how Miss Polly had her whipped and saying, I am never going to see her. I guess it is all right for you to take care of her and forgive her for what she did to you, but she could have starved to death if I'd had my say-so. She certainly would have, if it hadn't been for you. In addition to those visits, Ida sometimes went to stay with her grandmother and aunt and uncle, who helped Peggy and her husband on the farm. Apparently, another uncle and his wife, Fannie Butler, had three children and lived in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nWhen Ida reached her teens, she enrolled at Shaw University (informally called Rust College until 1890, when the name change became official), where she was greatly influenced by the missionary spirit of the school. Under the jurisdiction of the Methodist Episcopal Church, North, Rust was strongly tinged with evangelical Christianity. Students were required to attend daily chapel, weekly prayer meetings, and church on Sunday. W. W. Hooper, who became president of Rust while Ida was a student, was remembered as a religious man who prayed in chapel with his eyes open and would call your name when he got through if you didn't behave. Such an environment reinforced the religious training Ida received at home.\n\nRust's curriculum spanned from elementary education to normal school training for teachers--a four-year high school level program. A. C. McDonald founded the school to make former slaves and their children useful, independent citizens. In 1875 he wrote the following:\n\nIt is our aim to do no hot-house work, seeking to hurry students through a college curriculum ... sending them into the battle of life only to disgrace themselves and bring reproach upon the cause of education at large, but to take the far more difficult and tedious plan of trying to lay well a foundation for a broad, thorough and practical education.\n\nAs in many schools for African Americans of that era, Rust's faculty was predominately white. Most of the teachers were northerners who saw themselves as missionaries. The white women teachers influenced Ida's concept of ideal womanhood and her acceptance of Victorian codes of propriety. At the same time, she may have been inspired by the example of black faculty member Ophelia Smith who wrote, I love my race.\n\nWhile a student at Rust, Ida encountered the joys and sorrows of puberty. She experienced her first love and its painful demise. James B. Combs was a Rust student from Georgia, who boarded with a local family. Described in the 1880 U.S. census as mulatto, Combs was about five years older than Wells and apparently was the one to end the relationship. He married someone else and remained in Holly Springs for at least ten years--his presence reminding Wells of the impermanence of love. Throughout her twenties Ida remained skittish of committing herself to just one man.\n\nOther relationships caused difficulties for Wells at Rust. In late 1885, she referred to her tenure at Rust as my darkest days. Ida's fiery temper often got her in trouble, and a confrontation with President Hooper apparently led to her dismissal sometime in 1880 or 1881. For years she resented him tremendously for her expulsion, but in June 1886 she admitted to herself that her own tempestuous, rebellious, hard headed wilfulness was to blame. She rued her disposition to question his authority and asserted, I no longer cherish feelings of resentment, nor blame him that my scholastic career was cut short.\n\nIn 1878 Ida B. Wells encountered the next painful chapter of her life while on a visit to her grandmother. That year witnessed a devastating yellow fever epidemic in the Mississippi Valley. The region had undergone previous epidemics of yellow fever, but none was as extensive or deadly as the 1878 outbreak. An unusually mild winter, an early spring, and a blistering hot summer had allowed the mosquitoes, which served as the fever's agent of transmission, to breed prolifically and over a wide range of territory. Thus the fever spread to areas that had never experienced an epidemic; therefore, most residents of those regions had no acquired immunities to yellow fever. Compounding these factors, the strain of virus that year was particularly deadly, which caused higher mortality rates even in areas previously infected. In some regions the mortality rates exceeded 50 percent.\n\nLacking a good understanding of how the fever was spread, most Holly Springs residents believed their town to be immune, so the city opened its doors to people from other infested cities. The first refugees were housed in a small brick building that had served as the original land office. Within a week one of the refugees had died, which was only the beginning of the terrible toll the fever would exact in Holly Springs. On 4 September 1878, the New Orleans Picayune reported fifty cases of yellow fever in Holly Springs and two deaths; an epidemic was declared and panic began, causing a frenzied effort at flight from the unseen terror so that streets were jammed with every conceivable type of vehicle loaded with baggage and human beings. By the next day a different scene was described: The hurry and confusion of panic is gone. No hurried footsteps sound along the forsaken streets unless they seek help or a doctor. Hollow echoes mock their passing. The mass exodus reduced the town's population from about thirty-five hundred to fifteen hundred, comprised of three hundred whites and twelve hundred African Americans. One who remained telegraphed on 5 September, The stores are all closed.... Physicians are broken down.... Many cases will die today.... Gloom, despair, and death rule the hour, and the situation is simply appalling. Only a few dozen of those who stayed escaped the fever; by the end of the epidemic, 215 whites and 89 African Americans had died.\n\nWhile Holly Springs was reeling from yellow fever, Ida was safe at her grandmother's house and presumed that the rest of the family had evacuated the city and gone to stay with her mother's sister Belle. When no word came from them, she assumed delivery of the mail had been disrupted. Then three men from Holly Springs brought her a letter, which she scanned until, as she later recalled, four sentences caught her eye: Jim and Lizzie Wells have both died of the fever. They died within twenty-four hours of each other. The children are all at home and the Howard Association has put a woman there to take care of them. Send word to Ida. She immediately fainted and came to in a house of mourning surrounded by her grandmother, aunt, and uncle. Her father had died on 26 September and her mother the next day.\n\nWells was concerned about her younger siblings in Holly Springs. Two years earlier the next oldest child, Eugenia, had developed severe scoliosis that had bent her spinal column until she became paralyzed below the waist. Next in order of birth were her brothers James, age eleven, and George, age nine. Her two youngest sisters were five-year-old Annie, and Lily, about two. The youngest sibling was a nine-month-old baby named Stanley. Another brother, Eddie, had died a number of years earlier of spinal meningitis. Wells wanted to go to the children immediately, but her relatives would not allow her to leave until they received a letter from a doctor saying that she should come.\n\nWhen Ida arrived at the house, she found out that all the children except Eugenia had been stricken with the fever. Although most had slight cases, the baby had died on 3 October, and two still remained in bed. Eugenia told her what had happened since the fever struck, recounting their father's contribution to the emergency. To protect his family while he built coffins and comforted the sick, James Wells left home but came daily as far as the gate to bring food and to check on them. Elizabeth, however, was the first of the family to be stricken. An Irish woman was sent to nurse her, and James came home to help--only to come down with the fever himself.\n\nJames Wells had been a master Mason, which in the black community often operated as a safety net for its members and their families. Thus once the epidemic had passed, a group of Masons gathered at the Wells home to discuss what was to become of the children. After many hours of discussion, they had come to an agreement on the arrangements. They decided that Ida was old enough to take care of herself, but the others would have to be parceled out. Two of the Masons' wives each agreed to take one of the younger girls, Annie and Lily. The two boys were to be apprenticed to two different men--one of whom was a local white who was familiar with their father's work and hoped his son shared Wells's carpentry skills. The big problem was Eugenia. Because of her paralysis, no one wanted the responsibility of caring for her, so she was to be sent to a poorhouse.\n\nWhile the men were divvying up the children, Ida had sat quietly. When they finished, however, she calmly announced that her parents would turn over in their graves to know their children had been scattered like that and she did not intend to let it happen. She would care for them if the Masons would help her find work. Although they initially scoffed at the idea, Ida was adamant and they relented--probably relieved to be rid of the responsibility. Wells later subtly altered the past and her experiences at Rust University by recollecting, After being a happy, light-hearted schoolgirl I suddenly found myself at the head of a family. Actually, her days there were less than idyllic, and she continued to attend Rust between school terms until her expulsion some two years later.\n\nAt age sixteen, Ida B. Wells was able to keep her family together because her father had been industrious and frugal. He had left them a house free of debt and accumulated savings of at least three hundred dollars. That met their needs for awhile, but Ida needed to find work. On the suggestion of the Masons, she sought a teaching job in a country school. She successfully passed the examination and was assigned to a school six miles outside of Holly Springs with a salary of twenty-five dollars a month. While she waited for school to open, Wells lengthened all her skirts for the transition from schoolgirl to schoolmarm.\n\nUntil that time, Wells had been sheltered by her parents, who were very protective. She had not been allowed to be in the presence of men unchaperoned, and her contacts with boys had been limited to what she called children's parties. She was naive and society was suspicious of women living without the protection of a father, husband, or male relative. The result was a pattern of rumors that would plague her until she married. After she insisted on staying in the family home with her siblings, the word spread that Wells wanted the house for illicit assignations with a white man. She was dimly aware that such arrangements existed, but she was deeply shocked and hurt that people believed her capable of such action.\n\nAlthough Wells was listed as the head of the household in the 1880 U.S. census, she received help in meeting her responsibilities from her extended family and friends. Mr. and Mrs. James Hall, family friends who were in their early thirties, served as guardians. After fallacious rumors that Wells was having an affair with a white doctor, her grandmother, Peggy, came from the country to stay with them. Although she was in her seventies, she tried to help out by working during the day. However, one night Peggy collapsed with a paralytic stroke, and her daughter took her back to the country to care for her until she died?\n\nOnce Wells started to work at the country school, she needed someone to watch the children during the week. An old friend of her mother's (probably Rachel Rather) agreed to do so. Rather was from Virginia, twenty-four years older than Elizabeth, and may have served as a surrogate mother to her. She took care of the children until Ida would come home every Friday, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. Before she returned on Sunday afternoon, Wells did all the laundry and housecleaning for the week. She also cooked for the children, often using eggs and butter that people near her school had given her. Fortunately, she did not have to keep up this frantic pace for too long. Gradually, she was relieved of the responsibility for some of the children. By 1880, her brother James, who the family called Jim, had left home and had become apprenticed to a carpenter. Although he was no longer under her direct supervision, Wells still worried about Jim. She later called him her problem child because he was constantly getting into minor difficulties, especially with women. He would then go to Ida, who would help him out of the trouble. George was quieter and also became a carpenter's apprentice, eventually moving to Kansas.\n\nWells taught for three years in Marshall County and Tate County schools and for six months in a school in Cleveland County, Arkansas. In 1881 Wells accepted the invitation of her aunt, Fannie Wells, to come to Memphis. Fannie lived there with her three small children, having been widowed by the yellow fever epidemic. Wells brought her two youngest sisters with her to Memphis, while Eugenia went to live with their Aunt Belle on her farm. After she arrived in the city at the age of nineteen, Wells continued to teach--first in the nearby town of Woodstock, and after 1884 in the city schools of Memphis.\n\nForced into an early adulthood by her parents' deaths, in Memphis Wells began to feel the pull of conflicting duties and desires that marked her entire life. As she struggled to balance her responsibilities to her family and her race, Wells also sought to fulfill her personal needs for independence and security. Her quest for self-identity was complicated by a temperament that made it difficult for her accept the gender and racial roles expected of her. After much seeking and struggling, Wells became both a woman and an activist in Memphis.
But I happened to be in a relationship at that time, said Ms. McCulley, who graduated from Pomona College and received two master's degrees, one in business administration and the other in sport management from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She was also a Fulbright scholar in Switzerland from 2009-2010, where she conducted research on European sports law.\n\nThey parted ways but Tinder soon put them on another course, this one in May 2017.\n\nI was very excited, Mr. Spencer said. Though I must admit, I needed a bit of a nudge to remember having met Kayla previously through the car pool.\n\nMs. McCulley provided the nudge, and two weeks later, Mr. Spencer took her on a whirlwind first date that included a stop for coffee and churros, followed by some bookstore browsing and ending with blues dancing lessons.\n\nOn their sixth date, the book club was created.\n\nThat's about the time when we first started getting serious, said Mr. Spencer, who graduated from M.I.T. and received a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nWe often discussed our favorite books with one another, he said. That became a great way to learn new things about each other, and to feel more comfortable when in each other's presence.
In a crucial early scene of Janacek's Katya Kabanova, the title character, a young woman trapped in a stultifying marriage to a timid merchant in a town on the Volga, recalls memories of her carefree childhood. As a girl, Katya tells Varvara, her adopted sister-in-law, she would rise early on summer days, wash in the stream and tend to every flower in her house. Going to church was like falling into a trance, Katya says; she imagined rising to heaven to watch angels fly.\n\nJanacek's restless music suggests that this nostalgic confession is fraught with Katya's instability. The emotional complexities came through strongly on Friday night when the Juilliard School opened a production of Katya Kabanova by the director Stephen Wadsworth at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater — and not just because the soprano Felicia Moore, as Katya, sang so expressively.\n\nThe dramatic impact was enhanced because the opera was performed in an English translation of Janacek's original Czech libretto. It used to be common, if never the prevailing practice, for operas to be translated into the language of the audience, especially in the United States. This was especially true for less familiar works, though I have wonderful early memories of hearing staples like The Marriage of Figaro and La Bohème performed in English.\n\nThis practice involves a trade-off. Great composers wrote vocal lines that hewed to the sounds and flow of the words in the libretto, and that bond is hard to mimic even in the best translations. The advantage is the direct communication between singers and audiences that can result.
I am 17. Since I was a baby, my mother has taken me to church with her on Sunday mornings. Recently, I've felt less religious and less interested in going than I used to. But when I bring this up with her, it always ends in a screaming match (especially on Sunday mornings). She believes I must go. We get along fairly well otherwise. Is there a better way to broach this subject, or should I simply endure the weekly ritual until I go to college?\n\nSARA\n\nIn one of the great understatements in (boxing) history, Floyd Mayweather Jr. once said, Self-preservation is an important thing to me. So it should be to all of us. You are probably financially dependent on your mother — and will be, to some extent, when you go to college. Nothing in your letter suggests a dire backdrop, but many young people are cut off by their parents for warring over hot topics such as religion or sexuality. Keep that (and your best interests) in mind.\n\nI applaud your mom for wanting a regular spiritual component in your life. But that needn't be church (in my irrelevant opinion) for one disinclined and on the cusp of adulthood. Suggest a weekly commitment to serving those in need — at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter, maybe — in lieu of church. She may go for a switcheroo with a moral and compassionate flavor. (Or she may want you sitting in the pew next to her.) Bring it up quietly at dinner some Tuesday night and see how it goes.\n\nVegansplaining\n\nI am a passionate vegan for many reasons. But contrary to popular opinion, I do not speak about them. Still, when asked if I am vegan, I suffer an instant barrage of unsolicited opinions — from You're going to die of malnutrition to Stop being a snowflake; animals don't have feelings. This offends me. These conversations aren't about me explaining my choices, but others imposing their (often incorrect) views on me. I am a peace-loving person, but I would like a saucy comeback. Can you oblige?
FIRE SERMON\n\nBy Jamie Quatro\n\n208 pp. Grove Press. $24\n\nTHERE ARE BOOKS with front doors, through which the reader walks right in, and there are books with side doors. Side door books take more interpretive work, but yield special pleasures. Jamie Quatro's fantastic new novel, Fire Sermon, is a side door book. The novel delivers its story through a variety of methods: first-person confessions, fictional third-person descriptions, letters sent and unsent, emails, questionnaires, Socratic dialogues with the self. Roiling, raw and sensual on the surface, this mazy novel rewards a second reading.\n\nThe plot is simple: A married woman is trying to forget her lover. The woman, Maggie Ellmann, a contented mother of two grown children, meets James, a married poet, at a conference. They spend two years falling into a long-distance emotional affair. The affair culminates in a single, searing night together in Chicago, after which they part for good. In the unsent letters she writes to James during this embargo, Maggie struggles to find a theological framework for her longing and her pain. In one such letter, she admires the Buddhist notion of death as the ultimate lack of attachment, noting, What relief there would be in no longer longing to feel, again, your whiskers on my inner thighs. Her antagonist is time — so slow when she is trying to forget, so quick when she reflects on the simpler years with her husband and children, before the erotic disruption.\n\nThe novel dips back through time to track life before the affair. The mores of the Ellmanns' lives are exceedingly conventional, as are many of the novel's touchstones — weddings, baptisms, the death of pets. But the way this slim book condenses these happenings in the context of the affair gives them poetry. Lyrical lists of domestic detritus contain the sweetness of child rearing, as well as a mysterious sense of loss: Parent meetings, medical forms, class photos, permission slips. Organelles. Passive versus active transport. Quatro cuts gorgeous topiaries into the domestic landscape. Maggie's little daughter mispronounces nail polish as pale nolish; her son fashions a makeshift loincloth from his father's old T-shirt, with a wrapping-paper tube for a spear. But over the years, invasive plants encroach, privet and wisteria, thistle and honeysuckle. The backyard steadily shrinks. Even before she meets James, Maggie is aware of a lack of feeling, an inattentiveness to self — this nothing. This nothing can partly be traced back to two difficult childbirths, and the habitual surrendering of her own body to others, most especially during sex, into which her usually benign husband manipulates and bullies her. Middle age looms. The children grow into complicated teenagers, then leave for college. In other words, Maggie has been in a personal stasis for a long time. Enter James. She first becomes aware of him through reading his poetry, which she admires. I think I'm going to write to him, she announces to her husband, Thomas.\n\nImage\n\nPoor Thomas. He surely has his side of the story, but we don't get it here. Instead we are told: Thomas is, in fact, a good husband. Syntactically, the sentence says so much. The fact of the husband's goodness becomes a sidebar. Maggie is aware of, but helpless against, the greed for more love, when she already has more than most. The marriage has its problems, but the biggest one is its earthly limitations, the waning of interest and desire — its mortality. Only if a person were married to God would she or he have a partner who would never suffer from overfamiliarity.
I also wanted to be honest about my feelings without hurting his. He seemed unfazed when I suggested it may be awkward to appear as Eddie and Sally Obermueller and morph into a singular identity that looked like neither of us.\n\nEddie responded just as casually: What about our kids?\n\nGood question.\n\nWe both remembered being children and grappling with our cultural identities.\n\nStarting in my youth, I went exclusively by Sally as my American name . It's a change many Asian immigrants make in order to assimilate to their new worlds. Having a Western name was a kind of status symbol in the ethnic enclave of Southern California where I grew up, where the prosperous and so-called model minorities aimed to set themselves apart.\n\nA cascade of embarrassment would overcome me any time my real first name, Phuong, was discovered. The start and end of the school year served as the bookends to my self-consciousness.\n\nMy heart pounded as I spoke up at roll call on the first day of school to ask my teachers to call me Sally. And I would quickly and quietly cross out my legal name in yearbooks when the last day of school came near, replacing it with Sally and hoping those who flipped past the page wouldn't notice.\n\nAnd my last name was no cakewalk either. I was a girl taunted for being a Ho.\n\nI couldn't wait to shed for good the stupid jokes involving Santa Claus and prostitutes, comforting myself with the idea that I had a married name to look forward to. It was a Western tradition I was excited for, even though it's not the norm in Asian cultures like mine.
Maj. Charles S. Kettles, an Army helicopter commander in the Vietnam War, led an extraordinary rescue operation that saved the lives of dozens of airborne troops who had been ambushed by North Vietnamese soldiers in May 1967. President Barack Obama would later describe the incident as like a bad Rambo movie.\n\nMajor Kettles was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's highest citation for valor after the Medal of Honor, in 1968.\n\nBut the story of his heroism and those of his fellow helicopter crewmen remained largely unknown beyond military circles for nearly half a century.\n\nThat changed on July 18, 2016, when President Obama presented Mr. Kettles, a retired lieutenant colonel, with the Medal of Honor at the White House.
This week, Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story received six Oscar nominations, including for best actor (Adam Driver) and best actress (Scarlett Johansson). In the movie, an amicable split becomes a shattering rupture, A.O. Scott writes in his review. What is happening is catastrophic, ridiculous and also — as the lawyers know — perfectly ordinary.\n\nFor readers who have watched the movie, we're curious what the experience was like if you've gone through a divorce or if you grew up with divorced parents. If you're married and watched it with your spouse — and are still recovering — we'd love to hear from you too.\n\nShare details of your experience via the form below, and include contact information so The Times can follow up with you.

Jake Silverstein, editor in chief: What I love about this design, aside from the innate fascination of studying these couples closely, is how the subtle narrative of the four-part sequence (beginning with the husband and wife and then ending with them in a more intimate pose) perfectly captures the provocative idea posed by the question in the center.\n\nRead the cover story by Susan Dominus, Is an Open Marriage a Happier Marriage?

Katrease Stafford\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nDETROIT — The wife of alleged Kalamazoo shooter Jason Dalton saw no signs ahead of time that he planned the rampage that left six people dead and two others wounded, according to one of the lawyers representing Carole Dalton.\n\nThe day of the shooting, there was nothing until dinnertime, attorney Paul Vlachos told the Detroit Free Press Monday. There was no estrangement, no financial difficulties, they were not separated. ... There was nothing out there that would indicate something like this would happen.\n\nVlachos declined to go into detail about what transpired between Jason Dalton and his wife that day, but knocked down speculation that the couple were having marital or financial issues before the shootings.\n\nKalamazoo shooting victim, 14, breathing on her own\n\nCarole Dalton filed for divorce Thursday, according to Kalamazoo Circuit Court records.\n\nMichigan State Police 1st Lt. Dale Hinz of the Paw Paw post last week confirmed to the Free Press that investigators had heard allegations that the couple were having marital issues before the fatal shootings, but said they were unsubstantiated at that point.\n\nVlachos said the family led a relatively normal life. Jason Dalton worked as an insurance adjuster and worked as an Uber driver on the side. He said Carole Dalton works for an investment firm. They have two children, ages 15 and 10.\n\nKalamazoo shootings: Father and son remembered\n\nThe circuit court said the filing says: There has been a breakdown in the marriage relationship to the extent the objects of matrimony have been destroyed and there remains no reasonable likelihood that the marriage can be preserved, according to the MLive report.\n\nThe two were married in 1995.\n\nDalton, 45, is charged with six counts of open murder, two counts of assault with intent to murder and six counts of using a firearm to commit a felony in the Feb. 20 shooting that occurred over a four-hour period in the Kalamazoo area. He moonlighted as a driver for the Uber ride service, and authorities said he continued picking up Uber fares in between randomly shooting people. None of the victims were fares.\n\nThe police are continuing to investigate these incidents, said prosecuting attorney Jeffrey Getting, who said there were no new details to release yet.\n\nNeighbor: Kalamazoo suspect liked shooting guns at home\n\nBut Getting said a pre-exam conference is set for Thursday morning in circuit court and he'll be meeting with Dalton's attorney to discuss the case and what steps to take next.\n\nDalton's wife released a statement through Vlachos last week condemning the shootings and offering condolences to the victims and their families.\n\nOur hope is for peace and healing for the victims, the families of the victims, the Kalamazoo community and those touched by these events throughout the nation, Carole Dalton said in the statement released to the Free Press. This type of violence has no place in our society, and we express our love and support for everyone involved. We intend to cooperate in every way that we can to help determine why and how this occurred.\n\nContributing: Daniel Bethencourt, Detroit Free Press.

AP\n\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) — Marshawn Lynch strolled through the locker room he's called home for most of the past six seasons on Monday followed closely by a pack of cameras.\n\nWhether this was Lynch's final time in the Seattle Seahawks locker room remains to be determined.\n\nI don't know how that's going to go, Seattle coach Pete Carroll said on Monday. I don't know how any of these guys are going to go right now. I don't know.\n\nThe future of Lynch in Seattle is one of the big questions the Seahawks face entering the offseason.\n\nAfter an injury-filled season where Lynch played in just seven regular-season games, the Seahawks must determine whether it's time to move on or keep Beast Mode around for another season at a hefty cost.\n\nAll signs point to the marriage ending, especially with Lynch costing $11.5 million against Seattle's salary cap for the 2016 season if he returns.\n\nBut no one was willing to go so far as make declarative statements one day after Seattle's season ended in a 31-24 loss to Carolina in the NFC divisional playoff game.\n\nWe'll figure it out. It depends on how he comes back and how he works at it and all that kind of stuff, Carroll said. He had a difficult year physically.\n\nLynch was limited to just 111 carries and 417 yards in the regular season because of a hamstring injury early in the season and abdominal surgery in late November that sidelined him for the final seven games of the regular season.\n\nLynch appeared ready to return for the NFC wild-card game at Minnesota, but backed out of making the trip to Minneapolis on the Friday before the game telling the team he didn't think he could play.\n\nLynch returned for Sunday's game at Carolina, but was barely a factor in the run game with Seattle quickly falling behind 14-0 and trailing 31-0 at halftime. Lynch had six carries for 20 yards and caught two passes.\n\nWhile Lynch was out, rookie Thomas Rawls emerged as a potential replacement long term. Rawls led Seattle with 890 yards rushing in the regular season and averaged 5.6 yards per carry before suffering a broken ankle in Week 14 at Baltimore. Rawls said Monday he'll be out of his cast in the next few weeks.\n\nI let things work out the way that they work out, Rawls said. Everything is out of my control. What I can control is going out there and preparing, and showing what I can do. Everything thing else is for the guys upstairs.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
While the majority of the top 100 best-sellers in 2018 are fiction, it was one heartfelt memoir that topped this year's list. Former first lady Michelle Obama, a.k.a.

Orrin G. Hatch\n\nRight now, one of our own is suffering in a leaky prison cell in Latin America, cut off from family, friends and many of the people he loves the most. Joshua Holt, a constituent of mine and an upstanding American citizen, was arrested by Venezuelan authorities in June 2016 and jailed on false charges. His health is quickly failing, and he desperately needs our help.\n\nJosh's story is the nightmare of any American traveling abroad.\n\nMore:Iran unrest threatens Tehran's tyrants. Can protesters drive them out?\n\nMore:On immigration, Trump is positioned to do what Obama and Bush couldn't\n\nJosh first flew to Venezuela last year to marry his fiancée, Thamara Caleno Holt, a young Venezuelan woman whom he fell in love with after months of constant correspondence. Just days after their marriage, the newlyweds were detained on spurious charges — for allegedly possessing weapons and engaging in espionage. In clear violation of the Vienna Convention, Venezuelan authorities not only denied Josh medical attention but also barred access to U.S. Consular officials for the first several weeks of his incarceration.\n\nFor months, Josh's case has languished in Venezuelan courts. And while Venezuelan authorities dither, Josh continues to suffer in prison, alone and afraid in an alien country. With his case scheduled to move to trial in January, government authorities have offered no clarification as to how long the trial will take, or if U.S. officials will even be able to help Josh in legal proceedings. The Venezuelan government has also refused to guarantee that Josh will receive much-needed medical attention, even as his health continues to deteriorate.\n\nThe tragedy is that Josh is completely innocent of the crimes for which he stands accused. I know Josh to be a good and honorable man with a pure heart. As a case in point, Josh served for two years as a Mormon missionary in Washington prior to his marriage. It was in this setting that he learned Spanish and developed a deep love for the Hispanic people, culture and customs. That he would ever inflict harm on anyone, let alone the good people of Venezuela, is unthinkable.\n\nFrom the time of Josh's arrest last year, I have done everything in my power to secure his freedom. I have enlisted help from the highest levels of government, including from secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has encouraged our diplomats on the ground to stand firm in their negotiations with Venezuelan authorities. I even raised the issue of Josh's captivity with President Trump, who not long after, enacted heavy sanctions on Venezuela and called on President Nicolas Maduro to set Josh free.\n\nAs a leader looking to do what is good and just, President Maduro has an opportunity to change his country's course with the release of Josh and Thamy on humanitarian grounds. This action would be a historic step in opening the channels of communication between our two countries. With this gesture of goodwill, the governments of Venezuela and the United States could move forward together towards a better future.\n\nThe path to greater peace begins with simple steps, and I invite President Maduro to take the first step. Doing so would bring relief to the Holt family and usher in a new era of U.S.-Venezuela relations, initiating a conversation from which both nations could benefit.\n\nMore:The second 'Persian Spring' is upon us. Here's how we can make it last.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nVenezuela and the United States have significant policy differences, to be sure. But working out our disagreements should not require the life of an innocent American and his wife, who is herself a native of Venezuela. Josh and Thamy deserve to live as free citizens — not as bargaining chips in a game of global politics.\n\nAs the senior member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I recognize the importance of state sovereignty and of a fair judicial process. But I believe just as strongly in protecting human rights and upholding the principles of justice.\n\nThat's why President Maduro should release Josh and Thamy Holt. He must honor human life and recognize longstanding international conventions.\n\nI call on him to help us bring Josh home.\n\nOrrin Hatch is the senior senator from Utah, and president pro tempore of the United States Senate.
Gabriel Schoenfeld\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nDonald Trump's presidency has struck an iceberg on both sides of its hull. Starboard, with the indictment of Roger Stone, special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is circling ever closer to the president himself. Port side, the disastrous 35-day government shutdown has left a growing number of Republican pols unlashing themselves from the SS Trump's mast and searching for life jackets. The question now, as we enter another presidential election cycle, is whether they will actually jump off the foundering ship.\n\n\n\nAn increasingly attractive rescue vessel sailing by is Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of heavily Democratic Maryland, who according to multiple news reports is contemplating a 2020 primary challenge to Trump.\n\nOf course, with Trump's total domination of the GOP and the national conversation, Hogan and the others most frequently mentioned — such as Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — seem like guppies up against a shark. But that could change, and Hogan would be positioned well for a challenge.\n\nIf Trump is a scraping-from-the-bottom-of-the-barrel excuse of a human being — an ignorant, entitled, dishonest, braggadocious thug — Hogan, in character, policy and political appeal, is in every respect the reverse, in full measure an anti-Trump and more.\n\n\n\nTrump, of course, was born with a golden spoon in his mouth. For decades, he has used his inherited fortune to posture as a successful businessman, running serial scams (like Trump University) and bringing about serial bankruptcies (like the Trump Taj Mahal casino).\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nHow billionaires like Schultz and Bloomberg can help America: Don't run for president\n\nHoward Schultz: A third-party centrist candidate like me could win the presidency\n\nHow the Democrats could blow it in 2020\n\nBefore he won elective office in 2014, Hogan, 62, was also a businessman. Hogan Companies, however, is not a shell game but a genuinely successful real estate firm with $2 billion in transactions under its account, built from the ground up, without daddy's largesse. Hogan, though born into a political family, made his own way up.\n\n\n\nHogan did inherit one extremely valuable thing from his father. Lawrence Hogan Sr., a onetime FBI agent, represented Maryland in Congress. In 1974, he was the first Republican on the House Judiciary Committee to call for President Richard Nixon's impeachment. His readiness to put country before party is something his son regularly mentions in speeches.\n\nThe implication for Trump is left clear but unsaid. That episode taught a lesson in fidelity to principle, which goes a considerable distance in explaining why Hogan is one of the few Republican elected officials who has never endorsed let alone truckled to the weakling bully in the White House.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, when it comes to private life, the contrast between the two men is stark. Trump is a serial philanderer/sexual predator whose partners include multiple wives and a paid-off porn star. Hogan has been married only once, and he and his wife, Yumi Hogan — a first generation Korean-American — have never given the tabloids any occasion to visit their marriage.\n\nHogan style is civility and moderation\n\nMore centrally, Trump has both campaigned and governed by stoking racial and religious resentment, allowing him to gain and retain the fierce loyalty of a narrow base of disaffected voters. Hogan's philosophy is to govern with civility and moderation and so he has, regularly reaching across the aisle of the Annapolis statehouse to advance a bipartisan agenda.\n\n\n\nTrump is renowned for the art of the deal, but that is a marketing slogan cooked up by a ghost writer. It has never borne any relation to Trump's long career of shady business practices burnished only by boastfulness.\n\n\n\nHogan, for his part, speaks of the art of the possible. His political pragmatism is precisely what has made him a success. His signature initiatives don't grab headlines — like walling off Mexico or banning Muslims from entering the United States — but they are the unsexy work of good government: development of infrastructure, stewardship of the environment, innovation in K-12 education, access to affordable health care and fiscal responsibility.\n\n\n\nAs a national candidate, Hogan has his liabilities. In this age of celebrities, his is hardly a household name. His reasoned brand of charisma would not rouse crowds to chant demagogic slogans at rallies. His foreign policy experience is a blank that would need to be filled. His 2015 diagnosis of lymphoma, now pronounced in complete remission, will raise worries over his long-term health.\n\nTrump's troubles are mounting\n\nOf course, whether Hogan or any Republican could launch a successful primary challenge is in doubt as long as Trump's cult of personality does not crack and approval of the president among Republicans hovers in the 80s. Even so, the fluidity of American politics and Trump's mounting troubles raise the possibility of the SS Trump sinking abruptly to the bottom of the sea.\n\n\n\nShould that come about, and were Hogan to emerge against long odds as the Republican nominee, he would likely prove to be a formidable force in a general election, particularly if the Democrats lurched left.\n\n\n\nHogan regularly ranks as one of the most popular governors in the country, drawing support from Democratic and Republican voters alike, and earning approval numbers in the 70s. Running for re-election last November, Hogan beat Democrat Ben Jealous by 12 percentage points, a striking accomplishment in one of the country's bluest states.\n\n\n\nOf course, at this early stage, Hogan must be considered, as other potential Republican challengers, an exceedingly long shot. Nonetheless, anyone who wants to glean the future of American politics should prepare to hear more from this serious and determined man.\n\nGabriel Schoenfeld, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and the author of Necessary Secrets: National Security, the Media, and the Rule of Law, was a senior adviser to the 2012 Romney for President campaign.

WASHINGTON – Nearly 40% of judges President Donald Trump appointed to federal appeals courts have a history of hostility toward LGBTQ rights, according to a new report by the LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal.\n\nThe report presents a sobering image for civil rights advocates of Trump's lasting impact on the federal judiciary – one they say threatens to roll back progress made in advancing the rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nOur analysis was ... about calling out the danger to the rule of law, the danger to the integrity and credibility of the judiciary to be putting forth nominees who fundamentally start from a perspective of LGBTQ people as 'less than,' said Sharon McGowan, legal director for Lambda Legal.\n\nTrump will leave office having significantly altered the makeup of the federal judiciary, from lower courts to the Supreme Court – an accomplishment made possible by Senate Republicans and one that will create a major obstacle for President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nAfter four years as president, Trump has appointed three Supreme Court justices and 230 lower court judges to lifetime posts, many ny of whom are young, white and male jurists who will have decades to influence and shape federal law.\n\nA whiter judiciary:Trump's 87 picks to be federal judges are 92% white with just one black and one Hispanic nominee\n\nAccording to Lambda Legal's report, released Tuesday, the Trump administration has appointed 54 of the 177, about 30%, of actively serving federal appeals court judges.\n\nThis outpaced Trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. During the Obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. Previous administrations going back to President Ronald Reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.\n\nI think in many ways, Trump's impact on the judiciary will be his most significant and lasting legacy because it will have a life far beyond the four years of the Trump administration, McGowan said.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court hears only about 100 to 150 cases annually, the 13 federal appeals courts around the country hear thousands of the most consequential cases every year that shape laws and affect the rights of millions of Americans.\n\nTrump's legacy:Biden's influence on federal judiciary may be limited despite liberals' talk of 'court-packing'\n\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which has promoted and applauded Trump's nominees, previously said the nomination process under the Trump administration is not about meeting quotas.\n\n(Trump) is looking for people with a principled judicial philosophy, Severino said. The fundamental question is making sure we have judges who are going to be faithful to the Constitution.\n\nTrump judges:Trump's conservative judges begin takeover of federal appeals courts\n\nConversion therapy, misgendering and wedding vendor disputes\n\nThe report by Lambda Legal – which analyzed publicly available records on Trump's nominees, including statements and writings they've done as private individuals – singled out several appeals court judges who, the authors say, have already issued rulings hostile to LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn 2019, Judge James Ho, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion denying health care to a transgender woman who was seeking sex-reassignment surgery while in a Texas prison. Ho, who referred to the inmate using male pronouns, wrote that while it can be considered cruel and unusual punishment to deny essential medical care to a prisoner, there is much disagreement in the medical community about the necessity of sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nLater that year, Judge David Stras, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' First Amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. The judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.\n\nLast year, Judge Kyle Duncan, whom Trump also nominated to the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion rejecting a transgender federal prisoner's request to be referred to in court papers using female pronouns in accordance with the inmate's gender identity. Duncan wrote that doing so could raise delicate questions about judicial impartiality.\n\nAlso last year, two Trump-nominated judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit voted to strike down local laws protecting LGBTQ minors from conversion therapy, a practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have discredited the practice.\n\nBut in the opinion, Judge Britt Grant wrote that the ban on the controversial treatment infringes on therapists' First Amendment rights and that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. Judge Barbara Lagoa agreed with Grant, resulting in a split 2-1 decision.\n\nIn a candid speech in November to the conservative Federalist Society, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito lamented society's hostility against traditional views on marriage.\n\nYou can't say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, Alito said. Until very recently, that's what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now it's considered bigotry.\n\nThe speech was widely criticized by Democrats and advocates, including McGowan. Lambda Legal also opposed Alito's nomination to the high court in 2006.\n\nMcGowan said she expects similar cases and rulings to make their way through the federal court system.\n\nIn the past, she said, Lambda Legal has won cases before Republican-appointed judges, but the difference during the Trump administration is the appointment of judges whose records show deep hostility against LGBTQ rights.\n\nWe can and should be able to expect fair and impartial justice from judges regardless of whether they were appointed by Republicans or Democrats.

Next week, Kamala Harris will make history as the first woman, Black person and South Asian American person inaugurated vice president of the United States.\n\nHer climb from California attorney general to senator to vice president-elect has been well-documented in the news, as well as Harris' own books, including 2008's Smart on Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan to Make Us Safer and 2019's The Truths We Hold: An American Journey.\n\nKamala's Way: An American Life (Simon & Schuster, 257 pp.), out Tuesday, promises a revelatory look at how a daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants became one of this country's most effective power players, according to a press release.\n\nVogue:Kamala Harris' team says they were blindsided by controversial cover\n\nThe new biography was written by veteran California journalist Dan Morain, who covered Harris' career for decades at the Sacramento Bee and Los Angeles Times. He aims to show not only the confident former top cop known for her fierce takedown of Brett Kavanaugh at a 2018 Senate hearing but also the empathetic human fighting for racial justice, police reform and marriage equality.\n\nBecause Harris, 56, and her family declined interviews for the book amid President-elect Joe Biden's campaign, Kamala's Way isn't particularly revelatory, dryly detailing her early days in the Alameda County district attorney's office in California, as well as the political allies and adversaries she encountered during her rise. Although meticulously reported, it occasionally reads like a slapdash Wikipedia page rather than a compelling narrative.\n\nBut after the circus of the outgoing presidential administration, there is a level of comfort reading an exhaustive account of a lawmaker just putting in the work. It isn't a mere puff piece either, as Morain rightfully holds Harris accountable for her past support of capital punishment and mass incarceration policies.\n\nHere are some of the more illuminating stories that we learned from Kamala's Way about her life on and off the political stage:\n\nKamala Harris' VP win:'Powerful, emotional' moment for African American and South Asian American women\n\nHarris once comforted a young girl who was scared of gun violence\n\nCalling for smart gun safety laws, Harris would frequently bemoan the slaughter of babies, as she recalled seeing harrowing autopsy photographs of young people killed by guns, Morain writes. She took this approach while speaking at an event in downtown San Francisco in late 2016, only to stop mid-speech.\n\nErin, I am so sorry. I forgot, Harris said to Erin Lehane, a donor in the audience who had brought along her 7-year-old daughter, Rose.\n\nHarris, who had known Rose since she was a baby, promised to talk to the young girl after the event. She pulled two chairs together as the room cleared out, and asked Rose if her remarks frightened her.\n\nRose later told her mom that Harris told her not to worry, that there were so many people who would protect her – her mom, her teachers, the police, Morain writes.\n\nShe tried to be reassuring, Lehane says in the book. She asked if Rose had questions. She spent a huge chunk of time. There was no camera. There was no press. Nobody knew. She was very human in that moment and wanted Rose to feel safe.\n\nShe met her now-husband on a blind date\n\nHarris' husband, lawyer Doug Emhoff, will make history as the first second gentleman of the United States. The couple met on a blind date in 2013, set up by Harris' good friend Chrisette Hudlin, a public relations consultant.\n\nHudlin and her husband arranged a meeting with Emhoff about a knotty legal issue, which they ended by asking if he was single. She told Emhoff about Harris, then-California attorney general and her friend of 30 years.\n\nI said, 'Oh, my god, she's hot,'  Emhoff, 56, told Chasten Buttigieg in an interview last year that's recounted in the book.\n\nHudlin gave Emhoff Harris' number, and they met in Los Angeles that weekend. The two kept their courtship under the radar and were engaged in 2014. They were married that summer in a ceremony incorporating both Indian and Jewish traditions.\n\nThe couple share two children – Cole, 26, and Ella, 21 – from Emhoff's previous marriage. The kids affectionately call Harris Momala, which she proudly displays in her Twitter bio.\n\nHer late mom is a beacon in political career\n\nKamala's Way touches on Harris' close relationships with her family, particularly her sister Maya Harris, 53, a lawyer who was also a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign. She has long been Harris' closest confidante and political adviser.\n\nDuring campaigns, Kamala and Maya would talk several times a day, Morain writes. Often, a call with Maya was the first of the day and last at night. Their sense of humor is similar and the sound of their laugh is all but identical. They're brilliant, detail oriented, tough and competitive, sometimes even with each other in the ways big and little sisters can be.\n\nThe book also discusses Harris' private struggles as her mom, scientist Shyamala Gopalan, underwent chemotherapy for colon cancer in 2008. In a 2018 op-ed for the New York Times, Harris recalled how her mom continued to support her even while she was hospitalized, shortly before her death in February 2009 at age 70.\n\nI remember I had just entered the race for California attorney general and she asked me how it was going, Harris wrote.  'Mommy, these guys are going to kick my a**,' I told her.\n\nShe rolled over and looked at me and unveiled the biggest smile, Harris continued. She knew who she'd raised. She knew her fighting spirit was alive and well inside me.
David Schwimmer and Zoe Buckman taking a break\n\nDavid Schwimmer and wife Zoe Buckman are separating after six years of marriage.
Kaja Whitehouse\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK -- Yet another pharmaceutical mega-merger is on the books.\n\nMore than five months after making its initial bid, biopharmaceutical company Baxalta Incorporated (BXLT) agreed to buy Dublin, Ireland-based Shire (SHP) in a deal valued at $32 billion, the companies said Monday.\n\nThe companies reached a deal after overcoming concerns that a tie-up could create tax problems due to Baxalta's spin-off from parent company Baxter International last year. After conducting some due diligence, Shire concluded that the merger will maintain the tax-free status of the Baxalta spinoff from Baxter, the companies said.\n\nIt has been a record period for global mergers and acquisitions, led in good part by marriages among large pharmaceuticals and biotech companies.\n\nPfizer's $160 billion purchase of drug company Allergan, for example, marked the single largest deal of 2015, and helped to boosted total U.S.-based M&A to a record $4.28 trillion in 2015. That's 16.6% above the previous 2007 peak, and 29.9% above 2014, according to data from Mergermarket, which tracks deals.\n\nThe marriage of Baxalta and Shire will create a portfolio that reaches into more than 100 countries, and is expected to result in over $20 billion in annual revenue by 2020, the companies said.\n\nTogether, we will have leadership positions in multiple, high-value franchises and become the clear partner of choice in rare diseases, Shire CEO Flemming Ornskov said.\n\nUnder the agreement, Baxalta shareholders will receive $18 in cash and 0.1482 of Shire's U.S. listed stock for each Baxalta share, the companies said Monday. Based on Shire's closing price on January 8, 2016, the deal implies a value of $45.57 per Baxalta share, or a 37.5% increase to the value of Baxalta's shares as of August 3, 2015 — one day prior to Shire's initial public offer for Baxalta.\n\nThe transaction will give shareholders of Bannockburn, Ill.-based Baxalta roughly 34% ownership in the combined company. The deal is expected to close in mid-2016.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kaja Whitehouse on Twitter @kajawhitehouse
Holly Meyer and Jordan Buie\n\nThe Tennessean\n\nNASHVILLE — Tennessee Freemasons overwhelmingly voted Thursday to uphold a ban on gay members, according to Freemasons who witnessed the vote at a members-only meeting here.\n\nTwo Freemasons confirmed the results to The Tennessean but asked for anonymity because business conducted at the meetings is secret, and revealing information discussed at a meeting could result in them being kicked out of the organization. The vote took place at the Grand Lodge of Tennessee in downtown Nashville.\n\nSpokesmen for the Grand Lodge of Tennessee Free & Accepted Masons did not return a request for comment. The organization has about 41,000 members in Tennessee and more than 300 lodges across the state, according to the Grand Lodge's website.\n\nWhile the organization is secretive, bans on allowing gay men to participate in Tennessee and Georgia have prompted public discussion locally and globally, Christopher Hodapp, the author of Freemasons for Dummies, said in a Thursday blog post.\n\nChurch asks Boy Scouts to leave over gay rights\n\nGrand Masters nationally and internationally have weighed in on the debate, and California and District of Columbia, grand lodges have suspended Masonic relations with Georgia and Tennessee because of it.\n\nIn the fall, the Grand Lodge of Tennessee suspended two Memphis Freemasons, Dennis Clark and Mark Henderson, who had married in June after the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage, according to Hodapp's blog. A handful of Nashville Freemasons have withdrawn from Tennessee chapters to speak out for the two men.\n\nI'm not gay myself, but I have friends who are, Chase Geiser of Nashville said Monday. I don't think this is right, and it is something that will prevent younger members from joining the organization that has seen decreasing numbers since World War II.\n\nGeiser, a 25-year-old Freemason who joined the order in 2011 and became a full member in 2012, said the grand lodges of Georgia and Tennessee have drawn particular criticism for their bylaws banning homosexual members.\n\nIn the Freemasons, Geiser said, each state's grand lodge has its own constitutions and bylaws, separate from others nationally and internationally. In the United States, most Masonic lodges are male only but have sister organizations such as the Order of the Eastern Star.\n\nSuspension of the two Memphis Freemasons has cast light on a broader cultural issue within the Freemasons, Geiser said.\n\nThe organization saw a spike in membership following World War II, and then a large falloff in the baby boomer generation. Now, he said many young men are looking to align themselves with socially conscious fraternal organizations.\n\nSome are looking to find a home among Freemasons, and what Geiser called the old guard and the new members have differences of opinion.\n\nNigeria bans gay marriage, gay meetings\n\nThere's this cultural and ideological divide, he said. Now, we are at 25% of the membership just after World War II. The average mason in Tennessee is a 69-year-old man.\n\nThe older masons have very conservative Christian values, he said. The younger masons are theistic. We believe in a creator, but we don't have a problem with homosexual marriage.\n\nFollow Holly Meyer and Jordan Buie on Twitter: @HollyAMeyer and @JordanBuie
WASHINGTON — Eager to please the young leader of a promising potential ally in the Middle East, the CIA enlisted the help of billionaire Howard Hughes's longtime fixer to find women for Jordan's King Hussein, according to documents recently made public.\n\nThat help for Hussein during his spring 1959 trip to the United States, newly released documents from the investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy show, likely turned into a relationship between Hussein and B-movie actress Susan Cabot that may have produced the son who eventually beat Cabot to death in 1986.\n\nA CIA memo released Dec. 15 shows how the agency used private investigator Robert Maheu, a former FBI agent, to find female companionship for the 23-year-old King during his trip to Los Angeles in April 1959.\n\nThe document refers only to a foreign head of state but the timeline included in the memo corresponds to the times Hussein was in the United States. A March 28, 1959, New York Times story laid out Hussein's itinerary and plans to increase U.S. aid to his nation.\n\nThe foreign official was especially desirous of female companionship during his Los Angeles visit and it was requested that appropriate arrangements be made through a controlled source of the [CIA's] Office [of Security] in order to assure a satisfied visit, said the anonymously written memo.\n\nThe agency turned to Maheu, a private investigator in Los Angeles, to line up the dates, the CIA memo said. Maheu then contacted a prominent Los Angeles attorney and Hollywood figure whose name was redacted in the report.\n\nAn April 9, 1959, story in the Los Angeles Times said Cabot and Hussein met a party at the house of California oilman Edwin Pauley, a longtime Democratic Party donor for whom UCLA's basketball arena, Pauley Pavilion, is named.\n\nOn to New York\n\nCabot and Hussein got along so well during the Los Angeles portion of his trip that he wished to meet with her during his stay in New York City from 14 through 18 April 1969, the CIA memo said.\n\nThe agency, the memo said, rented a house in Long Beach, Long Island, N.Y., for the time Hussein was in New York, while Cabot was registered at the Hotel Barclay in New York under an assumed name.\n\nHussein's budding relationship with Cabot was well known at the time, and numerous news reports mentioned that the Jewish heritage of Cabot, born Harriet Shapiro, might cause a problem for the Muslim king.\n\nDuring the stay at the Long Beach site, [Cabot] discussed the publicity in the case at some length with the Security representatives, the CIA memo said. She speculated about the possible sources of certain personal information that she felt had been leaked to the press.\n\nCabot's film career started in 1947 with an uncredited appearance in the film noir Kiss of Death and continued throughout the 1950s with roles in low-budget science fiction films such as War of the Satellites and The Wasp Woman.\n\nJordan's mission\n\nIn 1959, Hussein had been Jordan's king for almost six years. He assumed the throne of the Hashemite kingdom in 1953 after his father, Talal, was forced to abdicate because of illness. At 17, Hussein had witnessed the assassination of his grandfather, King Abdullah I, in Jerusalem.\n\nOnce a British colony, Jordan lost British military and economic aid in 1957 when the United Kingdom cut off its annual subsidy. Hussein came to United States in 1959 to ensure the continued flow of U.S. aid to his country.\n\nThe United States officials were impressed by the King's personality, the New York Times reported on March 28, 1959. They discussed the possibility that in time he might develop into an Arab leader comparable to his grandfather.\n\nHussein led Jordan until February 1999, when he died from cancer. He was married four times, and his son from his second marriage, Abdullah, succeeded him as king.\n\nA brutal murder\n\nCabot was beaten to death in Los Angeles home on Dec. 10, 1986, and her son, Timothy Scott Roman, was charged with her murder.\n\nDuring Roman's 1989 trial, his defense attorney Chester Leo Smith introduced evidence that showed the Cabot received a regular sum of $1,500 a month from the Keeper of the King's Purse, Amman, Jordan. There is written indication in the handwriting of Susan Roman this money is from a trust. ... For better or worse, it looks like child support, Smith wrote.\n\nThe Jordanian government, the Los Angeles Times reported on April 13, 1989, had no comment on Smith's claims about Roman's paternity.\n\nRoman, the Times reported on Oct. 11, 1989, was born a dwarf but had grown to the height of 5 feet, 4 inches through thrice-weekly injections of a hormone derived from the pituitary glands of cadavers. A former attorney once called him a 'failed human experiment.'\n\nHe was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, not premeditated murder, for bludgeoning his mother to death with a barbell.\n\nThe Hughes-Mafia-Castro connection\n\nHussein had nothing to do with the Nov. 22, 1963, Kennedy assassination, but various government agencies had investigated the theory that Cuban dictator Fidel Castro or the Mafia were involved in Kennedy's killing. That's because Kennedy, along with his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, were actively trying to assassinate Castro in the early 1960s.\n\nOne assassination plan involved the CIA's use of Maheu to recruit someone 'tough enough' to handle the job, reported the Senate's Church Committee in 1976. A former FBI associate of Maheu's was employed in the CIA's Office of Security and had arranged for the CIA to use Maheu in several sensitive covert operations in which 'he didn't want to have an Agency person or a government person get caught,' the Church report said.\n\nMaheu contacted Johnny Rosselli, a Mafioso with connections in Las Vegas, to handle the job along with Sam Giancana, a Chicago-based Mafia leader also active in Las Vegas. While Rosselli was reluctant to handle the job, he and Maheu eventually met with a CIA official at New York's Plaza Hotel in September 1960 to handle the details.\n\nMaheu was also reluctant to pursue the plot, because he feared it would conflict with his new client, the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, who also had major business interests in Las Vegas. He finally agreed to participate because he felt that he owed the Agency a commitment, the Church report said.\n\nAn investigation by a House committee in 1976 mentioned Maheu's procurement of women for Hussein, but it did not mention any specific women.\n\nThe JFK files\n\nThe CIA's Maheu memo was part of an unveiling of more than 35,500 documents related to the JFK investigation that were required to be released under the provisions of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. Many had nothing to do with the actual assassination but with people, agencies and countries implicated in the various investigations of the killing and related conspiracy theories.\n\nPresident Trump said he would release all of the documents without redactions, but FBI and CIA officials prevailed upon him to keep some still secret or to release others with key details blacked out.\n\nAny information that is still redacted is subject to Trump's review and could be released in full in the coming months, the National Archives said.\n\nMore:JFK files: Soviet defector told how KGB compromised Americans living in Soviet Union\n\nMore:JFK files: House Assassinations Committee was suspicious of defector's claims about KGB and Oswald\n\nMore:JFK files: Controversy surrounding CIA counterspy chief fed assassination conspiracies\n\nContributing: Alia Dastagir
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThis is what the truth feels like\n\nRemember the 2015 summer of divorce? Ben and Jen, Gwen and Gavin, Miss Piggy and Kermit. It was horrible. Apparently now it's the winter of reveals. Gwen Stefani talked to The New York Times in a story Thursday about the morning she found out her marriage to Gavin Rossdale was over. The gist: After the Grammys she went to eat Mexican with Adam Levine. The next day she woke up to her life being blown up by a story so juicy and shocking that she can't tell you about it but felt like she was going to die. In a made-for-Hollywood twist, Stefani is now dating Blake Shelton, who split with wife Miranda Lambert that same tragic summer. Her reveal follows Jennifer Garner's public comments a couple of weeks ago about her breakup with husband Ben Affleck. We had been separated for months before I ever heard about the nanny, the actress told Vanity Fair. As for Kermit and Miss Piggy, he said this month he's still in love with her. All is not lost.\n\nAnother reason to eat Taco Bell before work\n\nThe dollar menu isn't dead yet. McDonald's may have phased it out, but for those who like to Live Más in the morning, Taco Bell unveiled a $1 breakfast menu Thursday. It's offering 10 breakfast items for a buck each, including new additions like a mini skillet bowl with potatoes and scrambled eggs and a sausage flatbread quesadilla.

Pope Francis is on it.\n\nDid you know that Pope Francis is expected next week to announce the date for the canonization of Mother Teresa? And did you know the process for making someone a saint is super expensive? Documents leaked four months ago revealed abuses and high costs, which can average $550,000. The Vatican responded Thursday with new rules for the whole process. The measures, approved by Francis, focus on how the Holy See handles applications for sainthood, a lengthy process that involves examining claims made by supporters of a would-be saint.

Miranda Lambert is thankful that nobody was hurt after she and husband Brendan McLoughlin were involved in a hit-and-run accident in Georgia.\n\nThe BlueBird singer, 37, said on Instagram Thursday the couple cut their road trip short and made it safely back to Nashville after they were side swiped near Atlanta.\n\nAn (expletive) in a small car with temp plates was driving erratically and tried to squeeze between us and (a) semi truck going 70, the country music star wrote, sharing a video of the damage. It hit the airstream (trailer) on the passenger side and sent us into the left lane. We fishtailed pretty good but got on the shoulder as quickly as possible to assess the damage.\n\nLambert continued: Nobody was hurt thank the good Lord…We are so thankful that nothing worse happened.\n\nMiranda Lambert,Ingrid Andress lead country nominations for Grammy Awards 2021\n\nAlthough the erratic driver sped away without stopping, Lambert said their vehicle and trailer were driveable, thanks to her husband's quick actions.\n\n@brendanjmcloughlin kept our trailer pretty steady for being side swiped, she applauded her husband, who she quietly married in January 2019.\n\nLambert also thanked her mother: I called mama right away to say that I know her prayers are always heard cause I know she prays for us every morning about 4:30 am.

Bob McManaman\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nAVONDALE, Ariz. -- Aside from recovering from a particularly nasty concussion and learning more about his craft from outside a race car, something else happened to Dale Earnhardt Jr. during his time away from work.\n\nNASCAR's Peter Pan decided it finally was time to grow up.\n\nI'm 42 years old, Earnhardt told azcentral sports Tuesday. I can't be a kid forever.\n\nEarnhardt, who was cleared by doctors to get back in the car after a stint at Darlington Raceway in December, was speaking between testing runs at Phoenix International Raceway in his No. 88 Chevrolet. He said it was his marriage to longtime girlfriend Amy Reimann on New Year's Eve that made him see the light.\n\nActually, Amy made him see it. She's changed his life, he said.\n\nShe just helped me mature as a person, Earnhardt said. She showed me a lot of things that were important. She helped me sort some priorities out in my life and get some things in a row.\n\nI've still got a lot to learn, a lot of growing to do, but she's a big part of that. She's helped me accelerate my maturity and I really needed it. I had a lot of things that I needed to get to doing better.\n\nEarnhardt didn't wish to elaborate other than to say, Nobody's perfect.\n\nMORE NASCAR COVERAGE:\n\nPIR unveils $178 million facelift\n\nJeff Gordon: Alex Bowman should be first call if Hendrick needs a sub\n\nThere's still plenty of youthfulness in the jovial Junior, who is getting ready to embark on his 19th NASCAR Cup season after sitting out half of the 2016 campaign while suffering from issues related to his concussion.\n\nHe keeps adding, for instance, new attractions to his 200-acre spread in Mooresville, N.C., which already includes an entire western town, a dirt go-kart track, a 66,000-square-foot race shop, a freshly built luxury treehouse and a massive race car graveyard.\n\nBut as his driving career winds down, there's no mistaking that Earnhardt is making it his business to be more dutiful to the business. That's why he isn't whining during his two days of testing here, something he's disliked to do anywhere. It's also why he didn't overreact to the small brake fire in his car Tuesday morning.\n\nAfter being forced to sit out for the longest time during a Cup career that began in 1999, Earnhardt absolutely was giddy to get behind the wheel for his first real action on a track. Oh sure, he took a few laps at Darlington Raceway to meet doctors' approval, but this was different. You could tell by the country-wide smile on his red-bearded face.\n\nIt's great to be able to get on the track some, run some laps before the season starts, get to work with my guys again and kind of get in the groove, he said. It's been a real good day so far and I'm looking forward to the season getting going. We've only got a few more weeks before we get after it big time (at Daytona).\n\nHe plans to return at Daytona International Speedway in the Daytona 500 on Feb. 26 (Fox, 2 p.m. ET) for his first points-paying Cup race since early July.\n\nAsked if it was an emotional moment or just another day at the track, Earnhardt said, No, not really. Actually, I was just super happy, probably more so than usual. The guys were pumped. The day's been going well, we're learning some stuff and we've had good speed. … The car feels good and I felt great in the car.\n\nDealing with ongoing concussion symptoms didn't feel great at all. It's been a long road back, Earnhardt said, and he used the time between the fog and the headaches to consider his future. And not just retirement.\n\nYeah, you contemplate everything, Earnhardt said. You've got to do what's right for your health and your body and make the best decision you can for yourself. It affects a lot more people than just you, though. You've got to make the right decision that's going to be right for the long haul.\n\nOne thing that helped was attending an October race at Dover, Del., where he watched from the pit box as four-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon, who had retired from racing in 2015, filled in behind the wheel. Alex Bowman split time with Gordon as Earnhardt's replacement drivers. Watching that particular race in Dover, however, was an out-of-body experience to Earnhardt.\n\nIt just really gave me a unique perspective on just being a fan and being a pair of eyes in the garage, getting out of the suit and seeing it from that vantage point and watching everybody operate, he said. It was just really impressive. You can't see that when you're actually in there doing it, when you're in the middle of it. You just can't really see how everything is moving all along, so I enjoyed it. It was fun.\n\nMORE NASCAR COVERAGE:\n\nJames: Dale Earnhardt Jr. relishes chance to return on his terms\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr. envies Jimmie Johnson's beard game\n\nEarnhardt said he'll know when it's time to retire when racing is no longer fun, when it takes too much effort to keep up with the schedule and be away from home for so long.\n\nI guess you show up and don't enjoy it one day, I don't know, he said. There's been a lot of races where we didn't end up where we wanted to and weren't that fun because of circumstances. But you're never just generally in the car not having fun, not enjoying it. Once that starts happening, I think you've got to think about doing something else.\n\nThere's always that humongous, fun treehouse in Mooresville if the former Peter Pan of NASCAR wants to be a kid again for a spell. That, or he can just drive through the woods and take a gander at his collection of wrecked race cars – those belonging to him and others from the racing world.\n\nWhich place does he like the best?\n\nThe old race car junkyard is a lot of fun. It never gets old riding around looking at some of that stuff, Earnhardt said. You always see something new. There's probably 60 to 80 out there in the woods on about 70 acres. The treehouse is great, though. It's hard to beat that treehouse. I spent the night before my wedding up there by myself.\n\nPerfect place to be the day before a kid becomes a man.\n\nMcManaman writes for the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nFollow him on Twitter @azbobbymac\n\nPHOTOS: DALE EARNHARDT JR.

Are you supposed to get something for someone you just met last week? Or ignore them on February 14? Is now the time to define the relationship with someone you've been talking to for the past six months (asking for a friend)? I need answers!!\n\nRegardless of where you stand (officially), you're probably wondering: what do you get your SO (or hopefully soon-to-be-SO) for Valentine's Day?\n\nBefore you even think about getting something, check in with your romantic partner about your gifting plan to avoid any awkwardness. At the very least, set a budget so you don't end up over (or under) spending. You could always skip the presents altogether and opt for a nice night in for Valentine's Day.\n\nBelow, you'll find the best gifts to give for every budget, whether you've been together for four years or four weeks (seriously, Josh, what are we?). You're welcome.\n\nValentine's Day gifts under $10\n\nSo you've been dating for a few weeks or just defined the relationship. Congrats! You're full speed ahead on the love train.

Robert Bianco\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSo many paths, so little time.\n\nWhatever you may think of the quality of TV shows these days, there's no debating their abundance: Week after week, hour after hour, on outlet after outlet, new series arrive. Lines must be drawn, which means that despite a trio of top stars — Aaron Paul, Hugh Dancy and Michelle Monaghan — and an admirably unusual premise, Hulu's The Path (Wednesday, ** ½ out of four) simply may not be one you want to follow.\n\nThe Path, created by Jessica Goldberg, explores the communal lives and faith of the followers of Meyerism — a made-up religion that seems to be a combination of Scientology, EST and New Age veganism. Living together on a compound, these Meyerists are both intensely private and intensely committed, shunning publicity as they follow the Ladder toward the Light.\n\nBut change is in the wind. The religion's founding father is in Peru and out of touch, leaving day-to-day operations in the hands of Cal (Dancy), who thinks Meyerism needs to stop hiding its Light under a bushel.\n\nThat switch does not sit well with Sarah (Monaghan), but she has more immediate problems. Her husband, Eddie (Paul), has returned from Peru troubled and distant — the result, she thinks, of a sexual affair. The truth, which Eddie keeps to himself, is that something has rocked his faith.\n\nAaron Paul loses his religion in Hulu's 'The Path'\n\nHulu forges 'Path' to a cult phenomenon\n\nThere are interesting questions here, including how we decide what we're willing to embrace (or at least accord grudging respect) as a religion and what we dismiss as a cult. And respect is the watchword here: While we're clearly meant to see worrisome aspects in Meyerism — led by the use of force to retain straying members — it's just as clear that we're not meant to mock its followers. There are, after all, worse sins in life than being painfully earnest.\n\nIn TV, however, there are few worse sins than being uninvolving — and despite the best efforts of a strong cast, that's where The Path lands. Lives and happiness are at stake here, yet the dramatic stakes somehow linger between low and medium. Monaghan's Sarah is a blind zealot; Paul's Eddie is a liar who allows his wife to suffer under the belief that he has been unfaithful rather then admit he's questioning his faith. No matter how much these two lovely people love each other, this is not a marriage we're left crying out to see saved.\n\nWorse yet for the show's dramatic purposes, the belief system they're battling over is so indistinct that it barely exists. The cult emerges as a hazy, marijuana-drenched mix of dated clichés, kept vague, perhaps, to avoid offense to any particular group. We're meant to be moved by the power of faith rather than faith itself, but that's a fine line for a series that gives us too little of substance or interest to hang on to otherwise.\n\nOn the plus side, Hulu is giving you only two hour-long episodes Wednesday, with the other eight to follow on a weekly basis. That limited commitment leaves you a week to decide whether you want to return.\n\nI wouldn't, but hey: Your time; your path.
SALINA, Kan. – Albert Bert and Carol Stevenson met later in life, after previous marriages that happened years before, at a Kansas restaurant in 2009. The couple loved to camp and go on their pontoon across the lake.\n\nThey said they were just going to date, then my dad ended up moving into the house with her, said Bert's daughter Sharolyn Hoffman, of Salina, Kansas.\n\nThey said they were too old to get married, and one day they called me and told me they were getting married. I thought they were joking, Hoffman said. Turns out they were not.\n\nThe couple both tested positive for the coronavirus at the end of December and started out the new year battling the virus.\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of several ups and downs, they died less than two hours apart while holding each other's hands in bed at the Salina Regional Health Center.\n\nBefore marriage\n\nBert, who had two marriages before finding Carol, met her when he was starting to accept that his Alzheimer's disease was going to have a major effect on his life.\n\nBert was a recovered alcoholic for 39 years, who helped with AA meetings in Salina and was a mentor to a lot of people, said Nicke Stevenson, Bert's daughter-in-law. When you asked him how he was doing, he would say 'Better than I deserve' every time.\n\nCarol also had two previous marriages. She has two daughters, both of whom live in the Seattle area.\n\nMy mother was living in the moment, very strong, super sweet, probably the nicest person I ever met, said Pennie Pickering. She outlived her first two husbands, and was a caretaker for both husbands. She really had a reputation of being a caretaker. She always had children in her life. She has always been a mother or grandmother and is the favorite aunt to a lot family.\n\nTogether, the couple has more than a dozen grandchildren, and Carol has several great-grandchildren.\n\nWhen they were first dating, I was visiting my mother for a couple of weeks, said Carol's daughter Jody Lentz. She was telling me that Bert was really nervous to meet me and I told her that was kind of funny as I was a little nervous to meet him for the first time.\n\nThe wedding day\n\nThe couple married on June 30, 2012, on a warm summer day at Carol's homestead near Kanopolis Lake in Kansas. Carol was 72, while Bert was 69.\n\nBert, who sings exactly like Elvis Presley, sang Elvis' Hawaiian Wedding Song, which was in the film Blue Hawaii.\n\nBert always loved to sing Elvis songs, he was good at it, Hoffman said. We had a big shindig for them. Carol's family came from Washington, it was hotter than donut glaze, but it was a great time.\n\nShelli Redden, Bert's daughter, remembers the love and compassion they had for one another.\n\nHe (Bert) would have never let us kids take care of him, especially when he got further into having his Alzheimer's, she said. Carol saved his life, because he allowed her into his life and let her take care of him. He was able to do things that he would not have been able to do if he did not have his partner with him. She loved him unconditionally, she knew what she was getting into.\n\nRedden said family members asked her several times if she wanted to marry Bert, not because we did not want her to marry him, but because she was marrying a man who was struggling with this disease and we knew it was going to be hard.\n\nFamily members knew his Alzheimer's was not going to get any better, but Carol went into it with her eyes wide open, Redden said.\n\nWhen you were around them, you knew they were in love. The smiles on their faces, the way they treated each other and took care of each other, Redden said. Carol really brought all of us back together.\n\nVoices:We were cautious. And yet, somehow, my entire household got COVID-19.\n\nTraveling to see family and dancing to Elvis\n\nA favorite pastime of Bert and Carol's was to travel and see family, so much so they bought a motorhome to help accommodate their travel. Most of the time, their designations were not tourist attractions, but where they had family they could visit.\n\nWe have family in seven states and all over the country. Their fun pastime was going out with family. She (was) constantly doing things with family, they were going to events. They traveled out here to come see us, said Pickering.\n\nIt did not matter which restaurant or what environment they were in. If Elvis was playing, they would always get up and dance. Sometimes they would be the only ones dancing, but they were fun to watch, said Lentz.\n\nHow they got COVID-19\n\nThe couple went to a family Christmas Eve gathering, and on Dec. 26th they were diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\nMy mother knew of the risk, but she could not help herself. She had to give presents, Pickering said. Christmas is a big deal for her to see family. They were literally 30 days from being vaccinated and they had made it since early March of quarantining. ... They were in the high age-risk group, with a few prior medical issues.\n\nPickering said Carol was warned by several family members that it was not a good idea to go to a family gathering for the holidays, but she went.\n\nTheir fight together\n\nAfter testing positive for the virus, the couple both had their good days and their bad days in fighting the virus.\n\nCarol's blood pressure started going up, said Bert's daughter-in-law, Nicke Stevenson. Both of them went to the ER together and both of them got released from the hospital. New Year's Eve, we thought they were doing pretty good.\n\nDoug and Nicke Stevenson gave them as much care as they possibly could.\n\nIt was a rollercoaster ride for the past two weeks. They went to the hospital three times. The staff at the Salina Regional Health Center did a phenomenal job. There were three or four individuals working there that I cannot thank enough. We had a lot of ups and downs, Doug Stevenson said.\n\nBert was sedated for three days with COVID-19. The virus made his Alzheimer's worse.\n\nDad with the Alzheimer's did not know who we were. He had lost his awareness of who we were, but I think he knew we belonged to him, said Redden.\n\nThere were over 100 people in our text chain when they were sick, said Pickering.\n\nAfter fighting for a week and a half, the couple died within two hours of each other while holding hands at the hospital – on Elvis Presley's birthday, Jan. 8.\n\nI talked to her the night before, they talked about putting her on a ventilator. They both loved Elvis Presley. It is sad, but the way they went was really good, said Jan Lytle, a niece-in-law to Bert.\n\nRedden decided to play music on her phone in the last few hours with the couple.\n\nThey wanted to go out of the world together and they were able to. It was devastating, but at least they were together, she said.\n\nCarol died when the song Stand By Me by Ben E. King played, less than two hours before Bert.\n\nWe were all in the same room as they were holding hands. Dad passed away to a song of Elvis, 'My Way,' which was another poignant moment for us. Even though we were not ready for them to go, they both went out on their own songs and on their own way, said Redden.\n\nThere were lots of tears, nurses were crying with us. The nurses were amazing, they helped us every step of the way.\n\nThe family is planning on having a celebration for Bert and Carol on the Fourth of July weekend.\n\nWe have family in seven states and all over the country, Pickering said.\n\nMy dad always said he did not want a funeral, he wanted a party, said Redden. They both loved to sing and dance. We cannot do it now; we hope by July things will be safe and we can gather together with family and friends.\n\nFollow the Salina Journal on Twitter: @salinajournal\n\nCoronavirus Watch newsletter:Sign up for daily updates right in your inbox\n\nShould you wear a mask after getting a COVID-19 vaccine?:5 reasons why the answer is 'Yes.'
For the Record\n\nTwo Republicans, somewhat alike in dignity, in fair Washington, where we lay our scene. A pair of star-cross'd politicians met in real life, who hope to with their meeting bury their party's strife.\n\nDonald Trump and Paul Ryan met Thursday. It was dramatic. Shakespearan, even. And like two of the Bard's characters of yore, Trump and Ryan pledged their undying devotion (to work together for Republicans this fall).\n\nHere are all the theatrics in today's For the Record, the politics newsletter from USA TODAY.\n\nTrump and Ryan are now seeing each other; Ryan does not DTR\n\nAs we previewed yesterday, Trump and Ryan swiped right (though not too far right) and met up to see see if they had any connection.\n\nAt stake: The unity of the Republican party, perhaps, should Trump become president and Ryan remain House speaker. The result: It's complicated.\n\nWe're off to a very good start, said Ryan, who added that he and Trump plan on seeing each other again. But Ryan still hasn't formally endorsed Trump, making this whole thing feel more like an arranged marriage.\n\nOver the course of 45 minutes, Trump and Ryan chatted about free trade, immigration, party unity and probably their hobbies. Reince Priebus, dad of the GOP, chaperoned the whole thing (ugh, so embarrassing) but the Republican national chairman issued his approval:\n\nThe meeting was great, Priebus tweeted. #ProudDad\n\nThis is the real life. It's not just fantasy.\n\nWe've watched the nation move through the five stages of grief since Trump closed in on the GOP, from denial to anger and bargaining to depression. Now, one step remains: acceptance.\n\nCue Lindsey Graham, the GOP senator who once likened a Trump nomination to being shot or poisoned.\n\nGraham spoke with Trump Wednesday, he said, calling the conversation cordial and pleasant. And while Graham congratulated Trump on becoming the face of the GOP, Graham still says he won't vote for him.\n\nAlso not endorsing Trump: George H.W. Bush. But Bush's former V.P.? Sure, why not.\n\nDan Quayle praised Trump on the Today show Thursday, claiming he is more qualified to be president than Hillary Clinton because voters' main qualification is that a candidate not be qualified to be president. Makes sense, actually.\n\nBernie Sanders' plan for New Jersey: Get a 28-year-old to run for sheriff\n\nWith only a narrow path to the nomination (by his words, not ours), Bernie Sanders is still hustling in early states and picking up some primary wins. His real goal: to beef up his delegate count, giving him more sway to shape his party's platform at the Democratic convention this summer.\n\nHe looks now to the June 7 primary in New Jersey, a state whose wacky ballot system requires Sanders to get a 28-year-old guy named Alex to run for sheriff. Alex doesn't want to be a sheriff. Alex doesn't think he'll be a sheriff. But such is this convoluted process we call democracy.\n\nMore from the campaign trail\n\nGet ready for (one, maybe two?) decades of constant Ted Cruz burns\n\nMemo to Ted Cruz: You may be out of the 2016 race. You may be back to running for Senate. But you'll never be free from the scorn of John Boehner. He's retired, has plenty of free time, and seems committed to publicly insulting you at every opportunity for the rest of his days.
Lisa Bitel\n\nPRI.org\n\nValentine's Day originated as a liturgical feast to celebrate the decapitation of a third-century Christian martyr, or perhaps two. So, how did we get from beheading to betrothing on Valentine's Day?\n\nEarly origins of St. Valentine\n\nAncient sources reveal that there were several St. Valentines who died on Feb. 14. Two of them were executed during the reign of Roman Emperor Claudius Gothicus in 269-270 A.D., at a time when persecution of Christians was common.\n\nHow do we know this? Because an order of Belgian monks spent three centuries collecting evidence for the lives of saints from manuscript archives around the known world.\n\nThey were called Bollandists after Jean Bolland, a Jesuit scholar who began publishing the massive 68-folio volumes of Acta Sanctorum, or Lives of the Saints, beginning in 1643.\n\nSince then, successive generations of monks continued the work until the last volume was published in 1940. The Brothers dug up every scrap of information about every saint on the liturgical calendar and printed the texts arranged according to the saint's feast day.\n\nThe Valentine martyrs\n\nThe volume encompassing Feb. 14 contains the stories of a handful of Valentini, including the earliest three of whom died in the third century.\n\nThe earliest Valentinus is said to have died in Africa, along with 24 soldiers. Unfortunately, even the Bollandists could not find any more information about him. As the monks knew, sometimes all that the saints left behind was a name and day of death.\n\nWe know only a little more about the other two Valentines.\n\nAccording to a late medieval legend reprinted in the Acta, which was accompanied by Bollandist critique about its historical value, a Roman priest named Valentinus was arrested during the reign of Emperor Gothicus and put into the custody of an aristocrat named Asterius.\n\nAs the story goes, Asterius made the mistake of letting the preacher talk. Father Valentinus went on and on about Christ leading pagansout of the shadow of darkness and into the light of truth and salvation. Asterius made a bargain with Valentinus: If the Christian could cure Asterius's foster-daughter of blindness, he would convert. Valentinus put his hands over the girl's eyes and chanted:\n\nLord Jesus Christ, en-lighten your handmaid, because you are God, the True Light.\n\nEasy as that. The child could see, according to the medieval legend. Asterius and his whole family were baptized. Unfortunately, when Emperor Gothicus heard the news, he ordered them all to be executed. But Valentinus was the only one to be beheaded. A pious widow, though, made off with his body and had it buried at the site of his martyrdom on the Via Flaminia, the ancient highway stretching from Rome to present-day Rimini. Later, a chapel was built over the saint's remains.\n\nSt. Valentine was not a romantic\n\nThe third third-century Valentinus was a bishop of Terni in the province of Umbria, Italy.\n\nAccording to his equally dodgy legend, Terni's bishop got into a situation like the other Valentinus by debating a potential convert and afterward healing his son. The rest of story is quite similar as well: He too was beheaded on the orders of Emperor Gothicus and his body buried along the Via Flaminia.\n\nIt is likely, as the Bollandists suggested, that there weren't actually two decapitated Valentines, but that two different versions of one saint's legend appeared in both Rome and Terni.\n\nNonetheless, African, Roman or Umbrian, none of the Valentines seems to have been a romantic.\n\nIndeed, medieval legends, repeated in modern media, had St. Valentine performing Christian marriage rituals or passing notes between Christian lovers jailed by Gothicus. Still other stories romantically involved him with the blind girl whom he allegedly healed. Yet none of these medieval tales had any basis in third-century history, as the Bollandists pointed out.\n\nIn any case, historical veracity did not count for much with medieval Christians. What they cared about were stories of miracles and martyrdoms and the physical remains or relics of the saint. To be sure, many different churches and monasteries around medieval Europe claimed to have bits of a St. Valentinus' skull in their treasuries.\n\nSanta Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, for example, still displays a whole skull. According to the Bollandists, other churches across Europe also claim to own slivers and bits of one or the other St. Valentinus' body: For example, San Anton Church in Madrid, Whitefriar Street Church in Dublin, the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Prague, Saint Mary's Assumption in Chelmno, Poland, as well as churches in Malta, Birmingham, Glasgow, and on the Greek isle of Lesbos, among others.\n\nFor believers, relics of the martyrs signified the saints' continuing their invisible presence among communities of pious Christians. In 11th-century Brittany, for instance, one bishop used what was purported to be Valentine's head to halt fires, prevent epidemics and cure all sorts of illnesses, including demonic possession.\n\nAs far as we know, though, the saint's bones did nothing special for lovers.\n\nUnlikely pagan origins\n\nMany scholars have deconstructed Valentine and his day in books, articles and blog postings. Some suggest that the modern holiday is a Christian cover-up of the more ancient Roman celebration of Lupercalia in mid-February.\n\nLupercalia originated as a ritual in a rural masculine cult involving the sacrifice of goats and dogs and evolved later into an urban carnival. During the festivities half-naked young men ran through the streets of Rome, streaking people with thongs cut from the skins of newly killed goats. Pregnant women thought it brought them healthy babies. In 496 A.D., however, Pope Gelasius supposedly denounced the rowdy festival.\n\nStill, there is no evidence that the pope purposely replaced Lupercalia with the more sedate cult of the martyred St. Valentine or any other Christian celebration.\n\nChaucer and the love birds\n\nThe love connection probably appeared more than a thousand years after the martyrs' death, when Geoffrey Chaucer, author of The Canterbury Tales decreed the February feast of St. Valentinus to the mating of birds. He wrote in his Parlement of Foules:\n\nFor this was on seynt Volantynys day. Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make.\n\nIt seems that, in Chaucer's day, English birds paired off to produce eggs in February. Soon, nature-minded European nobility began sending love notes during bird-mating season. For example, the French Duke of Orléans, who spent some years as a prisoner in the Tower of London, wrote to his wife in February 1415 that he was already sick of love — by which he meant lovesick. And he called her his very gentle Valentine.\n\nEnglish audiences embraced the idea of February mating. Shakespeare's lovestruck Ophelia spoke of herself as Hamlet's Valentine.\n\nIn the following centuries, Englishmen and women began using Feb. 14 as an excuse to pen verses to their love objects. Industrialization made it easier with mass-produced illustrated cards adorned with smarmy poetry. Then along came Cadbury, Hershey's, and other chocolate manufacturers marketing sweets for one's sweetheart on Valentine's Day.\n\nToday, shops everywhere in England and the US decorate their windows with hearts and banners proclaiming the annual Day of Love. Merchants stock their shelves with candy, jewelry and Cupid-related trinkets begging Be My Valentine. For most lovers, this request does not require beheading.\n\nInvisible Valentines\n\nIt seems that the erstwhile saint behind the holiday of love remains as elusive as love itself. Still, as St. Augustine, the great fifth-century theologian and philosopher argued in his treatise on Faith in Invisible Things, someone does not have to be standing before our eyes for us to love them.\n\nAnd much like love itself, St. Valentine and his reputation as the patron saint of love are not matters of verifiable history, but of faith.\n\nLisa Bitel, Professor of History & Religion, University of Southern California – Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

He's married? Since when?!\n\nEven Cole seemed to forget (to tell his fans, anyway). As he grasped for words, Coogler chimed in sheepishly: I told you I never interviewed somebody before. Is that off-limits? Oh, my bad, bruh!\n\nThat was like one thing to not do, Cole said. No, I'm just joking. I'm joking. It's all good...They know now.\n\nWhat? That it's a Cole world and all our Dreams are now dead? Yes. Yes, we do.
Sara M Moniuszko\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMarriage as political act? Ruby Rose thinks it can be.\n\nIn Cosmopolitan's March issue, the Orange is the New Black star shares\n\nWhen you don't have equal rights, it trickles down to kids who think, 'My aunt's gay so she can't get married, or I'm weird because I feel the same way,' she said. So it's important to break down that barrier. I'm more interested in having a loving, healthy, long-term relationship with someone I might want to have kids with someday.\n\nHear that, ladies?\n\nThe Australian actress and model, who is known in part for her androgynous style and gender fluidity, also said she feels blessed to be confident and in tune with her sexuality, noting how that can be difficult for people in different places around the world.\n\nI'm lucky I can explore, she said. I have a very healthy sex life, and there's something very empowering, strong and feminist about being open and comfortable in that world.\n\nAnother place she seems to feel open and comfortable is on social media.\n\nShe explained that she's always going to be vocal online about things like LGBTQ and animal rights, but knows she's another voice amongst other opinions.\n\nI have a platform and I can open up a dialogue, but I also know that I'm just an actor. I'm just another person with an option no better than anyone else's opinion, she said. I don't overanalyze. I just write from the heart, post it and hope for the best.\n\nRose's cover issue is on newsstands Feb. 7.
Andrea Mandell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. – To date, a few viral karaoke videos have been the most the world has heard Tom Hiddleston sing.\n\nThat will change Friday, when Hiddleston, 35, makes his debut in the Hank Williams biopic I Saw the Light, in which he impressively adopts the country legend's distinct warble. He laughs. I apologize unreservedly for those, the British actor says on a warm day in Los Angeles. Professionally, I haven't really sang before, he says. I mean I was in musicals (in school), but I was always a singing actor. I was never in a band, I was never in the choir or anything like that.\n\nI Saw the Light is full of tumult, genius and pain, chronicling the country legend's six years in infamy as Williams charted 33 hit singles, until he died abruptly at the age of 29 in the backseat of a Cadillac in 1953.\n\nInside Tom Hiddleston's very big spring\n\nI thought about this a lot, says Hiddleston. You think of all of those people who burned twice as bright but not for long, like Janis Joplin and Amy Winehouse and James Dean and Marilyn Monroe and Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix. There's a club, what do they call it, the 27 club or something? Heath Ledger was 27.\n\nHe continues: They become canonized, because they lived at a pitch of such intensity just before the lights went out. And they become frozen in time, so there is never a moment where you see the maturation of their talent or their personality. In some respects, it's basically a tragedy because you don't know where they would have gone or how they would have developed.\n\nMore than 60 years have passed since Williams' death, and classics like Your Cheatin' Heart, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Cold, Cold Heart still play on the radio.\n\nI Saw the Light, which received shaky reviews at its debut at the Toronto Film Festival, despite applause for Hiddleston's performance, charts the genesis of those songs, while folding in Williams' tumultuous marriage to Audrey Williams (Elizabeth Olsen), his unreliability and the ultimately fatal mix of alcohol and drugs he used in part to control chronic pain caused by spina bifida.\n\nHiddleston, who has become beloved to Marvel fans worldwide as the impish god Loki, embedded himself in Nashville for five weeks to get Williams right.\n\nSee Tom Hiddleston shimmy like Hank Williams\n\nThere were some dark days where I just wasn't sure if I was going to get it, he admits. There was a moment where I canceled everything. I canceled my life, I didn't pick up the phone, I didn't do anything else but what was related to Hank.\n\nHe puts a lot of pressure on himself with everything he does, says Olsen, adding that Hiddleston took on responsibility to do right by Williams' legacy and family.\n\nSkill-wise, director Marc Abraham calls Hiddleston so facile it's infuriating. That means on-set instead of staying in character, the actor easily switched between dialects. Let's put it this way: When we would have a disagreement about how something was coming down, he reverted to the king's English, the director laughs.\n\nNow, despite big-budget films such asThor: Ragnarok and Kong: Skull Island in the wings, it's Williams who stayed with Hiddleston. Looking back at it, it was one of the most fulfilling things I've ever done, he says.
Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nMELBOURNE — If history can be relied on then Serena Williams can count on at least reaching the Australian Open semifinals this year.\n\nThe 16th-seeded Williams organized that possible good fortune when she defeated 79th-ranked Genie Bouchard of Canada 6-2, 6-2 in the second round Thursday.\n\nBouchard, an Australian Open semifinalist in 2014, has played in the main draw in Melbourne on six occasions and all five previous opponents she's lost to have gone on to at least the semifinals.\n\nOf course, a semifinal showing is hardly the result Williams is looking for in Melbourne. A 23-time Grand Slam champion, with an Open Era record of seven Australian Open victories, Williams lives to successfully reach the finish line at every tournament she plays.\n\nWhile she understands that try as she might she can't win everything, it doesn't mean she has to love that reality.\n\nI do my best, said Williams, who won her last major while pregnant at the 2017 Australian Open. I don't obviously win them all or I'd have, like, 80 Grand Slams. But I do my best to win the ones I can. Obviously if I don't win, I go home. I go back to the drawing board. I see what I can do better. I come back. That's all I can do.\n\nThat's the strategy she's employing here after failing to hoist the trophy at Wimbledon and the US Open last year, where she lost in the finals to Angelique Kerber and Naomi Osaka, respectively.\n\nWilliams, 37, believes it's innate that she has the attitude of wanting to do it all and do it well — tennis career, small-business owner in the fashion industry, wife, mother.\n\nMore:Venus Williams loves her niece's Qai Qai doll as much as social media does\n\nMore:Doll Qai Qai holds special place in Serena Williams' family\n\nI need to be busy because, like, I have so much energy, she said. I always thought the older I get, the more calm I'll get. I feel like it's kind of going opposite. I keep getting more energy. It's crazy.\n\nDisregarding fame and fortune, Williams lumps herself together with the vast majority of people.\n\nI'm not doing anything special, she said. I'm just doing what I felt like working parents do, she said. They make it work. I'm just like literally everyone else. I'm making it work. It's not easy. But I have to do, as a mom and wife, what I have to do.\n\nAs someone who lives to rewrite history, Williams' most pressing goal at the moment is to tie the record of 24 Grand Slam singles trophies won by former Australian Margaret Court.\n\nIf she does accomplish the feat of tying the record here, Court is not expected to be in the crowd to applaud the achievement.\n\nA preacher who speaks out against homosexuality and the change of law that made same-sex marriage legal in Australia, Court's views are not popular in tennis circles. Last year many players and fans called for the renaming of the Margaret Court Arena here at Melbourne Park.\n\nIn the third round, Williams will play Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska, who upset 23rd-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1. If she wins that match, a fourth-round encounter awaits against either Venus Williams or No. 1 Simona Halep.
Corey Anderson was eager to let people know that there are levels to this game.\n\nDisrespected going into the fight, Anderson (13-4 MMA, 10-4 UFC) had a point to prove when he was matched up with highly-touted rising star Johnny Walker at this past November's UFC 244. Anderson, who had been continuously campaigning for a title shot, was the betting underdog going into the fight, but it wouldn't take long for him to prove his point.\n\nRound 1 started with Walker delivering his patented fakes and awkward movements, switching stances back and forth. Anderson would eventually charge forward, grabbing Walker's leg and stacking him against the cage to work for a takedown.\n\nWalker stuffed the first takedown attempt, a good early sign, but just seconds later, Anderson cracked Walker with a big overhand right, followed by a few shots that didn't fully connect, but ended the combination with a left hook that dropped Walker to the floor.\n\nAnderson made sure not to let Walker off the hook, pouring it on, even as Walker made his way back to his feet. He would take him right back down, dropping some more ground and pound. Walker was in survival mode, stumbling all over the place, until he was met with another big right hand, and the referee stopped the fight with Walker almost out on his feet.\n\nAn infuriated Anderson taunted his way across the cage, screaming in Walker's face, and even mocking his celebratory dance. Big city, bright lights, and Anderson was not going to be denied.\n\nAnderson returns to action this Saturday in the UFC on ESPN+ 25 headliner in Rio Rancho, N.M., when he rematches Jan Blachowicz in what could very well be a No. 1 contender fight.\n\nAnderson won their first meeting in 2015 at UFC 191 via unanimous decision, and he looks to replicate his performance on Feb. 15. Before then, check out the video above to watch Anderson's big finish over Walker.
Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nTheir wedding was spectacular, their happiness plain, and five years on, Prince William and the former Kate Middleton are still living the blissful life.\n\nThe fifth anniversary of the nuptials watched by multiple millions around the world is Friday, which seems like a good time to contemplate the state of their union — and the state of their royal brand.\n\nBoth seem to be more than sound: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, a future king and his queen consort, appear to be still in love and very happy together. As such they remain the most-watched members of the royal family after granny Queen Elizabeth II, who just turned 90.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II marks 90th birthday on Thursday\n\nOnly one thing could rival the couple's dominance, says CNN royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, who grew up the daughter of a royal press secretary.\n\nPrince Harry getting married would be the only thing that could take away the attention, she jokes. (Don't hold your breath: Harry, 31, is too busy even to have a girlfriend lately.)\n\nBut Will and Kate are really important to Britain, says royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith, author of a forthcoming book on Prince Charles. They are the faces of the future of the monarchy in the new generation.\n\nTheir appeal is obvious: They are a young couple with two young children, and appear to be a 'normal' couple that people (in the U.K. and abroad) can relate to, says Charlie Proctor, editor-in-chief of Royal Central, a leading royal-news website in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Cambridges remain incredibly popular, says Charlotte Crawley, who runs the British blog HRHDuchessKate, a must-read for Kate watchers. People who meet them find them very personable and engaging — their story has resonated globally and they have fans from all over the world. On the blog, over 50% of readers are from the U.S.\n\nDuring their recent six-day state visit to India and Bhutan, the pair looked to be endearingly affectionate judging from little signs: He, lightly, protectively touching her back, she, leaning in close to him to talk and laugh.\n\nThey seemed to be in a permanent state of delight as they traveled around India and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, doing their royal thing: meeting excited well-wishers and laying wreaths, feeding baby elephants and rhinos, hiking hours up to monastery on a mountain, and posing at the Taj Mahal, the world's most famous monument to love.\n\nThey are clearly a couple very much in love, Crawley says. They are very natural together, very much at ease, and I would say they bring out the best in each other.\n\nWill and Kate's visit to Taj Mahal may banish sad memories of Princess Diana\n\nWhy does it matter? Some will remember that at this point in Will's parents' marriage, the relationship between Prince Charles and Princess Diana was already beginning to fray, although the public didn't know it yet.\n\nIt was an entirely different story for Charles and Diana, as their marriage was fraught with problems and professional jealousy, Crawley says. With the Cambridges, it's a very successful partnership.\n\nSo it's likely to be a happy anniversary for Will, 33, and Kate, 34. As with the previous four anniversaries, it is expected to be privately celebrated with few details released by their media team at Kensington Palace.\n\nFrom a royal point of view, the couple have already achieved one of their most important duties: They have produced an heir and a spare. Three days after the anniversary, on May 2, their second child, Princess Charlotte, turns 1 year old. And on July 22, their first child and third-in-line to the throne, Prince George, turns 3.\n\nExpect more pictures (many fans can't get enough) of both children, probably some by keen photographer Duchess Kate herself.\n\nBut even the most popular royals can't escape some criticism, and lately the Cambridges have heard some, especially in the British media, about not working hard enough, not being transparent enough, blowing off some royal engagements and, worst of all, blowing off the hometown media.\n\nWill & Kate set to depart for India, leaving carping critics behind\n\nSmith says the Cambridges are feeling their way, trying to find a balance between their royal duty to be visible in public and their desire for as normal a life as possible for their family — in an age of 24-7 social media scrutiny. So far, Smith thinks, they have handled themselves well, have not put a foot wrong as the British say.\n\nThey are trying to preserve their family life, just as then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip, early in their marriage, were allowed to preserve their family life in the few years they had before she became queen, Smith says.\n\nAs a young mum, Kate would be criticized today if she were perceived as neglecting her children for months-long overseas trips, as was routine when the queen was a young mother in the 1950s, says Smith, also the author of an acclaimed biography of the queen.\n\nThey're hands-on parents, very involved in their children's lives, Smith says. And everyone agrees that parents who are engaged with kids, particularly in the early years, are to be applauded.\n\nStill, for the monarchy to remain respected, beloved and financially supported in modern Britain, there is a risk when royal heirs choose privacy too often over public accountability, says Express royal correspondent Richard Palmer.\n\nMy fear is that if William, Kate, and Harry continue at their current level of involvement in official royal duties and try to shut off the rest of their lives from the public for the next decade, there will be little left to interest people, Palmer says.\n\nArbiter, for one, thinks that Will and Kate and their advisers are fully aware of such pitfalls, and are prepared.\n\nThe last few months have been quite good for them — they realize they are not infallible, that they need to take advice and to make sensible choices, she says. No one can keep an upward trajectory forever... They're just going to have to step up in a bigger capacity at home, because people want to see them and the children more.
Derek Jeter won't be the first player elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in unanimous fashion. His old New York Yankee teammate, Mariano Rivera, beat him to that distinction just a year ago.\n\nYet, as ballots are tallied in January and induction ensues on July 26 in Cooperstown, Jeter, unanimous or not, will represent a final checkpoint in baseball's shrine: the last Hall of Famer for whom widespread fame was truly a part of the equation.\n\nWhile advanced metrics and a general sense he was merely an average defensive shortstop have haunted Jeter the past two decades, he is objectively, overwhelmingly qualified for Cooperstown. With 3,465 hits and a .310 average over 20 seasons, and a postseason dossier extensive enough to comprise a 21st season, Jeter has more than enough ammo to quiet the naysayers.\n\nHe will have his day at the Hall, and if his 2014 farewell tour is any indication, the grassy expanses of Cooperstown will be overflowing with pinstriped and gray No. 2 jerseys. And as the final single numeral in Yankee history enters Cooperstown, it in a way closes the book on an era when baseball – and its greatest stars – enjoyed a prominent place in the nation's zeitgeist.\n\nOh, we're not here to weep for baseball. With industry revenues approaching $11 billion, nobody is going broke. With countless ways to access the game – via mobile apps, social media channels or even still through the magic of television – today's big leaguers can touch many more corners of the world than their predecessors.\n\nYet since the time Jeter first stepped on the field in 1995 to this year when he'll earn Hall of Fame induction, baseball has faced a vexing and ruthless dichotomy: As it stacks cash, it withers away cultural currency.\n\nMuch has been made of Major League Baseball's inability to market its stars, and many of those critiques are fair. Yet, consider the cultural landscape in 1996, when Jeter claimed AL Rookie of the Year honors and the first of five championships with the Yankees, and today.\n\nJeter and the Yankees' Game 6 conquest of the Atlanta Braves was watched by 30.4 million people, earning a 19.1 rating and 34 audience share, according to Nielsen. The four top-rated shows that week? World Series Game 5, Game 6, Game 4 and Game 3.\n\nGame 2 ranked ninth that week but it drew 19.4 million viewers and a 14 rating, out-drawing Monday Night Football's 17.8/12, and relegating MNF – entrenched on ABC for 25 years at that point – to a 19th-place finish.\n\nThis year? The Nationals and Astros provided a compelling and occasionally controversial seven-game drama that was a delight for baseball aficionados – but a relative blip at the proverbial water cooler.\n\nSome 23 million viewers watched the decisive Game 7, but the Series-wide numbers were cut almost exactly in half from Jeter's Fall Classic debut: An 8.1 rating, a 16 share, with 13.9 million average viewers, compared to 17.4/29/25.2 million in '96.\n\nThe head-to-head, over-the-air showdown with Big Football also flipped: This year's Game 5 World Series notched a 2.4 rating and 10.2 million viewers, no match for Sunday Night Football's Kansas City-Green Bay tilt that attracted a 5.1 rating and 16.9 million viewers.\n\nOf course, this relevance drain is not unique to baseball, or virtually anything that's not the NFL.\n\nThe same year the Jeter-era Yankees won their first title, NBC's Friends saw its viewership peak at 29.4 million viewers per episode; even still, its 18.7 rating was only good for third place that year, behind ER (22) and Seinfeld (21.2).\n\nYet even as Friends eventually climbed to No. 1, its audience dropped from that point onward, a harbinger of what all media would face in coming decades.\n\nLike World Series ratings, TV's mega-franchises aren't what they were; CBS' The Big Bang Theory finished first, second or third in its last four seasons, but its best rating was just 12.7 in those four years leading up to its 2019 finale.\n\nIn that vein, Sheldon can be No. 1 on a ratings chart, but never connect in a manner Ross and Rachel and Chandler and Monica did – and even still do, in our nostalgia-obsessed present.\n\nSame for Jeter, whose good looks, benign manner and placement on one of the world's most iconic franchises made for a near perfect storm of marketability.\n\nNever mind the decades-long relationships with Gatorade and Nike – where he ranked just below MJ himself on the Jordan Brand masthead. Jeter's borderline A-list status looks even more stark in this era when baseball stars starve for recognition.\n\nHe guested 11 times on David Letterman's show. Sat down with Barbara Walters. Remains the only baseball player ever to host an episode of Saturday Night Live. Made an appearance on Seinfeld and acted alongside Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler and Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell on the silver screen.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that at the time of his retirement, Jeter ranked second to only Peyton Manning among active athletes in name recognition, according to Forbes.\n\nToday's stars are far from that lofty status, even if they're better baseball players than Jeter.\n\nWhile the Q Ratings system is not a perfect science, it's nonetheless notable that three-time AL MVP and burgeoning all-time great Mike Trout is familiar with just 22% of the public, and 50% of sports fans, according to an August survey. (Steph Curry and Drew Brees doubled his number in the former category, and Tom Brady and LeBron James in the latter).\n\nToday's stars may be objectively better baseball players but operate in a far different media landscape than the relatively barren turn-of-the-century world Jeter navigated.\n\nOh, for the days when AOL Instant Messenger was a TV show's or a sport's or a star's chief rival. The Internet, MySpace, Netflix, Facebook, PS1, 2, 3 and 4, the iPhone, Pokemon Go, TikTok – the only guarantee in this environment is audience will be subjected to further fragmentation as new platforms arrive.\n\nThere's a multitude of reasons why baseball – with its slower pace and structure that makes star-making far less conducive than the NBA or NFL - struggles in this environment. TV ratings tell one story; social media followings tell another.\n\nTrout and the occasionally brash Bryce Harper each have 1.7 million Instagram followers. Mookie Betts, an MVP and World Series champion on the highly popular Boston Red Sox, has 691,000.\n\nFor context: LeBron James has 54 million Instagram followers; his 15-year-old son, Bronny, has more than double Trout's total, with 3.9 million. Trout may mean the world to baseball, a far more significant figure than, say, the Utah Jazz's Donovan Mitchell is to the NBA. Yet even Mitchell (2.7 million) enjoys a far healthier social media presence than Trout.\n\nHow would a young Jeter fare in this environment if he debuted in 2016 instead of 1996? Would his high-profile relationships (Mariah Carey, Jessica Biel, Minka Kelly, etc.) help him win the proverbial Internet and burnish his fame?\n\nOr would his reserved public manner, combined with baseball's overall challenge to maintain its foothold in a buzzier, busier world, confine him to fringe celebrity?\n\nRegardless, it still feels as if he's the last of his kind.\n\nTwo years from now, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz will be eligible for the Hall of Fame, though the former's strong ties with performance-enhancing drugs may keep him out. Both he and Big Papi are certainly recognizable, and the many red carpets in A-Rod's future thanks to his impending marriage to Jennifer Lopez will certainly boost his image.\n\nBeyond that, it seems baseball only has the greatness of its players to rely on, which should be good enough.\n\nComing years will see Carlos Beltran, Adrian Beltre, Chase Utley and Ichiro Suzuki voted into Cooperstown. Fast forward a decade or more, and Trout, Clayton Kershaw, Justin Verlander and other contemporaries will have their day of glory.\n\nAll will be deserving. Many were Jeter's superior on the field.\n\nNone could match his fame, however. And you wonder if anyone ever will.
Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFrom romantic and girlishly demure to knock-out, drop-dead glamour, the late Princess Diana's journey from naive teen to global fashion goddess will be on display at Kensington Palace next year, nearly 20 years after her shocking death.\n\nDiana: Her Fashion Story will open Feb. 24 at the palace, the former home of the late Princess of Wales and the current home of both her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, and her two grandchildren, Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge.\n\nThe exhibit, the first Diana-focused show at the palace in 10 years, will trace the evolution of Diana's look and explore how she learned to use her image and her fashion to help showcase the causes she cared about, according to Historic Royal Palaces,the charity that operates royal palaces and estates that also are open to the public as museums.\n\nThe exhibit will explore the story of a young woman who had to quickly learn the rules of royal and diplomatic dressing, who in the process put the spotlight on the British fashion industry and designers, says Eleri Lynn, curator of the show. We see her growing in confidence throughout her life, increasingly taking control of how she was represented, and intelligently communicating through her clothes. This is a story many women around the world can relate to.\n\nThe exhibit will also feature a temporary White Garden, dedicated to her life, image and style, in the palace's historic Sunken Garden, which will be planted with such flowers and foliage as tulips and scented narcisii, a carpet of forget-me-nots and pots of classic English white roses.\n\nBut the main event will be the celebrated outfits from throughout Diana's short public life, from 1981 until she was killed in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997, at age 36. From glamorous gowns worn in the 1980s after her 1981 marriage to Prince Charles, to the chic Catherine Walker suits she wore on engagements in the 1990s, the exhibit will explore Diana's relationships with her favorite designers through some of their original fashion sketches created for her during the design process.\n\nFamiliar highlights will include the pale pink Emanuel blouse worn for Diana's engagement portrait by Lord Snowdon in 1981; and Victor Edelstein's inky blue velvet gown that she wore to dance with John Travolta at the White House in 1985.\n\nSome outfits are going on public display for the first time, such as a blue tartan Emanuel suit (David and Elizabeth Emanuel also designed her memorably pouf-y wedding gown) that she wore on an official visit to Venice in the 1980s. The suit, a rare survival of Diana's day-wear, was only recently rediscovered and acquired by Historic Royal Palaces at auction.\n\nDiana's clothes and artifacts have been traded at auction for years; just weeks before her death, she auctioned off some of her outfits in New York to raise more than $3 million for charity, at the suggestion of Prince William.\n\nThe Travolta gown has been bought and sold multiple times; among the most recent was an auction in London in 2013 when it sold for more than $360,000 to an anonymous British man who wanted it to cheer up his wife.
Happy Friday, everyone! I'm Winston Gieseke, philanthropy and special sections editor for The Desert Sun in Palm Springs, and I'm looking forward to a nice relaxing weekend of staying home and continuing my quarantine. What about you?\n\nIn California brings you top Golden State stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free, straight to your inbox.\n\nCalifornia will set aside 10% of first vaccine doses for educators, school staff\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Friday that the Golden State plans to set aside 10% of first vaccine doses for educators, school staff and childcare providers starting in March as a way to get children back in classrooms.\n\nThe move is aimed at jumpstarting in-person learning after nearly a year of distance classes for most of California's 6 million K-12 students. The news comes a day after California's legislative leaders announced a $6.5 billion proposal aimed at reopening schools in the spring. Newsom said that wasn't fast enough and suggested he could veto it.\n\nI can't support something that's going to delay the safe reopening of schools for our youngest kids, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the state's virus cases, infection rates and hospitalizations have dropped precipitously after reaching record highs in early January. Cases have fallen to 6,700 per day from a peak of more than 40,000, and hospitalizations are a third of what they were six weeks ago.\n\nWinter storm delays more than half of California's weekly vaccine supply\n\nApproximately 702,000 vaccine doses en route to the Golden State have been stymied by the winter storm ravaging the middle of the country, Newsom said Friday at a news conference.\n\nState officials had anticipated receiving 1.2 million doses this week. As a result of the delay, pharmacies in multiple counties have reported canceling hundreds of first-dose appointments. Others expressed frustration with the lack of resources and information available.\n\nThe vaccine supply coming to San Francisco is limited, inconsistent, and unpredictable, making vaccine planning difficult, the city's COVID Command Center said, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nWhile the governor didn't know when the doses would arrive, he said after the storm passes he expects a ramp-up of vaccine allotment from the federal government with modest increases every week.\n\nIn other vaccination news, public health clinics in Riverside County have lost 263 doses of the vaccine, according to county spokesperson Jose Arballo Jr., who had previously told The Desert Sun that the county did not track this information. This week he said he'd been mistaken.\n\nArballo said vaccinations could be lost in a number of ways, including a syringe breaking either during vaccination or from being dropped, a vial being dropped, or a vial being exposed to too much light or sunshine.\n\nCalifornia loosens rules for high school sports\n\nThe California Department of Public Health issued new guidelines Friday for youth and high school sports, opening the door for a quicker return to action for several sports, including football.\n\nAccording to the report, outdoor high-contact sports can be played in counties in the purple or red tier with a case rate at or below 14 per 100,000. There are currently 27 counties in the state with less than 14 cases per 100,000.\n\nThose sports include football and water polo from the current season. Under the new guidance, those sports can resume once the county reaches that threshold if all players and coaches get tested once per week.\n\nBefore Friday, outdoor contact sports would not have been allowed until a county had reached the orange tier, which would've meant less than four cases per 100,000.\n\nThis new guidance, which not include indoor sports, will go into effect Feb. 26.\n\nEasily digestible bite-sized news bits\n\nFor those of you who fear commitment to larger news bits.\n\nThousands of people from around the globe flood Yosemite National Park each February for a chance to see the fleeting firefall phenomenon, where a trick of the sunlight appears to send molten lava down the eastern slope of El Capitan.

Matthew Stafford is the best player the Detroit Lions have. And the most dedicated. So when your best and most dedicated player comes to and you and suggests maybe parting company would be the best thing, you ought to be worried about your team.\n\nSo much for the happy glow the Lions front office put out last week. It turns out they knew all the time that Stafford had pretty much had enough. If we are to believe the reports, the 32-year-old quarterback approached them after the season and said he'd be open to going elsewhere. Supposedly, the Lions brass has agreed.\n\nWhich means the first task facing the nascent duo of Brad Holmes and Dan Campbell — neither of whom have ever made an NFL trade on their own — will be trying to find fair value for their most important player.\n\nGood luck.\n\nThis is bad news on many fronts. First of all, with the story now out there, teams know the Lions are seeking to trade Stafford, and maybe even have to. So much for leverage. Plus, these days starting quarterbacks tend to fetch draft picks, and even if the Lions get a first rounder, unless it's Jacksonville's No. 1 pick and they take Trevor Lawrence, everything else is a crap shoot.\n\nAnswer honestly. Do you really trust this franchise with drafting? They've turned a No. 2 pick into Charles Rogers, a No. 3 into Joey Harrington, a No. 5 into Ezekiel Ansah and a No. 10 into Eric Ebron.\n\nAnd don't tell me there is any quarterback besides Lawrence who is a sure thing in this draft. Certainly not as sure as Stafford now and for another year.\n\nYes, the Lions have a new man pulling the draft strings. The former college scouting director of the Rams. Does that make you confident or nervous?\n\nWhatever the case, it'll be a shakeup of seismic proportions. Stafford is a known entity. The only star player the Lions really have. Go ahead. Who's next? The injured Kenny Golladay? Frank Ragnow in the distance? There's no one on the defense, just a few names past their glory days. They've got a really good punter, if that makes you feel better.\n\nThe rebuild is on\n\nBut take Stafford off this team, and you are truly starting over. And maybe that's the only thing they can do. Living in the middle at 5-11 and 6-10 gets you nowhere.\n\nBut this news, which broke on Saturday, is another bang to the gong that signals how long and consistently the Lions mess things up.\n\nStafford was the top pick in the 2009 draft, Detroit's reward for enduring an 0-16 season. He became the fastest player in NFL history to 20,000, 30,000 and 40,000 yards. He holds virtually all the Lions passing marks. From 2011 to 2019 he started every single game. He's played through all kinds of injuries. Put up big numbers. Made one Pro Bowl and led the Lions to three playoff games in three separate years. I know that sounds pathetic. But it's actually more than any previous Lions' starter in more than 50 years.\n\nOn top of that, Stafford is a quality guy. I've gotten to know him fairly well over the years. What you see is what you get. He's a stand-up person. The ultimate teammate. A leader. A grinder. A spotlight-avoider. A non-complainer. His stand over the summer during the George Floyd protests revealed a man who's fully morphed from taking things seriously to doing things seriously.\n\nI know him well enough to say if he indeed approached the Lions about this, then he's been bottling it inside for a long time. The last time he spoke with the media, following another dismal season, he reiterated that he loves it here in Detroit. I believe that's true. His kids have been raised here. His marriage blossomed here. He's intricately involved with the community and charities here.\n\nHe's a Lion through and through. But anyone who's that much a Lion must know the following feelings: Heartbreak. Frustration. Aggravation. Depression.\n\nCan you blame him for seeking greener pastures?\n\nHard to blame him\n\nSomeone will get themselves a whale of a quarterback, just turning 33 in a league where guys are playing beyond 40. And if you like Stafford, part of you might be happy if he gets to play, say, for Bill Belichick in New England, or with all those weapons in New Orleans, or with that young aggressive group in Washington.\n\nMark my words. If Stafford gets with a real coach and a reliable offensive line, his biggest achievements are ahead of him.\n\nBut it's shame he never had that here. He was coached by Jim Schwartz, Jim Caldwell, Matt Patricia and Darrell Bevell. Not exactly a Hall of Fame group. And his coordinators were even less remarkable. Turn him loose with that arm and some innovative minds and who knows what will happen?\n\nAnd maybe that's what he's after. Maybe he realizes there are only so many autumns left. He's got tools. He's got talent. But he can't coach the team, can't build the roster, can't make the trades. At some point, maybe, like every Lions fan, a player throws his hands up. Heck, it took Bobby Ross less than two seasons before he was screaming I don't coach this ----!\n\nIt's not the city. It's not the fans. It's the franchise. Would YOU want to spend your entire career here if you had enough talent to possibly make a Super Bowl?\n\nSo begins the long goodbye to the best quarterback the Lions have ever had. And the long hello to a rebuild that could try the patience of even us, the league's longest-suffering fans base. When you think this through, you know what you feel like saying to Stafford? Send us a postcard. We're not going anywhere.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com. Check out the latest updates with his charities, books and events at MitchAlbom.com.
Josh Smith\n\nCredit.com\n\nWith the recent passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, many Americans are wondering how their finances will be affected. That's a fair question, since a tax overhaul of this size and scope hasn't happened since the 1980s.\n\nNews reports have come out since the signing of the bill detailing how some companies have been able to provide new raises, bonuses, and benefits to employees. Since many Americans are employed by someone else, you may want to know: how will the new tax bill affect me as an employee?\n\nHire an accountant\n\nThere are big changes coming, so even if you don't expect to see much of a change, it's still a worthwhile investment to consult a tax professional — whether that's a CPA or just a tax preparer. They may be able to spot problems with your filing or even help you get deductions you didn't know you qualified for.\n\nRun a projection\n\nIt's not all that difficult to run a projection of how much your taxes will cost or return to you, even if you aren't quite ready to file. If you do it now, you can get an estimate of how much you may owe, if anything. This will leave you with more time to file an extension if necessary.\n\nMore:Residents in this city owe the IRS more than $7,000 during tax time\n\nMore:Timing is everything: The 4 best times to file your taxes\n\nMore:These are the most important tax forms and documents you need for filing\n\nUpdate your withholdings\n\nWhen we first start a job, we all have to fill out paperwork about our tax withholdings. Contact your HR representative to ask about updating your withholdings. This is worth doing every year or every time you and/or your family experience a life event, such as the marriage, birth of a child, or buying a home.\n\nRethink buying or selling your home\n\nSpeaking of homes, your mortgage interest is still deductible, but only up to $750,000 now. (Previously it was up to $1 million.) If you were planning on taking out a mortgage over that amount this year, consult a financial advisor to decide if this is the right move for you.\n\nDon't count on deducting your moving expenses\n\n2017 will be the last tax year where employees can deduct expenses if they relocate specifically for a job. If you are considering doing that this year, see if your employer will foot part of the bill, especially if it's not a voluntary move on your part. Their answer might pleasantly surprise you!\n\nAssess your retirement situation\n\nIf you have a 401k or Roth IRA, consider increasing your contribution. It may help your tax game in the long run. The tax rules around rolling over these types of retirement accounts have changed, so make sure you're taking advantage of them.\n\nReconsider taking out a home equity loan\n\nUnder the new tax law, home equity loans will be taxed differently. Previously, the amount was tax deductible. This will no longer be the case after this tax year. Many expect home equity loans to become more expensive moving forward.\n\nDon't rely on a SALT deduction\n\nThose who live in states with famously high tax rates (such as New York and California) will be disappointed to learn that state and local taxes can no longer be deducted. If you live in one of these states, or any other highly taxed state, begin saving now.\n\nDouble check on your commuter benefits\n\nPreviously, employers were incentivized through tax breaks to offer commuter benefits to employees. This deduction is going away for businesses, but with the other tax breaks for corporations, it may end up being a wash. Check with your employer on the future of this benefit. Personal contributions are still deductible up to $255.\n\nAssess your financial situation holistically\n\nWhether or not you're financially savvy, you may want to take this opportunity to assess your financial situation as it currently stands and weigh it against your long-term financial goals. While the tax reform bill may not affect your day-to-day life right now, it's always a good idea to take a step back and look at the big picture once in a while.\n\nMore from Credit.com\n\nProperty Taxes & Your Mortgage\n\nA Tax Audit: Will It Happen to You?\n\nCan My Taxes Mess With My Credit?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Credit.com.\n\nJosh is the Content Manager at Credit.com.

With Manny Pacquiao set to fight Adrien Broner Saturday night in Las Vegas, the curious case of Freddie Roach lingers.\n\nIn short, how is it that Roach, the esteemed boxing trainer, is back in Pacquiao's corner?\n\nOver the past 15 years, he has played an instrumental role in the rise of Pacquiao (60-7-2, 39 KOs), the Filipino boxer who has won world titles in eight divisions. But unceremoniously, Roach then became a castoff.\n\nIn July 2017, after Pacquiao suffered a controversial loss to Australian Jeff Horn, Pacquiao didn't bother to call Roach before Pacquiao's next fight. And without Roach in his corner, Pacquiao delivered his first knockout in nine years with a TKO victory in July over Argentine brawler Lucas Matthysse.\n\nYet now, with the 40-year-old Pacquiao fighting the 29-year-old Broner in a bout to be televised by SHOWTIME PPV, there in plain view have been the signature black, horn-rimmed glasses, the 5-6 frame and cheerful disposition of Roach.\n\nHe's back.\n\nMore:Quite the contrast: Senator Manny vs Adrien Broner\n\nThey're like a married couple,'' said Justin Fortune, Pacquiao's strength and conditioning coach, and it's like they had a trial separation.''\n\nPacquiao has dodged questions about what went wrong between him and Roach.\n\nIt's been a long time that I didn't speak to Freddie,'' he said. I was busy in the Philippines.''\n\nBut in an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Roach, 58, talked in detail about what transpired.\n\nIn 2017, Pacquiao was juggling responsibilities as a senator while preparing for his fight against Horn. Sometimes it meant Pacquiao's work days lasted up to 18 hours a day, according to Fred Sternburg, Pacquiao's publicist.\n\nRoach said the demanding schedule contributed to Pacquiao losing to Horn by unanimous decision.\n\nManny fought one good round in that fight, I thought,'' Roach said. And he almost knocked (Horn) out in the ninth. And then I told him give me one more round like that, he'll be all set, and he just couldn't do it. It wasn't there.''\n\nAfter the fight, Roach said, he spoke bluntly to Pacquiao.\n\nI told him being a senator and being a professional boxer at this level is not working,'' Roach recalled. I said, 'I think that it's really hurting you to do both. I think you should pick one or the other.' \n\nPacquiao walked away without saying a word, Roach said.\n\nAt a Nov. 20 press conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., to promote his fight with Broner, Pacquiao said Roach would be part of his team again. Only he still hadn't talked to his longtime trainer.\n\nPacquiao made the call later in the day and a deal was in place soon after, according to Roach.\n\nRoach was asked to play more of a supervisory role and work alongside Filipino trainer Buboy Fernandez, Pacquiao's close friend. But Roach was glowing one day during training camp after he'd held the mitts and caught Pacquiao's punches. Just like the old days.\n\nLike always, I'll go till he's finished,'' Roach said. And like always, 12 rounds later he says, 'That's enough.'\n\nEveryone says that's the best work he's had in a long, long time, OK? Me and him work well together. We know each other quite well.''\n\nLikely factors behind the reconciliation have become clear.\n\nDuring a recent interview, when talking about Pacquiao's political career, Roach did not express concern about whether Pacquiao could juggle politics and boxing. Rather, Roach mused about the possibility of Pacquiao running for president in the Philippines — and then becoming the first president to win a boxing championship.\n\nPacquiao, meanwhile, has spent less time focused on political responsibilities and has taken more time off during training to make sure his body recovers. With Roach supervising, of course.\n\nYou can't replace that knowledge that Freddie has,'' said Fortune, the strength and conditioning. And if Manny's happy, I'm happy.''\n\nOr as Pacquiao cagily said, I don't have any problem with Freddie Roach.
Bill Keveney\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSpoiler alert: This story contains significant details from Monday's series finale of A&E's Bates Motel.\n\nIn the end, Norman Bates got his wish: He'll be with his mother for eternity.\n\nThe psychologically damaged killer at the heart of A&E'sBates Motel — a prequel to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho that charted a different course —- came to his own end, buried next to his mother in Monday's series finale of the five-season drama.\n\nNorman (Freddie Highmore), obsessed with his dead mother, Norma (Vera Farmiga), died at the hands of her other son, Dylan (Max Thieriot), after his delusions could no longer stand up to reality.\n\nIn the episode, Norman comes home and is consumed by images of the (series) pilot and is thinking he's back at that time and his mother is alive and they're going to make things great, Highmore says. But his dream starts to unravel when Dylan says, 'She's dead. She really isn't here, Norman.' \n\nAs Norma's embalmed corpse sits at an immaculately set dinner table, Norman charges at Dylan with a knife after his half-brother challenges his view of reality. Dylan then fatally shoots him in self-defense, an action producers say Norman instigated as he saw his fantasy world crumble.\n\nNorman puts Dylan in a position where he has no choice. We hope there was a certain beauty to Norman having this final moment of clarity where he recognized he had no options that were better than this, says executive producer Carlton Cuse. He forces Dylan to do something, and that action is the final act in his tragedy.\n\nExecutive producer Kerry Ehrin sees this final Bates killing as an act of brotherly love.\n\nNorman is in such a hopeless place that he's reaching out to his brother to fix it for him in the only way he can think of in the moment, she says. There's caring and love, even though the incident itself is horrific and tragic and heartbreaking.\n\nThe finale includes plenty of action before Norman's death. Early in the episode, Norman — taken from jail at gunpoint by Norma's vengeful husband, Alex Romero (Nestor Carbonell) — shows Alex her corpse, beautifully situated in the snow. Norman then turns the tables and kills Romero before returning to the motel and his own eventual demise.\n\nAmid Bates' bloodshed, there is at least one bright sign. In a scene that takes place some time after Norman's death, Dylan, whose marriage to Emma (Olivia Cooke) was frayed by his support for Norman's legal defense, is happily reunited with his wife and their growing daughter.\n\nFrom very early on, we thought that Dylan and Emma deserved to survive this tragedy and come out the other side, Cuse says. There's so much sadness and loss that we wanted there to be one story that had a ray of hope to it.\n\nHighmore acknowledges the severity of Norman's lethal crimes, but still feels for a character who struggles with and eventually succumbs to his delusions. He points to Norman's urging, earlier this season, that Marion Crane (Rihanna) leave the motel, knowing that would prevent him from acting on his murderous urges.\n\nIt's not that I'm condoning certain actions of his, but I hope we feel sympathy for him at the very end. I think he's always tried to be a good person, tried to be nice and do what he thought was best, Highmore says. What makes him appealing is that he's never really been out to get people.
Sharon Peters\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nYou're a successful fiftysomething author and former federal prosecutor with four kids, a quite famous husband (novelist Michael Chabon), and raging mood swings that therapy and the usual pharmaceuticals no longer blunt. What do you do?\n\nWhat Ayelet Waldman did was break the law and secretly consume minuscule doses of LSD every third day for a month, monitoring and recording the changes in her moods, relationships and productivity.\n\nA Really Good Day: How Microdosing Made a Mega Difference In My Mood, My Marriage and My Life (Knopf, 219 pp., ***½ out of four stars) is the chronicle of Waldman's short experiment with what most regard as a dangerous mind-bending psychedelic. She, on the other hand, asserts that the tiny doses she consumed amounted mostly to a sip of serenity, or something close to it.\n\nRelentlessly honest and surprisingly funny (in parts), the book is also an energetically researched history of this drug (which until it was criminalized in the 1960s was regarded by many researchers and counselors as a helpful tool in addressing several forms of mental illness).\n\nWaldman's underlying bias — that LSD was and is safe and effective in therapeutic settings and hasn't been all that risky when used recreationally, either — might challenge mainstream thinking. But she produces some very decent data and arguments. It's worth noting that she taught a course on the War on Drugs at UC Berkeley School of Law, so she knows where the good stuff about drugs and policy and vested interest is buried.\n\nIn modified diary form, Waldman details her use of and reactions to LSD microdoses (two drops, about one-tenth of a typical recreational dose), branching off for sweeping forays into drug history, drug law and some of the most private corners of her life. She was motivated by a lifetime held hostage by the vagaries of mood, and writes that at the worst times she's beset with self-loathing, and knotted with guilt and shame….overtaken by a pervasive sense of hopelessness.\n\nOnce she embarked on this experiment, she experienced the probably predictable moments of fretting over whether she would have to be resuscitated by EMTs and worrying about how wretchedly irresponsible she was, what with all those children counting on her.\n\nAlthough hers was a journey few will take, A Really Good Day reads almost like an Everywoman's experience, because Waldman's fears and reactions are so commonplace. She is so likable in her flaws and her determination that it's a relief to learn that the microdoses (or possibly her therapy sessions or maybe even a placebo effect, she acknowledges) allowed enough of a head shift that her life has become easier, lighter.\n\nShe had the courage, the credentials and the insight to make this journey and tell us about it. They all add up to a fine read.\n\n—————\n\nSharon Peters is author of Trusting Calvin: How A Dog Helped Heal A Holocaust Survivor's Heart.
Don't believe the rumors. Howard Stern's 20-year marriage is still going strong.\n\nThat's the message Beth Ostrosky Stern, 46, brought to The Ellen DeGeneres Show that aired Friday.\n\nTwenty years of marital bliss. I'm setting the record straight right here. I love my Howard, Beth said while sitting on the stage next to DeGeneres. He's a great guy.\n\nThe rumor mill started up last week when Howard and Beth had a disagreement, and Beth told her husband that he was being grumpy and a Debbie Downer.\n\nHe then talked about their problems on his SiriusXM show.\n\nAt least that's what Beth suspects is what caused the uproar that followed. Because she doesn't actually listen to his show.\n\nThe Google alerts come: 'Howard and Beth are breaking up. Marital problems' There's pictures of us with lighting bolts between our heads. I don't know what's going on, said Beth. Apparently, he spoke about us on the air. This was last week. And it spread like wildfire.\n\nStrangers even stopped her in the street and wished her well.\n\nThe other day, someone comes up to me and said, 'I'm so sorry about what's going on with you and Howard, I hope you make it.' I had no idea what was going on, said Beth.\n\nConsider that discussion closed.\n\nBut things are getting ugly on the animal front for Beth, the host of Hallmark Channel's Kitten Bowl VI.\n\nShe and Howard foster a one-eyed kitten named Pebble.\n\nShe's the biggest jerk. I love her to the last day, forever and ever, says Beth. She attacks me, Howard can't even touch her. I love you so much Pebble, but you are a jerk.
J.J. Watt will be 32 next month, but the man can still move. Heck, he just beat a guy more than six years his junior, Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, out of Houston.\n\nAnd good for Watt.\n\nHis best years are almost certainly behind him, and there was definitely no Super Bowl trophy in front of him had he remained with the Texans, who drafted him 11th overall in 2011 but are currently an organization seemingly in complete disarray. But now, by forfeiting what would have been a $17.5 million non-guaranteed salary in 2021 with Friday's release – a move that simultaneously helps extricate Houston from its salary cap issues – Watt has the freedom to sign with any team immediately rather than wait for the start of NFL free agency March 17, when the contracts of pending free agents officially expire.\n\nSo where does Watt, one of three men in NFL history to win defensive player of the year three times (along with Lawrence Taylor and Aaron Donald), go next? A number of factors are likely to be in play.\n\nNFL POWER RANKINGS:Buccaneers are No. 1, but who's next?\n\nDAN WOLKEN:Urban Meyer's 'character and leadership' con continues in Jacksonville\n\nTROY AIKMAN:Dallas Cowboys, Dak Prescott are not in rebuild mode\n\n► Watt left a lot of money on the table to leave the Texans and surely knows he can no longer command top dollar at his age after coming off the least productive full season of his 10-year career. Assuming money isn't the variable driving him to his next destination, a world of possibilities could open up for him.\n\n► Houston had never won a playoff game prior to Watt's arrival in 2011. But starting in his rookie season, when Watt returned an interception 29 yards for a touchdown to help beat the Bengals in the wild-card round, the Texans won four playoff games. However Watt, a man long driven to achieve glory on Super Sunday, has never even reached an AFC title game. He'll surely be looking for a team he believes can win now.\n\n► Watt spent most of his career as a left defensive end, often devouring helpless right tackles, in Houston's base 3-4 defense. Though scheme fit for his next team will surely be a consideration for both sides, it seems unlikely to be the overriding determination.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind, here are 10 teams (listed alphabetically) that could be fits, some better than others, for JJW:\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nMatt Judon, their leading sack man each of the past two seasons, is headed for free agency and seeking a contract that will average $20 million annually, per ESPN. Watt could be a far more cost-effective option, especially if he falls into more of a rotational role on passing downs. Quarterbacks wouldn't enjoy staring across the line of scrimmage and seeing Watt and Calais Campbell, even at their advanced ages.\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nA marriage between Watt and a Western New York community saturated with Bills Mafia would surely be a happy (if brief) one. Buffalo, which finished one win shy of the Super Bowl last season, didn't have a player with more than five sacks on a middling defense. Watt's five sacks in 2020 were his fewest over a 16-game season. However, his 17 quarterback hits would have easily paced the Bills, who would have to make some cap room to accommodate him. Still, for a team that might only be a player or two away, Watt might just be one of those players.\n\nChicago Bears\n\nThey were a wild-card team in 2020 but don't have available cap space right now ... or a good idea who their quarterback will be in 2021. But the Bears do provide the unique opportunity to play in the Windy City – where Watt's wife, Kealia, is a member of the National Women's Soccer League's Chicago Red Stars. Watt probably also wouldn't mind a defensive union with Bears OLB Khalil Mack.\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nA team that took a quantum leap in 2020 under coach of the year Kevin Stefanski could use help on a defense that ranked 22nd against the pass. Imagine the damage Watt could do playing opposite All-Pro DE Myles Garrett and alongside disruptive DT Sheldon Richardson. And given the way the Browns' run-heavy offense can both milk and control the clock, Watt wouldn't find that he has to play nearly as many snaps.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nThe Pack have massive cap issues, roughly $28 million overspent at present, per Over The Cap, a figure they'll have to reduce to zero by March 17. But they also represent a singular chance for Watt, a proud Badger, to return to his native Wisconsin. And given how this defense was exposed in the last two NFC championship games, adding Watt might be a very nice to way to give league MVP Aaron Rodgers help at a discount.\n\nLos Angeles Rams\n\nThey boast the league's No. 1 defense and are clearly going after the brass ring following their damn-the-torpedoes trade for QB Matthew Stafford. A pairing of Donald and Watt is not only extremely tantalizing, but perhaps wholly necessary given OLB Leonard Floyd, L.A.'s No. 2 sack man in 2020, is poised to cash in during free agency – an arena where the Rams don't seem able to compete for prime talent given they're $27 million in the red cap-wise.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nThey wouldn't make a ton of sense for Watt schematically or from a cap standpoint given Pittsburgh needs to shed about $32 million to be compliant by the time the new league year starts. But if a scenario arises for J.J. to join his brothers, OLB T.J. Watt and FB Derek Watt, in Pittsburgh with the reigning AFC North champions, is he going to say no?\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nThey haven't had a premier edge rusher since the days of Michael Bennett and Frank Clark and relied heavily on S Jamal Adams to create havoc in 2020, when his 9½ sacks established a single-season league record for defensive backs. But it would make more sense to get pressure up front from Watt and not expose the back end so regularly by bringing Adams into the box. And an acquisition of Watt's caliber might mollify suddenly publicly disgruntled QB Russell Wilson, a University of Wisconsin product like Watt.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nWhy not help the Bucs run it back? Rickey Jackson, Neil Smith and DeMarcus Ware are just a few all-time great pass rushers who switched teams late in their careers to successfully snatch a first Super Bowl ring. The Bucs have nearly $30 million in available cap space, though face decisions on what to do about soon-to-be free agents like OLB Shaq Barrett, WR Chris Godwin and DL Ndamukong Suh. Regardless, Watt seems like an ideal short-term fit for a group of mercenaries in win immediately mode.\n\nTennessee Titans\n\nAFC finalists in 2019 and AFC South champions in 2020, they seem close to a breakthrough – especially if they can upgrade a pass rush that managed only 19 sacks last season. Going to Nashville would reunite Watt with coach Mike Vrabel, his defensive coordinator in Houston in 2017, and allow him two opportunities to play the division rival Texans in 2021.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Jessica Simpson pulls back the curtain on her highly publicized breakup with Nick Lachey and her relationship with John Mayer in her upcoming Open Book memoir.\n\nIn excerpts published by People before the release Feb. 4, the Do You Know artist revealed that being in the spotlight caused her marriage with Lachey to crumble.\n\nSimpson, who was 22 years old when she married Lachey in 2002, said they were both trying to find their places in the music industry. They filmed the reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica about their union. It ran from 2003 to 2005.\n\nWe worked and we were great at it, but when it came time to being alone, we weren't great at it anymore, Simpson wrote. We really got crushed by the media and by ourselves. ... I couldn't lie to our fans and I couldn't give somebody hope that we were this perfect golden couple.\n\nThe actress said the 98 Degrees member was her first love and she will always have respect for him.\n\nI was really young, and my success hadn't really begun, she said. He knew me as this young, innocent 18-year-old that had never been introduced to the world in so many ways. I went straight from my father to him. Nick's very smart. He was eight years older than me, but he was also young.\n\nThe pair divorced in 2006, and Lachey married Vanessa Minnillo in 2011. Simpson married NFL pro Eric Johnson in 2014, but before she found love with Johnson, she dated John Mayer, a romance she details in her book.\n\nSimpson wrote that despite her intense connection to Mayer, the singer made her feel insecure in their relationship, and she started drinking to control her nerves.\n\nI constantly worried that I wasn't smart enough for him. ...

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Gov. Eric Greitens' affair was known to his political opponents more than a year ago, before he was elected. But despite the buzzing rumor mill, his infidelity wasn't in the public eye until last week.\n\nRumors of the affair percolated since at least the summer of 2016, said Roy Temple, who at the time was the chair of the Missouri Democratic Party.\n\nAmong Democrats and Republicans alike, Greitens' affair was just kind of common knowledge in political circles, said Temple, whom the News-Leader contacted after St. Louis television station KMOV reported Greitens' admission of an affair and denial that he allegedly blackmailed his hairdresser.\n\nGOP observers — not candidates — whispered rumors of the affair after Greitens won the primary in August 2016, Temple said. And as the year passed, the rumors became more specific, including the woman's identity and eventually, her ex-husband's name.\n\nAt this point, Temple said, he recognized the man and reached out through a mutual acquaintance, if for no other reason than to see whether there was any truth to what he had heard.\n\nMore:Blackmail allegations prompt investigation of Missouri governor\n\nMore:Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens admits to affair, denies blackmail\n\nTemple and the man spoke by phone in August 2016 and met later that month. Then, Temple said he learned a great deal more detail and was presented with documents the man retained and a recording of a March 25, 2015, conversation.\n\nIn the recorded conversation, the man assured his wife that what she tells him about her March 21 encounter with Greitens won't leave the car.\n\nOn the recording, the woman says Greitens allegedly invited her into his home, talked her into his basement, bound her, blindfolded her, pulled her pants down, took a photograph of her and told her that she was never going to mention (Greitens') name, otherwise there will be pictures of (her) everywhere.\n\nGreitens' attorney has said any blackmail allegation is false and denied that any such photograph was ever taken. The allegations have triggered a criminal investigation by the St. Louis Circuit Attorney.\n\nAt the time of that first encounter with his hairdresser, Greitens had created an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for his gubernatorial run, and two days later, the former Navy SEAL was in Chicago to promote his book Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life.\n\nThe woman's ex-husband knew Greitens was considering running for office and urged the woman to risk the embarrassment in publicly challenging Greitens' image as a manly hero.\n\nAnd I'll have you know, I can destroy his career in a half an hour ..., the man tells the woman at one point on the tape. He took a picture of my wife naked as blackmail. There is no worse person. (The man's attorney, Al Watkins, has said that the man's agenda is to protect his children and their opinion of their mother.)\n\nThough the ex-husband did not follow through with the threat at the time, he did try to alert the future governor's wife.\n\nWatkins provided the News-Leader with a message the man sent to Sheena Greitens using a pseudonym. The email was sent in early July 2015, at a time when the man believed his wife and Eric Greitens were again together at the Greitens residence.\n\nThere is another woman in your home right now, the man wrote to Sheena Greitens, according to the email provided by Watkins. I'm assuming you're out of town again. If you want to know more contact me here. I'm sorry. This isn't fake or spam. They are at the Maryland address (in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis).\n\nSheena Greitens' email provided an automatic reply that thanked the sender and said she was traveling with limited access to email. The man wrote again that day, several hours later: Today was not the first time he has had her in your home.\n\nWhy Democrats didn't go public\n\nTemple told the News-Leader that he was struck by what he termed extraordinary attempts by Eric Greitens at that time to maintain secrecy, based on the ex-husband's account and the documents Temple reviewed.\n\nGreitens has been since scrutinized for accepting millions of dollars in untraceable donations, the anonymously sourced political contributions he has received through a non-profit set up by senior aides and the illegal transfer of a donor list from the pro-veteran charity he founded to his political campaign. Attorney General Josh Hawley is investigating Greitens' and his senior staff members' use of a communication tool that deletes messages after they are read.\n\nTemple said he was supposed to meet with the ex-husband again in mid-September of 2016. Instead, the Democratic operative was contacted by Watkins, the ex-husband's attorney. From their conversation, Temple said, he understood that the ex-husband wanted time to think and that Watkins was to be the go-between from then on.\n\nBy then, the race between Democratic Attorney General Chris Koster and Greitens was heated — but the ex-husband, who was worried about the effect on his children, did not want to go public with what he knew.\n\nIf the man had expressed a desire to go public, Temple said, I would have connected him to a reporter and let them make a news judgment about the affair involving Greitens — who presented himself as a towering symbol of virtue and family values Temple said — and allegations related to violence and threats.\n\nWatkins has pointed out that if the ex-husband had a political agenda or aimed to damage Greitens' reputation, he could have gone on the record when Greitens and Koster were locked in a tight contest during their race's final weeks.\n\nA Koster campaign official confirmed to the News-Leader that before the November election, they discussed with Temple substantiated rumors that Greitens had an extramarital affair. The Koster staffer said top campaign aides did not hear about the alleged blackmail then and did not talk of the affair to Koster, who could not be reached for comment.\n\nSpeaking to Greitens' general counsel hours before news of the affair broke Wednesday, Watkins said he attempted to reach out to Greitens through back channels before the election to let him know that the ex-husband wanted to put the affair behind him. Watkins said he was hired to put the kibosh on it and credited the Democrats who knew of the affair with not going public.\n\nSince the election\n\nGreitens was elected in November 2016 and started implementing parts of his conservative agenda throughout 2017, while he continued to project the image of a patriarch of a solid, happy family. The Democratic party replaced Temple as state party chair, and Koster's campaign staffers dispersed.\n\nRumors of the affair remained in circulation throughout the first year of the Republican governor's term — and according to Watkins, interest rose sharply in early to mid-December.\n\nWatkins has facilitated contact with media outlets interested in his client's story, but he has rejected the notion that he is shopping the story to various news outlets. Several weeks ago, Watkins said, media interest on the local and national levels reached a frenzied pitch — including a phone call by a national reporter to one of the ex-husband's children.\n\nThe dam starts to break\n\nSince KMOV broke the story Wednesday — based on an interview with the ex-husband, his surreptitious recording and the governor's own admission, but without on-the-record comments from the woman — the governor's private attorney has released several statements from Eric and Sheena Greitens, and from himself.\n\nA few years ago, before Eric was elected Governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage, the joint statement said, in part. This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately.\n\nWhen the ex-husband went public, I knew it was him, said Temple, who reiterated that he kept his word to the ex-husband to not publicize the affair.\n\nTemple said he felt free to comment to other media outlets after the news broke.\n\n#MeToo's role in the reaction\n\nThe News-Leader has not spoken with either the ex-husband or the woman with whom the governor cheated on his wife, instead communicating through attorneys for all three parties. The News-Leader has declined to name the former couple. The woman's attorney has said his client wants to have her privacy respected.\n\nAnd therein lies another problem, as pointed out to the News-Leader by multiple lawmakers, including Rep. Crystal Quade, D-Springfield.\n\nWe're essentially re-victimizing her by having this come forward without her consent, Quade said last week. And if these allegations are true, this woman had terrible things happen to her without her consent, and it's happening all over again.\n\nQuestions of power, consent and consequences gained national prominence with the rise of the #MeToo movement, through which women have come forward with allegations and evidence that they have been wronged by men in positions of power.\n\nJohn Hancock, a GOP consultant and former chair of the Missouri Republican Party, questioned whether the #MeToo movement was the proper context when the News-Leader asked about the movement's possible impact on Greitens' scandal.\n\nThe 'Me Too' movement, as I understand it, deals with sexual assault, unwanted sexual advances, and demands for sex by a superior over a subordinate. This instance, setting aside the photo / blackmail allegations which may or may not be true or provable, seems to involve a consensual sexual affair, Hancock said in an email. Marital infidelity is tragic for those families involved and may require years to process before healing. The current situation does not, however, appear to me to be analogous with the kinds of offenses brought to light by the recent 'Me Too' movement.\n\nDave Robertson, a political science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the best test of the impact of the #MeToo movement is the accusation that he threatened the woman involved if she exposed him.\n\nThe Governor denies it, and right now it is his word against her and her former husband, Robertson said in an email. In a case like this, Americans are more skeptical of the denier. Fair or unfair, the #MeToo movement undoubtedly has reduced the number of people willing to give Governor Greitens the benefit of the doubt, because it seems common for public figures to deny the first allegations.\n\nBennett, Greitens' attorney, referred to previous statements and declined to comment further when asked Tuesday by the News-Leader. Despite some calls for the governor to step down, Greitens has not indicated that he will resign.\n\nFollow Will Schmitt on Twitter: @ws_missouri
Jessica Berman has never played lacrosse, but that hasn't stopped her from becoming one of the top executives in the National Lacrosse League.\n\nIn August, she was appointed deputy commissioner of the National Lacrosse League and is now the highest-ranking woman in a men's professional sports league. Her immediate goal? To expand the NLL, which now has 13 professional teams, to 16 teams.\n\nI love it, said Berman, who lives in Larchmont, New York. If I could have scripted the next best opportunity for me, it would be exactly this.\n\nBerman said she knew by age 15 that she wanted a career in sports.\n\nShe remembers the excitement at a New York Islanders game where spectators, who didn't seem to have much in common, were high-fiving and even hugging each other when their team scored a goal.\n\nLISA WILLIS: First female coach for New York Knicks' franchise\n\nSomething in that moment clicked as I watched the power of sports in bringing people together, said Berman, 42.\n\nGrowing up in Brooklyn, Berman always found ways to be part of the sports culture, from cheerleading in her high school to tracking statistics for her school's baseball team.\n\nAt the University of Michigan, where she majored in sports management, she was the manager of the school's hockey, football and baseball teams.\n\nWhen I went to college back in the '90s there was no clear path on how to obtain that kind of experience, she said of managing the teams. I just went to the athletic department and I offered my services to help the different teams to kept statistics on the different players and liaised with the local newspapers on storytelling about the players.\n\nSummers were spent on professional internships with sports agents and sports marketing agencies.\n\nThose experiences led her to sports law.\n\nThe way that my mind works, I knew I would really enjoy a very analytical way of thinking and I was specifically interested in collective bargaining and understanding labor and management relationships, she said.\n\nAfter graduating from the Fordham University School of Law, Berman began her career at Proskauer Rose LLP, in New York City specializing in labor and employment.\n\nOne of the firm's clients was the National Hockey League.\n\nWorking on labor relations issues, particularly collective bargaining agreements, convinced her she was in the right field, she said.\n\nI often describe labor relations as a marriage where you can't get a divorce. You have to find a way to work it out, she said. Collective bargaining requires a lot of patience and compromise and understanding the big picture. It's about winning the war, even if you lose some small battles.\n\nAfter four years with Proskauer, Berman was hired by the NHL in 2006 as a staff lawyer.\n\nNHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly, who was then head of the legal department, said the team had the opportunity to observe Berman on the job while she consulted on behalf of Proskauer.\n\nWe could see how she worked under stressful, difficult situations. We saw the level of expertise and creativity she brought, said Daly. She is very committed to accomplishing things. Anything that's put on her plate to accomplish, she'll go to great lengths to make sure it gets done.\n\nThat trait was in full display in 2013 when her husband, Brad Berman, a marathon runner, suffered a stroke at age 37. Doctors had to cut out a chunk of his skull to relieve pressure from a ruptured blood vessel in his brain (storing it in his abdomen for future reattachment) before placing him in a coma, where he remained for six weeks.\n\nThe stroke initially left him totally paralyzed on his left side, unable to even move the left side of his face. For the next few years, Jessica Berman balanced work, raising the couple's two young children — both under the age of 6 — and taking care of her husband.\n\nShe also raised more than $750,000 to help the Burke Rehabilitation Center, where her husband was being treated, to purchase machines and other equipment, including a robotic exoskeleton, needed for his progress.\n\nI often describe Jessica as the quarterback of my recovery, said Brad Berman. There were many difficult and complicated decisions that had to be made. She collected tremendous amounts of information and did a lot of research and figured out what the best technology was in terms of helping me to recover the left inside of my body and pulled in experts from around the country to deal with my condition.\n\nToday, he is not only well on his way to recovery, but also working full time as a tax attorney.\n\nThe couple's marriage, however, did not survive. The Bermans divorced earlier this year, but remain close.\n\nOur marriage didn't survive the experience. It changed the dynamics of our relationship, she said. When they say your life can change in an instant, I really know what it means.\n\nThrough it all, family, friends, the community and the NHL were pillars of support, she said.\n\nTime for change\n\nIn 2015, looking for a change in her career track, Berman approached Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner and deputy commissioner Daly: She wanted to move from the legal side to the business side to gain a better understanding of revenue generation.\n\nBerman was offered the position of vice president for community development, culture and growth, responsible for designing and executing the league's strategic corporate social responsibility goals, initiatives, policies and programs.\n\nOne of her priorities was to increase revenue by building programming that engaged the community, such as an initiative honoring the Hockey Mom of the Year.\n\nMillennials and Gen Z really leverage their own spending on brands that are committed to community and purpose, she said. And when you have programming that authentically engages the community, sponsors will align around those objectives and support the programs.\n\nTwo years ago, as she turned 40, Berman said she sought out mentors to help her figure out how she could grow in her career.\n\nShe said she knew she would have to step out of her comfort zone.\n\nAn opening at the National Lacrosse League proved to be that opportunity.\n\nAfter 13 years, I felt like my identity was intertwined with the NHL, she said. It was a very hard decision to leave, but ultimately, I felt like if I want to stretch and learn and grow, I owed it to myself to challenge myself, redefine myself in a lot of ways and see where it leads.\n\nExpanding the NLL\n\nBerman is not shy about her ambitions.\n\nI wanted to intentionally fill any gaps in my experience so that I'd be a qualified candidate for any opportunity that comes my way in the future, she said. Whether it's to be a commissioner of a league one day or the president of a team.\n\nBut first, winning a buy-in from her kids, Noah, 11, and Andrew, 9, to take on a high-pressure job which would require a lot of travel was important to her.\n\nAs a working mom, you're always trying to be conscious of 'where am I most needed?'  she said.\n\nFor Berman, the key to her ability to balance all of this has been keeping her kids up to speed on what she's working on and why it's important.\n\nI talked to them about it before I accepted the offer and I said, 'I already work really hard. This is going to be the next level and if you guys aren't on board, I probably won't take it. We need to do this as a team or I'm going to figure something else out.'\n\nNoah, when he heard about the opportunity, he says, 'Are you kidding mom? This is going to make you a pioneer,'  she said. I always say they're co-presidents of my fan club.\n\nBeing at a much smaller, emerging league (it was established in 1986) has offered Berman the opportunity to grow in her role as executive vice president of business affairs.\n\nIn my old role at the NHL, I touched the revenue side from a marketing standpoint, but I wasn't working directly on generating revenue, she said. Now I'm involved in things like selling expansion teams, for example.\n\nWhen an expansion team is sold into a new market, there are things one quickly needs to become familiar with, such as negotiation with the prospective owner, identifying an arena for the team to play and paying a fee to buy a new team.\n\nThe NLL, which currently has 13 teams, has been authorized by its board to expand to 16 teams by 2023. By comparison, the National Football League, National Hockey League and National Basketball Association each have roughly double that number.\n\nLacrosse is among the fastest growing sports in the United States, according to a recent Sport & Fitness Industry Association report.\n\nIt's been really fun to learn and work on. From bringing in new sponsors to working on media rights, there are so many new things to learn, said Berman.\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy covers women and power for the USA Today Network Northeast.

Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE — Verbosity hasn't often been an inclination for Serena Williams and at the start of her 20th season as a tennis superstar she hasn't developed a penchant for chattiness.\n\nSo it came as no surprise that when meeting the international press ahead of the Australian Open on Saturday, she primarily chose cagey over confessions.\n\nAt 35, Williams arrives in Melbourne with the chance to win a 23rd career Grand Slam trophy, which would break her shared Open-Era record of 22 Grand Slam titles with Steffi Graf, and place her one Grand Slam title away from equaling Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 titles.\n\nWilliams, however, had that looming possible achievement on her list of subjects not-to-be discussed.\n\nOh, I'm not talking about that, she said. I'm just here to play and to win, obviously, but just to play.\n\nThat led to wonderment as to whether she'd open the door to divulging any details on her recent engagement to Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of the social network Reddit. Williams played it mostly coquettish, but didn't totally shy away from being the future blushing bride.\n\nAsked about the exciting news in her personal life, she countered with a sly smile, Can you elaborate? then added, I'm just kidding.\n\nIt's been really great, said Williams, notably not flaunting an engagement ring. I've said from the beginning I just didn't want to think about it until after Australia because I was, like, Grand Slams mean a lot to me.\n\nMORE TENNIS:\n\nFrustrated Serena Williams loses in second round at Auckland\n\nThanks to Reddit, we can all now see Serena Williams' engagement ring\n\nI don't think I've had an opportunity to let everything sink in, she added. I won't allow it to sink in because I'm so focused. It was right in the middle of pre-season. Now I'm on the road, already back at work. I don't want to get too happy because I want to stay focused.\n\nThe pending marriage supposedly on the back-burner with questions such as whether the part-time fashion designer bride-to-be will create her own wedding dress unanswered, it was back to the basics of tennis.\n\nWilliams reached the final at the first three Grand Slams last season, winning her 22nd major trophy at Wimbledon, but lost out on the title to current No. 1 Angelique Kerber at the Australian and Garbine Muguruza at the French.\n\nAfter a semifinal defeat to Karolina Pliskova at the U.S. Open, Williams relinquished her No. 1 status to Kerber and shut down her year, prematurely, to nurse a left knee injury.\n\nFor me, it wasn't a great season, Williams said of 2016. I think for other people it would have been wonderful. It was what it was.\n\nAs it turns out it wasn't a joyous start to the 2017 season for Williams, who posted 88 unforced errors in a 6-4.6-7, 6-4 second round loss to fellow American Madison Brengle at the Auckland tournament nearly two weeks ago.\n\nWilliams' opportunity to change her luck will commence with a first round meeting against Belinda Bencic on Tuesday. They've split their two prior meetings with the Swiss posting the upset in the 2015 Toronto semifinals.\n\nAlso at stake for Williams at this Australian Open is a possible return to the top of the ranking charts.\n\nIt's a given that if Kerber journeys to the final, win or lose, she retains the No. 1 status.\n\nThe scenarios for Williams to dethrone the German work out to she must reach the final, but if Kerber advances to the round-of-16 Williams must win the trophy.\n\nI didn't come here to lose in the first round, or the second round, or at all, said Williams, sending an obvious message to the other 127 players in the draw.\n\nPHOTOS: SERENA WILLIAMS' GRAND SLAM WINS
After only one woman went home last week (bye, Elyse), this week's Bachelor was going to be a bloodbath. No surprise: It was! Five women left the show this week, four of whom Colton sent packing himself.\n\nSo, who's left?\n\nWe pick up this week right where we left off with last week's to be continued cliffhanger: with Colton frustrated on the beach. Heather dubs the Onyeka/Nicole/Colton drama the moment of the century, because, sure, there's nothing more important going on in the world.\n\nOnyeka confronts the group and asks if anyone feels like she's ever bullied them, and Nicole later joins them.\n\nNicole, you said I bullied you, back it up! Onyeka says in front of the group.\n\nThe show doesn't waste any time bringing us to the rose ceremony. There are seven roses on the table, which means two people are going home. It would be too easy for the two to be Nicole and Onyeka, right?\n\nWrong! The two troublemakers are out of the house faster than their backstabbing bickering match even began.\n\nAnd then we properly start this week's fun.\n\nLove at first sushi roll\n\nColton and the remaining contestants head to Vietnam, and Hannah G. (winner of the first-impression rose) gets the first date card.\n\nHannah G. is absolutely stunning, Colton says about her. Every time I see her I get a little smitten. The two sneak in some spa time and get facial masks.\n\nNot gonna lie, it's hard for me to keep my hands off her, Colton adds. All wrapped up at the spa, he tells her she looks like a sushi roll. I would definitely eat that sushi roll, he cheekily tells the camera.\n\nAfter Caelynn questions Hannah G.'s authenticity as a person to Cassie (i.e. wonders if there's a layer to her that they're missing), we see Hannah G. open up to Colton about her parents' divorce. Colton's parents also are divorced and the two bond. Duh, she gets the rose.\n\nHannah G. tells the camera she's falling in love with him. Colton tells the camera the same. (Start placing your bets, people.)\n\nFight! Fight! Fight!\n\nCassie, Heather, Tayshia, Caelynn, Katie, Hannah B., Sydney and Demi go on this week's group date, Are you ready to fight for love? They learn the ancient art of Vovinam, a Vietnamese martial art. Some are more ready to fight than others.\n\nI went to sleep last night as Hannah B. But I woke up this morning as Hannah Beast, Hannah B. says. She also referred to herself as Hannah Beast last week, so that's a thing.\n\nThe women pair off to spar with each other. The most pivotal moment comes when Demi swears Katie hit her in the face and she winces and whines like a toddler. This doesn't impress Colton. (Remember this later, friends.)\n\nColton opens up to Tayshia after the date and tells her their one-on-ones are what he'd kill for every day. Demi calls her mom with Colton by her side. (Demi's mom has spent time in jail, and this is going to be the first normal phone call they've had in years.)\n\nSydney opts to leave the show. She says that if it their relationship was right then it would be a lot easier. She doesn't think they can get there based on her needing more.\n\nThere are some very wonderful people in that group, she warns Colton. Find them. Figure out who they are. Don't be distracted by shiny things, especially now.\n\nTayshia ultimately gets the rose. She's someone who continues to push me each and every time that we sit down, Colton says.\n\nChemistry-less Colton and Kirpa\n\nKirpa and Colton channel their inner A Star Is Born and dive in to the water together on their boat trip one-on-one. Did anyone else hear far from the shallow now? Just us? Cool.\n\nThe two also go out to dinner and have about as much chemistry as a Tinder date that would fizzle after a month or so. She's been engaged before (from an eight-year-relationship) and he was saving himself for marriage. Colton asks her if she can see herself getting engaged again at the end of this, and she says if they keep progressing as they are she'd want to be engaged.\n\nColton insists he had a fun time and that though their relationship is moving slower, it's our pace. She gets a rose (somehow).\n\nDemi's sex plan fails\n\nDemi may not be a fighter, so she tries being a lover instead. Hopefully, after tonight, Colton won't be the virgin anymore, she says, and goes to visit Colton. Hasn't she learned what happens when you go visit Colton at night? (See: Elyse.)\n\nDemi tells him she feels like she's falling in love with him, but he tells her there's a part of him that doesn't know if they can get there. I don't know right now if I can see myself with you at the end of this, he says. And that's that, she's going home.\n\nWho (else) went home?\n\nAnd after all that: No cocktail party tonight. Five women are vying for roses, and only four are up for grabs. Colton sends Katie home, and she tells him, You have a great group of girls. And you know who's ready in there. And there's some that aren't. She adds, Just be smart about those girls, and the camera pans to Heather and Hannah B.\n\nColton confesses his greatest fear in all this is that he's going to be with somebody who's not ready to be engaged the end of this. He tells the remaining women that Katie's the third person this week to warn him that there's someone or some people here not ready for the future he wants.\n\nColton knows that the tea is brewing and he wants someone to spill the tea, Tayshia tells the camera. It seems like she tells Kirpa at the end (though it's not immediately clear, per some clever camera editing): Let's take this thing. Watch, it's us two at the end. Gulp.\n\nIn case you're an episode behind:'The Bachelor' recap: That kiss finally happens; 1 contestant quits\n\nOr you missed two episodes:'Bachelor' recap: Colton gets serious about sexual assault during chat with Caelynn
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — No disrespect to Olympic gold medal prospect Nathan Chen, but the biggest current stars in American figure skating won't be taking to the ice this month. They'll be behind a microphone.\n\nFor many, the commentary combo of Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir are more of a reason to tune in to the Winter Olympics than the individuals and pairs populating the competition itself.\n\nThe Tara and Johnny show came to Sochi four years ago, but this time it has hit prime time on NBC and promises to be raucous, outrageous and completely unafraid to pull any punches.\n\nIt is a double act that works, to the extent that the network has put them together at Super Bowl media day, the Academy Awards, the Kentucky Derby and the National Dog Show.\n\nWhen you are trying to reach a younger crowd, this is 2018, the old school way isn't going to work, Lipinski, 35, told USA TODAY Sports in recent joint interview with Weir. You have to be honest and lay it down exactly as you see it. There's a lot of pretty strange things in our sport and you have to have a good chuckle.\n\nThat brand of irreverent humor isn't appreciated by some of the sport's hardcore and traditionalist fans, but is adored by the wider mainstream set that truly drives ratings. Figure skating hasn't boomed since the 1990s and has been left behind by the rapidly evolving media landscape. Weir and Lipinski are doing their darndest to bring it back.\n\nThe 90s were great, it was such a boom time, and on television in general everything was very airbrushed, very beautiful and packaged, Weir said. Then came the family we all love so much — the Kardashians — and suddenly butt injections were on TV, Lady Gaga was ruling the charts, things changed and people wanted reality. We give them reality.\n\nMedal count:How is Team USA faring?\n\nMeet Team USA:Where 2018 Olympians are from\n\nMore:Adam Rippon gives LGBTQ community athlete they can relate to\n\nLipinski, who won gold at Nagano in 1998, and Weir, a three-time national champion and 2008 world bronze medalist, did not cross paths during their own careers.\n\nIn 2014, they were NBC's broadcast experiment, thrown together. They've never looked back. Figure skating commentary may never be the same again.\n\nThe pair are close enough now that they sit for interviews with their bodies touching, and finish each other's sentences. Weir, who is openly gay, was bridesman at Lipinski's wedding to television producer Todd Kapostasy last summer.\n\nWhen she met Weir, Lipinski loved the way he spoke frankly and openly, on and off air.\n\nOur sport is very political and subjective and you can hide that if you want, Lipinski added. But why would you? If a skater falls five times and wins and the next skater who did stand up, doesn't (win), it is very confusing. Johnny is not afraid to go out on that limb, point it out and let the judges know he didn't agree.\n\nWeir was having a tough time during Sochi, with his marriage to ex-husband Victor Voronov on the verge of collapse. Things got messy with accusations flying back and forth, the matter ending up in divorce court, Voronov lodging a defamation suit against Weir and even a dispute over a valuable Faberge egg — much of it played out through TMZ and the New York tabloids.\n\nLooking back to Sochi in particular, I was going through a divorce – it was awful, the most horrible time of my life as far as dealing with another human being, Weir said. The best thing to come out of it was that Tara and I had to bond so quickly. We were in Russia, there was no one really around, I wasn't close to any of my coworkers or my bosses, I wasn't close to anybody. It was just terror. If I hadn't had her I would have panicked. (I would have) gone home or just crumbled under the pressure.\n\nLipinski remembers them working all day — then we'd cry and have therapy sessions with each other — then get back at it the next day and put together a collective breakout performance.\n\nWeir keeps most of his private life out of the commentary spiel but everything else is fair game, and you can confidently bet that the chatter with him and Lipinski won't be restricted to salchows and triple axels.\n\nAnything can be on the agenda, from hairstyles to costumes to whatever happens to be passing through their minds at the time, and unless the viewership's tastes have dramatically changed they'll be lapping it up once more.\n\nWeir and Lipinski are an oddity no more. Somehow, through the force of their own chemistry and personality, they have become a staple of the American Olympic landscape. Last time they were largely tucked away on the NBC Sports Network. Now they are front and center — and ready to shine brighter than the glittering costumes on the ice.\n\nWe just had this chemistry that came instantly and for the last four years we have been building on that, Lipinski added. America has accepted us as the voices of figure skating.\n\nAs a skater, Weir often found more popularity with the sport's occasional fans than he did from the traditionalists. He feels the same is true of his commentary.\n\nAre we feeling more loved? he said. Really hardcore skating fans … it's hard to impress them. We are getting a lot of love from people who don't watch skating and that's what we want — people to come back to our sport. But the sport itself doesn't change much, or quickly.
Patrick Ryan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWell, it's a step forward from 1989.\n\nLest you've forgotten, Ryan Adams proclaimed himself the ultimate Swiftie in fall 2015, when he released a track-by-track cover album of Taylor Swift's gleaming foray into pop. Although it effectively brought Swift's vivid lyrics and undeniable hooks to the forefront, the sleepy, acoustic-rock slog more or less drained the life out of one of pop's best-crafted efforts in recent years.\n\nSo it's a relief that Adams returns to original material on follow-up Prisoner (**1/2 out of ****), out Friday, his 16th album and first collection of new music since his divorce from actress Mandy Moore was finalized last year. Though he takes no risks sonically, the dissolution of their six-year marriage provides a fascinating lens through which to read this next chapter.\n\nThe 42-year-old singer/songwriter sets the scene with the stomping Do You Still Love Me?, as he ponders what went wrong and attempts to salvage the dying embers of their relationship. Recalling an '80s-era Bruce Springsteen on the harmonica-assisted title track and Doomsday, Adams fights to hold on, singing on the latter, My love, we can do better than this / My love, how can you complicate a kiss? It's an aching sentiment that eventually turns into defeat on Shiver and Shake, in which he describes the physical distress of heartbreak and how if I wait here any longer, I'll just fade away.\n\nAfter a stirring first half, Prisoner treads into less affecting territory in its second, as Adams continues to wallow in pain while offering little insight into what may have actually transpired between them. The exceptions are Breakdown, a morose guitar ballad that veraciously captures the hopelessness that comes with breakups; and album closer We Disappear, in which he painfully takes a stab at closure, conceding, You deserve a future and you know I'll never change.\n\nWith the exception of a serene saxophone solo on the sanguine Tightrope, Prisoner hews closer to the bare-bones arrangements of 2011's Ashes & Fire than his more rock-heavy self-titled album in 2014. Some fans may gripe that Adams is simply doing more of the same, but overall, it's a solid, sincere addition to his prolific catalog.\n\nDownload: Do You Still Love Me?, Shiver and Shake, Breakdown
Japan's environment minister is taking paternity leave, a first for a Cabinet minister in the country where men rarely take time off for raising children.\n\nThe move has made waves around the country and world, even as Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, a potential candidate for prime minister one day, said he'd only take off two weeks over three months.\n\nHonestly, I had to think over and over how I should take time off for child rearing, or take paternity leave, while fulfilling my public duty as environment minister, Koizumi told ministry officials and reporters Wednesday. Unless we change the atmosphere, government employees presumably won't start taking paternity leave.\n\nThe decision comes as Japan has pushed for men to take paternity leave and spend more time with their families. The government changed its rules last month allowing public servants now to take more than a month of paternity leave. Governors in Hiroshima and Mie have taken leave, but never before has a Cabinet minister.\n\nAcross the country, Japan's leave policy is generous, with men and women allowed to take off up to 12 months with partial pay. However, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare says only 6% of eligible men took paternity leave from work in 2018.\n\nKoizumi, son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, said he'd be taking the leave without it affecting his parliamentary and Cabinet duties.\n\nKoizumi is having his first child later this month and said last year when announcing his marriage that he'd be taking the leave. Some have been critical of the decision, saying he should focus on his public service duties.\n\nI hope there will be a day when lawmakers' paternity leave is no longer news, he said.\n\nI wholeheartedly support him, Tokyo politician Hironobu Narisawa told local media, per CBS News. This will encourage other male employees.\n\nParental leave in the US:America's parents want paid family leave and affordable child care. Why can't they get it?\n\n'Childcare is outrageous here':Real people sound off on paid leave, affordable child care\n\nIn the United States, federal law allows for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child, however, individual employers may grant some amount of paid leave. The United States is the only OECD country that does not offer paid leave to new mothers, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.

LOS ANGELES – The fast-approaching end of Modern Family is sinking in for the people who make the acclaimed ABC comedy, cast members told USA TODAY during an exclusive on-set visit Thursday.\n\nCast, writers and crew Wednesday experienced one of the final milestones on the way to the April 8 series finale: the last group script reading – table read, as it's known in the business – before they begin shooting the final half hour of the 11-season series, a five-time Emmy winner for best comedy.\n\nThey shared their feelings Thursday during shooting breaks between scenes from the two-part finale, which will bring the show's episode count to a lofty 250.\n\nIt's getting a little real, says Julie Bowen, whose Claire Dunphy is married to Phil (Ty Burrell) and the mother of three now-grown children. I don't like table reads to begin with. I hate them as a performative thing, because they make me very anxious. It's like doing a play. And so I thought I wouldn't care, that I'd be thrilled when we were done.\n\n'Modern' maturation:Ariel Winter and Sarah Hyland on growing up on 'Modern Family': People love to attack women\n\nIt didn't quite turn out that way. I was sobbing and sobbing by the end, she says, acknowledging that the tears will be flowing during the final week of production. Turns out I'm not going to have any control over my emotions during this process.\n\nBowen, one of numerous cast members to commemorate the last table read on social media, conveyed the mood visually with an Instagram post featuring a photo of long-time Modern Family writer and producer Danny Zuker: Modern Family's FINAL table read is hitting @dannyzuker hard. Our writers truly are the heroes of the show...\n\nEd O'Neill, who plays patriarch Jay Pritchett, the husband of Gloria (Sofia Vergara) and father of Claire and her brother, Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), from his first marriage, says he's very happy with the final script of the series, which was created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan.\n\nO'Neill, speaking before shooting a scene on Thursday, called it perfect, just the right amount of sentiment, but not too much. It was very good and very funny.\n\nDuring the script reading, the cast sat facing the writers at a long table, as shown in Vergara's Instagram post below.\n\nAs it progressed, I could see people getting emotional, O'Neill says. When it ended, I just stood up and started applauding the writers. Everybody was doing it and that lasted for, like, five minutes.\n\n'Modern' milestone:Exclusive 'Modern Family' video: With Phil ill, jealousy bug bites Cam in 200th episode\n\nEric Stonestreet, who portrays Mitchell's husband, Cam, posted a short video of the table-read room with Trace Adkins' You're Gonna Miss This playing as a soundtrack.\n\nThe table read was kind of tough, just having it actually dawn on everybody that it's over, Burrell says, expecting more emotions in the coming days.\n\nBut I honestly feel like the dominant emotion isn't sadness. It's actually sort of an overwhelming gratitude that has a lot of people feeling emotional, he says. It's just feeling really grateful to have had the experience and to have been with these people, understanding how rare and special it's been.
Bree Burkitt\n\nThe Spectrum\n\nST. GEORGE, Utah — Following Tuesday nights announcement of the death of President Thomas S. Monson, questions have already emerged about who will be the next prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nAccording to a statement previously released by the church, the appointment of a new president is viewed by members as a divinely revealed process free of internal lobbying.\n\nFollowing the death of the president, the First Presidency is automatically dissolved and the two counselors in the First Presidency return to positions of seniority in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In this situation, that would be President Henry B. Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, who served as Monson's two counselors since he assumed the Prophet role in 2008.\n\nMore:Mormon Church President Thomas Monson dies at 90\n\nMore:Mormon leader reaffirms faith's opposition to gay marriage\n\nA senior apostle is then determined based on who has the highest ranking seniority from the date when they were ordained to the Twelve. The longest-tenured member of the governing body is 93-year-old Russell M. Nelson. His appointment will not be officially named until after Monson's funeral services, out of respect.\n\nThe senior apostle will then preside over a meeting of the Quorum of the Twelve to consider two alternatives: should the First Presidency be reorganized or should they just move forward with the Quorum of the Twelve? A formal motion will be made and accepted.\n\nIf the motion to reorganize is passed, the Quorum of the Twelve will unanimously select the new president, who will assume the top role in the nearly 16 million-member church. The decision is predetermined, though.\n\nThroughout the history of the Church, the longest-serving apostle has always become the president of the Church when the First Presidency has been reorganized, according to a church release.\n\nThe next president has not been named yet, but based on this information the job is expected to go to Nelson. He has served nearly 34 years after being first called to service in 1984.\n\nAfter being officially selected, he will then choose two counselors from the Quorum of the Twelve to form a three-person presidency considered the religion's top governing body.\n\nThe second-longest serving apostle will be designated as the new president of the Quorum of the Twelve after the reorganization of the First Presidency. This would be Dallin H. Oaks, who has served for 33 years and nine months.\n\nThere have been 16 presidents, including Monson, since the founding of the LDS Church by Joseph Smith in 1830.\n\nThe choosing of the prophet differs from the choosing of other religious heads. For instance, traditionally, there is a 15- to 20-day waiting period from the death of a pope to the start of a conclave, the process of choosing the next leader of the Catholic Church.\n\nAt the start of a conclave —­ Latin for with key, referring to the voters being locked inside the Sistine Chapel ­— the 115 cardinals move into the Domus Santa Marta, a modest five-story building tucked securely behind Vatican walls.\n\nAfter morning prayers, the first balloting takes place, the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church, told USA TODAY in 2013, during the selection of Pope Francis, who succeeded retiring Pope Benedict.\n\nAfter the first day, then there are customarily four votes per day, trying to reach a two-thirds majority of the cardinals. In 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was chosen on the second day on the fifth ballot and became Pope Francis. Reese noted the last time a conclave lasted more than four days was in 1831.\n\nContributing: Marco della Cava, USA TODAY. Follow Bree Burkitt on Twitter: @breeburkitt
Married five days ago in a jailhouse wedding, a suburban Cincinnati man found himself Tuesday one step closer to deportation.\n\nYancarlos Mendez, 27, of Springdale, Ohio, was taken overnight to a federal detention center in Louisiana, the final move before he will be put on a plane for his native Dominican Republic. The Bayou State has three immigration detention centers in Basile, Jena and Oakdale, and his records did not come up in a search of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Online Detainee Locator System.\n\nHis lawyers confirmed the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement decision to proceed with Mendez's removal. He overstayed a 90-day non-visa waiver by more than two years, according to agency officials.\n\nLate Monday, lawyers Charleston Wang and Nazly Mamedova completed an emergency application for a stay of removal that says irreparable harm will befall a 6-year-old paraplegic boy named Ricky Solis. The son of Mendez's wife, Sanda Mendoza, is now legally related to Mendez as his stepfather.\n\n► Feb. 9:As husband's deportation looms, bride ready 'for whatever comes next'\n\n► Jan. 19:Immigrant's jailhouse wedding gets OK from sheriff\n\n► Jan. 18:Ohio sheriff blocks jailhouse marriage of immigrant facing deportation\n\nMendez's lawyers submitted the application overnight to Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. She has jurisdiction over the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which this past week overturned its previous stay of Mendez's deportation.\n\nMendez, an auto mechanic, financially supported his fiancée and her son and has training from Cincinnati Children's Hospital staff to care for Ricky's extensive medical needs.\n\nRicky traveled last week with his mother and the family's ministers to the Morrow County Jail in Mount Gilead, Ohio, an hour north of Columbus, for the wedding. He was not allowed in the jail's secure area, where the ceremony took place.\n\n► Jan. 16:Can courts stop deportation of disabled boy's caregiver? Yes\n\n► Jan. 12:Deportation stay granted for caregiver 'daddy' of paraplegic boy\n\n► Jan. 8:Despite social media outcry, paraplegic boy's 'daddy' to be deported\n\nWe have one last chance, one last chance, Mendoza said.\n\nShe spoke Monday on the phone with her husband.\n\nI tried to cheer him up and tell him not to be sad, she said. It is so difficult.\n\n► Jan. 5:ICE to move forward with deportation of paraplegic boy's caregiver\n\n► Jan. 4:Paraplegic 6-year-old's 'daddy' faces deportation\n\nRicky was injured in a car crash a year ago in the Cincinnati suburb of Fairfield, Ohio. Mendez proposed shortly after the incident and lived in Ricky's hospital room with his fiancée for several months until the boy's release.\n\nMendez was detained and turned over to the federal government after he was stopped in November for driving without a license.\n\nFollow Mark Curnutte on Twitter: @MarkCurnutte
Bill Keveney\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBEVERLY HILLS, Calif. – A huge class divide hasn't stopped Downton Abbey's Lady Mary and her lady's maid, Anna Bates, from finding a way to connect.\n\nThe most interesting part of this story is the relationship between the two worlds. Mary has her most sisterly relationship with Anna. She knows her better than anyone, Michelle Dockery (Mary) says in a joint interview with Joanne Froggatt (Anna) before the sixth and final season of PBS Masterpiece's Downton (Sundays, 9 p.m. ET/PT, check local listings). For me and Jo, that's been a huge part of the experience, those scenes between the two of them.\n\nAnna has a strong marriage to her downstairs colleague, Mr. Bates (Brendan Coyle), but she speaks most freely to Mary.\n\nMary's been the one from the start that Anna's always confided in, Froggatt says. They really genuinely care for each other. Anna won't hear a bad word said about Lady Mary, even though she's not always perfect.\n\nThat applies from the other direction, too, Dockery says. A lot of the time, Mary doesn't really care what other people think, especially the family. But it's important that she gets approval from Anna.\n\nMary's relationship with her real sister, Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), is fractious, leading to plenty of drama. There's some really great stuff between the sisters, especially late in the season, Dockery says.\n\nWhile Anna has a husband, the widowed Lady Mary, who has a young child, is seeking a new partner.\n\nIt's complicated. She's a widow now, so her choices are different, because it's about finding a father for George as well, Dockery says.\n\nDashing race-car driver Henry Talbot (Matthew Goode) is a candidate, although Mary may not agree. That's the sort of guy she would have liked at the beginning, Dockery says.  Mary was a rebel. Then her position gave her more responsibility, and she kind of became the person she didn't want to be.\n\nThere's a playful give and take between the two actors as they discuss swapping their Downton roles.\n\nI definitely want the (upstairs) wardrobe, Froggatt says.\n\nDockery cautions. Sometimes, you're like, 'You can take it,'  because of all the costume changes during filming.\n\nFroggatt reconsiders: I'm so glad all I have to do is one fitting at the beginning of each season.\n\nAnd Dockery decides she doesn't mind: . The outfit changes are always worth it, because they are knockout.\n\nThe period covered by Masterpiece's Downton – 1912 and through World War I to a technologically advanced 1925 – reflects massive change. You definitely feel those social changes, more so for the women, Froggatt says. You feel there are starting to be more opportunities for women and for the working classes.\n\nNew opportunities greet the actors, too. Dockery is set to play a thief and con artist in contemporary America in upcoming TNT drama Good Behavior, while Froggatt will go back to the 19th century to play poisoner Mary Ann Cotton in Masterpiece's two-part Dark Angel.\n\nThey appreciate their Downton fame, with each ending heading toward the March 6 series finale serving as a reminder.\n\nThe last day (shooting) at Highclere Castle was a big day, Dockery says. That's when it really started to sink in.
Keith Uhlig\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nMARSHFIELD - Sara Guild's unborn baby died about halfway through her pregnancy.\n\nUntil that point in 2016, Guild, outreach director for U.S. Congressman Sean Duffy and a Marathon County Board member, and her husband, Daniel Guild, Weston village administrator, were thinking about the future.\n\nBy that stage, you are already planning a life around another member of your family, said Sara Guild, 33. After the doctor told her the news, she said she only had one thought: What did I do wrong?\n\nNothing. She took some solace when her doctor told her so. The baby likely died because its body got twisted up with the umbilical cord, her obstetrician said. It's the cause of an estimated 10 percent of stillbirths, according to research by the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network.\n\nBut for many women who lose unborn babies, the reason isn't at all clear. And sometimes, there is no answer at all to a loss during pregnancy. Not knowing what happened or why can add even more emotional pain to an already difficult grieving process.\n\nThat special kind of suffering spurred Dr. Elizabeth McPherson and Diane Allingham-Hawkins of PreventionGenetics, a Marshfield genetic testing lab, to band together to find a new, better way to determine the causes of pregnancy loss. McPherson is a medical geneticist for the firm and director of the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service Program. Allingham-Hawkins is the senior laboratory director at PreventionGenetics and a geneticist who specializes in the technical aspect of scrutinizing human DNA.\n\nTogether, they and their colleagues at PreventionGenetics unveiled in December a first-of-its-kind process of determining why unborn or just-born infants have died, called the Comprehensive Miscarriage, Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Panel.\n\nCouples who experience these kinds of challenges are compelled to seek answers to questions whether the event will happen again, and if it could have been prevented, McPherson said. Genetic testing can sometimes open the doors to answers.\n\nHow the test works\n\nThink of DNA as a car engine. A skilled mechanic knows a good engine by the way it looks and sounds. When things go wrong, the mechanic can look at an engine and see oil seeping through a seal, find a cracked hose or hear a piston misfiring.\n\nIt was only recently that researchers fully understood what a sound gene looked like. Now they can use highly-refined equipment and testing procedures to look at DNA of the child and see where things have gone wrong — like a mechanic does with an engine. The PreventionGenetics testing panel uses genetic expertise and sophisticated technology developed over the past decade or so to identify DNA deficiencies in the child that cause pregnancy loss.\n\nThe PreventionGenetics lab itself isn't all the distinctive. It looks like a high-tech chemistry lab, full of equipment such as computers, monitors and machines that have a space-age, microwave or dishwasher kind of look. But the equipment is able to peer down into the sub-cell level and provide images of the genes that are the building blocks of life. Geneticists then can use those images to determine genetic problems.\n\nThe PreventionGenetic miscarriage panel is not just one simple test. It's a battery of tests that first scrutinizes for chromosome abnormalities (chromosomes are larger, and therefore easier to study). Then, if the cause isn't found, the tests go deeper into the DNA to scrutinize specific genes for problems, the most common first. In the past, all those tests were done individually. The PreventionGenetic procedure is unique because it uses one cohesive process and can find genetic disorders more efficiently.\n\nMcPherson has three decades worth of experience working with patients and she has a deep understanding of the genetic problems that cause pregnancy loss. One of the reasons McPherson specialized in genetics 30 years ago was because she foresaw how the study of the DNA could impact the future of medicine. Through her professional career, she has seen a science revolution in the field of genetics.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, we didn't know the genes and what they cause, McPherson said.\n\nThe PreventionGenetics Comprehensive Miscarriage, Stillbirth & Neonatal Death Panel is based at its very core on the work of the Human Genome Project. Begun in the 1990, the international scientific effort completed in 2003 the vast and intricate blueprint that provides the instructions for the development of a human being, according to the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nHuman DNA contains the information that determines a cell's makeup and role in the human body. Nearly every cell in a person contains a copy of the 3 billion DNA pairs that make up the human genome.\n\nThe Human Genome Project created a model, or map, of the entire sequence. That information gives medical researchers an understanding of the healthy DNA. They use that information to find defective or deficient genetic factors that contribute to diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. And miscarriages.\n\nLoss of pregnancy 'so common,' rarely discussed\n\nThousands of American families deal with a loss during pregnancy or death shortly after birth each year:\n\nMiscarriages, a pregnancy loss prior to 20 weeks, occur in anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of all clinically-recognized pregnancies, according to the American Pregnancy Association, an organization that promotes pregnancy wellness.\n\nAbout 24,000 stillbirths — defined as a loss 20 or more weeks after a woman becomes pregnant — were reported in the U.S. in 2013, or 1 percent of all pregnancies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNeonatal death refers to the death of a live-born infant before the baby is 28 days old. Precise statistics on neonatal deaths are difficult to find, but it affects about 4 million babies per year across the world, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nGuild said it wasn't until she miscarried that she learned how prevalent pregnancy losses are. After her experience, friends, relatives and colleagues began to speak to her about their experiences.\n\nIt is so common, Guild said. And it's so rarely talked about.\n\nA mother's guilt that she could be at fault is part of the reason for the taboo in discussing pregnancy loss, Allingham-Hawkins said.\n\nBut it's also often an unacknowledged loss, she said. People assume (because the baby hasn't been born) that (the mother) didn't connect with them. And that's just not true.\n\nDeveloping the test\n\nThe need for a new genetic testing panel became obvious to McPherson when she became the director of the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service Program in 2009. That medical program was developed in 1983 to provide state services to families and health care providers across the state, with a focus on assessing why stillbirths happen in Wisconsin.\n\nWhen she started working with the Wisconsin Stillbirth Service, McPherson also began to pore through the data compiled by the service, representing about 3,000 stillbirths and their causes. She looked for causes that would not be immediately apparent to an attending physician, but also were prevalent in the cases.\n\nI was searching for genetic diseases that might be missed on an autopsy, McPherson said.\n\nAbout half of early miscarriages, 25 percent of stillbirths and 20 percent of neonatal deaths can be traced back to abnormalities of the developing baby, and most of those have a genetic cause, according to PreventionGenetics.\n\nMcPherson's and Allingham-Hawkins' skills meshed together well to create the testing panel for miscarriages.\n\n\n\nAllingham-Hawkins's specialty is knowing how to create the genetic tests that find those problems.\n\nMcPherson and Allingham-Hawkins' partnership was a perfect marriage. There was a mixture of clinical expertise with technical know-how, said Christina Zaleski, the PreventionGenetics director of genetic counseling/client services.\n\nPersonal experience also motivated McPherson and Allingham-Hawkins to develop the test. Allingham-Hawkins understands full well the pain of miscarriage — she's had two.\n\nAnd just after the testing panel was completed, another PreventionGenetic colleague, Angela Gruber, a human molecular geneticist who is the director of the Specimen Processing Department, lost her child in December, four months before she was due.\n\nAs part of the grieving process, Gruber named her late child Rosemary, and she and her husband, Ben Gruber, a firefighter/paramedic, consented for Rosemary's DNA to be used to validate the testing panel and make sure it worked as designed.\n\nGruber still aches from the loss, but participating in the test development process helped ease some of the pain.\n\nKnowing that our little girl was directly involved in the validation of the test that can help so many families is comforting, Gruber said. For many families, getting an answer is closure, relief, and allows for you to be at peace with the situation.\n\nHer connection with her unborn baby led Gruber to allow a photographer to record the day Rosemary was delivered. We sang songs, read books, and continue to hold her close to our hearts, Gruber said.\n\nRosemary had trioplody, which is a chromosomal disorder which causes abnormal development and almost always causes pregnancy loss. It affects about 1 to 3 percent of all pregnancies.\n\nAt my 12-week appointment things seemed off, and I had a mother's intuition that something was wrong, Gruber said. It wasn't until our week 20 ultrasound that my fears and concerns were confirmed by a lot of life-threatening birth defects.\n\nGruber, an Auburndale native who has earned a doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, understands more than most the genetic problems that can lead to miscarriage. Plus she had the support of colleagues such as McPherson and Christina Zaleski, the PreventionGenetics director of genetic counseling/client services.\n\nEven before Gruber lost Rosemary, McPherson diagnosed trioplody. In one sense, the diagnosis was a relief.\n\nWhen we first started to realize there was something not right with our little girl, my first concern was if my husband and I were carriers for a disorder. At least we know that this most likely was a random one-off event that shouldn't be something to worry about in future pregnancies, Gruber said.\n\nEven though Gruber knew why Rosemary didn't survive, using her DNA to validate the test was a way to help others in a similar situation, Zaleski said. (There's a) passion and desire here to bring answers to families experiencing a very deep and personal loss.\n\n'A really good tool'\n\nStillbirth often happens without any warning, said Dr. Maria Mascola, a maternal and fetal medicine specialist who treats women with high-risk pregnancies for the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield. And it's not only devastating and perplexing for parents, but it's also important to them to find out why. ... That's such a natural reaction, of course.\n\nMascola estimates that she can ascertain causes for about a third to half of the stillbirths in her patients. That leaves a significant number left in doubt. The PreventionGenetics panel can help determine hard-to-find causes in those cases, Mascola said.\n\nSince learning about PreventionGenetics' panel, Mascola has ordered the testing to be done for two of her patients. She hasn't received results yet, but she believes in the process. That's because she's worked with McPherson in the past and is confident in McPherson's abilities.\n\nI don't think there's anybody better equipped than her to address this issue, Mascola said. I think she's developed a really good tool.\n\nMcPherson worked with Mascola as a geneticist with the Marshfield Clinic, and also as the director of the Wisconsin Stillbirth Project.\n\nThe Stillbirth Project is an amazing, amazing resource in helping clinicians, hospitals and patients find out the causes of stillbirths. And as the director, McPherson has expanded the knowledge base regarding miscarriages and stillbirths, helping create large databases that hospitals can use as resources, and because she has the deep genetic knowledge that doctors who specialize in obstetrics and gynecology generally don't have.\n\nGenetics is a complicated world, and is becoming more complicated each day as new discoveries are being made, Mascola said.\n\nThose new advances, such as the PreventionGenetics miscarriage panel, are life changing.\n\nKnowing what happened during a pregnancy carries the very essence of motherhood, said Sara Guild.\n\nAs a mother, it's up to you to protect that child from the moment it develops, Guild said. You're so emotionally invested from the moment of conception.\n\nKeith Uhlig can be reached at 715-845-0651 or at keith.uhlig@gannettwisconsin.com.

Fredreka Schouten and Mary Troyan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The Alabama political scandal that has cost the state's governor his marriage and now threatens his job has thrust politicians' growing use of often-secretly funded nonprofits into the spotlight.\n\nGov. Robert Bentley's former aides created the tax-exempt Alabama Council for Excellent Government last year to promote the governor's agenda, but some of its funds went to pay the governor's senior political adviser, exposed in recent weeks as his extramarital love interest. And like any other social-welfare group created under the 501(c)(4) section of the tax code, it does not have to disclose its donors.\n\nNonprofit groups have become a fixture in federal politics, allowing secret donors to pump unlimited sums into advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts in elections. But their use has spread rapidly to statehouses from Lansing, Mich., to Nashville, Tenn., and city halls from New York to Los Angeles, as another source of cash that elected officials of both parties can tap to help shape public policy.\n\nElected officials defend their use, saying nonprofits can move more nimbly than government agencies to advance civic initiatives and are less likely to draw the public's ire over using taxpayer funds for pet projects or quasi-political expenses, such as polling. Campaign-finance watchdogs, however, said they are just another way for unregulated money to seep into the political process and give big donors a back-door method to curry favor with decision makers.\n\nThe c4 world was created for social-welfare opportunities, to help hospitals and food banks and the like provide services to people, said Edwin Bender, an expert on campaign money who runs the National Institute on Money in State Politics in Helena, Mont. The fact they have morphed into political slush funds is certainly against the spirit of the (tax) code.\n\nIn Michigan, a tax-exempt group operated by Gov. Rick Snyder's supporters is helping to underwrite the Republican's public relations campaign to cope with the Flint water contamination crisis. The group, Moving Michigan Forward, discloses its donors and reported taking in nearly $300,000 during the first three months of this year. Most of the money came from another Snyder-linked non-profit, Making Government Accountable. That group does not make its donors' identities public, said Snyder spokesman Ari Adler.\n\nAsked whether the fundraising gave donors a behind-the-scenes opportunity to build relationships with the governor, Adler said: You could also look at it, though, that there are people who want to help in Flint and may not necessarily want to be out there cutting a check and making it public because they don't want the publicity.\n\nObama to visit Flint, prompted by 8-year-old's letter\n\nIn Los Angeles, Democratic Mayor Eric Garcetti helped establish a nonprofit, Mayor's Fund for Los Angeles, to raise funds for his initiatives, ranging from a public campaign to encourage city residents to reduce their water usage to a program that keeps parks and recreation centers open after dark during the summer months. It raised $14.6 million in its first full fiscal year, drawing support from philanthropic groups such as the Anheuser-Busch Foundation, to companies such as Goldman Sachs and Paramount Pictures, according to its website.\n\nGarcetti has said he has no control over the fund, which he describes on the website as a public-private partnership that enables the nimbleness of private enterprise to meet the scale of city government.\n\nThis year, allies of another big-city mayor, New York's Bill de Blasio, began disbanding Campaign for One New York, a nonprofit group created to advance his agenda on issues, such as universal pre-kindergarten. The group, whose donors have included individuals and companies with businesses before the city, had drawn sharp criticism from government watchdogs who claimed it amounted to a shadow government, operating outside of campaign-finance rules that bar corporate donations to mayoral candidates. The group discloses its donors.\n\nThe nonprofit now appears to be part of a sprawling federal and state investigation into the Democrat's fundraising practices. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that JAD Corporation of America, a company that received a New York City contract to buy its mint-scented garbage bags that repel rodents, received a subpoena from authorities looking into De Blasio's affairs. The company's owner, Joseph Dussich, had donated $100,000 to Campaign for One New York.\n\nDe Blasio has denied any wrongdoing and has said the nonprofit is shutting down because its work is done. Dussich did not return telephone calls, and an official with the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York declined comment.\n\nIn Tennessee, Gov. Bill Haslam's former campaign manager formed Tennesseans for Student Success in October 2014 to defend Haslam's education policies, including running ads supporting like-minded legislators. This year, the 501(c)(4) announced it will spend $500,000 on an aggressive ground, air and data operation to support the policies that have led Tennessee to become the fastest improving state in the nation in education and hired a field director with experience on state and federal political campaigns. It does not disclose donors.\n\nThe practice also has reached the highest levels of government.\n\nIn 2013, President Obama became the first sitting president to launch nonprofit advocacy group to lobby for his agenda. The group, Organizing for Action, reported $40.4 million in revenue during its two years of operation, according to its most recent filings with the IRS. The tax-exempt group does not accept corporate money or donations from federal lobbyists and voluntarily discloses all contributions larger than $250 on its website. OFA has advocated for everything from Obama's push to overhaul the criminal-justice system to urging the Republican-controlled Senate to take action on his Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.\n\nLike Obama, the 501(c)(4) in Alabama promoting Bentley's agenda was formed at the beginning of his second term, with two of the governor's former aides listed as incorporators. During the state legislative session that followed in early 2015, the Alabama Council for Excellent Government touted the Republican's unsuccessful $541 million tax and revenue package.\n\nDuring that same time, the group paid $15,000 to RCM Communications, a consulting firm run by Rebekah Mason, the adviser now at the heart of the scandal involving the governor. Mason resigned after recordings of their romantic phone conversations became public in March.\n\nAlabama governor took alleged paramour to formal White House dinner\n\nThe investigations have just begun into whether the arrangement — having a top adviser to the governor paid by private sources — violated Alabama's ethics laws. At least two lawsuits are seeking information about the finances of the organization, and some lawmakers are calling for Bentley's impeachment amid questions about whether state resources were misused.\n\nRebekah was paid by a campaign fund that we don't know who contributed to, and that just don't pass the smell test, said state Rep. Jim Patterson, a Republican lawmaker in Alabama who introduced legislation barring anyone paid using undisclosed, private money from working for the state.\n\nMason herself disclosed the Alabama Council for Excellent Government's payment to her consulting firm, but the group has not publicly identified any of its donors and has not fully disclosed how it has spent its money. It is run by Bentley's former legal adviser, Cooper Shattuck, who is now general counsel for the University of Alabama System.\n\nIn the wake of the Bentley scandal, Shattuck told USA TODAY that he has contacted the group's donors and none has agreed to allow their identities to be revealed. The Alabama Council for Excellent Government has not yet filed a tax return with the IRS, but Shattuck said the group has raised about $123,000 and spent almost $81,000 since March 2015.\n\nShattuck said using a tax-exempt group makes sense because it can make expenditures that help further a governor's agenda that some feel are more appropriately paid with private funds, such as polling and digital media advertising.
In an award season with no clear front-runner, Joker catapulted to the lead Monday morning. Director Todd Phillips' villainous origin story scored 11 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best actor for Joaquin Phoenix. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 1917 and The Irishman each scored 10 nods.\n\nThe 92nd annual Academy Awards, airing Feb. 9 (ABC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT), won't have a host for the second year in a row but will have plenty of excitement with a stacked best-picture race.\n\nJoker will compete against Quentin Tarantino's 1969-set L.A. fantasy Once Upon a Time, Martin Scorsese's gangster epic Irishman, Noah Baumbach's divorce drama Marriage Story, Sam Mendes' World War I thriller 1917, Bong Joon-ho's dark comedy Parasite, Greta Gerwig's coming-of-age adaptation Little Women, retro racing drama Ford v Ferrari and Taika Waititi's World War II satire Jojo Rabbit.\n\nBiggest Oscar snubs:Jennifer Lopez, Robert De Niro shut out of nominations\n\nWho's up for an Oscar?See the complete list of nominees\n\nParasite, which is in contention for the recently renamed international feature film Oscar, picked up six nominations, as did Jojo Rabbit, Marriage Story and Little Women.\n\nWith his transformative Joker role, Golden Globe winner Phoenix scored a best-actor nomination alongside Adam Driver (Marriage Story), Leonardo DiCaprio (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory) and Jonathan Pryce (The Two Popes).\n\nRenee Zellweger, who has earned stellar reviews – and a Globe win – as Judy Garland in the biopic Judy, is a favorite in the race for best actress, which also includes Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story), Saoirse Ronan (Little Women), Charlize Theron (Bombshell) and Cynthia Erivo (Harriet).\n\nOnce Upon a Time star Brad Pitt, armed with a Golden Globe win and a ton of goodwill, could be on the road to Oscar glory with a nomination for supporting actor. He'll take on the Irishman duo Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, Tom Hanks (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood) and Anthony Hopkins (The Two Popes).\n\nLaura Dern, who won the Golden Globe for supporting actress for Marriage Story, is in the Oscar category with Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Margot Robbie (Bombshell), Kathy Bates (Richard Jewell) and Florence Pugh (Little Women).\n\nErivo was the lone woman of color nominated in a predominately white acting field that also snubbed Golden Globe winner Awkwafina (The Farewell), Screen Actors Guild nominee Jamie Foxx (Just Mercy) and Globe nominee Eddie Murphy (Dolemite Is My Name).\n\nThe race for best director features Tarantino, Bong, Mendes, Scorsese and Phillips, but no women were included.\n\nGerwig scored a nomination for Little Women in adapted screenplay, a category that also features Joker, Irishman, Jojo Rabbit and The Two Popes. Up for original screenplay are Once Upon a Time, Parasite, 1917, Marriage Story and Rian Johnson's murder mystery Knives Out.\n\nFrozen II, which recently became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time, picked up a nomination for best original song (Into the Unknown) but was shut out for best animated feature, which the first hit film won in 2014. The category this year spotlights recent Globe winner Missing Link, Toy Story 4, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and a pair of Netflix films, Klaus and I Lost My Body.
Mark Curnutte\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nCINCINNATI — Amid U.S. immigration officials' efforts to send a young man thousands of miles away, he and his fiancee are trying to tie the knot.\n\nAn Ohio sheriff is blocking it.\n\nMorrow County Sheriff John L. Hinton said he will not allow the jailhouse marriage of one of his federal prisoners, Yancarlos Mendez of Springdale, to the mother of a paraplegic boy because it needs to go through U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement first.\n\nEven then, Hinton said, the decision about whether to let the marriage take place would ultimately be his.\n\nWe haven't allowed any in the past, Hinton told The Enquirer.\n\nMore:Despite social media outcry, paraplegic boy's 'Daddy' to be deported\n\nMore:Paraplegic 6-year-old's 'Daddy' faces deportation\n\nMendez, a native of the Dominican Republic with dual Spanish citizenship, has a final deportation order. However, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted a temporary stay of deportation last week to determine if it had jurisdiction, on Thursday set a schedule for going forward with the case. The dates stretch into April.\n\nIn the meantime, Mendez will remain jailed in Morrow County, north of Columbus.\n\nSandra Mendoza and Mendez have planned to get married since February, but they were consumed with the around-the-clock medical needs of her son, Ricky Solis, 6, who is paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nRicky remains hospitalized at Cincinnati Children's Hospital because of abdominal bleeding. He sustained serious bowel, bladder and colon injuries in a February auto crash. He needs surgery.\n\nAttorney Nazly Mamedova said that legal precedent exists that prevents jailers or sheriffs from denying a prisoner's legal right to marry. She said she requested permission Wednesday and was told by a deputy that the sheriff does not allow inmate marriages.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 1987 Missouri case — Turner v. Safley — that preventing inmates from marrying violates their constitutional rights. Mamedova said the precedent has been affirmed in other cases by the court that a fundamental right to marriage exists under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe sheriff said he is not aware of such case law.\n\nI'd take a look at it, Hinton said\n\nICE wants to deport Mendez because it says he violated terms of the Visa Waiver Program, which is how he entered the United States from Spain. He overstayed the 90-day visa, ICE said.\n\nHis attorneys said Mendez is the sole provider for Mendoza and Ricky and, with Mendoza, was trained to provide specialized medical care to Ricky in the family's Springdale apartment.\n\nTheirs is not the only immigration case on which the 6th Circuit has ruled in the past week. On Wednesday, it ordered the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeal to reconsider evidence in the deportation case of Maribel Trujillo-Diaz. The Fairfield mother of four was deported to Mexico in April.
Would a real Oscar front-runner please stand up?\n\nWith less than two weeks until the Academy Awards on Feb. 9 (ABC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT), it has become painfully obvious who's taking all the acting gold but not so much what's going home with the big prize: best picture. This awards season has spread the love around, giving every major film contender a time to shine and every person in an Oscar pool a chance to chew on his or her nails.\n\nThrowing other wrenches into the works: Best picture is voted on through a preferential ballot, where academy members rank their choices rather than just pick one winner, plus a voting body that is slowly getting younger and more diverse every year.\n\nBest picture:15 films that didn't deserve the Oscar – and the ones that should have won instead\n\nOscar tally: Here are the films and actors leading the race\n\nWhile one movie hasn't risen to rule them all quite yet, some have been left in the dust. The racing drama Ford v Ferrari may win some technical awards but that's it, the best chances for coming-of-age adaptation Little Women and divorce drama Marriage Story are in the screenplay categories, and the World War II satire Jojo Rabbit looms as a dark horse with key guild nominations but has yet to make a splash this season.\n\nHere are the five, though, with the right resumes to conquer the best-picture race on Oscar night:\n\n'1917'\n\nThe closest thing to a favorite is director Sam Mendes' World War I thriller, about two British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) racing to deliver orders in time to save 1,600 fellow military men. The film has had big wins at the Directors Guild Awards and Producers Guild Awards, the latter a strong predictor for the Oscars: The PGA honoree has gone on to win best picture 21 out of 30 times, including the past two years with The Shape of Water and Green Book. Also in its favor is a Golden Globe victory for best drama and an impressive box office, scoring $104 million with only a few weeks of nationwide release. One troublesome statistic remains: 1917 doesn't have an acting nomination, and only 11 films in Oscar history – most recently Slumdog Millionaire in 2009 – have won best picture without one.\n\n'Parasite'\n\nThe Oscars have gone 91 years without awarding the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' highest honor to a foreign-language film, so history is not exactly on the side of South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho's acclaimed black comedy about class and social inequality. There is real love in the industry for Parasite, however, evidenced by the crowd eruption when it snagged a surprise win for outstanding ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. With actors being the largest voting bloc in the academy, the victory – plus an honor for best drama given by the American Cinema Editors – gives Parasite momentum going forward, though like 1917, it also has the problem of no Oscar acting nominations.\n\n'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'\n\nQuentin Tarantino's star-packed Tinseltown fable – one that intertwines the lives of a washed-up actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), his steely stuntman (Brad Pitt) and the Manson Family – has been a favorite among movie lovers ever since its summer release. Once Upon a Time won best comedy at the Golden Globes and best picture at the Critics' Choice Awards, it's a strong contender in the 10 Oscar categories where it's nominated (Pitt's pretty much a lock for supporting actor and Tarantino has a good shot at original screenplay), and the Academy Awards since their inception have always adored movies about Hollywood. This one has it right in the title.\n\n'The Irishman'\n\nMartin Scorsese's Netflix gangster epic came into Oscars like a heavyweight, but like A Star Is Born last year, is starting to look like an also-ran. The film, which tracks World War II veteran and Mob hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) over multiple bloody decades, received widespread critical acclaim but has lost out on every major honor so far. Still, don't count out The Irishman yet: Crime dramas tend to do well at the Oscars (Scorsese's The Departed marked his first and only best picture in 2007), Netflix put a lot of horses behind its campaign, everyone involved is a Hollywood favorite – not only Scorsese and De Niro, but also supporting-actor nominees Al Pacino and Joe Pesci – and it could benefit from the preferential ballot if it's the second or third choice for a majority of voters.\n\n'Joker'\n\nOf course the Oscars' biggest wild card is the one with the iconic comic-book supervillain. Joaquin Phoenix seems destined to win best actor for his unnerving transformation from mentally unstable outcast to face-painted nihilist in Todd Phillips' psychological thriller origin story. The film's chances for best picture aren't as good as in other categories – such as original score and hair/makeup – but Joker leads with the most Oscar nominations (11 total). Like Irishman, it might also be helped by the preferential ballot, plus the controversial Joker has made enough money ($334.6 million domestically, $1.1 billion worldwide) that it can't be ignored.
Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith don't celebrate the day they tied the knot, which might not come as a shock to devout Red Table Talk viewers who have been privy to the highs and lows of their unique marriage.\n\nThe actors wed Dec. 31, 1997, but Pinkett Smith – who hosts the Facebook Watch series with her mom, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, and daughter, Willow Smith – said on Monday's episode the two spent the day apart.\n\nPinkett Smith said she likes to stay home on the last night of the year. Very rarely am I out and about for New Year's, she said. I like to snuggle up somewhere and just chill and kind of go inside. I do a lot of spiritual work during this time.\n\nUsually, Will on New Year's likes to be in an adventure in the world somewhere. There's no telling where he's gonna be, she said. I don't wanna be out in the world. He now has the freedom (to) go and have an awesome adventure of some kind.\n\nIt's more a life partnership, so it's not steeped in ... that day, the Girls Trip star explained. We don't really celebrate that day anymore, in that sense, because the context of our union is totally different.\n\nReflecting on 2018, Pinkett Smith appeared content with her personal life.\n\nEven with a lot of the transitions that we've made as a family, I feel like this year, everything has really come together in a beautiful, cohesive, harmonious manner, and that took a lot of work, she shared. So, it's so beautiful to just see it land, finally.\n\nOn Red Table, Pinkett Smith and Smith have spoken candidly about their 21-year union.\n\nOn a previous episode, she remembered her wedding ceremony, but not fondly. Pinkett Smith said that she didn't want to get married or have a wedding, but once she got pregnant, she felt pressured to tie the knot.\n\nI was so upset that I had to have a wedding. I was so (mad), she remembered. I went crying down the freakin' aisle getting married.\n\nOn another show, Smith talked openly about a rough patch. We broke up within our marriage and got back together again and had to rebuild with new rules and something way completely different.\n\nContributing: Anika Reed\n\nMore:Jada Pinkett Smith 'cried for 45 days straight,' husband Will Smith claims\n\nMore:Exclusive: Jada Pinkett Smith remembers Willow was destroyed by Santa truth on 'Red Table'\n\nMore:'I had a complete emotional collapse': Jada Pinkett Smith, Kid Cudi talk mental health
As David's Bridal was toppling toward Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2018, the nation's largest wedding retailer took careful steps to show it was not leaving couples at the altar.\n\nThe company made sure customers knew it wasn't planning to close stores or cancel orders, unlike Alfred Angelo Bridal, whose 2017 bankruptcy culminated in a chaotic liquidation that temporarily left many brides-to-be without dresses.\n\nDavid's Bridal succeeded in using bankruptcy to slash burdensome debt it had acquired through a private-equity buyout years ago. The chain emerged from bankruptcy with more sustainable finances on Jan. 18.\n\nBut the company's challenges aren't over. With digital threats emerging, marriage rates declining and wedding alternatives proliferating, David's Bridal is adjusting its business to stay competitive.\n\nThe company has lowered prices on many of its bridesmaids' dresses, added more plus-size options and guaranteed free one-on-one consulting for brides-to-be.\n\nDavid's Bridal CEO Scott Key recently spoke with USA TODAY Money reporter Nathan Bomey. Excerpts from their conversation (condensed and edited for space and clarity):\n\nQuestion: How did the bankruptcy affect the business? Did it leave a mark?\n\nDavid's Bridal CEO Scott Key: Relative to the other 50 or so retail bankruptcies in the last couple years, our process was very clean, highly consensual and supported by our lender group. And very quick.\n\nThe news about David's entering bankruptcy – for some people that gets interpreted as David's is going away, and that's clearly not the case. We've come out the end a much stronger company.\n\nWe had work to do in communicating that David's is here to stay and in a healthy position, and we have been doing that.\n\nQ: Did you see a measurable impact on your sales?\n\nA: That's non-public at this point, but what I would say is that it is important that we reach out to brides in the market and let them know that David's is there for them and they can trust us. This business is built on trust, and they have to know that's part of the equation.\n\nWe were clear with our brides that dresses that were on order would be delivered on time, and we were clear with our vendors that they would be paid through the process and there would be no impact to them in that regard, that our stores would remain open, that our employees would remain harmless.\n\nWe kept all of those promises.\n\nQ: So many retail bankruptcies in the lastcouple years end up in a lot of stores being closed. You didn't take that approach. Why did you choose not to take that approach, and going forward what will your store footprint look like?\n\nA: You're right, we didn't shed a bunch of stores. And that is because we're actually in an advantageous position relative to most retailers. I think our fleet in the United States is appropriately sized, and our real estate choices have been well made in terms of the economics.\n\nThat said, I believe we have a significant opportunity to improve the customer experience in our stores and have been working to do so, with early steps being the introduction of a one-to-one service model.\n\nQ: What does that entail?\n\nA: In the past, in a busy, peak period … brides-to-be might find themselves in a situation where they're sharing the attention of the associate with another bride. And that was a dissatisfier for our customers.\n\n(Now) brides have the attention of a dedicated bridal stylist.\n\nQ: Does someone have to pay for that?\n\nA: No, it's free.\n\nQ: Does that mean you had to do some hiring or shifting people around?\n\nA: We actually reworked things. We created the bridal stylist, which is the most experienced of the staff we have in stores, and then what we call a dress specialist, which handles the bridesmaids and special-occasion side of the business.\n\nQ: You've lowered prices on some of your best-selling dresses. What's happening there?\n\nA: That's true in a number of categories, but it's particularly true in bridesmaids' (dresses). It's in response to us understanding better the competitive forces in the marketplace.\n\nIf you look in the online space, where the bridesmaids' business is the most competitive, you'll find other players have … figured out how to deliver them at a lower price. To be competitive, we need to be at parity with price, and so we made those adjustments.\n\nWe also introduced a new line of product. If you were to take the good-better-best spectrum of bridesmaids' (dresses), we amplified the good end of the spectrum and made those available online.\n\nQ: Is there a figure to quantify the price difference of bridesmaids' dresses overall at David's Bridal?\n\nA: No. I would say it's taken on case by case. Some were priced perfectly, some were perhaps north of what's competitive, and in some instances there might be some that were below.\n\nQ: Is it correct to say you're offering more, larger sizes now?\n\nA: It's not as much about the size run itself as it is the number of choices that are available in those sizes. David's is an open and inclusive brand, and we support many women with plus-sized needs and petite-sized needs.\n\nWhen a plus-sized woman would visit our store, she would likely be able to try on a dress in her size, which is different than the experience if she visited (a) boutique, but it might not be the dress she wanted.\n\nBasically we are … supporting women of all sizes and giving them an opportunity to try on a dress in their size.\n\nQ: Are you concerned at all about this surge of online competition and the effect it could have on your business?\n\nA: If you look at market share today, the reality is that the majority of the units and the sales happen in physical retail locations. But as is true of every other category of retail, that will change over time.\n\nWe see that first pivot happening in the bridesmaids' category, but over time that will shift into the gown, too.\n\nSo we are very focused on improving our digital customer experience and have a project going on that front.\n\nThink of online as the future and stores as the present. That said, the vast majority of research happens online. So between social channels like Pinterest and Instagram, that's where the bride gets inspiration and research from.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Not all triumphs come with a medal.\n\nGus Kenworthy leaves the Pyeongchang Olympics empty-handed, failing to land a run in the slopestyle final Sunday. But his heart is full, knowing what he did here is far bigger than sport. In the evolution of societal attitudes toward gays and lesbians, Kenworthy and Adam Rippon's participation here will be a watershed moment.\n\nIt's not simply that they are the first openly gay athletes to represent the United States at the Winter Olympics. It's that they became two of the biggest American stars at these Games simply by being their authentic selves.\n\nThe only way to really change perceptions, break down homophobia, break down barriers is through representation, Kenworthy said Sunday afternoon.\n\nMore:Adam Rippon will work for NBC as a correspondent\n\nMore:Nick Goepper, Gus Kenworthy can inspire others by sharing stories\n\nFour years ago, Kenworthy wanted so badly to kiss his then-boyfriend after winning the silver medal in Sochi, but couldn't work up the nerve to do it. He hadn't come out yet, either publicly or to his family, and he was petrified of the reaction.\n\nNone of that crossed his mind Sunday when he kissed boyfriend Matt Wilkas before his first run, a moment shown during NBC's prime-time coverage.\n\nIt's positive. It's great. The exposure to that is a great thing for our community, Wilkas said. But, also, part of me thinks, `Well, big deal.' It was the tiniest kiss in the world.\n\nBut there are still places in the world where daring to be yourself is dangerous, where being gay can get you killed. There are politicians in our own country, the president and vice president chief among them, who view members of the LGBTQ community as being somehow less, and promote policies that have no other objective than to marginalize them.\n\nSo to see Kenworthy and his boyfriend act like any other couple, to be treated like any heterosexual couple, it speaks volumes. So, too, to see Rippon being embraced from Hollywood to the heartland.\n\nIt tells bigots whose hate is rooted in fear and ignorance that gays and lesbians pose no threat. It tells children who are gay and worried about what that will mean for them that they're OK and their sexuality will not define or limit them.\n\nIt is yet one more step in the road to true equality.\n\nTo see somebody like this who is unashamed, unafraid … it's game-changing. It's life-changing. It's reaffirming, said Tyler Oakley, a YouTube host and LGBTQ activist who has become friends with Kenworthy and called him and Rippon possibility models.\n\nTo see somebody celebrated when they're often used to being disenfranchised, it's a flip of the script.\n\nWhile Kenworthy and Rippon are proud of who they are and are willing standard bearers for the LGBTQ community, they look forward to the day when their sexual orientation is irrelevant. When they, or those who follow them, are known as athletes who happen to be gay rather than gay athletes.\n\nBut for that day to come, society will have to rid itself of its prejudices and fears. And there is no better way to speed that process along than when people like Kenworthy and Rippon are embraced by mainstream America.\n\nGus was worried before he came out that he would lose his fan base, said his father, Peter. I said, `You never know. You might gain a whole other fan base.' Which is exactly what happened.\n\nIt's worth remembering that, during the Sochi Games, gay marriage was still about a year and a half from being legal throughout the United States. Attitudes have undergone a significant shift since then, as more and more people realize just how conventional gays and lesbians are.\n\nThey are accountants and bricklayers, teachers and clergy, actors and attorneys. They are moms and dads, husbands and wives. They are your family members, co-workers, neighbors and friends.\n\nAnd, yes, they are people to be emulated and cheered.\n\nI was trying to remind myself that win or lose, I still have a lot to be proud of, Kenworthy said.\n\nKenworthy leaves these Games without a medal, but he won something much bigger. More tolerance and acceptance, both for himself and the entire LGBTQ community.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.
WASHINGTON – As President Joe Biden tells it, the nuns who taught the future president based their religious instruction on the Gospel of Matthew: Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\n\nThat tenet was echoed during his first days in office, when Biden signed orders to ensure fair treatment for marginalized groups on housing and other issues.\n\nWe're all God's children, Biden said. We should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves.\n\nAnother of his earliest actions strengthened anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. On Thursday, Biden was expected to sign a memorandum to protect the rights of LGBTQ people worldwide, including providing protections to gay and lesbian refugees and asylum seekers.\n\nBut what to Biden is an advancing equity agenda grounded in his deep Catholic faith appears to some Christian conservatives as attacks on their own intensely held beliefs that will unravel the religious freedom protections championed by the Trump administration. Those protections treated religious beliefs as paramount, even if they conflicted with another person's rights – to an abortion, to marry a person of the same sex, or to be transgender.\n\nIt absolutely is a direct conflict with Trump's approach, said history professor John Fea, author of Believe Me: The Evangelical Road to Donald Trump.\n\nStark contrast to Trump White House\n\nBiden, only the second Catholic president, has brought to the White House a different approach to faith, both personally and through policy.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden regularly attends church. His Catholicism has played as large a role in his life as his outsized family Bible did at his inauguration. Biden wears his son's rosary beads, made the sign of the cross when paying his respects to fallen Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick Tuesday, and quotes Bible passages.\n\nThe contrast couldn't be starker, said John Carr, co-director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University. We're going from one of the least overtly religious presidents in modern times to one of the most overtly religious presidents in recent history.\n\nThe difference is already clear in policy.\n\nTrump was a hero to the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns running homes for the elderly, which challenged the federal requirement that insurance plans cover birth control. At Trump's renominating convention, a nun from the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary questioned Biden's religion and called Trump the most pro-life president.\n\nBiden is praised by Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of Network Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention about caring for all of God's creations. She's thrilled by Biden's efforts to expand health care coverage, address racism and reverse Trump's anti-immigration actions.\n\nOne of the ways that he's living out his faith is by centering the issues of equity at the heart of his administration, which I find super-exciting, she said. It's never happened before.\n\nAdvancing the 'common good'\n\nBiden has not yet announced a faith-based adviser or created a faith outreach office. But he has declared that advancing equity has to be everyone's job.\n\nBiden's focus on the common good is a central concept of the centuries-old Catholic social tradition, Massimo Faggioli wrote in the new book Joe Biden and Catholicism in the United States.\n\nIn remarks to the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, Biden said his faith provides hope and solace, clarity and purpose.\n\nIt shows the way forward, as one nation in a common purpose, to respect one another, to care for one another, to leave no one behind, he said.\n\nNational Prayer Breakfast:Biden urges a turn to faith at event notable for absence of Trump\n\nBut Biden's emphasis on social justice issues over social policy flashpoints like abortion mirrors an ongoing struggle in the Catholic Church between Pope Francis, with his pastoral approach, and the church's more conservative wing. (A photo of Biden with Francis was among the personal photos arrayed behind Biden when, sitting at his desk in the Oval Office, he took steps last week to expand health insurance access and to allow federally funded family planning groups to provide or refer patients for abortion services.)\n\nWe are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health insurance status, or immigration status, Biden said in a joint statement with Vice President Kamala Harris last month recognizing the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that affirmed the right to an abortion.\n\nFar from creating a more equitable society, Christian conservatives say, Biden's actions are reverse discrimination – particularly his first-day move to ensure workplace and other protections for people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nWith a stroke of a pen, President Joe Biden has turned 50-year-old civil rights legislation on its head, hollowing out protections for people of faith, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said in a statement.\n\nTrump's strongest supporters\n\nWhite evangelical Protestants were Trump's strongest supporters, according to the Pew Research Center. That's despite Trump having been one of the least religious to ever run for the presidency.\n\nBut Trump promised on the 2016 campaign trail that the first priority of my administration will be to preserve and protect our religious liberty. Religious freedom became a signature issue of both his domestic and foreign policy.\n\nRecent cultural and demographic changes have made evangelicals feel not only that the idea of America as a Christian nation is under siege but that their own liberty is being threatened, said Fea, who teaches history at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pa.\n\nTrump provided the kind of fighter, the strong man, to protect their interests, he said.\n\nThe feeling of both loss and victimization is reflected in Pew Research Center surveys. In a 2019 poll, a majority of adults who identify with or lean toward the GOP said that religion is losing influence in American life and that this is a bad thing. A 2020 survey suggests that Republicans who have experienced some form of harassment online are more likely than Democrats to say they believe their religion was a reason.\n\nWe live in a time when the freedom of religion is under assault, then-Vice President Mike Pence told Liberty University graduates in 2019. During the Trump administration, Pence's strong faith-based views on abortion and homosexuality made him a target of Democratic criticism, including from those seeking the party's 2020 presidential nomination. Biden had to backtrack after being lambasted by progressives and LGBTQ activists for calling Pence a decent guy.\n\nThere is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President, Biden tweeted.\n\nBiden's own positions on gay marriage and abortion evolved over the years. After voting to block federal recognition of same-sex marriages 16 years earlier, he backed legalizing gay marriage in 2012 – jumping out ahead of President Barack Obama in his announcement.\n\nBiden has become a strong supporter of Roe v. Wade and, in 2019, reversed his support for a longstanding provision that bans federal funding for most abortions.\n\nRabbi Hara Person, head of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, said she's encouraged that Biden is not imposing his faith-based opposition to abortion on others.\n\nReligious liberty means not only freedom to practice our faith as we see fit, but it's also freedom from having the religious views of others imposed on us, she said. That was something that was really missing these last four years.\n\nCarr, of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, said he backed Biden, in spite of Biden's going along with the extremism of the Democratic Party on abortion.\n\nI think character matters, competence matters and treating people with respect matters, Carr said. Lifting up the poor and vulnerable matters, and Trump failed those tests for me.\n\nBut Carr is waiting to see what Biden will prioritize.\n\nIs it going to be overcoming COVID, bringing us together, caring for creation? Or is it going to be sort of a culture war? he asked. I think what Biden campaigned on, and who he is, is pursuing justice in unity – not a culture war agenda.\n\nCarr, who in a former role with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops helped develop their documents on political responsibilities of Catholics, recently organized a discussion of how Biden's Catholicism affects his presidency and the role its playing in the divide within the church.\n\nThe split was highlighted when Pope Francis' congratulatory message to Biden on Inauguration Day emphasized respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable, and those who have no voice.\n\nIssuing his own statement, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops warned that Biden has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.\n\nOf deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences, wrote Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez.\n\nBiden's presidency could contribute to the difficult realignment of American Catholicism with Pope Francis's vision – a process resisted by `culture war' bishops since the time of Francis's election, but also interrupted by Trump, Faggioli wrote in his book on Biden and Catholicism. The mere possibility of such a realignment will being a lot of attention to this particular Catholic moment.\n\nMore broadly, there's a stark divide along religious lines on whether people see the United States as having an essential culture and values that immigrants take on or whether it's a nation made up of many cultures and values that change as new people arrive, according to Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life.\n\nWhite Christians – including white evangelical Protestants and white mainline Catholics – believe the U.S. has a central culture, surveys show. The majority of everyone else believe culture and values adjust, Cox said.\n\nThat's a fundamentally different conception of the country and where it ought to be headed, Cox said.\n\nBiden will have to take that into account as he tries to weave together the disparate groups that make up his coalition and fulfill a central campaign promise – one that's also rooted in his faith – of bringing the country together.\n\nI think, Cox said, that's really going to be challenge.

Sam Mendes scored a major awards-season victory when he won best director at Sunday's Golden Globes, and he followed it on Tuesday with a key honor from his peers.\n\nThe 1917 filmmaker has been nominated by the Directors Guild of America for outstanding directorial achievement in feature film for 2019.\n\nQuentin Tarantino, whose Once Upon a Time in Hollywood took best screenplay and comedy/musical at the Globes, is also in the field at the 72nd annual DGA Awards. Tarantino snagged nominations in 1995 for Pulp Fiction and in 2010 for Inglourious Basterds.\n\nJoining Tarantino and Mendes are Martin Scorsese (The Irishman), who won the DGA prize in 2007 for The Departed, and first-time nominees Bong Joon-ho (Parasite) and Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit).\n\nPGA Awards:'Joker,' 'The Irishman,' 'Knives Out' receive film nominations\n\nBAFTA:'Joker' leads with 11 nominations, 'Irishman,' 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' follow\n\nNotable snubs include Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story), Todd Phillips (Joker), Pedro Almodovar (Pain and Glory) and Greta Gerwig (Little Women).\n\nThe DGA Awards are often a strong bellwether for the Academy Awards. In three of the past four years, four of the five nominees also landed Oscar nominations for best director. And since 2014, every DGA winner also won the Academy Award: Alfonso Cuaron for Gravity (2014), Alejandro G. Iñárritu for Birdman (2015) and The Revenant (2016), Damien Chazelle for La La Land (2017), Guillermo del Toro for The Shape of Water (2018) and Cuaron last year for Roma. Since 2000, only six films have won the DGA but failed to win the best-picture Oscar; in that same time period, there have only been three instances when the DGA winner hasn't also won the best-director Oscar.\n\nThe category for outstanding achievement by a first-time filmmaker features Mati Diop (Atlantics), Alma Har'el (Honey Boy), Melina Matsoukas (Queen & Slim), Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz (The Peanut Butter Falcon) and Joe Talbot (The Last Black Man in San Francisco).\n\nWinners will be announced Jan. 25 at the Ritz-Carlton in Los Angeles.

Adam Rippon isn't a hulking football player like Michael Sam. He's not a 7-foot basketball center like Jason Collins. He's dissimilar from Robbie Rogers, a soccer player whose recent retirement from MLS left zero openly gay men in major professional sports in the U.S.\n\nThe fact that he happens to have come out as gay and did so as an active athlete is about the only thing that links Rippon to some of the more masc sports figures who courageously came out over the years — and that's part of his appeal.\n\nI think it's huge that he does not project the way other professional athletes have when it comes to masculinity, Anthony Nicodemo, a high school basketball coach in New York and LGBTQ activist, told USA TODAY Sports. He marches to the beat of his own drum the way somebody like Michael (Sam) and Jason (Collins) didn't. They fit that piece of masculinity we have come to expect in sports being big and strong. Adam doesn't fit into that box.\n\nRippon became the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics and the first out figure skater overall to medal as he aided Team USA's bronze medal finish at the free skate competition Monday. Eric Radford then became the first openly gay figure skater to win an Olympic gold medal as he and Meagan Duhamel helped Canada win the team figure skating event.\n\nThere are 15 LGBTQ athletes competing in Pyeongchang -- including Rippon and Gus Kenworthy (skiing) from Team USA --- per Outsports.com. There were seven in Sochi four years ago.\n\nIt's an awesome time, Mason Darrow, who came out in 2015 while a member of Princeton's football team, told USA TODAY Sports. For the lack of a better word, it's a gay Olympics. I think it's (a) really nice change of pace.\n\nRippon, 28, certainly hasn't shied from embracing who he is on the international stage -- and that included criticizing Vice President Mike Pence's views on the LGBT issues in an interview with USA TODAY Sports last month.\n\nBeing here at the Olympics does give me a louder voice, Rippon said earlier this week. It has given me a platform. It's given me a voice to reach to young kids. I've gotten so many messages I could even get emotional thinking about it, but I've gotten so many messages from young kids all over the country that my story's resonated with them. It's incredibly powerful this platform that you can have at the Olympic Games.\n\nRippon declined to speak with Pence, who attended the opening ceremony last week, before the figure skating competition began, USA TODAY Sports' Christine Brennan reported.\n\nThe bravery and courage he has is amazing, Austin Parrish, a former swimmer who came out in high school before competing collegiately at Eastern Illinois, told USA TODAY Sports. I personally love that he is taking on Mike Pence. I'm from Indiana, where Pence was my governor while I was a college athlete. I never felt supported by the politicians of Indiana or the support for being an openly gay athlete. The way Pence rejected marriage equality in Indiana brought several emotions to the surface.\n\nRippon has regularly -- on social media and in interviews -- talked about what it means to be an openly gay elite athlete.\n\nBeing true to who you are and not giving a (expletive) about what others think about you is an awesome and liberating thing whether you are gay or not, Rippon wrote on Twitter earlier this week. Sometimes we the gays need to be reminded more often but, LIKE, EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT, FOR REAL. JUST DO IT.\n\nRippon is hardly the first gay male figure skater, a sport that has seen gold medalist Brian Boitano, Rudy Galindoand NBC broadcaster Johnny Weir among the American skaters who have come out. However, they made that choice later in their careers or after their respective retirements.\n\nI definitely had that fantasy about being a figure skater when I was a young gay kid, said Darrow, who now works for the Cleveland Indians. I think most young gay boys did something of the sort. I think Adam is definitely easier to relate to on that front than somebody like a (football player) like I was.\n\nRippon scored 87.95 in the short program Thursday night, putting him 7th out of 21 competitors and tops among the three Team USA skaters. He remains a long shot to medal in the men's individual competition as the free skate takes place Friday night, although Nicodemo said much of LGBTQ community has taken in and appreciated all that Rippon has accomplished so far.\n\nThe interesting thing with Adam is that he's been embraced by the LGBT majority more than most out athletes, Nicodemo said. I think he's a lot of us who go brunching on Sundays and wear glitter. They see themselves in Adam even if they can't skate.\n\nFollow A.J. Perez on Twitter @byajperez
2021 is starting off with a big-time celebrity shake-up: Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West are getting divorced.\n\nIndeed, according to Page Six, the A-list couple have finally called it quits after six years, four children, and who knows how many disagreements about where to spend their time, energy, and celebrity capital.\n\nAccording to reports, Kardashian West is intent on continuing to work on her prison reform project, while West's political ambitions (including a fanciful bid for the Oval Office) have kept him rather busy, too. Another source says West has become increasingly frustrated with the Kardashian family's reality TV star lifestyle. Alas, there also seems to be the issue of West's mental state, which can test the strongest of unions.\n\nBut what inquiring minds really want to know is this: How will their massive real estate holdings be divided?\n\nJennifer Lenz, a real estate agent at Dolly Lenz Real Estate in New York City, has been privy to many high-profile splits and shares that divorce settlement details typically hinge on the prenups and other contractual obligations that were in place before the marriage.\n\nHowever, most prenup terms well exceed the final settlement in order to get a signoff on the divorce, and the properties are divvied up to avoid the appearance of a fire sale, she says.\n\nFor example, one billionaire couple that Lenz's firm worked with had a $10 million prenup, but the ex-wife was able to get a $60 million settlement to secure her signature — which included two homes and seed money to start her new business venture.\n\nIn the case with Kardashian West and West, however, money like this is probably no big object. Kardashian West is the richest of her famous family, and the couple's combined wealth exceeds $3 billion, which means dividing the properties they share might take on more meaning.\n\nBut California divorces sometimes turn out to be quite equitable as all assets acquired during the marriage are to be divided 50/50. In community property states, like California, division of homes purchased while together belong to both parties and are divided equally as well, says Bruce Ailion, a real estate agent in the Atlanta metro area.\n\nSo, looking at Kardashian West and West's biggest real estate assets, here's how we think the properties will be divided.\n\nHidden Hills estate: Kardashian West\n\nThe Hidden Hills, CA, home of Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West Google Maps\n\nFirst up, the couple's mansion in the star-studded community of Hidden Hills in Los Angeles, which was purchased for $20 million in 2014. Kardashian West reportedly wants to own it outright since this is the one place their children are settled into and call home. It's also near her mother Kris Jenner's home and her sister Kourtney Kardashian's place.\n\nCourts want to minimize the impact of divorce on the couple's children, so often this means the custodial spouse will retain use of the marital residence, says Ailion.\n\nBefore (left) and after shots of a hallway in the Hidden Hills, CA Realtor.com/Kanye West\n\nThe sticking point? It seems that Kardashian West owns the land in and around the house, but the actual structure belongs to her soon-to-be ex. Complicated!\n\nThe couple also reportedly poured a ton of cash (upward of $20 million) into an extensive renovation over the years. West engaged the exclusive Belgian designer Axel Vervoordt to handle the rehab and installed a completely white, monastic-style aesthetic throughout the home. Should Kardashian West take it over, it's possible she might rip out some of the cold marble and make it a bit homier.\n\nSince West oversaw the redesign and owns the home, a sensible compromise would be for him to keep it and for her to build on the surrounding land for herself and stay in the home via some type of rent-back until the project is done, says Cedric Stewart, a real estate agent with Keller Williams Capital Properties in Washington, DC.\n\nWyoming ranch: West\n\nKimye's ranch sits on 9,000 acres near Cody, WY. realtor.com\n\nSomehow we just don't see Kardashian West feeling at home in a very remote part of Wyoming — so Monster Lake Ranch, purchased in fall 2019, seems to have West's name written all over it.\n\nThe Wyoming property will go to Kanye as this is where he plans to build his technology, design, and innovation epicenter, says Stewart.\n\nThe spot, which features two houses, eight cabins, plus several barns and corrals for horses, will require a herculean effort to transform it into a livable space for a celebrity of West's level. Not only is the Wyoming ranch pretty much in the middle of nowhere, but transporting contractors and all the materials needed to build in a barren part of the country is a giant headache.\n\nWest's plans for this compound apparently include a 10-bedroom, 52,000 square-foot mansion and two 10,000-square-foot underground garages, which will likely run him into the $50 million range, according to real estate experts.\n\nThe upside for West: The spot is extremely quiet and private (no paparazzi for miles).\n\nThe house next door to Hidden Hills: Kardashian West\n\nThe couple purchased this ranch home in 2019. realtor.com\n\nThis fixer-upper ranch home isn't exactly posh, but it's directly next door to the couple's Hidden Hills compound, bringing their total property ownership in this area to 8 acres. They bought it in 2019 for $3 million and apparently had plans to create a guest compound here and live off the land, growing organic vegetables and fruit.\n\nThis property sports four bedrooms, a pool, and gardens, plus a horse barn and corral. Since this one is also close to some Kardashian family members, we bet it'll slide her way.\n\n2 acres in La Quinta, CA: West\n\nLast up, an undeveloped 2-acre parcel with a whopping price tag of $6.3 million. The plot was quietly purchased through a trust at the end of 2019.\n\nLocated two hours from Los Angeles in La Quinta's Madison Club (a golf and tennis community), this area is a playground for the ultrarich and famous. It's also close to the location of the Coachella music festival where West performed in 2019, so we're moving this property to his portfolio.\n\nHowever, both Kris Jenner and Kardashian's little sister Kylie Jenner have homes nearby, so this particular real estate holding might cause a tussle in the end.
It's been said that behind every great man is a great woman. In Prince Harry's case, it's three wealthy and media-savvy women.\n\nOn Saturday, Buckingham Palace announced a deal had been reached for Harry and Meghan Markle to relinquish their official duties as members of the British royal family. They have agreed not to use His/Her Royal Highness, and will repay the state the costs of renovating their U.K. base, Frogmore Cottage. But they're now free to pursue their own business opportunities overseas.\n\nIn a statement, Queen Elizabeth said she was proud of how quickly Meghan had become one of the family, adding: Following many months of conversations and more recent discussions, I am pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.\n\n Netflix would give the Sussexes a platform of 158 million paid subscribers and be a coup for the streaming service. \n\nLast week, the couple announced they work to become financially independent and live between U.K. and North America. Free from the ribbon-cutting duties of royal life, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on the brink of becoming a global-media power couple, with or without their royal titles. Their Instagram FB, +2.02% account has 10.9 million followers, adding 700,000 in one week.\n\nPearson said that the couple — stripped of their ability to use HRH on their website and products — will do their best to leverage their fame and royal connections in the U.S. to build a personal brand much like Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and as Markle previously did with TIG. (Forbes recently named reality TV star Kylie Jenner, 22, the youngest self-made billionaire ever.)\n\nHarry receives an income from his father Prince Charles. Harry, who is already worth several million dollars, owes his fortune to three famous women: his mother, the late Princess Diana, who became a global superstar; his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who steered the royals into the 20th and 21s Centuries, and his wife, Meghan Markle, an American-born self-made former actress.\n\nAlso see: Queen Elizabeth's statement on Harry and Meghan: 'We would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family'\n\nMultiple newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph in the U.K., have reported that the queen was disappointed with the surprise announcement, and had asked the Sussexes to hold off on issuing a statement. When The Sun newspaper published a front-page story that the couple was contemplating a move to Canada, the Sussexes pushed the button on their statement.\n\nQuestions now linger over whether they will qualify for armed security if they live in Canada, a member of the British Commonwealth, or the U.S. Markle previously lived in Toronto, where she still has a home, and Los Angeles. Their HRH titles would certainly have burnished their personal brands and commercial appeal, but they will remain the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nNetflix says it's open to talks with the Sussexes\n\nTed Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, said he would be interested in speaking to the Sussexes about working together. Speaking at an event in Los Angeles over the weekend, he told the Press Association: Who wouldn't be interested? Yes, sure. Harry and Meghan will no longer be working members of the royal family after April, and will split their time between the U.K. and North America.\n\nHarry is friends with former U.S. president Barack Obama, and will consider adopting the Obamas' post-White House career model, some royal observers say. Barack and Michelle Obama reportedly signed an eight-figure deal with Netflix NFLX, +0.73% to produce high-brow historical, biographical and social-justice programming with their company, Higher Ground Productions.\n\n 'One of the reasons they broke off from the royals is, in part, because they want to build their own brand.'  — —Ashley Pearson, an American-born writer based in London\n\nNetflix would give the Sussexes a platform of 158 million paid subscribers and be a coup for the streaming service, which won critical praise for, The Crown, chronicling the life of Queen Elizabeth. (Netflix did not respond to request for comment.) Harry has already participated in a documentary on mental health with Oprah Winfrey, a friend of the couple, for Apple TV AAPL, +1.27% .\n\nThe media mogul responded to reports that she had helped the Sussexes navigate and negotiate their #Megxit — as the royal scandal has been described in the U.K. press, a riff on #Brexit, the U.K.'s protracted exit from the European Union. Meg and Harry do not need my help figuring out what is best for them, Oprah said in a statement, according to The New York Post.\n\nAshley Pearson, an American-born writer based in London who has been a royal commentator for two decades, said their powerful political and media connections will serve them well. She sees them leveraging their circle of boldfaced names: Their kind of lifestyle costs a fortune. However, one of the reasons they broke off from the royals is, in part, because they want to build their own brand.\n\n 'You know she does voiceovers? You seem surprised. But, yeah, she's really interested.'  — —Prince Harry speaking to Disney CEO Bob Iger at the opening of 'The Lion King' in London in July 2019.\n\nPearson believes Markle is the driving force to break free from the House of Windsor, suggesting that — despite the privileges of royal life — the negative press coverage was too much to bear. She had no idea how un-glamorous it really is to be a royal and, when she found out she would be a civil servant in a tiara she was, like, 'No way.' The couple's website is similar in tone to Obama.org.\n\nThe Sussexes have already cut their teeth in broadcast media. In 2017, Harry interviewed Barack Obama when he was the guest editor of BBC Radio 4's Today program and, last year, ITV in the U.K. broadcast Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, which aired in the U.S. on ABC DIS, -1.28% Another route: The Obamas reportedly inked a book deal for more than $65 million.\n\nIn a recently resurfaced video, as Meghan greeted Beyonce and Jay Z in a line at the opening of the movie The Lion King in London last July, Prince Harry told Disney chairman and chief executive Bob Iger, You know she does voiceovers? Iger responded, Oh, really? Ah, I did not know that, and laughed. Harry responded, You seem surprised. But, yeah, she's really interested.\n\nNetflix is broadly unchanged at $339.7 over the last 12 months. However, Disney rose by 30% to $144.5 and Apple is up 103% at $318.5 over the same period, both outperforming the overall market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% is up 18.8% at 29,348.10 over the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% increased 24.7% at 3,329.62.\n\nMeghan Markle was already a self-made millionaire\n\nWhile the couple's break for the border releases them from the drab ribbon-cutting, handshaking daily duties of royal life in the U.K., and should better shield themselves from the jaundiced coverage they have received at the hands of the British tabloids, their bid for financial independence is somewhat more complicated and will not require them to take up full-time jobs.\n\nFor a start, they will keep their U.K. base, Frogmore Cottage, their historic Grade II-listed house in Windsor, which was renovated for 2.4 British pounds ($3 million) by the British taxpayer. They have already built a strong royal/celebrity personal brand, breaking the traditional mold of the royal family. Their 2018 wedding was an unusual mixture of Hollywood and English aristocracy.\n\n 'Harry & Meghan: An African Journey' aired in the U.S. on ABC and was sold to several networks around the world. \n\nHarry, 35, on the other hand, inherited a sizable fortune after the death of his mother. He inherited approximately 7 million British pounds ($9.2 million) from his mother's estate, the BBC estimated. His father's side of the family is far richer — worth more than $88 billion, according to Forbes — including investments, properties, castles and land.\n\nHarry, 35, on the other hand, inherited a sizable fortune after the death of his mother. He inherited approximately 7 million British pounds ($9.2 million) from his mother's estate, the BBC estimated. His father's side of the family is far richer — worth more than $88 billion, according to Forbes — including investments, properties, castles and land.\n\nTo be fair, Harry also reportedly earned an annual salary of $45,000 when he served as an officer in the Army Air Corps and approximately $52,000 a year while working as a helicopter pilot for the Army Air Corps, according to separate estimates by Forbes and Fortune magazines based on publicly available figures for salaries in the U.K. army.\n\nHarry also has had a military career on the front lines. Prince Harry served in the Army for ten years, rising to the rank of Captain and undertaking two tours of Afghanistan, according to Buckingham Palace. He continues to work in support of his fellow servicemen, promoting support for wounded men and women as they adapt to life post-injury.\n\nAlso see: This entrepreneur landed funding from a male venture capitalist — but she told him to take a hike after he texted her nude selfies\n\nThe Sussexes rely on Prince Charles — first in line to the British throne — for approximately 95% of their income. Prince Charles earns $23 million a year from the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate with more than $1.3 billion in assets. The Duchy's financial accounts reveal a total income for fiscal 2017 of 37.2 million British pounds ($48.7 million), up 2.5% on the previous year.\n\nChoosing Toronto or Vancouver as their overseas residence may make more financial sense than, say, L.A. or New York. In Canada, they are close enough to the U.S. without becoming embroiled in complex web of American tax law. Canada, for instance, does not impose a capital gains tax for homes that increase in value.\n\nMarkle lived there while filming Suits, and the couple spent the holidays in Canada, reportedly at a waterfront mansion on Vancouver Island. As Canada is part of the U.K. Commonwealth, it may be required to pay for security for the couple and their son, Archie. (Of possible interest for other couples moving there: Canadian divorce law generally splits all new marital wealth equally.)\n\nThey will hope to take control of their public brand\n\nHarry's late mother, Princess Diana — who died at 36 in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by photographers — had long battled the relentless, prying eyes of the British red tops, which dissected her every move in the years following her 1981 marriage to Prince Charles, and 1996 divorce. She had reportedly long dreamed of starting a new life in the U.S.\n\nIn a widely circulated article, Ellie Hall, a Buzzfeed reporter, compared Kate's morning sickness cure? Prince William gifted with an avocado for pregnant Duchess with Meghan Markle's beloved avocado linked to human rights abuse and drought, millennial shame, in the Express. The contrasting headlines appeared in the same papers and, sometimes, with the same bylines.\n\n Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, had reportedly long said she dreamed of starting anew overseas. \n\nTwo more appearing in the Daily Mail went thus, Hall reported. Kate and Wills Inc: Duke and Duchess secretly set up companies to protect their brand — just like the Beckhams and, A right royal cash in! How Prince Harry and Meghan Markle trademarked over 100 items from hoodies to socks SIX MONTHS before split with monarchy — with new empire worth up to £400m.\n\nMarkle flew back to Canada earlier this month amid reports she was driven out by, among other things, press coverage regarded as both overtly and covertly racist. Highlighting 20 headlines, Buzzfeed pointed to the different standards used to report on Kate Middleton — wife of Prince William, second in line to the British throne — and Markle, from child-rearing to eating avocado.\n\nMarkle acknowledged that she had a difficult time adapting to life with the often critical media attention in the U.K. I've really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I've tried, I've really tried, I think that what that does internally is probably really damaging, she said. The biggest thing that I know is that I never thought this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair.\n\nThe Queen acknowledged the difficulties in her statement Saturday: I recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life, her statement read, adding, It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.\n\nThere appears to push back from Harry's circle to the avalanche of press in the U.K. criticizing the couple's decision. Writing in The Sunday Times, Tom Bradby, a friend of Harry's who directed a documentary about the couple in Africa last year, said Buckingham Palace claimed to be blindsided by the couple's announcement, but Bradby threw doubt on the palace line.\n\nBradby wrote that Harry was asked by senior members of the royal family to write a plan to move away. He was reluctant, on the grounds that such documents normally leak, Bradby wrote in a 1,600-word essay, Escape from the poisonous palace. He was persuaded and did as he was asked. (Buckingham Palace did not respond to a request for comment from MarketWatch.)\n\nThe document, or its details, was shortly afterwards leaked to The Sun, Bradby added. He said the Sussexes had long faced unpleasantness from the family, saying some members were jealous and, at times, unfriendly, although excluded Queen Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh from that assessment. The fallout began at the time of the wedding in 2018.\n\nSpeaking to Bradby for his documentary last year, she thanked him for asking how she was, and said not many people had asked if she were OK. In his essay Sunday, Bradby wrote that some members of the family (with the exception of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh) were jealous and, at times, unfriendly: Really damaging things were said and done. The atmosphere soured hard and early.\n\n(This story was originally published on Jan. 8 and was updated on Jan. 19.)

There's something extra special about the holiday season when you're a parent, watching your kids excitedly open presents and enjoy quality time with extended family. But, of course, that's just half the story. On the other side of that coin is the financial stress of having to buy those gifts and coordinate travel to meet that extended family.\n\nAnd, honestly, the holidays are the least of your financial worries with kids. The latest estimates put the average cost of raising one child at $233,610. And an estimated one-third of American families devote at least 20% of their annual income to child care. These stats can feel pretty daunting for those of us already grappling with other major financial commitments.\n\nIt's safe to say that millennials are juggling more financial priorities and hurdles than prior generations, says Certified Financial Planner Natalie Colley of Francis Financial. These hurdles include paying off student loans and credit card debt to struggling to accumulate enough savings to one day buy a home.\n\nRead: Are kids a good investment? Will they make you happier?\n\nIndeed, in a July New York Times survey, about a quarter of millennials said they'll have fewer children than they'd hoped because of the high costs associated with parenthood.\n\nAs a millennial with a mortgage, student debt and a fluctuating income, I can relate to that stress—but it didn't stop me from starting a family nearly three years ago. While it may not make financial sense, my husband and I make it work. Because, like anything worth having, some sacrifices are necessary in the pursuit of bigger dreams.\n\nWe've only just begun our journey of balancing parenthood and financial goals, but it's been a real crash course, especially now that we have two kids under the age of 3. Here are some lessons we've learned so far.\n\nThere's no perfect time to have a baby\n\nI got married at 20, so there was no urgency to rush into parenthood. Instead, we spent the first years of marriage finishing college, enjoying (a little) disposable income and buying a house. But did we manage to check everything off our financial to-do list before having our first kid? Not even close.\n\nAlso see: How overparenting in America has created a generation of snowflakes\n\nWe still have student loan payments topping $800 a month. We're paying them down as aggressively as possible, but we'd certainly be making faster progress without kids in the mix. Plus, my work as a freelance writer means I don't have a steady paycheck or benefits like maternity leave.\n\nWe weren't blind to these downsides, but life decisions can't always be based on what looks best on paper. Starting a family in our mid-20s was aligned with our long-term goals, like traveling later in life and enjoying more years with our kids. If that required finding a way to budget and saving for the future on a tighter budget, we were up for it.\n\nFor us, that looked like putting a focus on building our emergency fund as much as possible from the moment I got that positive pregnancy test. From that point on, we knew to expect the unexpected—and wanted to give ourselves as much of a cushion as possible, even if it meant scaling back on our other loan payments in the short-term.\n\nFamily money decisions aren't always black and white\n\nDespite our best intentions, we had a lot to learn, especially when it came to weighing our day-to-day expenses against long-term goals. For example, we initially decided not to pay for regular child care because my unpredictable earnings weren't guaranteed to cover the expense with anything leftover to save. It didn't feel worth it.\n\nBut by my child's first birthday, my kid's schedule didn't leave enough time for me to get work done, and I was actually leaving money on the table. Faced with the decision to invest in child care or take a step back from work, I did some (overdue) research: Was it enough to only consider today's earnings, or was I missing something by not factoring in potential earnings and long-term professional goals?\n\nThe answer was clear. Continuing to grow my business would yield more money over time and allow us to save more—and it made me happy. This was a lightbulb moment that prompted us to get creative about finding affordable child care that was compatible with my career. We ended up organizing an in-home nanny share with another family, which gave the kids a playmate and us moms reliable work hours.\n\nIt's OK to say 'no' to some baby purchases\n\nThere's a real temptation to buy all the baby things—especially on birthdays and around the holidays. But as my first kid's closet filled up and our storage space overflowed with toys, I hit the pause button to redefine what was a necessity, what was extra and where our money would have the highest impact.\n\nDressing up a baby in an adorable new outfit is definitely more fun than saving that money. And, as our kids have grown and begun to express interest in pricey activities like gymnastics classes and swim lessons, we've had to explain in their terms that we can't do it all at once.\n\nBut I'm grateful for this perspective, which has helped us pad our long-term savings and travel fund. Now, when I'm tempted to make an impulse purchase, I think about spending that money on our coming family trip instead…and then step away from the baby bows.\n\nIn the end, you can have anything, but you can't have everything\n\nHere's Colley's bottom line about affording to start a family: Each couple's unique circumstances, values and priorities will impact how they decide to arrange their lives to accommodate a new family member.\n\nIn other words, it's all about trade-offs. It's about saying no to all the vacations we wish we could take and things we wish we could buy in lieu of the opportunity to build our family. But these are trade-offs I'm glad to make for my personal life and for the example it's setting for my children about being grateful for what we have.\n\nAnd thankfully, the happiest memories of being with your family during the holidays don't cost a cent.
Dear Moneyist,\n\nI'm an upper middle-aged male and seven years into a happy second marriage to my early-senior-aged wife. My first marriage ended after 30 years and produced four children, all now adults. The divorce went quickly. The equitable distribution was a bitter, expensive two-year process leading to a significant estrangement from two of my children. The other two are kind to me, but only one of that pair is kind to their stepmother (who has been kind to those who would let her).\n\nI will obviously leave retirement savings, work pension, and any additional savings and property to my second wife. She's not in the best of health and wouldn't do well on her current Social Security award. However, I disinherited my children in my will. At the time I made my will there were significant reasons to disinherit my children by default: Three were quite hostile to me, and the fourth had difficulties with managing her mother's manipulations and greedy demands on her.\n\nI'm reconsidering this stance.\n\nDon't miss:Did my sister have the right to sell our parents' home and pocket the cash?\n\nI'm feeling some sense of recognizing them in a final estate. This could best occur by designating them as beneficiaries to one of my life insurance policies. It would also be a discreet (and discrete) method that would avoid probate and keep some hostile adult kids from their scorned stepmother.\n\nHowever, I don't want to sneak behind my wife's back to do so. I also don't like the discord in my marriage this would bring. But there's no way I've found to square this circle, apart from just waiting. And I find it ghoulish to mentally calculate on my wife's passing as necessary to bequeath without noise. I also need to admit most of my adult kids continue to be estranged and nasty, despite my reaching out.\n\nThat leads to another question: if I bequeath, do I do so evenly? Or proportionally, recognizing those who have tried to maintain a relationship?\n\nPerplexed\n\nDear Perplexed,\n\nI'm sorry you've fallen out with your children or, at least, they have fallen out with you and I take my hat off to you for wanting to leave them something. That's a good instinct. At some point in their lives, they will remember the good times, even for a moment. This will be a testament to the fact that — despite everything that went down — you are still their father.\n\nIn that spirit, follow your gut. Include them in some way, and do so equitably. If you pass away after 10 years of marriage, your wife will have rights to a widow's payments from your Social Security, rather than receive the lower sum from her own. Your spouse is entitled to the money in your retirement account unless she signs a waiver, giving up her rights as a beneficiary.\n\nAlso see:My husband is either giving $300,000 to a religious cult, being blackmailed — or plotting a divorce\n\nAs for those assets that will go through probate, such as a large sum of money in your bank account, I advise you to consult your wife, and proceed with honesty and transparency. As for your wife? Even if you decide to do this quietly, it will always prey on your conscience and, if you predeceased her, she would find out after you've gone. That may leave her with many unanswered questions.\n\nInclude her in the conversation and on the amount you decide to leave them. If you don't, that would defeat the purpose of doing this good deed in the first instance. Preface any discussion by telling your wife that she need not worry about her own financial security. She may or may not agree, but I'm betting that your transparency and open heart is what drew her to you in the first place.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? Send them to MarketWatch's Moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nWould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new Moneyist column has been published?

Dear Quentin,\n\nI am married, but my home is in my name only. When I bought it in 2010, I was the only one eligible to apply for a mortgage because my husband was working a temporary job, having been laid off in the recession.\n\nMy previous home, which I bought when I was single, had substantial equity in it. But I wasn't able to sell it right away, due to needed repairs and no funds to get them done while my husband was working sporadically. I subsequently took a loan out of my retirement fund to pay for the repairs.\n\nWhen the old home sold, the money was used to refinance and pay down the current house's mortgage, again in my name only. I am the one who pays for the home mortgage. (We live in Georgia.)\n\n 'I am the one who pays for the home mortgage.' \n\nMy husband is 62 and I am 61. We both have chronic health conditions, though I've had more serious hospitalizations, including a pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, cerebral spinal fluid leak, etc.\n\nMy husband's son is almost 29 and still lives with us. He does not pay rent nor contribute much toward household chores, and is a most aggravating total slob, as well as disrespectful, rude, physically and mentally abusive and menacing to me in particular.\n\nSorry, but that is the truth of the matter. I feel I am held hostage in my own home, which he treats like a garbage dump. Because my stepson has mental-health issues, my husband thinks we cannot kick him out of the house until he is able to sustain himself.\n\nI am concerned my husband will outlive me, and while I have no problem with my husband receiving the house if I die first, I am adamantly opposed to my stepson ultimately inheriting my home under any circumstances.\n\nHow can I structure my will to enforce my wishes regarding my home to prevent it from being inherited by my stepson?\n\nTrapped\n\nYou can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nDear Trapped,\n\nLet's talk about the here and now before we talk about what happens after you're gone.\n\nYou are in a House of Danger and surrounded by Wall of Trauma. You need a team to deal with the effects of living with a man who is a bully and a perpetrator of elder abuse, and then you can deal with your and his living situation. Once you start to break down the walls of your own fear and abuse with the help of a lawyer, financial planner, doctors and therapist, you will be able to deal with the brick-and-mortar problem of what happens to your home if you predecease your husband.\n\nBut why put all your focus on ensuring that this man does not inherit your home? I agree that you should do everything in your power to make that happen, but you could have another 10 or 20 or more years left, so why suffer because your husband is unable or unwilling to kick him out? You do not have to live with abuse. There is no excuse for abuse. It is time to end your stepson's rent-free rule of terror in your home. You have a right to live safely and happily.\n\n You have a right to live safely and happily.  — — The Moneyist\n\nGeorgia is an equitable distribution state. For instance, both spouses generally have some property ownership despite not being named on the deed, according to Abbott & Abbott, a law firm with offices in Marietta and Canton, Ga. Talk to an estate-planning lawyer about whether or not you can leave your husband a life estate (he lives there after you die, but does not own the home), given that you paid off a home you brought into this marriage and used the proceeds to buy a new one.\n\nContact Georgia Adult Protective Services to report abuse, and find an organization that can help you navigate the last years of your life so they are free from harassment and abuse. Talk to a lawyer, financial planner, therapist, doctor and even the police if you have to. You didn't sign up for this when you married and the price you paid should not have been a peaceful life. If your husband stands by and allows this to happen, he is helping to facilitate your stepson's abusive behavior.\n\nNeither your husband or stepson are unlikely to change. But you can take actions to ensure that you wake up in the morning and go to sleep at night feeling safe in your own home. What happens to your home after you're gone is an important consideration for you. However, given what you have revealed in your letter, it should be way down on your list of priorities. I believe you can do it — and, with the right amount of outside support, I feel confident that you will begin to believe that too.\n\nApproximately one in four people aged 65 years old will live beyond 90, and one out of 10 will live past 95, according to the Social Security Administration; more than half of those who reach the age of 65 will require some form of long-term care. You don't want to be in a position where both your health and the health of your husband have declined to such a degree that you are dependent and at the mercy of your stepson. Unless you force your stepson to move out, he will never leave.\n\nThe time for action is now.\n\nThe Moneyist:When my parents died, my sisters and I split their estate. I chose a painting that may be worth $50,000. Should I tell them?\n\nHello there, MarketWatchers.

Facebook's latest virtual reality (VR) device, called Oculus Quest, gets good reviews. It offers six degrees of freedom of movement, which pushes the boundaries of user interaction with content. There are no messy wires. Apps download straight to the device and WiFi connects users for multiplayer games.\n\nBut there's a glaring flaw. Comic book superheroes are notably scarce in VR content, which seems odd because comic book fans are super-passionate about their make-believe worlds. That makes comic books one of the original VR formats. As anyone who's been to Comic Con knows, fans love interacting with their superheroes.\n\nThe Oculus content line up isn't the only evidence that superheroes aren't yet at home in VR. Panel discussions on comics in the digital age at the New York Comic Con focus on web-based platforms supporting the traditional panel format, like Line WebToon, which feels like the stone age at this point.\n\nExperts cite two reasons why comic book heroes can't yet find a home in the brave new world of VR.\n\n1. Game developers need coding skills, and those skills readily carry over into VR, says Chris Pruett, who works with third-party content developers as the director of ecosystem at Oculus. Comic book creators, in contrast, are artists and writers, not coders.\n\n2. The big entertainment companies that own the most successful comic book content don't want to give up control of characters and story lines, says Jaron Lanier, author of Dawn of the New Everything: Encounters with Reality and Virtual Reality.\n\nEarly on, VR pioneers like Lanier talked with Hollywood studios about a potential marriage. The studios loved the idea of putting viewers in a 3D landscape. I said that is not really the spirit of VR. In the spirit of VR you become the character, Lanier said. Hollywood's response: Forget about it because that takes the story away from us.\n\nRead: If you like 'Game of Thrones,' you'll love this stock\n\nSigns of progress\n\nStill, this mindset is slowly evolving — to the delight of comic book fans. Progress should continue thanks to Oculus and private companies paving new ground. Consider the following three trends — which likely will ultimately support revenue growth at entertainment content and platform companies ranging from Walt Disney Co. DIS, -1.28% and Sony SNE, +1.11% , to Facebook FB, +2.02% , Netflix NFLX, +0.73% , Amazon.com AMZN, +0.33% , Apple AAPL, +1.27% , and AT&T T, +0.20% .\n\n1. Marvel Entertainment, a division of Disney, collaborates with Oculus to offer playable characters through a lineup called Marvel Powers United VR. Multiplayer games lets users turn into superheroes to carry out missions, battling Marvel villains along the way. Superheroes also are leaping into video games. A Sony video game called Marvel's Spider-Man is one of the company's most successful titles. It has helped power profits at Sony's videogame business, picking up where hardware left off.\n\n2. Indie comic book creators should see Oculus as a playground. The device ships with a browser that can play third-party content rendered in a 3D VR format, says Pruett. Browsers aren't built for speed, so the VR quality is not as good as with native apps written to run directly on the Oculus device.\n\nBut indie comic book creators also can go the native code route, Pruett says. A thriving indie developer community of smallish teams of a half a dozen people or less produce some of the most successful VR games, without financial backing from big studios. The popular Beat Saber and Superhot VR games are examples. Small indie teams are the authors of some of the best content we have today, Pruett says.\n\nThere's no reason to think this can't happen for comic books, in time. When we take a media from traditional sources into VR we have to reinvent how it works. We understand how video games translate into VR. We don't understand it for comic books yet, says Pruett. Artists and developers are still feeling their way, but there's probably someone in a garage somewhere right now who is inventing the new model.\n\n3. Upstart private companies are developing technology to help comic book artists pave the way and make some money in the process. For example, Madefire — which presented at New York Comic Con last year — offers a basic VR platform for comic book artists to develop ideas, in a format called motion books. Madefire CEO and co-founder Ben Wolstenholme likens the final product to walking through a popup book.\n\nMadefire tools are free, but if creators charge money for content they split it with Madefire. The company has tens of thousands of books on its platform, including content from Marvel and DC Comics, a division of AT&T. Dave Gibbons, an artist who worked on popular Watchmen and Superman books, explains what Madefire does in this short video. .\n\nMadefire collaborates with a private VR headset maker called Magic Leap, to put content into Magic Leap's augmented reality (AR) format. AR creates the illusion of 3D images projected into the real world that users can interact with. Think holograms. The Magic Leap One device is similar to Microsoft's MSFT, +1.24% HoloLens headset.\n\nInvesting angles\n\nUnless you are a big investor like Alphabet GOOGL, +1.43% , which has pumped money into Magic Leap, it is difficult to invest in private companies like Madefire or Magic Leap. But they're worth watching, because they might go public some day.\n\nLike Oculus, these companies serve as content farms for entertainment giants hungry for content, as their business model shifts towards the over the top subscription revenue streams, said Madefire's Wolstenholme. Comics are a source of new intellectual property (IP), franchises and storytelling material, he added. Public companies are interested in comics because they are building subscription services that need new IP.\n\nMarvel, for example, is pulling its content from Netflix to put on the Disney+ platform. That means Netflix will have a big hole to fill. Amazon has a similar need on its video platform and Apple is a player in the content game. To the extent that Oculus and companies like Madefire welcome superheroes into the world of VR, they'll play a role filling the content gap at these giants. Said Wolstenholme: We believe this era is all about new and original IP, and we are built to create that. .\n\nAt the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

MarketWatch rounded up 10 of its most interesting articles published over the past week.\n\nTonya Garcia tells the story of how Olive Garden, one of several restaurant chains run by Darden Restaurants Inc. DRI, +0.00% , has boosted sales by emphasizing takeout convenience and by giving people what they want — pasta with pepperoni.\n\nShares of Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.24% rose 35% from Sept. 19 through Oct. 4 amid reports of a possible bidding war for the social-media company by Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.25% , Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.32% , Walt Disney Co. DIS, -1.29% and Salesforce.com Inc. CRM, -1.75% . But everything changed Thursday, as takeover rumors were deflated and Twitter's stock fell 20%. Barbara Kollmeyer and Caitlin Huston consider how much further Twitter's stock might drop before a takeout.\n\n3. Mylan and its executives may be in hot water\n\nThere's already plenty of egg on the face of Mylan NV US:MYL and its CEO, Heather Bresch, from of the company's epic round of price increases for its lifesaving EpiPen, which is produced at very low cost. But the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has said the company overcharged the government for years. Emma Court explains what this might mean for the company.\n\n4. A missed opportunity for Donald Trump\n\nBrett Arends believes Donald Trump could have gotten ahead of the story of how his business benefitted from U.S. tax law and used it to make the case for tax reform.\n\n5. A big day for tech IPOs\n\nInitial public offering activity has been scarce in the U.S. this year, but Thursday featured five IPOs by tech firms, with all their stocks rising, Caitlin Huston reports.\n\n6. What Apple (and others) can do to help U.S. infrastructure\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, -2.32% and many other U.S. companies keep very large amounts of cash overseas in order to avoid paying U.S. income taxes. Ciara Linnane looks at an idea from Standard & Poor's to have those companies repatriate $2 trillion, tax-free, while requiring them to invest at least 15% of the money in infrastructure bonds.\n\n7. The presidential election is over\n\nSteve Goldstein looks at the polls and Electoral College prospects and determines Hillary Clinton has already won the 2016 election.\n\n8. The presidential election is not over\n\nBrett Arends writes that the presidential election is still competitive, heading into the second debate on Sunday, because [Donald] Trump now benefits from the irrational phenomenon of low expectations.\n\n9. This might be a better target for Disney\n\nNot only has Disney been rumored to be mulling a bid to acquire Twitter, the company is reportedly considering buying Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.96% to broaden its entertainment offerings. Trey Williams considers the potential marriage in light of Disney's history of successful acquisitions.\n\n10. Retail stocks with heavy insider buying\n\nIt's always a good sign to see a company's executives buying its shares — with their own money. Michael Brush lists five retailers that look attractive heading into the holiday season.\n\nWant more from MarketWatch?

Dear Moneyist,\n\nMy stepfather recently passed away. He and my mother were each receiving Social Security, and he had two pensions that were fully paid out during his lifetime. This leaves my mother with about 50% of her original income. She is left with savings and investments with a value of about $150,000.\n\nEventually, my mother is set to inherit my grandmother's house, where she currently lives and pays monthly rent of $2,500 to my grandmother, but I am uncertain when that will happen (possibly in about five years or longer, depending on my grandmother's health).\n\nMy mother's only income is equal to her housing expenses, so she will need to rely on her savings to pay her bills of about $1,500 to $2,000 a month. They are high, mainly because she pays for my 23-year-old sister's bills,which amount to $500 to $600 per month.\n\nThe Moneyist:My sister became my late father's power of attorney, took out a reverse mortgage on his home, and drained his equity. What can I do?\n\nI've been able to reduce her bills by canceling things she doesn't use, and negotiating for discounts for her cellphone and TV. I've told my mother that my sister should be paying her own bills as she lives rent-free in my mother's home, and just spends her money on whatever she likes.\n\nI thought we were on the same page, but my mother seems reluctant to have this discussion and continues to pay her way. I'm worried that my mother will run through her savings before she gets her inheritance, and then she will be in dire circumstances due to my sister's indulgence.\n\nShould I push for my sister to be a big girl and learn the concept of responsibility, or should I keep my mouth shut?\n\nDisgruntled sister\n\nWant to read more?Follow Quentin Fottrell on Twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\nDear Disgruntled,\n\nI join you, your sister and your mother in wishing your grandmother a long and healthy life. And, of course, I wish the same for your mother too. I understand that it must be hard to watch your mother give hundreds of dollars to your sister every month, especially as she only has a finite amount of savings. But this is her decision to make, as long as she is of sound mind and not under undue influence.\n\nYou need an outside voice, preferably a financial adviser, to outline your mother's financial situation and goals as she faces a life without her husband. It would make a nice New Year's gift, and you could pitch it as a way of putting your and your mother's minds at ease. The adviser would then form an opinion on your sister's role in your mother's life and finances. Your mother would not suspect the adviser of being anything other than objective.\n\nIt's unlikely that your sister will, upon hearing your opinion, suddenly start paying her way. She will accept money from your mother as long as your mother gives it to her. It's hard to undo such an arrangement. When someone is used to being given special or preferential treatment, they often believe that this is their due. The more pressure you put on both of them, the more defensive they are likely to become.\n\nYou need a third party to intervene who does not have a horse in this race.\n\nThe Moneyist:My wife and I have 3 kids. I also have 3 kids from a previous marriage. How should we split our house among these 6 children?\n\nHello there, MarketWatchers.

Dear Quentin,\n\nI am a 49-year-old woman with four adult children aged 19 to 29. I bought my home in 1998 as a single mother and my children grew up here. I now have a live-in boyfriend who has done extensive repairs and upgrades to the home over the last 3 years — he performed all the labor himself while I purchased all materials.\n\nWhen he was working, he contributed his fair share to our expenses. However, he works in the oil and gas industry, and was laid off about a year ago and has not worked since then. His employment outlook is uncertain as oil and gas is not rebounding, and he may need to get additional training to change careers.\n\nAlthough we are in a committed relationship and intend to remain together as life partners until one of us dies, we are unlikely to ever formally marry as we both had very bad experiences.\n\n 'I am at an absolute loss as to the fair way to address the home in my will.' \n\nHe is 9 years younger than I am, and has three children from his previous marriage who are considerably younger than my children (7 to 12). They will likely spend a good portion of their childhood in this home over the coming years.\n\nOther than my home, I have little in the way of assets — a car and some insurance policies — but very little in liquid cash. I am at an absolute loss as to the fair way to address the home in my will. Three of my children want the house to go to them, if I should die. The other said I should leave it to my oldest daughter.\n\nMy boyfriend does not want to leave this home should I pass away, but he also says the house should go to my kids since it is their family home. Of course, I hope to live long enough that all the kids are grown and settled, in which case I can make a new will.\n\nIn the meantime, I need to have a will that makes sense should I expire early.\n\nI am very concerned with treating everyone fairly. The last thing I want when I die is for one of my kids (or my boyfriend) to feel as if I didn't love them because of how I divide things. Please help!\n\nGirlfriend, Mother & Home Owner\n\nYou can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nDear GMHO,\n\nYou worked hard for this house. You raised four children as a single mother. You have every right to exhale and reflect on a life well lived, and a job well done. You succeeded where many others may have fallen apart. It's also great that you have a hard-working man in your life, and I hope he finds work in his chosen industry, or another. Sit back and take a moment to enjoy all that you have accomplished. Your job is done.\n\nAnd now that I have said that, I feel compelled to tell you what is not your responsibility. You met a man nine years younger than you are, and you clearly love each other and he has fallen on some difficult times. I understand that he has helped you with the renovations, but it's not your job to acquiesce to his demands or the needs of your adult children regarding what happens to your estate.\n\n This house should be a source of peace and contentment for you, not one that creates ongoing anxiety. \n\nThis house should be a source of peace and contentment for you, not one that creates ongoing anxiety. It's not your job to fix everybody. It's not your job to split your estate according to your children's wishes. It's not your job to make everything right for everybody all the time. This is your moment. Do not give up your happiness to the ill-winds of other people's wishes, wants and what-ifs.\n\nYou can't control how other people will feel after you make a decision. There is a great freedom to be had in making decisions that you believe are right for you, and allowing others to feel as they are going to feel. Some people will be mad at you in this life, others will try to bend you to their will, and some will sit in the lawyer's office while your last will and testament is being read out, and will curse you from the other side.\n\nCaring too much about what people think of you while you're here is exhausting enough. Worrying about how they will feel about you after you're gone is an unheavenly form of co-dependency that only serves to muddle your financial decisions now and later. After all, you'll be gone, so you won't have to worry about it! You want to make sure your loved ones are taken care of, of course, but do what YOU believe is right, not what OTHERS tell you to do.\n\nTrust your gut, and consult an estate lawyer. Your boyfriend is responsible for himself. Your children are responsible for themselves. You could give your boyfriend a tenancy for life, only if this is what you believe to be the right thing to do. After he dies, you could split your estate equally between your children. Are you OK with him living there with a new wife or girlfriend should you die before he does? You have earned the right to make estate plans both before and after you're gone.\n\nThe Moneyist: My daughter-in-law will only have a second child by surrogacy — and wants to use $200K of my son's inheritance to pay for it
Marriage problems are more likely for people in some career paths than others.\n\nWorkers in certain fields are seeing higher divorce rates by age 30, a recent analysis of U.S. Census Data from career website Zippia found. The highest divorce rate was for first-line enlisted military supervisors, its analysis of Census Bureau's Public Use Microdata Sample, or PUMS, data found. They had a divorce rate of 30%. The occupation involves leading operations and coordinating the activities of enlisted military personnel.\n\nThe next highest rates came from careers including logisticians, automotive service technicians and mechanics, followed by military-enlisted tactical operations and air weapons. In fact, military jobs took three of the top 10 spots in its listing. Across all fields, military workers of all ranks were most likely to be divorced by age 30, at a rate of 15%. (The average age for divorce is 30 and roughly 41% of first marriages end in divorce, studies show.)\n\nPeople who serve often face a unique set of circumstances that can impact their home life. Some of the most demanding professions can be hardest on marriage, either because of time spent away, persistent danger or insufficient pay, said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at personal-finance site Bankrate.com. These challenges can certainly pertain to those who serve in the armed forces, making or either willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nMilitary deployments have a profound effect on marriage, according to a separate study published last year in the Journal of Population Economics. It found divorce rates increased significantly when spouses spent each month away. Divorce rates for military members who have been deployed are higher:It's 12.52% for those in the U.S. Navy, 8.9% in the Marines, 8.48% in the Army and 14.6% in Air Force, according to Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch data.\n\nThe Moneyist: What to do about your finances during a divorce\n\nDon't miss:The bigger the age gap, the shorter the marriage\n\nMental health issues put additional strain on marriage, with 20% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans reporting experiences with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, experts say. Another study from Military.com — a website that gives people with a connection to the military access to jobs, benefits and discounts — found that even non-deployed military members found their relationships struggled due to marrying too young and moving too often.\n\nOf course, career stress affects all couples, Hamrick said. Money troubles can create additional divides. The overall divorce rate in the U.S. peaked in 1980 at 23 divorces per 1,000 married women and has been falling ever since. In 2016, the divorce rate was at 16.9 divorces per 1,000 married women. Careers with lower rates of divorce listed by Zippia included religious workers, speech language pathologists, and dentists.\n\nBaby boomers in particular have seen divorce rates double in the last 25 years, a Pew Research Center report found, increasing 109% since 1990 as people are living longer and the cultural and religious stigma of divorce has declined in recent years. Gray divorcées tend to be less financially secure than married and widowed adults, particularly among women, Pew said. And living alone at older ages can be detrimental to one's financial comfort.
A new Budweiser ad campaign has attempted to catch the attention of consumers with splashy newspaper spreads re-imagining late 1950s and early 1960 ads with a 2019 spin.\n\nAppearing in several national newspapers, the three ads show real Budweiser ads from 50 years ago of women serving up sudsy domestic bliss to their husbands next to new versions depicting empowered women deciding how they spend their time and who they spend it with — all while catching a cold brew.\n\nThe three ads were created by three female illustrators and each has a different theme: independence, equality and fulfillment, according to the company. They were done in partnership with #SeeHer, an effort led by the Association of National Advertisers to ensure every woman and every girl see themselves as they really are in advertising and media.\n\nThe campaign follows in the recent footsteps of Gillette PG, +0.30% , which said its razors were the best a man can get. A recent provocative advertising campaign urged customers to shave off toxic masculinity, which gained worldwide press attention and appeared to polarize critics.\n\nIs this the best a man can get? Is it? We can't hide from it. It has been going on far too long. We can't laugh it off, making the same old excuses, a narrator said.\n\nBut does representation for women start at home? The top leadership of the company that owns Budweiser, AB InBev BUD, -1.31% , is predominantly male. Only two of the company's 15 board of directors are women, and one of those women is a non-executive board member. AB InBev's 18-strong leadership team are all men, from the Chief Executive Carlos Brito and Chief Financial and Solutions Officer Felipe Dutra to the Chief Sales Officer Ricardo Tadeu and Zone President Europe Jason Warner.\n\nBudweiser told MarketWatch it was serious about female empowerment and had the numbers to show it. As a leader in advertising, it's our responsibility to showcase women in more balanced and empowered roles, said Monica Rustgi, vice president of marketing for Budweiser.\n\nTwo of the ads subtract the husband from the frame of the 1956 and 1962 images and put the woman front and center, either with her favorite takeout for a Friday night or ready to have a Budweiser with friends.\n\nAnheuser-Busch/Budweiser\n\nAnheuser-Busch/Budweiser\n\nThat's in line with reality. The Pew Research Center found that 40% of households with children under age 18 counted mothers as the sole or main source of income, up from 11% in 1960.\n\nThere are signs even more women are the main wage earner. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last year said 49% of women participating in the survey were their family's main earner, an increase from the 37% in 2000.\n\nDon't Miss:When wives earn more than their husbands, they both do something pretty terrible\n\nAnother 1958 ad shows a woman pouring a drink for her man, with the wording mentioning the king's credentials and talking about ingredients.\n\nAnheuser-Busch/Budweiser\n\nThe updated ad shows the man and woman together, Budweisers in hand and a pizza in front of them. Home is where life happens. And life happens when you build it together, the wording says.\n\nMarriage rates have dropped over the decades while unmarried cohabitation is on the rise, which is something borne out in National Health Statistics Reports and the Pew Research Center.\n\nBudweiser is one of the many AB InBev brands. The company's board of directors is comprised of 15 members, its website explains. Two of the members are women. Listings of other leaders across the company show many — though not exclusively — male faces.\n\nBudweiser takes female empowerment very seriously, beyond leading in advertising and reflecting culture, a spokesman said, noting that over 80% of the company's brand team was female. Nearly half of our US breweries are led by female head brewmasters, who play a crucial role in brewing our best-known products. As an advertising leader, it is our responsibility to equally represent and celebrate culture, including championing women.\n\nLast year, AB InBev issued its first global diversity and inclusion policy to encourage diversity and inclusion.\n\nMany companies are grappling with the predominance of men at the top of the ladder. A study last year from McKinsey & Company and LeanIn.org showed patterns across all sorts of industries: an ever-shrinking number of women the higher in a company.\n\nIn the food and beverage distribution sector, women made up 42% of entry-level workers but accounted for 9% of the headcount at the C-suite. That was the smallest percentage of women at the topmost levels among the 18 industries analyzed.\n\nLast year, Heineken USA tapped Maggie Timoney as its CEO. She's the first woman to lead a major American beer producer.\n\nOther companies have recently taken a look at their old messages to consumers and updated them.
Are you being underpaid?\n\nSharing pay data is probably the easiest way to ensure every employee gets the same pay for the same job. But new research suggests that employers may claw back those gains made by underpaid staff over time. Economists from the University of Toronto, Princeton University and the Social Analysis and Modelling Division from Statistics Canada, the country's national statistics agency, examined the impact of public-sector salary disclosure laws on university faculty salaries.\n\nUsing administrative data covering the universe of faculty in Canada, they came to three conclusions: Firstly, the laws reduced the gender-pay gap. That's good news for a persistent problem that has dogged generations of workers. Secondly, the closure of the gender wage gap occurred primarily in universities where faculty are unionized. That's a wrinkle in how widely this study may be applied. Thirdly, pay disclosures ultimately reduced all salaries on average.\n\nIn other words, increased transparency appeared to decrease the gender-pay gap in the short term by nudging employers to pay female employees more money so they would earn equal pay for equal work. Any gap in pay, regardless of gender, was used as leverage when they negotiated their salaries. But sharing information on salaries over the long term may have led employers to lower overall salaries rather than lifting women's salaries to the level of their male co-workers, the study suggests.\n\nThe gender pay gap was around 15% in 1970 and reduced to 4% to 5% in 2017. The study looked at 101,103 individual university employees across Canada. Individuals were on average 48 years old and one quarter of them were women. The women in the sample were nearly 10% more likely to be unionized than men; this may be because they're more likely to work at organizations where there are labor unions and/or the share of women increased in the workforce alongside the gradual increase in unionization in the 1970s.\n\nDon't miss: Why male Uber drivers earn more than their female colleagues\n\nThe researchers said it's possible that the gender wage gap is unaffected by transparency laws. While learning about co-workers' wages might reveal something about the nature of firm-specific rents, if men and women use this information in a symmetric fashion in bargaining, one should not expect to see any impact on the gender pay gap. Put simply: If men, but not women, use the information in bargaining, it could exacerbate the gap.\n\n\n\nPay transparency is a big issue in the U.S. U.S. companies with at least 100 employees have until the end of September to turn over worker salary information to federal regulators, a federal judge ruled last month. Companies are already required to give the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission breakdowns of race, sex and ethnicity. These companies will have to supply the agency with information on how much they paid men and women in 2018 by Sept. 30.\n\nCompanies including Google GOOG, +1.26% , Disney DIS, -1.28% and Nike NKE, -0.20% have faced allegations recently of failing to pay women fairly. Google has previously said that it works hard to ensure there are no disparities and has installed an annual pay-parity review. Similarly, Nike defended itself against such complaints, saying that it's committed to competitive pay and benefits for our employees, and Disney has called the allegations without merit.\n\nAlso see: When wives earn more than their husbands, their marriage is less likely to last\n\nPrevious research on pay transparency found that people were more concerned with pay ranks than differences pay levels. Workers earning below the median for their pay unit and occupation reported lower pay and job satisfaction, while those earning above the median report no higher satisfaction, it found. Workers with salaries below the median for their pay unit and occupation report lower pay and job satisfaction, it added, while those earning above the median report no higher satisfaction.\n\nNationally, women earn 83% that of men, according to the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. In the 1970s, women were paid closer to 58% the salary of men. Men and women acquire more experience the longer they work and, therefore, become more valuable and productive. After 50, however, they either slow down and learn fewer new skills, economists say, or they are competing with younger, less expensive but equally skilled, employees for the same jobs.\n\nThere are only two occupations where women's median earnings are slightly higher than men's, while there are 107 occupations in which women's median earnings were 95% or less than men's for the same jobs, according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Women working as dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers and wholesale and retail buyers, slightly out-earned men, it found. That is, the lowest paid occupations had the smallest gaps.\n\nAnd it doesn't always get better when women climb up in the ranks. Female managers are not only under-represented in tech companies, they're paid significantly less than men. In the Bay Area, they're paid $172,585 per year, 10% less than men. In Seattle, they are paid an average of $158,858 per year, also 10% less than men. That pattern is similar across tech companies in Los Angeles, Boston and New York City, according to this analysis of 6.5 million employee profiles.
Good grief. As if the COVID-19 crisis has not already done enough damage, all the extra stress and forced togetherness may be causing some married couples to call it quits. If you're going down that road, anecdotal evidence suggests you'll have plenty of company. Sad, but apparently true.\n\nOn top of all the other stuff, getting divorced can be a major financial transaction. As such, it can have major tax consequences. And there are tax pitfalls to avoid — if you know about them. Don't expect your lawyer to understand all the tax implications of your impending marital split. Some otherwise-competent divorce attorneys are not fully up to speed on divorce-related tax issues.\n\nIn this column, we address one very important divorce-related tax issue: how to divide up IRA and qualified retirement plan balances between you and your soon-to-be ex without triggering unexpected and unfair tax outcomes. Bottom line: you need to plan ahead to make sure the federal income tax results turn out OK for you. If you don't plan ahead, the tax results can be dire. Here's what you need to know to avoid that fate.\n\nDivide up IRA balances the tax-smart way\n\nOur beloved Internal Revenue Code allows divorcing couples to divide up IRA balances without adverse federal income tax consequences. Say you'll be transferring IRA money to your soon-to-be-ex as part of the divorce settlement. You should arrange for a tax-free transfer of money from your IRA into an IRA set up in your ex's name. Do this via a direct transfer (AKA trustee-to-trustee transfer) from your IRA into your ex's receiving IRA. That way, the transferred funds never pass through your hands, which is what makes it a tax-free deal for you.\n\nAfter the transfer, your ex can manage the receiving IRA and defer taxes until he or she begins taking money out of the account.\n\nThis drill applies equally to traditional IRAs, SEP accounts, and SIMPLE IRAs. They are all considered traditional IRAs for this purpose.\n\nSo far, so good. But you must be very careful here. The aforementioned tax-free transfer drill is only allowed when your divorce agreement requires the transfer.\n\nWhat happens if money from your IRA gets into your ex's hands — before or after the divorce — without such a requirement? You'll be treated as if you received the IRA money in a taxable distribution and then gave the money to your ex. That means you'll be on the hook for the income tax bill from the deemed taxable distribution — even though your ex wound up with all the money. To add insult to injury, you'll usually owe the dreaded 10% early withdrawal penalty tax if this happens before you've reached age 59½. Your ex won't have any complaints, because the money from your IRA is received without any tax consequences for your ex. All the tax consequences are on your side of the deal, and they are all bad news for you.\n\nTo avoid this unexpected and unfair tax fate, never transfer IRA money to your ex in advance of a legal requirement in your divorce agreement to do so.\n\nDivide up qualified retirement plan money the tax-smart way\n\nSay you participate in a qualified retirement plan at work — such as a 401(k) plan or profit-sharing plan. Or you are self-employed and have a small business qualified plan, such as a Keogh plan or solo 401(k) plan.\n\nTo divide up qualified retirement plan accounts the tax-smart way in a divorce, you need to establish a qualified domestic relations order, or QDRO. A QDRO is boilerplate language that should be included in your divorce papers. First and foremost, the QDRO establishes your soon-to-be-ex's legal right to receive a designated percentage of your qualified retirement plan account balance or designated benefit payments from your plan. The good news for you is that the QDRO also ensures that your ex, and not you, will be responsible for the related income taxes when he or she receives payouts from the plan.\n\nThe QDRO arrangement also permits your ex-spouse to withdraw his or her share of the retirement plan money and roll it over tax-free into an IRA (assuming the plan permits such a withdrawal). That way, your ex can take over management of the money while postponing income taxes until distributions are taken from the rollover IRA.\n\nBottom line: with a QDRO in place, both you and your ex are treated fairly tax-wise, because the person who gets retirement plan payouts owes the related income taxes. Who can argue with that?\n\nHere's the rub. If money from your qualified retirement plan account gets into your ex's hands without a QDRO in place, you face a dire tax outcome. You'll be treated as if you received a taxable payout from the plan and then turned the money over to your ex. So, you'll owe the tax bill while your ex gets the money tax-free. To boot, you'll usually owe the dreaded 10% early withdrawal penalty tax if this happens before you've reached age 59½. To sum up: in the absence of a QDRO, all the tax consequences are on your side of the deal, and they are all bad news for you. So please make sure that your divorce agreement includes the tax-saving QDRO language.\n\nThe no-more-deductible-alimony factor\n\nBefore the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), you could deduct properly structured alimony payments made to your ex, and your ex had to include the payments in his or her taxable income. But the TCJA permanently eliminated deductions for alimony payments required by post-2018 divorce agreements. These payments may also be called spousal support or spousal maintenance. Whatever they are called, you can't deduct them anymore under the federal income tax rules, and your ex receives these payments federal-income-tax-free.\n\nThe message: when structuring your divorce settlement, consider giving your soon-to-be-ex a share (or a bigger share) of your IRA and/or retirement plan money in lieu of making now-nondeductible alimony, spousal support, or spousal maintenance payments. If you follow the advice given here, your ex will owe the taxes on the IRA or retirement plan money that he or she receives under the divorce agreement. Tax-wise, that may be a better deal for you than making a bunch of non-deductible payments and still being on the hook for taxes on your IRA and retirement plan money when you eventually take distributions.\n\nThe last word\n\nIn divorce, you can divide up IRA and qualified retirement plan money the tax-smart way or the tax-dumb way. Please go with the first option. As stated earlier, some otherwise-competent divorce attorneys are not so great on the tax stuff, but they might not admit it. You need a tax pro who has done lots of divorce-related work on your side. While your divorce attorney might be able to fill that role, don't take it for granted.\n\nFinally, don't let all the COVID-19 stress cause you to drop the ball on important divorce-related considerations, whether they have to do with taxes or other matters. Stay focused, keep your eye on the ball, and be careful out there.\n\nNote: For some good general advice for divorcing couples in the COVID-19 era, see this previous MarketWatch story.
Investing isn't all about the nuances of stocks and bonds and the twists and turns of the market — sometimes, it involves matters of the heart. On Monday, UBS announced it had raised $325 million for The Rise Fund, which was co-founded by Bono and hopes to combine financial returns and support a range of social and environmental causes. The fund's total size is $2 billion and is managed by Bill McGlashan, founder and managing partner of TPG Growth, Reuters reports. Its investments include EverFi, a provider of subscription-based digital learning to K-12 schools, universities, corporations, sports teams and NGOs, and Dodla, an Indian dairy business.\n\nValues-based investing is growing in popularity, where investment strategies are tied to investors' core beliefs. This can be broken down in a variety of ways: sustainable, responsible and impact investing (SRI) excludes companies from an investment portfolio that do not align with core values, such as the environment or corporate governance practices. Impacting investing is similar, but tracks the progress of these goals. More than half of millennials (51%) find impact investing appealing, and 54% believe investments' effects on society are important, according to a recent survey by Kansas City, Mo.-based investment management firm American Century Investments.\n\nDon't miss:Investing during a Donald Trump presidency — don't follow your gut\n\nAnother new company hopes to find a place amid investors' ever-changing values. Motif, an online brokerage platform for investing in specific themes, such as biotech and health, introduced Motif Impact Portfolios in March, where people invest in their beliefs and customize the list of funds put in those thematic buckets. Investors may be particularly passionate about a subject, such as climate change or corporate governance, but if there are funds for companies investors don't believe are aligned, they can change those allocations. We are constantly voting with our consumer dollars, but not with our investing dollars, said Hardeep Walia, chief executive officer of Motif.\n\nThe new offering is intended to provide investors with more transparency on their holdings — 73% of investors don't know if their investments are aligned with their personal beliefs, a Motif survey found. (And 40% of Americans don't know what's in their retirement accounts at all). Motif charges $9.95 a month with a minimum investment of $1,000 (there are no fees for security transactions). The environment, for instance, is important to some investors concerned about climate change. Sustainable investing funds rose 33% from 2014 to 2016, according to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, thanks mostly to millennials: 70% say they prefer this type of investing.\n\nThe new frontier for vision companies: Colorblindness\n\nThere are many misconceptions about investing based on your values, namely that you won't see much of a return. But that's largely a myth, experts say. It is not as much a choice of do good or do well, said Greg Vigrass, president and chief executive of Folio Institutional, which builds robo-adviser technology for financial advisers. It is very possible these days to invest along the lines of your beliefs and value system and not give up anything in investment returns. Folio allows investors to invest in their beliefs by, for example, excluding securities of companies that participate in factory farming or alcohol. Performance depends on funds, though some asset managers believe these types of funds do better than the S&P 500 and others do not.\n\nSee also:Can you do well as an investor and still do good?\n\nAlong with anti-animal cruelty, there are a myriad of other ways people can invest with their core values. Religion-based investing has grown in popularity, and a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) recently joined the market, and is based on the bible — it excludes companies that support abortion or support same-sex marriage. Environment, social and governance (known as ESG) investing looks at climate change, equal pay and executive compensation. There are also Islamic-inspired funds that exclude anything to do with alcohol, tobacco and gambling, said David Kathman, a mutual fund analyst at Chicago-based investment research and management firm Morningstar.\n\nValue-led investing is a growing, long-term trend, according to Casey Clark, director of sustainable and impact investing at Philadelphia-based wealth management firm Glenmede Trust, though it is more so for young investors than older generations. ETFs have been popping up to support other beliefs — there's one that focuses on LGBT-friendly companies and another ETF that believes companies with female leadership will see better performance than those without. According to MSCI Research, companies with strong female leadership generated a return on equity of 10.1% a year, compared with 7.4% returns for those without.
Why are so many Americans over 65 self-employed? If you're thinking the answer lies in Nelly's lyrics, Hey, must be the money! you are mistaken.\n\nAt least that's what three researchers found in their recent research looking at self-employment and contract work by age.\n\nIn some cases, financial necessity is the primary driver, wrote Katharine G. Abraham, Brad Hershbein and Susan Houseman in their National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) paper, Contract Work at Older Ages. In other cases, motivations such as the desire to stay active, connect with others, or pursue a hobby may be more important.\n\nThat's exactly what I heard when I spoke with a variety of people in their late 60s and early 70s about what led them to become self-employed at this time of life. (Of course, many others work after 65+ because they need the money.) As much as those I talked to said they're glad about the self-employment income, the psychic rewards are even greater.\n\nFun as a professional photographer\n\nI'm having fun. I'm as happy in my work as I ever have been, said Frank Gallagher, 65, of Silver Spring, Md. He spent 25 years working as an executive in nonprofit educational technology and is now a part-time photographer as well as a blog editor.\n\nGallagher calls his new life a marriage of two of my passions: photography and making the world a better place through nonprofit and volunteer work.\n\nJudith Henry, of Tampa, Fla., had a successful career in management and left it in 2017 at 65. She then wrote The Dutiful Daughter's Guide to Caregiving: A Practical Memoir, which she calls the book I could have used during my six years caring for my parents. These days, Henry — who blogs at Late Bloomer and calls herself a bohemian soul with a bean counter's brain — is selling her artwork: paintings, collages, stitchery and cards.\n\nWriting the book was not about the money. If you write a book you find that out very quickly, said Henry. Now as an artist, she noted: When someone buys one of my pieces, it's like having a heart-to-heart conversation. That's gold, baby!\n\nThe dramatic rise in self-employment by age\n\nSelf-employment in America now rises sharply with age, especially after 65, the NBER researchers noted in their report. While just under 20% of workers age 18 to 49 are self-employed, 25% of those 55 to 59 are, 46% of those 65 to 69 are and 68% of those 75 to 79 are. Self-employment among older workers is a lot more common than we think it is, said Hershbein, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and one of the paper's authors.\n\nThe older self-employed aren't always what you might think of as traditional small-business owners, running brick-and-mortar enterprises. Often, as the NBER economists learned after conducting a Gallup survey of 61,000 Americans, they're independent contractors working from home.\n\nMost of the rise in self-employment rates at older ages is due to independent contracting work, not small businesses in the conventional sense, said Hershbein.\n\nAnd less than half of independent contractors age 65 to 69 that Gallup surveyed said earning income was the main reason; about a third of those age 70 to 79 said that.\n\nWho older independent contractors typically are\n\nSaid Hershbein: Independent-contractor work as people get older is because they want to do it, not to make ends meet.\n\nBut that's a rarefied world.\n\nThe older independent contractors, Hershbein noted, are overwhelming highly educated and often come from managerial or professional occupations. What they're frequently looking for, he said, is more control over their life.\n\nThat rings a bell with Janine Vanderburg, 67, of Denver, who left the consulting firm she ran in 2017. Now, Vanderburg is director and chief catalyst at Changing the Narrative Colorado, a campaign to increase understanding of ageism and shift how Coloradans think about aging.\n\nOne of the things that has become really important to me is to never have to do the things I hated doing, says Vanderburg. I didn't want to manage staff or operate according to any schedule outside of my own or deal with administrative stuff or work with people I didn't want to work with.\n\nWhat about the money?\n\nWhat she did want to do was find a way to be useful in the fields she has dedicated herself to over the years: social justice and social change. As for the money part…\n\nMoney is a way we measure value in society. I think it's important as we age to get paid for our work. Often, there's a big push telling older people to just step to the side and volunteer. We should be paid for the value we bring to the table, said Vanderburg.\n\nRosemary Cass, of Fairfield, Conn., retired from her executive search business to follow her passion for writing. She then published a print magazine for three years and has converted it into the blog for boomers, seniors and caregivers, Seeing It Clearly Now. Love it! Meets many needs other than money, she said in an email.\n\nRelated: Working for yourself? Open your eyes to this great deal from the IRS\n\nRoughly a quarter of older independent contractors work at least some of the time for their former employers, according to the NBER research. They have a lot of skill sets that their former employers still want, said Hershbein.\n\nAnd these independent contractor boomerangers are why government figures for the number of older self-employed Americans are lower than reality, said Hershbein. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, he noted, assumes that if people say they're working for an employer, they must be employees.\n\nWhat will the coronavirus outbreak mean for the future?\n\nGiven that 57% of workers plan to work full time or part time in retirement, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies survey, what will the pandemic mean for self-employment and independent contractor work for people 65+?\n\nThat will be a really interesting question, said Hershbein. My sense is that people who are employees now will probably be reluctant to retire or quit if they can keep their job. But quite possibly, for those who are 65+ who were working and got the news of possibly being laid off, rather than waiting for that, they might think, 'Now's the time' [to retire]. That's more 'I see the writing on the wall.'\n\nHershbein thinks some employers will use the coronavirus outbreak to retool and start using more independent contractors, rather than full-time employees.\n\nSee: Pre-COVID-19 survey shows employers positive on older workers\n\nSome older self-employed people have learned or improved skills during the pandemic to keep their operations running.\n\nOver the last two months, I regret my January resolution for the year to become an expert in [the videoconferencing service] Zoom, Vanderburg joked. In reality, she has switched her in-person events to Zoom ZM, -4.26% conversations.\n\nBut the pandemic is already cutting into the work availability for many older self-employed people and causing others in their 60s to postpone launches.\n\nPrototypical gig-economy independent contractor jobs, like Uber UBER, -2.23% or Lyft LYFT, -4.05% driver, have shriveled, though they're a small share of all independent contractor work. Only 2% to 2.6% of workers ages 65 to 79 are employed through a platform or mobile app, according to the Gallup survey.\n\nAlso see: Joe Biden's retirement reforms are the boldest we've seen in generations\n\nIn normal circumstances, I'd work 20 hours a week on my photography business, said Gallagher. In the pandemic, it's more like 10 hours.\n\nA great new life after the great recession\n\nCheryl Comento, 73, of Campbell, Calif., was laid off from her home design job during The 2007-09 recession. So, she opened a senior-move management business and now runs two part-time businesses to help older adults and their families: Living Thru Transition and Above N Beyond Senior Placement.\n\nFor Comento, it's all about pursuing her passion and interacting with people. Ever since I was a child, I liked talking to seniors and listening to their stories and connecting with them. I thought this is a good time of life to do that, she said.\n\nAlso, Comento added, as a solo ager with no family near her, my social interaction is through my business. I love talking to people and helping people. When the money comes in, that's nice as well.\n\nVanderburg told me she couldn't be happier. I wake up every day to do something fun and enjoyable, she said.
Like many of my fellow cohabitating millennials, I was relatively naive about the realities of getting married. I assumed not a ton would change between my now-husband and me once we made it official.\n\nWhen we got engaged I was suddenly bombarded with questions ranging from silly — What are your thoughts on a sweetheart table? — to the more serious (at least by comparison): Where will you be spending Thanksgiving this year?\n\nTo be honest, we hadn't given this much thought. Over the course of our relationship we'd opted to spend Thanksgiving separately, even as we tried to rotate where we celebrated various Jewish holidays. But if a practical reason meant a change in routine, we didn't give it too much thought.\n\nNow the question of where to spend the holidays looms larger and answering it was one of the first times that I truly began to understand the difference between living together in a committed relationship and deciding to get married.\n\nYou're not just marrying your partner, you're ending up with this big system of people, said Liz Higgins, a licensed marriage and family therapist associate, who deals largely with millennial clients. The conversation needs to become how can we make sure we're prioritizing our relationship values but still maintaining relationships with these other people?\n\nFor now, we're avoiding that new conversation for at least one more year, instead basking in the glow of childhood traditions with our own families. But for those of you who aren't procrastinating, several experts give tips on how best to navigate this touchy territory:\n\nStart planning Thanksgiving in July\n\nEven if negotiating the holidays is a conversation we all dread, couples should try to get to it as soon as possible, experts say. Though it can be awkward to talk Christmas in July, couples may be happier with their plans if they discuss them while the weather is warm — before other family members' plans have a chance to influence their own, said Sharon Naylor, the author of more than 35 wedding and celebration books.\n\nBy making decisions early, the couple can also help soften the blow of their choice for any family members who they won't be seeing and take time to prepare an alternative celebration, said Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert and the owner of The Protocol School of Texas. You don't want to surprise your family members at the last minute, she said.\n\nBe open to suggestions from your partner\n\nThis might seem like obvious advice, but it can be hard to remember in the midst of calls and texts from relatives seeking to learn your holiday plans: Partners need to make sure they don't commit to either family before discussing the choice with each other, said Naylor.\n\nThey should consider one another, have a conversation and be open to suggestions from your mate, said Elaine Swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert.\n\nDuring these conversations, partners should remember that while their family is important the feelings of the couple are paramount when determining their plans, said Gottsman. It really is first and foremost about the couple and respecting each other, she said. That's not to say that you don't take your family into consideration, but often times we [go somewhere] for the family and we end up resenting it.\n\nFactors to consider when setting your routine\n\nIt can be helpful to set a routine where you either alternate holidays or spend a certain holiday with a certain set of relatives each year. That way you manage relatives' expectations, so that you don't have to have the same conversation every time certain holidays roll around, said Swann.\n\nTeach them how you celebrate the holidays, so they'll get used to it, she said.\n\nWhen deciding where you're going to spend each holiday, it's important to consider whether a given celebration, say Christmas Eve, is more important to one partner than the other. That's kind of a compromise in itself, said Swann. If one celebration is very important to both families, then couples either have to rotate or find a way to be with both sets of relatives.\n\nBut of course, it isn't all about feelings — money plays a role as well, experts agree. It may not be in all couples' budgets to take off work and travel to see relatives, which means they may choose to host their own celebration or visit with family closer to home.\n\nReasons to alter your holiday routine\n\nJust because you've set expectations doesn't mean you can't make exceptions. One major reason to alter your routine would be if your financial fortunes shift, said Swann.\n\nCouples may also decide to change things up if a relative on one side is elderly or ill. One of the things that I've found figures the most in couples' plans in where to go is whose family is having a problem, said Naylor. We're seeing a lot more humanity in the decisions there. I'm also finding that the other side is very understanding of that kind of thing.\n\nAnd as young children come into the picture couples may be less willing to crisscross the country in a short period of time visiting various relatives. At the same time, they may feel more pressure to spend time with both sets of grandparents.\n\nIn that case, families may consider starting their own tradition, inviting both sets of relatives to their homes. Couples nervous about preparing the meal all on their own can get creative, said Naylor. They can assign tasks to other family members, hire a private chef or simply make a reservation at a restaurant and invite relatives over for dessert or drinks.\n\nThere are other, less logistical reasons to upend your routine, said Gottsman: if both members of the couple are consistently unhappy spending a holiday at a given place. But that doesn't mean you can simply change course willy-nilly.\n\nYou may not like your mother-in-law or brother-in-law, she said, but sometimes you just have to take one for the team. That's an important part of being in a couple, she added. Still, in that scenario, it's important to make sure your spouse reciprocates, she said.\n\nHow to break your decision to your family\n\nOnce couples have made a decision, they face the challenging task of reporting it to their families. The first step is gaming out how you expect the conversation to go, said Higgins. Consider the best-case scenario and consider the worst-case scenario and if it's the worst what will you say in response to that?\n\nOnce you've visualized the possible scenarios, it's time to take to the phone or set up a meeting. Experts agree that this is a conversation that should never be had over text or email. Ideally, the phone call or in-person conversation is with the adult son or daughter, not their partner, said Gottsman.\n\nThat's something that has to be clearly described so they can hear the inflection in your voice, said Naylor. Couples should be very direct with their families about their plans, she said. They should also be sure to respond to any invitations, even if that means saying we haven't decided yet, so that the host can plan appropriately.\n\nYou don't want people thinking that there are 50 people coming and buy 50 lobsters, Naylor said.\n\nCouples may also want to limit the blow of a disappointment by discussing alternative times to visit with the family they're missing, Gottsman said. Some suggestions for how to frame that conversation: We're going to come see you Christmas Eve, but we're not going to do Christmas morning, or: We're not going to spend the entire weekend with you, so which day or time would you prefer?\n\nBeing honest, but being diplomatic, she said.\n\nCouples can also numb the sting of their absence by sending the family something to open on the holiday, like a pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving, said Swann. They should also be sure to mention the gift when they're breaking the news that they won't be in town.\n\nWhen you have the conversation, don't put so much focus on the fact that you won't be there, she said. Make that part matter of fact — talk to them about what you will do.\n\nAnd even if you send a gift, you should still make a point of calling the relatives you're missing on the holiday. What's important is that you remember them on that day, Gottsman said.\n\n(This story was republished on Nov. 12, 2018.)
Dear Moneyist,\n\nMy spouse and I have been friends with a neighboring couple for decades, until recently. In our early 30s, we worked, struggled, and endeavored to improve our lives. This included career changes, setbacks and successes, vacations and fun, work on our respective houses, and dinners out.\n\nOur approaches to life were different but we remained fast friends nonetheless. For example, we took camping trips in the mountains, while they enjoyed trips to Europe.\n\n In our early 40s, our friends invited us to meet with their financial adviser. \n\nWe dug trenches, poured concrete foundations, and worked to build our house; they hired contractors. They traded in cars frequently; we ran ours into the ground.\n\nOur idea of a fun night out was the special at the local Chinese restaurant, while they clubbed it in the city. Indeed, their combined income was twice ours — probably more — and we had unemployment setbacks. But we never suffered relationship problems with the so-called wealth gap as so many friends do. While out for an evening together we split bills evenly, treated or were treated. It worked.\n\nIn our early 40s, our friends became interested in retiring early, and invited us to meet with their financial adviser. We accepted and had a great time. Well, they did poke fun at us for participating too much on their dime. It was a good experience, and my spouse and I took it to heart and so did our friends, or so we thought.\n\nAfter all, they talked about finances all the time, shared conversations they had with their financial adviser, and frequently forecast their future. Our friends had absolute plans to retire with their current lifestyle at 55, which at the time seemed out of reach for us, even if the underlying financial concepts seemed sound. We adopted the financial advice, mostly.\n\nWe stopped discussing finances for the next decade or so, enjoyed our lives, and enjoyed one another's company. In our mid fifties, finances came up again. They asked us about our plans, and we reminded them about the financial adviser meeting so many years back.\n\n We stopped discussing finances for the next decade or so, and enjoyed our lives. \n\nWe shared that we had just finished our last five-year plan and, at 55, we were ready to retire with no debt, a steady income stream, full and nearly free lifetime medical insurance, and a healthy nest egg. This includes a nice capital gains exemption on our house sale.\n\nWe assumed they had outperformed us with their income but no, that same financial adviser is telling them that they need 10 more years of work to meet their retirement income goals. They have mortgage and credit-card debt and incomplete medical coverage.\n\nThey can't down-size and sell their home at a profit, nor is their home configured to sell easily. The subject came up a few times more, but then they lost interest and we stopped discussing it. Now they have pulled away, and we haven't spoken for a long time. We pass each other in town with polite nods or thousand-yard stares.\n\nMaybe we can understand how they feel, but it is confusing. What happened?\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Future is Bright, For Us\n\nWant to read more? Follow Quentin Fottrell on Twitter and read more of his columns here.\n\nDear Bright,\n\nYour letter was compelling from the get-go. It exists in that bittersweet spot between friendship and hardship, romance and finance, saying too much and not enough, good neighbors and bad manners, and good manners and bad neighbors. When I read, In our early 40s, our friends became interested in retiring early, and invited us to meet with their financial adviser, I knew we had reached a turning point or a crossroads or — perhaps for your friends — something of a spaghetti junction.\n\n It was an equal friendship in terms of dinner checks, but that doesn't mean it was equal.  — The Moneyist\n\nThey were living well, and they were also comfortable with you and your wife living, well, not quite in the same fashion. But you were A-OK with that. And you're right. You can have just as much fun camping as you can have in Europe staying at a five-star hotel. More, in fact. Plus, you can enjoy a home that was lovingly renovated over time with the sweat from your own brow as much, if not more, than if you had hired contractors to turn it into a marble-encrusted suburban palace.\n\nIt was an equal friendship in terms of dinner checks, but that does not mean it was all equal. It may not have been a 50/50 relationship in the eyes of your friends. They wanted to help you when they believed that you needed their help, and whatever propensity they had for competing with others was not triggered in your company. It may be harsh to say they were at ease with perceiving you and your wife as the underdogs in this relationship, but it certainly seems that way.\n\nIf they did live beyond their means and live a lifestyle to which they hoped to become accustomed — and they can't blame you or their financial adviser for their credit-card debt — it suggests that they may not be 100% happy in their own skin. When people are unhappy and they have a brief respite from those emotions when they buy a smart TV or a face cream that promises to make them look 10 years younger, it might not feel so bad to have friends who do not have access to those luxuries.\n\n Pull up a chair because I am now going to tell you a story about a friendship.  — The Moneyist\n\nLook back without anger or diamond-encrusted rose-tinted spectacles. Was your friendship as real as you believe it to be? Pull up a chair. I'm now going to tell you a story. My father died 20 years ago and, after reading the death notice in the newspaper, my best friend from elementary school got in touch. In high school, he dropped me. I was crestfallen, but I also realized that it wasn't healthy to have just one best friend. We had not seen each other since then, so I was curious to reconnect.\n\nWe arranged to meet for dinner in a restaurant in Dublin. When I arrived, he said, Why don't you sit down there — and relax. Why was he telling me to relax? I was relaxed! Now I wasn't feeling so relaxed! The evening started with that weird, condescending tone, and it went downhill from there. He asked a lot of questions, which soon took on a common theme. All roads led back to money, money, money: Where do you live? How many bedrooms do you have?\n\nLate into the evening, and too many pints of Guinness later, he asked me in a slow, slurring drawl: Do you mind me asking, 'How much did you pay for your apartment?' Again, I told him. He could do all the calculations he wanted to, but it was no skin off my nose. My friends have been, and always will be, the most valuable thing in my life. But at that moment it finally hit me: A childhood friendship I had encased in a special snow globe of my mind was, like this evening, actually difficult to endure.\n\n Your frugal living led you to where you are today, retiring in your 50s.  — The Moneyist\n\nMemories came flooding back. Bad ones. Summer vacations when he didn't return my calls. Reminders that he had more money, a recurring topic. Recalling those experiences led me to feel bad for my younger self. It wasn't that he had changed, it was that he had not changed. He was the same. That high status/low status was the dynamic of our childhood friendship. I was so happy to have a friend back then that I put up with it. In 2001, however, one night was enough.\n\nWhat did I learn from that? If someone is no longer in your life, it could be for a good reason. It's OK to have a smaller home or less money than everyone else, so drive up to that school reunion bursting with pride in your old jalopy! Listen to how you feel, and take action. When you are spending time with neighbors or old school buddies who are not healthy for you, you are taking time away from yourself, and from days and nights spent with others. Time is infinitely more valuable than money.\n\n They, and they alone, bear the sole responsibility for their own finances.  — The Moneyist\n\nSimilarly, your friendship with these neighbors may not be exactly as you remember it. It is revealing that they poked fun at you for taking too much time with their financial adviser, or for asking too many questions. It shows that there was an invisible line not to cross. You could take a stock tip or two, but just enough so you would stay in your proverbial box. Have no doubt: Your investing and frugal living led you to where you are today, retiring in your 50s. No one is responsible for that, but you.\n\nYou never did ask your friends what went wrong. They may not give you an honest answer, but you may feel better by acknowledging that this friendship has come a cropper. They may be genuinely struggling financially and, while that must be hard for them to deal with, they — and they alone — bear the sole responsibility for that. Some people will only be around for the good times. Others will relish the bad times. But true friends will celebrate and commiserate, and be there for both.\n\nIf this friendship doesn't recover, that's OK. What was your part? Were you quietly competing with them too? Either way, I believe that we journey through people, and just because a friendship ends does not mean it was not a success for the time that it lasted. Sometimes, they simply run their course. Finally, every challenging experience we have and every person we meet is here to teach us something. And so what has this decades-long friendship taught you?\n\nLearn to master your money:Sign up for MarketWatch's FREE live series to boost your financial IQ\n\nHello there, MarketWatchers.

NEW YORK (AP) — Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen are teaming up for an eight-episode Spotify podcast series, swapping stories about their upbringings and even a White House singalong around a piano.\n\nThe first two episodes of Renegades: Born in the USA, a conversation recorded at Springsteen's guitar-filled home studio in New Jersey, were made available on Monday.\n\nSee also: Tech CEO says Twitter needs to go 'all in' on subscriptions\n\nSpotify SPOT, -0.47% has moved aggressively in podcasts over the past three years, and made other programming announcements Monday. The audio streaming service has already worked with Barack and Michelle Obama's production company Higher Ground, and the former first lady's podcast is the service's most popular original.\n\nThe seemingly offbeat relationship between the former president and the rock star began when Springsteen performed at benefits for Obama during his presidential campaigns. But it has blossomed into deeper conversations since he left office, Obama said in the first episode.\n\nHe's a rock 'n' roll icon, he said. I'm a lawyer and politician. Not as cool. And as I like to remind Bruce every chance I get, he's more than a decade older than me.\n\nThe men recalled a White House visit, which included Springsteen playing the piano as Broadway and Motown tunes were sung. There were libations involved, Obama said.\n\nSpringsteen uses a few of those guitars during the course of the podcast. In that first episode, both men recalled feeling like outsiders growing up and turning to their fields as a way of finding their voices, with a little megalomania involved. In later episodes, they talk about racism, fatherhood and marriage.\n\nTheir wives, Michelle Obama and Patti Scialfa, bonded, sealing their friendship.\n\nWe still have a fundamental belief in the American ideal, Obama said. Not as nostalgia. But as a compass.\n\nThe Renegades: Born in the USA series title references one of Springsteen's biggest hits and could also be a sly reference to the birther campaign where Obama's eventual successor, Donald Trump, falsely suggested Obama's origins were outside of the country.\n\nSpotify said Monday it was working with Higher Ground on another podcast, Tell Them I Am, which compiles stories from Muslim voices and will debut throughout Ramadan.\n\nThe service also said it had reached a deal with Warner Brothers and DC Comics for a series of narrative podcasts, with the first being Batman Unburied. Director Ava DuVernay is participating in a new podcast about high profile cases of police brutality.\n\nSpotify is also upgrading its sound, announcing that it will debut Spotify HiFi later this year, where members with Spotify-connected speakers can sign up for enhanced quality music streams.
Dear Quentin,\n\nI am married and have been in the same relationship for a number of years. We have both been single parents from prior relationships. Considering our age gap, he is much more successful in life as a sole proprietor. He is more than a decade older than me. He talked about a prenuptial agreement during our relationship, but he did not spring it on me until three days prior to our wedding day.\n\nWe discussed nothing as to what would go into the agreement. I was severely depressed and cried uncontrollably for days. Even reliving this is causing heartache. I consulted with my attorney but decided to sign it rather than not go through with the wedding. For several years, I asked for a copy and he couldn't find it. When I finally had enough, I found it in his office and made myself a copy.\n\n 'I'm angry at myself now because there are provisions I would have included had I had more time to think about it.' \n\nI still don't fully understand what happened, and I'm angry at myself now because there are provisions I would have included had I had more time to think about it. My parents will be willing me a home and a nice considerable amount of cash. I'm not in his will, there is no life-insurance policy, and I'm not listed on the deed of the second vacation home we bought before we married, but he wants to say how everything is ours.\n\nTechnically, it isn't. Now that I am about to start my own venture, which may be lucrative (potentially six figures a year), I want to amend the prenuptial agreement. In a way, I want to hurt him the same way he hurt me. It's caused a lot of resentment on my end as I feel he never trusted me, although I have never asked him for anything. If he dies tomorrow, what is going to happen to me?\n\nShould I amend the prenuptial agreement? Is it possible that the current prenuptial agreement is null and void?\n\nPostnuptial State of Mind\n\nYou can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nDear Postnuptial,\n\nYou should know what's in your own prenuptial agreement, given that it's a legal document you both signed. I don't understand why you did not have a copy when you originally signed the document, and why you didn't actively insist on a discussion. With the help of your lawyer, that was your job to make sure that happened. You had the choice to call off the wedding and/or sit down and read every page. I'm not saying this to be provocative, but to remind you that taking responsibility for this sequence of events is more constructive than taking umbrage at your husband.\n\nBut let's be very clear: Three days' notice of a prenuptial agreement before your wedding without any willingness to compromise on the details or discuss them is sorely lacking in consideration, and is a chaotic and unsettling start to a marriage. I understand why it left you reeling, and why you felt both confused and angry. In a marital property state, in the absence of a prenup, assets are distributed in a fair and equitable manner. Inheritance is not considered marital property, so you should have no worries on that front.\n\n It was not a good way to embark on a marriage and, as a tangent to your question, it's not a good way to continue one. \n\nYour prenuptial agreement should reflect that you both maintain your separate finances and assets in the event you divorce. In other words, what's his is his and what's yours is yours. He can't have it both ways. According to Rowe Law Offices, Historically, courts sometimes set aside premarital agreements when they were unreasonable; left one spouse destitute; were made without full disclosure of a spouse's property and debt; were signed under duress or without mental capacity; were the product of fraud or misrepresentation; and so on.\n\nShould you amend the prenup? You can certainly create an amendment, as long as both of you are in agreement, or sign a new postnuptial contract that supersedes the original contract. But that is a question only you can answer based on what the prenup actually says, and whether your lawyer believes it is written in a way that gives you both the same financial independence post-divorce. The whole business seems messy and unpleasant. It was not a good way to embark on a marriage and, as a tangent to your question, it's not a good way to continue one.\n\nCertainly, something needs to change. From the little you have said, it appears to be a marriage that lacks transparency and mutual respect. You need a financial therapist, a mediator or your own counselor to examine the causes and cures of this toxic atmosphere. Starting a business should be a time of optimism and joy, not steeped in an I'll show you entrepreneurial revenge fantasy. Getting married is the biggest financial decision you will make in your life, if only because of the toll divorce takes on an individual, and because you may end up taking turns supporting each other.\n\nIf this marriage ends, you should both leave with what you brought into it. Given that, the real issue here is not what happens in the event of a divorce, but everything else that comes before it.\n\nThe Moneyist:My wife has homeschooled our son and our best friends' son since September due to COVID-19.

In the credit-card turf war, platinum wraps plastic.\n\nA premium credit card is typically associated with high social status and higher fees, but recent research suggests that people will choose them because it signifies higher income over and above its benefits. Economists worked with an Indonesian bank that markets premium platinum credit cards to high-income customers. Demand for the platinum card greatly exceeds demand for a nondescript control product with identical benefits, according to the study distributed Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a Cambridge, Mass.-based research group.\n\nWhat's more, the lower your self-esteem, the more likely you will opt for flashy credit cards with higher fees. Social image is a substitute for self-image, the researchers wrote. Demand for status is psychological in nature. Cross-referencing spending habits with psychological tests, the researchers found that increasing self-esteem causally reduces demand for status goods. (The study was carried out by economists from the University of Chicago, The World Bank, Sao Paulo School of Economics, Harvard University and University of California, Los Angeles.)\n\nThere's one real-world drawback: Consumers may use the platinum card in social situations when they're better off using a less prestigious card. It can be a costly mistake, the study found. While the card used in our study does not offer cash back rewards, at least 48% of platinum customers report owning other credit cards which do offer cash back at restaurants and similar transactions. In order to appear wealthier, in other words, customers may actually forgo money in the form of cash rewards each time they use the platinum card instead of other cards in those situations.\n\nDon't miss:The larger the rock, the rockier the marriage\n\nPrevious studies have identified impulsivity among people who want to escape unhappiness and low self-esteem. This 2010 study in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found that individuals conspicuously consume to signal their wealth. Or, put in academic terms, The compensatory role of high-status goods has important implications for consumer decision-making and public policies aimed at reducing consumer debt. Understanding why we put certain goods on credit is important to controlling our impulses, the researchers said.\n\nPremium credit cards are becoming increasingly extravagant. Several metal credit cards have been released in recent months. In March, U.S. Bank USB, +2.90% , announced the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite Card, which the bank hopes will rival Chase's JPM, +1.45% Sapphire Reserve and American Express's AXP, -1.55% Platinum. Even Amazon AMZN, -3.37% used a minimalist metal design for its Prime Rewards Visa V, -0.94% card. They're targeting big spenders and, if the latest research reflects U.S. consumers, those who want to appear to be big spenders.\n\nHigh-end cards like the Sapphire Reserve and Amex Platinum charge hundreds of dollars a year to carry them, but often give out a large number of reward points initially. Despite such high fees, consumers may also have a hard time spending all those rewards to make those cards worth it. If every Sapphire Reserve card user's spending qualified for the 100,000 point sign-up bonus — which was later reduced to 50,000 points — they'd have around 91 billion points to spend, an equivalent of more than $1 billion, the personal-finance website NerdWallet calculated.
Dear Moneyologist,\n\nIt took a couple of months, but I finally managed to get out of the relationship I told you about in my previous letter. When I did, my boyfriend threatened to disclose personal details about my life that I don't want others knowing.\n\nAs you can imagine, I don't want anything to do with him. If he is going to be petty, then I feel I need to have my bases covered in terms of property that was exchanged in our relationship.\n\nNotably, before any of this happened, I had ordered my ex the latest 128-gigabyte iPhone 7. I was advised to cancel this order because it sends mixed signals if my wish is to cease communication with him. There is a part of me that feels I should inform my ex that I have canceled the order, so he can make arrangements to get the new phone if he so desires. However, I am afraid of triggering him to disclose these details of my life; given his recent behavior towards me, does this courtesy go out with the bath water?\n\nThe second question I have is how to deal with a promise ring. It was given to me last Christmas. I looked up the price of the ring and its listed retail price is $400 and is selling for $250. I have absolutely no problems giving the ring back — nor has he asked for it — but I am trying to do the right thing if somehow a promise was unfulfilled.\n\nPlease advise me. I don't mean to be petty and stupid, even though my problem is.\n\nTrying to Work through the Damage in California\n\nDear Trying,\n\nNever do anything out of fear — unless you're fleeing a burning building, of course.\n\nIt is truly abhorrent that he would even think about disclosing personal details about your life. Don't dignify this intimidation by paying $749 for his iPhone 7. If you do, you are living in the shadow of his threat. To break free from this relationship, cancel the iPhone order (if you still can) and do something really nice with that money. If it involves sitting on a beach with a cocktail, raise your glass to the universe to give thanks for this experience. (Here's a five-night all-inclusive vacation in Cancun for $749 exactly.) You may not know it now, but you have probably learned a great deal.\n\n You dodged a bullet, lost a promise ring and gained $749. I'd say you come out of this ahead.  — The Moneyologist\n\nAmong those lessons: If something does not feel right, deal with it head on. In your last letter, you wrote of this possible marriage to him, I want to be able to protect my assets, which I said sounded transactional. After you read my answer, you wrote to say that you realized that you were likely looking for reasons to end the relationship. Whether you were hesitant about marrying a man with two children or his uncertain financial situation, you did not want to take the relationship farther. Trust your gut. Sometimes, it's the best guide we have in areas of romance and finance.\n\nDon't miss:Will a flip phone give other people the wrong impression?\n\nSpeaking of the universe giving you a helping hand, Apple AAPL, -2.32% appears to be having supply issues with its new iPhone 7. My MarketWatch colleague Jennifer Booton recently reported that shipment estimates for the iPhone 7 Plus are now October and versions of the jet black iPhone may not arrive until November. The silver, black, gold and rose gold iPhones are all on a two-to-three-week delay, she wrote. While other consumers can't wait to get their hands on the new iPhone 7 and are probably fuming at the delay, this is good news for you.\n\nSo cancel the iPhone. The fact that he could be using this phone to text people unflattering stories about you just makes it all the more urgent that you do. If he does want to do that, let him do it on his old flip phone, or whatever he's using. Return the promise ring, however. The relationship is over. It would seem churlish to resell it. If his iPhone has arrived and it's too late to cancel the order, still give back the promise ring. Add a polite, but civil note, saying that it would not seem appropriate to keep the ring, and you hope he finds someone to give it to.\n\nYou dodged a bullet, lost a promise ring and gained $749. I'd say you came out of this ahead.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? Send them to MarketWatch's Moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nWould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new Moneyologist column has been published?

The long-held assumption that children will be better off than their parents were appears to be faltering.\n\nAmericans are not very optimistic about their children's financial futures. Only 37% of Americans believe today's children will grow up to be better off than their parents were financially, a sentiment unchanged since 2013, according to a recent survey by Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C. It is very hard for people to thrive when health-care, housing and education costs are so high, said David Grasso, the editor of GenFKD, an education and economy advocacy group for millennials. Those are three realities threatening the ability for present and future generations to thrive.\n\nAmericans aren't the only people pessimistic about future generations' finances. Canadians aren't very hopeful, nor are those in France, Greece, Japan, Australia, Kenya and Mexico. Overall, a median of 41% of residents in countries Pew surveyed believe children in their country will be better off. The gloomy outlooks comes even as people view their country's economy positively — 58% of Americans, for example, said the economic standing of the U.S. was good in a separate Pew survey earlier this year. Pew interviewed about 40,000 residents in 38 countries.\n\nEverything you need to do in your 20s for a great financial future\n\nSee:Millennials: This is how to fix your money to get the retirement you want\n\nOlder Americans are much more pessimistic than younger ones — 61% of Americans 50 and older say the next generation is in trouble. Among 18- to 29-year-olds, less than half (49%) believe even younger Americans will be worse off. Older Americans in particular may have trouble envisioning a future free from a housing market that would have been out of reach to them in their 20s and 30s, stagnant wage growth and student debt that has tripled to $1.3 trillion from $481 billion a decade ago, Grasso said. Not to mention modern society's obsession with smartphones.\n\nOne possible reason for the downbeat assessment of young people's future could be that millennials aren't as well-off as their parents were when their parents were their age, according to a report from Young Invincibles, an advocacy group for young Americans. That's in part because they earn lower incomes than their parents did, according to Young Invincibles report. The report analyzed Federal Reserve Board of Governors public surveys from 1989 and 2013 and found millennials earn lower incomes than their parents did.\n\nSee also: Millennials need to worry about these 4 things — in addition to saving for retirement\n\nYounger Americans also face a host of financial constraints that previous generations didn't. Millennials have a reputation for delaying marriage and homebuying and living at home with their parents for longer than any generation before them, but there's more to it: There's an increasing number of young people who are staying home to help their parents or save for a down payment on a house. But younger Americans' lack of worry about the future also means they're saving less for retirement.
Welcome to Capital Confidential — a weekly diary column featuring the best tidbits from around the U.K.'s business and political landscape from MarketWatch sister publication Financial News.\n\nThis week: Martha Lane Fox voices despondency on eliminating tech's gender imbalance, and star-studded goings-on at Davos...\n\nMartha gives up on tech gender pay gap\n\nMartha Lane Fox, co-founder of Lastminute.com, who now runs responsible tech think-tank Doteveryone, is renowned for being one of the business community's cheeriest entrepreneurs. But Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho is despairing at the chance of the gender pay gap ever being eliminated in her lifetime in her industry. Asked by the Media Masters podcast about tech's notorious gender imbalance, Lane Fox — who sits as a crossbencher in the House of Lords — said: When you look at the numbers, they're unbelievably disappointing and dispiriting. There are more women, as a percentage, in the House of Lords than there are in technology; a 1,000-year-old institution versus something that didn't even exist 30, 40 years ago. So, I'm not sure we're ever actually going to get to a level playing field, because if you look at the trajectory now we're actually going backward, and yet this is a sector that is growing bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\nLane Fox reckons that studies back her gloomy gender prognosis.We're not making progress, she laments. I am an optimist, but I think we have to be realistic. McKinsey did some work to show when there's going to be gender parity across various different [sectors]… Politics was going to be about 75 years. Awful, but you can imagine I might still be alive if I take the right drugs and put the right face cream on. Business, I think a bit less, maybe 50 years. But then in STEM [science, technology, engineering and maths] or anything to do with technology, never — because the trajectory's either flat or backwards… but it doesn't mean we shouldn't focus on it relentlessly.\n\nRetail politics\n\nTalk that Santander's U-turn on appointing Andrea Orcel, the former head of UBS's investment bank, as CEO was due to a potential populist uprising in Spain over the size of his pay packet, and less to do with reservations over the Italian dealmaker's modus operandi, is looking cheap after the elitist adventures of Ana Botín, the Spanish retail bank's chair. In the same week that Santander announced it was closing 140 branches in the UK, Botín attended the Institute of International Finance meeting in Zurich and was then on stage at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos alongside assorted politicos. Given Santander's recent woes of late, it seemed fitting that Botín found herself at the Davos forum having to mediate a contentious exchange between Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and former European Parliament President Martin Schulz.\n\nDavos House party\n\nMeanwhile, the prevalence of celebrities attending the WEF annual meeting has been much discussed, and there's no doubt that the most star-studded haunt was at Davos House. The event space partnered with organizations including Red, Bono's Aids initiative, children's charity Unicef and conservation organization WWF in an effort to raise awareness about the U.N.'s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, and the likes of Bill Gates, Matt Damon, John Kerry and David Attenborough dropped by. Capital hears former Treasury pals Matt Hancock and George Osborne, now health secretary and Evening Standard editor respectively, also made an appearance in Davos House at the same time daredevil magician David Blaine was there showing off his tricks. Given Blaine's previous stunts include spending 44 days suspended in a glass box by the Thames, the political pair — both of whom have been wringing their hands over Brexit — could have been forgiven for begging the illusionist to try to pull an EU-related rabbit out of a hat.\n\nSlice of modesty\n\nThere was a welcome injection of modesty at the press party hosted by Amundi the other week. Laurent Guillet, the London chief executive of Europe's largest asset manager, introduced proceedings and proudly declared that Amundi managed €1.5bn before correcting himself to the right amount, which he said was €1.5tn. Then a galette des rois, a lavish French cake traditionally eaten on Twelfth Night, was wheeled out with Fany de Villeneuve, Amundi's UK head of PR, warning guests: From experience I can tell you that if you have a big piece now you won't need any dinner tonight… or breakfast tomorrow.\n\nFast-food Guy\n\nGuy Hands might be more famous for his fast feuds than fast food, but the private equity tycoon is loving running the McDonald's franchise in the Nordic region. Students attending the London School of Economics' alternative investments conference must have been bemused to hear Hands telling them to snap up McDonald's franchises and that a golden arches diet was working wonders for his waistline. I have found a way to eat McDonald's every day and lose weight, Hands said. I have a protein-based lunch with salad consisting of less than 500 calories and under two grams of sugar. I'm down 26 lbs so far.\n\nGoldman and boy\n\nGoldman Sachs banker Dirk Lievens was made partner at the U.S. bank four years ago, so he knows a thing or two about living the dream. But in a soul-stirring post on LinkedIn, Lievens, who heads up Goldman's team in Europe, said his 12-year-old son Pietro has shown him how it is really done. A few weeks after Lievens told his son to get real about his chances of becoming a professional footballer — even though he plays as a junior for Crystal Palace Football Club (I laid out the probabilities and then told him to go back upstairs [and] finish his homework, Lievens wrote) — on Father's Day enterprising Pietro handed his old man a manuscript of Following Your Dream, a story he had written about three boys who are given a trial at Chelsea FC. The Lievens have self-published Pietro's book and Dirk is impressed with his son's literary achievements, with one caveat. I am Arsenal. He is Chelsea, he noted. Guess that is why the father in the book runs off in the first chapter.\n\nRemains of the divorce\n\nThe forthcoming divorce of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, from his wife MacKenzie after 25 years of marriage has yet to play out. But when the possessions are divvied up, Bezos will surely walk away with the family copy of Booker Prize-winning novel The Remains of the Day. It is Bezos's favorite novel of all time and he once said of the tome, which recounts the exploits of a dutiful butler in the mid-2oth century: Before reading it, I didn't think a perfect novel was possible. So Bezos might not like to hear that author Kazuo Ishiguro has told Capital that his 2005 dystopian novel Never Let Me Go has recently overtaken The Remains of the Day in sales. MacKenzie Bezos once posted a scathing one-star Amazon review of Bezos biographer Brad Stone's book The Everything Store, in which he claimed The Remains of the Day inspired Bezos to create Amazon. It isn't true, she wrote. Jeff didn't read The Remains of the Day until a year after he started Amazon. Halcyon days!
Dr. Anthony Fauci told Americans on Thursday to brace for more infections and deaths from COVID-19.\n\nWe believe things will get worse as we get into January, Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NPR in an interview. He called for an acceleration in public-health measures during this time.\n\nThe winter season and cold weather forcing people to socialize and work indoors, as well as travel and family gatherings associated with the holiday season, will likely amount to a terrible situation in January, the veteran immunologist said as the global COVID-19 death toll exceeded 1.9 million.\n\nWe want to get it to 1 million vaccinations per day, he added. The idea about having everyone for at least 100 days — at least — wear a mask. Everyone uniformly, so we don't have disparities where some people are adhering to public-health measures, and others are not.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, 5.9 million people in the U.S. had received their first vaccine dose and 21.4 million doses had been distributed in total, according to the CDC.\n\nAnd then also a greater interaction, cooperation between the federal government and the states, instead of letting the states in some respects do things on their own — to help them not only with plans, but with resources, Fauci added in the interview.\n\nHowever, Fauci noted that people have COVID-19 fatigue and a national lockdown is not feasible. I don't think this is something that we're ready for on a countrywide basis. But, you know, you have to keep your eye on everything that's going on and always keep all options open.\n\nAs the months go by, I would expect by the time we get to April, it will be what we call open season on vaccines, he added. Everyone will be able to get a vaccine. So I think by the end of the summer, if we get 70% to 85% of the population vaccinated and get a good herd immunity.\n\nDispatches From a Pandemic:It's 2:30 a.m. in Wyoming: 'You're holding a smartphone to let a husband say goodbye to his wife via FaceTime after 60 years of marriage'\n\nFauci has previously warned that Americans are facing a dark time and the potential surge over the holidays could lead to a dark January, This may be even more compounded because it's a longer holiday, he told CNN last month. Infections have exceeded 89.2 million worldwide.\n\nThe U.S. set a record for COVID-19-related hospitalizations this month with more than 131,889 patients, and the number of people with the virus in ICUs has surpassed 23,866. The U.S. had 21.9 million cases and 369,830 fatalities as of Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe U.S. lost at least 4,111 lives on Thursday from COVID-19, the most in a 24-hour period since the start of the pandemic, according to a New York Times tracker, and reported a record 280,028 new cases. Those do not, for the most part, include those who are asymptomatic.\n\nPfizer PFE, -0.11% and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX, -1.33% have said that a final analysis of their vaccine candidate showed 95% efficacy. Meanwhile, Moderna MRNA, -5.43% said its vaccine candidate was about 94% effective.\n\nOn Friday, BioNTech and Pfizer said an in vitro study found that their COVID-19 vaccine neutralizes the two new highly infectious variants that have emerged in the U.K. and South Africa. The results were published on the preprint service bioRxiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed.
Some things always seem to signal the change from winter to spring. The first crocus. The sound of birds chirping. Turning the clocks ahead an hour.\n\nOn Sunday, March 14, at 2 a.m., people in most areas of the U.S. will turn their clocks ahead one hour to daylight-saving (not savings) time.\n\nYou may have already noticed that it's staying lighter later, thanks to the normal course of the Earth's movements in relation to the sun, but daylight-saving time turbocharges this process. Of course, no daylight is actually being saved. We're just moving an hour of daylight to later in the day — so, for example, on March 14 when the clock reads 6 p.m., it will look pretty much as bright as it was at 5 p.m. the day before. By the time June is here, we'll be able to enjoy the twilight well into the evening.\n\nRead: Why daylight saving and 'March madness' could cause you to lose sleep over your investments\n\nNot everyone participates in this temporal engineering. A handful of U.S. states and territories, including much of Arizona (excluding the Navajo nation), Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, stick to standard time.\n\nMany people welcome the tradition of springing forward. It means an extra hour of daylight in the evenings, and signals the approach of spring and summer. So what's the problem?\n\nWell, some people complain about the lost hour of sleep (although they'll probably be back on their game within a day or so), as well as the dark mornings for early risers. And be careful: Some studies show there's an uptick in morning car accidents after the switch because people aren't used to traveling in the darkness. It might even be bad for your marriage.\n\nRead: 5 ways life would be better if we remained on Daylight Time forever\n\nHaters can start counting down the days until we (in the U.S.) turn our clocks back an hour and fall back to standard time on the first Sunday in November.\n\nTake note: In Europe, daylight-saving time doesn't begin until the last Sunday in March (March 28 this year), and Asia, for the most part, doesn't get involved.\n\nSo even though we still have a few weeks to go until it's officially spring, and in much of the country a lot longer until it actually feels like spring, celebrating daylight-saving time is a first step.\n\n(This story has been updated because this occurs yearly.)
Stormy Daniels takes Manhattan.\n\nThe adult-film star, director and author of the 2018 memoir, Full Disclosure, kicked off the first leg of her nationwide storytelling tour, An Intimate Evening With Stormy Daniels, on Tuesday evening at Stand Up NY, a small comedy club on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She talked about her life and answered audience questions about topics ranging from Donald Trump, his former personal attorney Michael Cohen and her former lawyer Michael Avenatti.\n\n 'Now I've turned 40, I only want three things from a man: good Wi-Fi, a good credit score and good parking.'  — —Stormy Daniels\n\nDaniels has simple requirements for the next man in her life. Now that I'm 40, she said, I only want three things from a man: good Wi-Fi, a good credit score and good parking. Daniels, a single mother who reportedly charges $10,000 per appearance, is not alone in wanting a partner who is financially secure and can also demonstrate that he can manage his own finances.\n\nMore than 40% of adults say knowing someone's credit score would make them think twice about dating that person. Women were nearly three times as likely to consider credit score a major influence on a potential partner compared to men (20% versus 7%). Credit scores also reveal an individual's relationship skill, trustworthiness and level of commitment, a 2015 paper by researchers at UCLA, the Brookings Institution and Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe audience wrote questions on cards for Daniels to answer. One person asked if there was any chemistry between her and her former lawyer, Michael Avenatti, who has been charged in a 36-count federal indictment alleging he stole millions of dollars from clients, did not pay his taxes, committed bank fraud and lied in bankruptcy proceedings. (Avenatti, 48, pleaded not guilty.) She said no. I was never in a room with him alone, Daniels said, adding, He thought he was prettier.\n\nStormy Daniels at Stand Up NY on Manhattan's Upper West Side.\n\nAlso see:When wives earn more than their husbands, their marriage is less likely to last\n\nHer life has changed since The Wall Street Journal revealed in January 2018 that Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in October 2016, a month before the U.S. presidential election, to stop her from talking about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen started a three-year sentence on Monday for tax evasion, making false statements to a bank and campaign-finance violations related to those hush-money payments. She was delighted that the man who arranged those payments is now in jail.\n\n On her former lawyer Michael Avenatti: 'I was never in a room with him alone. He thought he was prettier.'  — —Stormy Daniels\n\nDaniels said the sex scandal that propelled her into the spotlight has no relationship to #MeToo. She has always made clear that her alleged affair was consensual, but said the movement has made dating more fraught for men. I have to buy my own drinks now. People approach me less, probably because I have a very large man standing next to me, she said, citing her security detail. But she has no beef with men, in general. I don't think men are monsters, Daniels said.\n\nShe allegedly hooked up with Trump in a hotel room in 2006 after a celebrity golf tournament. She made it clear that she is not a fan of the president, or of his administration's policies, and said she hopes he's not re-elected. Daniels read a question from an audience member that asked if she would apologize to First Lady Melania Trump for her alleged fling with the married Trump 13 years ago. Daniels replied, I'll apologize to her when she apologizes to the country.
Dear Moneyologist,\n\nAfter years of my wife having numerous affairs, I had one of my own which resulted in twins. Their mother and I came to an agreement on child support amicably, which is about 40% more than what would have been ordered by the local courts. This has allowed her and the children to move significantly closer to where I live, so I am able to be a part of their lives.\n\nMy wife and I have decided to divorce. I know our assets will be split and since she only recently rejoined the workforce, I will have to pay alimony. My question is how the alimony will be calculated. Will the courts take into account the actual amount of child support I pay or only what the court calculates is appropriate?\n\nWorried Father in California\n\nDear Worried,\n\nCalifornia is a no-fault state, meaning that you can get divorced for pretty much any reason you want. Irreconcilable differences is commonly listed on a divorce petition in California. Another reason: Incurable insanity. In such a case, let's assume that you would be listing your spouse's incurable insanity and not your own. In other words, you might have one affair or a dozen, but a no-fault divorce means a faster and easier divorce for both of you. The judge will only be concerned that the marriage is over, and he or she is unlikely to care who is at fault.\n\nYour divorce attorney should advise you to outline the payments you already make to support your children and will calculate what is fair and reasonable given both incomes and your current expenditure.\n\nDon't miss: My wife left me after two days of marriage — should I divorce her?\n\nAnd you're not the first couple who walked into divorce court after having multiple affairs. Adultery is often a symptom rather than the cause of a breakdown in a relationship. Around one in four married people will admit to having engaged in sexual infidelity, Justin Lehmiller, a Purdue University psychologist and author of The Psychology of Human Sexuality, told The Wall Street Journal last year. It also shows that happy, faithful marriages are, at best, the norm and, at worst, at least possible.\n\nConsider yourself lucky. Believe it or not, adultery is categorized as a felony in Massachusetts, Idaho, Michigan, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, and a misdemeanor in several states (not California), although adulterers are rarely prosecuted in those states. So you're actually in a good place in regards to both your finances and your divorce.\n\nA married person who has sexual intercourse with a person not his spouse or an unmarried person who has sexual intercourse with a married person shall be guilty of adultery and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than three years or in jail for not more than two years or by a fine of not more than $500.\n\nThat's the law in Massachusetts and it's not as extreme as the penalties listed in the Old Testament, which states they shall both of them shall die.\n\nOn that note, good luck with the divorce.\n\n(This story was republished.)
Happy Friday, MarketWatchers! Here are some of Friday's top stories to read over the weekend.\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nNearly half of women who have abortions live below the federal poverty level\n\nAs Missouri, Georgia and Alabama move to restrict abortion access, the cost can vary by state, trimester, procedure and other factors.\n\n\n\nStudent-loan borrowers are using their vacation days to pay off their debt\n\nThis new employee benefit lets workers trade in their paid time off.
TOKYO—Taiwanese electronics assembler Foxconn Technology Group and Sharp Corp. scrambled to salvage their proposed marriage as investors questioned whether the companies could restore trust in each other after an 11th-hour breakdown in takeover talks.\n\nOn Friday, as Sharp's shares 6753, -0.86% plunged, Chief Executive Kozo Takahashi flew to Shenzhen, China, to meet Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou, according to people familiar with the situation.
Some people treat being single like a bad smell that won't go away. They think it's a recipe for a lifetime of misery. And were a person to be so bold as to be happy and single, balancing the two with the kind of aplomb only seen by a unicycle-riding circus juggler, they'd have science to contend with, in the form of a broad swath of studies that appear to prove that married people are happier.\n\nThe problem: Those studies are flawed — at least according to Bella DePaulo, the author of Singled Out and a project scientist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who by her own description has been single all my life, and I always loved it. She found that the way researchers study single people puts all divorced people into the single people category.\n\nNowadays, singledom is more widespread than ever before: The number of never-married people has only been growing over the years, and young people today are taking longer to marry, and a record percentage — 25% — may never marry, according to the Pew Research Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit think tank.\n\nBut because that lumps people whose relationships ended presumably because they weren't happy, the results grossly misrepresented the actual story, DePaulo said, making married people look better and single people look worse. In the long term, married couples — though there was a short-lived honeymoon effect right after they got hitched — weren't any happier on average years into marriage than they had been when single, DePaulo found.\n\nDon't miss:10 things married couples won't tell you\n\nSingle people are also more connected to other people than married people, have more friends and value meaningful work more. Even if you could employ the gold standard of scientific research to study this subject, randomly assigning married or single life to people, DePaulo said she believes it would be impossible to examine objectively. That's because of what she calls singlism and matrimania — the narrative favoring wedded bliss over perceived sad singledom.\n\nThough happily single herself, DePaulo doesn't think everyone else needs to be single to be happy — but that's true of married or partnered people too, she said. Embracing this idea, though, renders all the research about marrieds and singles alike meaningless, she said. At best, the quest for a universal truth about partnership will only capture the average experience. Science will never tell you that marriage is the right decision, or that walking down the aisle was a horrible mistake.
Dear Moneyist,\n\nMy fiancé — or should I say eternal fiancé because he never wants to get married — recently shocked me when he flatly stated that he wants me off the mortgage and deed to our newly purchased waterfront home. We have lived there for a year and pay 50/50 on everything. He didn't want to debate or talk about buying me out, he was more insistent and will not budge.\n\nThis happened following a conversation I instigated and in which I suggested we see an attorney to have a will drawn up, in case one of us passes away. The house is appreciating in value daily due to its location (it's worth $50,000 more already) and he wants his children to inherit it. He wants me to pay rent, which essentially leaves nothing for my children.\n\n 'I moved from another state and sold my beautiful home to be with this man. He sacrificed nothing.' \n\nI didn't want out prior to the conversation. I still love him, but I wanted to live a committed life where we were building a future together living in the same home. I feel like it is a slap in the face. I am shocked and brokenhearted and he is making me feel that I am making it all about me. I already gave up my dream of marriage.\n\nHe said that if I don't want to pay rent, we can live in separate houses and continue to date eternally, which to me sounds completely like a huge step backwards. I am a hard-working person with a very good credit rating, and I always pay my half of the mortgage a month in advance. He thinks I am unreasonable.\n\nI moved from another state and sold my beautiful home to be with this man. He sacrificed nothing. If I buy my own home, I doubt if he would stay overnight at my home. I just feel that his decision was influenced by money. I hate the way he is making me feel emotionally unstable and insecure because I disagree with him.\n\nWhat should I do now?\n\nFiancée\n\nDear Fiancée,\n\nAsking you to both quit-claim your share of the property to your boyfriend and take yourself off the mortgage — assuming the bank would even allow that, which is far from a given — is unreasonable. Using a wedding ring and your clear desire to get married as leverage is despicable.\n\nI disagree with you on one salient point: not getting married to this man after such a long engagement would be a huge step forward, as long as you take one more leap forward to freedom, with exactly 50% of this home that you purchased together.\n\n Let me introduce you to the sunk cost fallacy. \n\nLet me introduce you to the sunk cost fallacy: You spend an hour waiting for a bus so you wait another hour rather than taking a taxi. Or you sink $100,000 into a bad investment so you spend another $100,000 to keep it afloat because otherwise that first $100,000 would be wasted.\n\nThis is the dilemma you face with your fiancé. Let's start with dropping the term. It doesn't mean anything, except the promise of something happening that has not happened and is unlikely to happen and, I hope, with the right support, you agree would be a disaster for you if it did happen.\n\nIf this is how he treats you and your relationship now, imagine how he would treat you if you signed over your half of the house? Imagine how he would treat you if you did get married, heaven forbid. A girlfriend or wife who pays rent on a home she used to co-own?\n\nWhatever social contract you signed up to by becoming engaged has now been broken by his indecent proposal. If this house is rising in value, I suggest you both rent it out, live separately, and show him that what he thinks you want you don't want anymore. Or else sell the home.\n\n Whatever social contract you have signed has been broken. \n\nDid he need you to co-sign this mortgage, or is this just a random change of heart? Either way, stop calling him your fiancé for the purposes of this dilemma, and just view him as another human being who is offering you a bad deal, and using emotion to get it over the line.\n\nIf he tries to woo you back, remember this is who he is. People don't change. A partner who would make such a suggestion won't change who he is, he will merely put up a different type of wallpaper and move the furniture around to make you think everything is shiny and new.\n\nYou stayed with this man not because you wasted years but because it took the amount of time it took to learn what it was you were supposed to learn from this experience. Among the lessons: You deserve a good relationship, and you are able to face life on your own.\n\nYou can email The Moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.

In financial services, when most people talk about retirement planning it's about the numbers — saving, investing, preparing an income plan and a budget.\n\nPerhaps it's assumed that if you hit the magic age of retirement with the magic number in your portfolio, all will be great. The truth is that it's only a lucky few who bounce happily from one phase of life — their working years — to retirement without some feelings of displacement, loss or confusion. From my experience, it can be harder for men than women, so it's important to think about their emotional and social readiness with the same focus applied to building a financial plan.\n\nWho are you?\n\nAsk yourself, what identifies you today? How important is that career to your sense of belonging in the world? I had a long stage of life where my identity was completely wrapped up in getting ahead — at an Ivy League school, at work in a big investment company. But karma intervened, and life got complicated with marriage, children, some family illnesses and I had to step out of my comfort zone and, as they say, get a life.\n\nThis force from singular focus to multi-focus seems to happen to women naturally, even if they stay on a corporate track. I think of it as having a complex identity of piece parts — business leader, mom, wife, daughter, room parent, book club member, etc. While life gets crazy, I'm accustomed to switching from one self to another, and the process has given me a wide social network and a varied set of interests.\n\nThe challenge for the sexes\n\nThese connections are one reason that in my house, and among my friends, it's the wife's role to manage the family social life. As couples move into their 50s and begin thinking about retirement, this imbalance of connections is something that can cause big problems ahead. According to a 2015 Pew Research study, not only has the divorce rate among people over 50 doubled since 1990, over 66% of those divorces are initiated by the wives. Women are not only more financially independent, they have the support network making the single life look attractive.\n\nIn 2016, Fidelity did a study of over 9,000 people ages 55+ and found that 60% of men looked forward to spending more time with their spouses in retirement, versus 43% of women. Men tend to have fewer social ties than women and are more emotionally dependent on their spouses. This may not be true of the next generation, as social norms are changing, but it's something that is worth attention for any couple who have retirement on their minds.\n\nWomen can carry over parts of their identity and amplify them in retirement more easily than men. A different financial services study by TIAA in 2016 found that caregiving, socializing and community service expanded to take the place of paid work when women retired, and they continued to identify as contributing to the world. Men, whether married or not, tended to perceive retirement as a reward and they filled their time with sports and were more inclined to stay engaged in some aspects of their career. Unfortunately over time physical limitations may affect the sports plan, and work ties can fade, so men need to consciously expand their horizons.\n\nYour social and emotional plan\n\nAs I work with clients, I talk about their values and priorities as much or more than their portfolios, and these discussions can help them as individuals or couples prepare for a satisfying retirement life. I also uncover their emotions about money itself — and find for some people the mere thought of spending their wealth, rather than earning more money, creates anxiety. Ideally, we are having these conversations for many years before retirement, and they are continuing afterward to support them in their experience.\n\nIf you have even a few years to ready yourself for retirement, here are three important considerations and ideas for action plans to improve your transition:\n\n1. Who are your most important relationships over the course of your life, and what can you do to nurture them?\n\n2. What are your hobbies or activities you haven't tried that could interest you, and how could those become social networks?\n\n3. How do you define the idea of giving back and how could that be translated to a goal in retirement?\n\nAction for a happier retirement\n\nThe success of any plan depends on how well it's executed, so it helps to create specific objectives and consider how well you're meeting these objectives. Instead of a portfolio performance review, think about this as creating an index for personal retirement life readiness.\n\nQuite often, male and female clients who have led extremely busy lives will be wistful about old friendships and lost connections, but in the age of social media reconnecting can be easy. Making a list, reaching out, going to reunions and committing to entertaining more often are just come examples of action plans to reignite relationships. Family ties can be improved, too. Now is the time to invest in people you love.\n\nWomen have a knack for making even solo hobbies like knitting a social event, but men often need to do more work in this area. I know golfers who after 18 holes still can't describe what they really talked about with their partners. Being more conscious about conversations is a first step. Learning to be what I call a joiner is another action item — simply sign up and show up for group activities whether it's a yoga class or bird watching.\n\nMany retirees use some form of part-time work to ease the transition, but that's a deferral, not a long-term solution. For people with ongoing board positions and charity work, there's a ready-to-go way to continue to give back when their careers end. For other people, giving back can mean stepping up to larger caregiving roles within the extended family as grandparents. The point is, having a purpose beyond yourself is important for engagement and self-esteem, and the earlier you start developing these interests — the better.\n\nEnjoy a richer life\n\nMen, women and couples who prepare themselves socially and emotionally as well as financially can enjoy a rich life in retirement. Spouses who've addressed their desired balance of sharing and independence, who are clear on their priorities individually and together, often find the best years of marriage ahead of them. Advisers who work with clients to think of this broader definition of richness, beyond the money, will find that the years before and during retirement are when clients need them most.\n\nSo, don't be satisfied with a plan that's just about saving for retirement. Get in touch with your social and emotional needs to ensure a life worth saving for.\n\nYolanda Taylor is managing director at Prio Wealth.
Cameron Huddleston, author of Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk: How to Have Essential Conversations With Your Parents About Their Finances, remembers the birds-and-the-bees talk she had as a child with her mother. Huddleston says she'd give her mom a D at best because the talk was a single sentence saying that a man and woman lie together and make love.\n\nSadly, Huddleston says, many of us in our 50s and 60s are having the same kind of unhelpful talk with our parents about their finances. She notes in her book that a GoBankingRates survey found that 73% of adults haven't had detailed conversations with their parents about their finances. And that, the award-winning personal finance journalist maintains, is a giant problem for both generations.\n\nI interviewed Huddleston to find out why, how boomers and Gen Xers can initiate these conversations; what to do if your parent refuses to talk about money, estate planning or end-of-life planning and what she wishes she'd done differently helping her mother with her finances. Excerpts:\n\nNext Avenue: Why did you write this book and who is it for?\n\nCameron Huddleston: I wrote this book because of my experience with my mother. When I was 35 and she was 65, she was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I had not had a detailed conversation with her about her finances.\n\nWhen she was 60, I had had a conversation with her about long-term care insurance and said she should look into it. She had been divorced awhile and was living on her own and I knew if she needed care, a long-term care policy would help. Unfortunately, she couldn't get coverage because of a pre-existing health condition — not dementia. That would've been the perfect opportunity to have another conversation about her finances. It never crossed my mind.\n\nA few years later, when she started having signs of memory loss, I knew I had to meet quickly with her attorney to update her will and to get power of attorney. I knew she had to be mentally competent to sign them and without them I wouldn't have been able to step in to make health care and financial decisions for her. She was still competent enough, so she did.\n\nThat experience led me to writing this book. As I got more involved with my mom's finances, my friends started finding themselves in similar positions with their parents. They came to me asking how to have 'the conversation.' I realized no one should have to go through this alone. I wanted to help them figure this out, so I wrote the book.\n\nAnd what about your father?\n\nHe died at 61 without a will and in a second marriage.\n\nWere you surprised by that GoBankingRates survey showing that most adults haven't had detailed conversations with their parents about finances?\n\nIt's stunning, but it doesn't surprise me entirely from my own experience. I was a financial journalist and I didn't think about it!\n\nThat survey also found that 22% of adults don't think they should ever have this conversation because they think their parents' finances aren't any of their business. I can understand the reluctance. But that 22% who think their parents' finances are none of their business don't realize there's a good chance that their parents' finances will be their business at some point.\n\nAlso see: Have you started saving for your parents' old age?\n\nIt's better to have a plan and those legal documents in place and to have a discussion before an emergency arises.\n\nWhy does it matter whether adult children talk with their parents about the parents' finances? What happens if they don't?\n\nIf the parents don't have a will or an advance health care directive and haven't given their child power of attorney, then if they are no longer mentally competent — maybe due to dementia or a stroke or a car accident — the child can't step in and make financial and health decisions. The child would then have to go through a lengthy and expensive court process to be named a conservator or guardian of the parents.\n\nIn my book, I write about someone who spent thousands of dollars and nine months to become the dad's conservator. He had to pay his father's medical bills himself until he had access to his dad's bank account to get reimbursed.\n\nPeople don't realize that if mom has a stroke and the hospital transfers her to a nursing home, if you don't have access to her bank account, you can't sign the checks for her unless she signed over power of attorney.\n\nWhat are the other types of conversations adult children need to have with their parents?\n\nIt could be that your parents didn't save enough for retirement. You may need to encourage them to move somewhere smaller, more manageable and more affordable.\n\nOr they may not be doing a good job managing their finances. I'm not saying it's your job to step in and tell them what to do. But if you see that their mismanagement of finances will affect you, it could be to your benefit to try to have conversations to offer suggestions to get them back on track so they don't jeopardize your financial well-being.\n\nHow hard do you think it is for people in their 50s and 60s to talk with their parents about their parents' finances?\n\nI think people make these conversations in their minds to be more difficult than they're actually going to be.\n\nCertainly, some parents will resist having them. But I would say a majority of parents will come around if you let them know that you want to have the conversation because you're looking out for their best interest.\n\nIf they say: 'It's none of your business,' you can respectfully respond: 'It could be some of my business one day if you ever need my help. And as your child, I want to be able to help you. I want to care for you in the same way you cared for me when I was growing up. I feel I owe it to you.'\n\nDon't miss: Inheriting a parent's IRA or 401(k)? Here's how the Secure Act could create a disaster\n\nI think when most parents hear that, they will open up. Hopefully.\n\nSome parents think their kids are asking about a will because the kids are out for their money.\n\nYes. They may think that. Say: 'I don't care what I'll be getting. I just want to know that you have put your financial wishes in writing so we can do what you want. Because if you don't have a will, the state has one for you, and the people who will get your assets may not be the ones you want to get them.'\n\nSome of us fear that if our parents resist talking about these things when we first bring them up, they never will. What do you say?\n\nDon't give up if your parents resist the first time. Keep trying. It doesn't mean you need to nag your parents every time you see them. But look for opportunities to have the conversations. If they complain how difficult it is for them to take care of the house, that's an opening for a conversation saying that it might be easier to move into an apartment or a retirement community.\n\nWhat do you think adult children do wrong when it comes to having the talk?\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes people tend to make in their 50s or 60s is they tend to be condescending when talking to their parents. If you approach the conversation from the point of view that 'I know more about these things and I see you making mistakes and I'm going to point them out,' that just embarrasses a parent and puts them on the defensive and they shut down.\n\nI wouldn't point out that your parents are making mistakes. Put yourself in your parent's shoes and consider how you want your own children talking to you. You need to be respectful.\n\nAnd you don't want to give parents ultimatums, like: 'Mom, Dad, if you don't tell me details of your finances, I won't take care of you if you need it.' That's not going to work. They're going to say: 'Fine, I don't need your help.'\n\nWhat are some of the most important topics for the adult children and their parents to talk about and why?\n\nWhether your parent has estate planning documents like an advance directive and power of attorney, and where. They're essential.\n\nIf they don't have these documents, you want to be sure they meet with an attorney or you can go online for a low cost and get the documents in place.\n\nWhat else?\n\nYou want to try to find out how they pay the bills. So if something were to happen, how can we all make sure your bills will get paid? Are they set up automatically or do you write a check?\n\nAnd then you might say: 'I would like to help you set up automatic bill paying and online banking.' I know some older adults can be reluctant and see this as risky, but explain that it's a safeguard and they can check on these bills every day.\n\nAnd then, if they're willing, get as many details as possible about what type of insurance policies they have and their sources of income and their debts. You can ask them to write it down for you with a list of their accounts.\n\nYou can say: 'I'd love to know your username and password for these accounts, so I can access them in case of an emergency.' They may not want to tell you, but they may be willing to write this down.\n\nWhat's your advice about doing these kinds of things if you have siblings?\n\nIdeally, you should talk with your siblings before you have conversations with your parents. You want everyone to be on the same page and you don't want to exclude anyone. If you don't talk to your siblings about this, they might resent you for leaving them out.\n\nDecide what roles you can all play in the financial lives of your parents as they age. Perhaps one who lives closer will be willing to provide more hands-on care while another might be in charge of the parents' finances. When you go to your parents, let them know. Hopefully, this is going to lift a burden off them.\n\nIt doesn't work in every family. Some siblings don't get along or have different ideas about what's best for Mom and Dad. Point out that it's not what we think is best for Mom and Dad, but to figure out what they want.\n\nAnd what do you do when your parent simply won't discuss any of this and won't give you power of attorney?\n\nYou can say: 'I understand.' Then you can take one of two approaches.\n\nOne is saying: 'I understand you don't want to talk about finances now, but let's think about situations when you would be willing to share some information and you might need some help.' Maybe it's when one parent has a health issue, if Dad passes away and Mom's left alone. Ask them to identify those moments and write down situations when it might be OK to step in. Help make that list and hang onto it. And then when the time comes, come back and say: 'We agreed we would talk.'\n\nOr you can use a story. Say: 'I understand you don't want to have this conversation now and we don't need to; everyone's health is good. But I have a friend whose mother was perfectly healthy and she started having issues with her memory and my friend realized if she didn't get her mother to meet with an attorney soon, it would be too late to step in and help her mom with finances as her memory worsened.'\n\nFor power of attorney, you could say: 'Is there someone you are comfortable naming as power of attorney? I understand it feels like you are giving up control. But if you don't name someone you trust and something were to happen and you were no longer able to make financial decisions on your own, someone will have to make them for you. You'll want to be sure your bills are getting paid.'\n\nWhat about getting a third party involved?\n\nThat's a possibility. You could say: 'I recently updated my legal documents. Maybe you want to meet with my attorney?'\n\nFinal thoughts?\n\nThese conversations can't wait. And as difficult as they might seem, the consequences of not having them can be far worse.
Hi, Carolyn: My husband and I will be traveling to attend my mom's wedding. It's either a 13-hour drive (now that we have a child, it would probably actually eat up an entire day) or a 1½ -hour flight, plus brief transportation at each end. My husband hates to fly — mostly because he is frugal and dislikes being shuffled around by airlines, but he also has slight confinement anxiety. He has a prescription for this when he absolutely has to fly, and it works well.\n\nMeanwhile, I enjoy flying, don't mind paying for the convenience and seriously do NOT want to sign on for a gruesome road trip with a toddler who is pretty well-behaved on a plane.\n\nThis difference between us makes it hard to plan not only this trip, but also hypothetical future travel. I proposed that I fly with the toddler, which would give me more time to spend with family, and that he drive, if that's his preference. It infuriated him that I would consider abandoning him to drive alone. He seems to think the only answer is that we both do the road trip thing, which I do not think makes sense.\n\nWhat do we do in this case, and when this inevitably comes up again?\n\nSpouse\n\nSpouse: Why just deal with stubbornness and anxiety when you can have a boundary issue, too?\n\nYou have my sympathies. It's one thing to have a partner who is irrational on a particular issue — we all have our stuff, after all — but another for a furious partner to expect everyone to live in service of that irrationality.\n\nYou do have two advantages, though — time and distance. As in, this isn't a problem of culture or perception, like deciding whether gender roles are appropriate or how much one defers to Grandma. This hinges on how long it takes you to travel how far. Useful simplicity.\n\nThat means you can actually quantify what he's asking of you and draw the line where you think he's asking too much.\n\nLet's say a drive is seven hours, where flying instead would involve 30 minutes to the airport, a 90-minute cushion for parking and security, a one-hour flight and another hour on the ground at your destination — so, four hours. Call it five to be generous and allow for delays and other hassles of air travel.\n\nThat means the cost of indulging your husband is two or three hours. Are you okay with that, yes or no? You decide for yourself, of course, but that doesn't sound too awful to me.\n\nNow take the trip you're contemplating. The flight and ground transportation look to be about a four-hour commitment, compared with a 13-hour drive, which pegs your indulge-the-spouse cost at nine hours. In a car with a toddler. Instead of with family.\n\nAgain — you decide what's right for you, but if I were doing that I'd want a prescription assist of my own.\n\nSo do the math, figure out what your pain limit is for extra driving, then explain it as such to your husband. Make it clear — you will gladly accommodate him up to X hours, and after that you hope he will accommodate you by either traveling separately as you suggest, or adopting your pain limit as his absolutely has to fly threshold.\n\nYou can't make him agree to this, of course. You can, however, stick to your own limit by not agreeing to gruesome car trips, even flying solo against his wishes if you must. While it isn't ideal, it's a valid response to accusations of abandoning him, which are controlling and highly manipulative.\n\nIf that's his default and not just a flight-anxiety-specific bit of emotional slumming (his airline resistance screams control issues), then make sure good marriage counseling comes next. Do that alone, too, if you must.\n\nDear Carolyn: My husband and I are deciding whether to have kids. We live in an expensive city far away from any family. No one has visited us in the four years we've lived here.\n\nI can't imagine raising kids with no support system, it scares me! My job is highly specialized, so I don't really get to choose where I live, and we probably will never live anywhere near our families. How do I move past the fear of raising children without the village?\n\nFar Away\n\nFar Away: You remind yourself that you're human: What you don't have, you scrounge, improvise or make.\n\nThere's nothing that says you have to have kids, of course. It might just not be for you.\n\nBut if you want to be a parent, then do what countless others have done who, like you, have relocated for better opportunities — or who emigrated, or outlived their families, or cut ties after years of dysfunction. You discard preconceptions and develop a network of friends, paid caregivers, drop-in centers, schools and whatever else you need. You study your employers' leave policies. And you trust the resourcefulness that made you a specialized, big-city asset to serve you here, or in whatever challenge you take on next.
Two of them — Ya Kaka, 19, and Hauwa, 18 — are risking everything to ensure that their stories, and the stories of their fellow captives, are heard. They've spent the past two weeks meeting with U.S. and U.N. officials to recount the atrocities committed against them by Boko Haram.\n\nYa Kaka was kidnapped at 16, along with her two sisters. Hauwa was 15 when Boko Haram fighters stormed her family's thatched-roof home. Her parents were killed. She was taken. This public advocacy will make both women targets at home. Ya Kaka will have to move to a new city, where no one knows her past. She says it's worth it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe hope to let people know the true situation of what is happening, the 19-year-old said.\n\nBoko Haram has been especially destructive in northeast Nigeria, waging a brutal campaign to take control of large parts of the country. In 2017 alone, the group killed 900 people and carried out more than 900 attacks. The lawmakers who met with the girls already know those statistics. Ya Kaka and Hauwa offered a more personal account of what happened. They talked, too, about their dreams: to finish school, then go into public service. The gathering captured the emotional dichotomies of the occasion: Washington elite and survivors of sex slavery; opportunity and profound loss.\n\nTheir stories began in September 2014, when Boko Haram decimated their city, Bama, near the Cameroonian border. The assault was gruesome. Many of Bama's 350,000 residents fled. Men who couldn't escape were killed and put in mass graves. Thousands of girls and women, some as young as 8, were forced to travel on foot to camps where they became sex slaves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHauwa and Ya Kaka were marched into the Sambisa Forest and kept in tiny huts, raped nightly by their male captors. Like many captives, Ya Kaka was married off — though that didn't protect her from near-daily rape from multiple men. Her husband would force her to walk naked through the camp. Both women — still girls at the time — became pregnant.\n\nIn 2015, Ya Kaka, Hauwa and their infants managed to escape the camps along with other captives. They walked for days to find villages with food and water. Both babies died. Many other women were freed after a months-long campaign by the Nigerian military, but some were killed during the rescue operation. Even those who escaped Boko Haram still suffered.\n\nHundreds of Boko Haram wives have been shunned by their families and neighbors, who worry that they are loyal to the group and may be violent. They are forced to live in hastily constructed camps often guarded by armed men. Though they are free, the indignities have continued. Hauwa said she has been mocked while begging for food. A store owner, she said, would yell, Don't come into my store because she was a Boko Haram wife. School and other educational opportunities are nonexistent. Most of the Boko Haram survivors are traumatized and have struggled to recover from the abuse. Today, Hauwa and Ya Kaka's former home of Bama is a ghost town. But because of NGO support, the former captives who are trying to live as free women will get another chance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter they return home, they will start classes at a boarding school. I had no hope of going back to school, Ya Kaka said. Now, she is enrolled at Ramat Polytechnic in Maiduguri. She hopes to study international relations, and to someday represent her home state of Borno. These opportunities, they know, are rare.\n\nThough the Nigerian government declared victory over Boko Haram, the group regularly stages attacks around the country. Many schools — common targets of Boko Haram — are still not secure. There are no soldiers or police at any school, Ya Kaka says. Just last month, 110 schoolgirls were kidnapped from Dapchi, Nigeria. And the women who have been freed from Boko Haram need help and counseling. To Ya Kaka, though, those challenges are opportunities. I want to help my society, she says.\n\nMore on In Sight:\n\nAD\n\nAD
A common point of friction is the topic of vacations: She's an extremely disorganized person who never plans her own time, but wants me to commit months in advance to my family to visiting her over any/all vacations. (She'll start pressuring me about Christmas in October.)\n\nWe have been generous with our time, but my husband and I both have demanding jobs. We don't want to spend every Christmas holiday sitting on my mother's couch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI'm at a loss. Conversations with her often end in her feeling attacked and/or abandoned. Attempts to politely refuse invitations or set boundaries have been fruitless at best, and can result in toxic rant-fests in which our parenting/life skills are called into question.\n\nAt least once a month, I'm faced with the decision to fulfill a perceived obligation to bring my kids to her, or face an extreme guilt trip for choosing not to do so. I can't ever have a weekend with my family, guilt-free. How can I take this pressure off my marriage and family without deeply hurting my mother?\n\nEmotionally Exhausted\n\nEmotionally Exhausted: You wonder how you can get what you need without deeply hurting your mother. Short answer: You can't, because she's not going to let you.\n\nAD\n\nYour mother's emotional manipulations have affected you so profoundly that you continue to basically put her (perceived) needs before your own. Stop that.\n\nAD\n\nYou should assume that — for any boundary you draw, your mother will always perceive it as a deep wound and will act out.\n\nBut it is her job to figure out how to feel better about her own life. You do you.\n\nTurn your focus toward strategies for deflecting your mother's control and guilt, knowing how she will retaliate to any change in your behavior.\n\nJump the gun and email her a rough outline of how you and your family plan to spend your vacations over the next 12 months, based on what you want to do.\n\nAD\n\nAs a parent, you know that you don't respond to a tantrum by giving in — you step back and let it run its course. A natural consequence for her ranting and attacking you is that you will not want to take her calls for a period of time.\n\nRespond with statements like, I'm sorry you're so unhappy without assuming responsibility.\n\nAD\n\nBoth of you could use the help of a therapist — she, especially, because of her extreme self-focus, rage and inability to cope with any disappointment.

I didn't give it much thought.\n\nAD\n\nOne day he left his email open on our shared computer, and I discovered its primary purpose — to secretly communicate with another woman. She is a younger woman and happily married, so there's not a romantic relationship. However, by the tone of his messages and some of his remarks, it is obvious that he is very smitten.\n\nI don't much mind that he is communicating with her, so much as the efforts he took to keep it secret.\n\nI'm very hurt and will never again view my marriage — or my husband — in the same light.\n\nAD\n\nAm I justified in feeling a sense of betrayal?\n\nHurt\n\nHurt: Yes, your feelings are justified.\n\nNow, what are you going to do about it?\n\nI hope you will be brave enough to confront your husband.

By that measure, it is welcome to have Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words, for which Thomas and his wife, Virginia, sat with filmmaker Michael Pack for more than 30 hours of interviews. Structured around this conventional talking-head footage — which covers, in easily digestible if inertly chronological fashion, Thomas's Georgia childhood, education, first marriage and career — the film reveals much, while at the same time leaving us to wonder much. A lot of this ground has been covered before, in Thomas's 2007 memoir My Grandfather's Son, from which Thomas occasionally reads aloud.\n\nOne throughline is Thomas's political evolution, beginning with an abortive stint as a Catholic seminarian — the lone black student — that ended when he withdrew after hearing a racist remark. That was followed by his self-described leftward radicalization, subsequently abandoned, along with his anger, when he became what he calls a lazy libertarian at Yale Law School, then a left-leaning registered Democrat and, years later, a reliable member of the conservative wing of the Supreme Court. As common as such transitions may be in the life of any 71-year-old, Created Equal doesn't offer many insights, at least not in a deeply satisfying way, as to how and why he has changed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs it inevitably must, the film eventually works its way back to the confirmation hearings, during which sometimes-lurid allegations of sexual harassment were made by attorney Anita Hill, who once worked with Thomas. And Thomas again refers to the proceedings as a high-tech lynching, orchestrated because he was the wrong kind of black guy, as he characterizes his opponents' views.\n\nThis part of the film is the most interesting — and, depending on your predisposition, potentially poignant — segment. But Created Equal is, by design, a lopsided affair, with Pack — a conservative filmmaker and former president of the right-leaning think tank the Claremont Institute — clearly sympathetic to Thomas's self-characterizations. Pack makes no attempt, for example, to present arguments that might counterbalance the claim of a lynching, however metaphorical. The comparison is drawn, somewhat absurdly, between Thomas's treatment and the treatment of Tom Robinson, the character falsely accused — and convicted — of rape in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThere is no mention, for instance, of other women who might have corroborated Hill's claims.\n\nBut Created Equal isn't that kind of documentary. Rather, it's meant as an opportunity for Thomas to have his full say, without challenge. At one point, he talks about how he prefers to vacation in RV parks instead of, say, resorts. He explains that he prefers the company of what he calls regular people, leading one to wonder, among many other questions left unasked and unanswered: Does that mean that travelers who stay in hotels are, despite the film's title, less regular than others?
AD\n\nAD\n\nNaturally, the possible breakup of one of our culture's highest-profile couples caused shock waves through the celebrity press — although the tabloids have been on high alert since the summer, when West kicked off his campaign for president with a controversial speech that left Kardashian reportedly furious after he told the crowd they considered terminating her pregnancy when she was expecting their first child. In now-deleted tweets, West claimed Kardashian was trying to get a doctor to lock [him] up and said he had wanted to divorce her for months.\n\nBut shortly after Page Six's report lit up social media, TMZ weighed in with its own exclusive: Not so fast! Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have been in marriage counseling, and we've learned the subject of divorce was looming for much of 2020, but they haven't given up, the site explained under the headline KIM AND KANYE in Marriage Counseling … DIVORCE ON THE TABLE. The article also noted that West has been living at his ranch in Wyoming and Kardashian is staying in California with their four children. We're told no final decision has been made.\n\nAn avalanche of competing information ensued and became a perfect encapsulation of what happens when a big Hollywood story breaks: Every other tabloid scrambles to post stories with their own takes and their own anonymous sources, and it quickly becomes very confusing. How does anyone decipher what is actually going on? (Representatives for Kardashian and West did not return requests for comment.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of the Kardashians, it's more clear-cut than you might expect. The most reliable source of information for the Kardashians is E!, which has been the home of their reality TV empire for 13 years. And when we say reliable, we don't mean necessarily 100 percent true — the network essentially operates as state media, and it's where the family can shape the story. So when you want to see the narrative framing that will probably show up on a future season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians (coincidentally or not, the final season is scheduled to air early this year), you can check out E! and its online offshoots.\n\nNearly two hours after Page Six's story hit the Web, E! Online published its offering: Why Kim Kardashian Hasn't Officially Filed for Divorce From Kanye West, the headline read. The story confirmed that the pair is effectively going their separate ways after a six-year marriage, though an unnamed source explained that Kardashian is still waiting before she makes anything official because she wants to make sure she's making the right decision for the kids.\n\nSince then, E! has posted a flurry of stories from every angle imaginable as it attempts to truly corner the market on everything Kardashian: the hopeful (the couple is in marriage counseling trying to work things out); the ominous (Kardashian spotted not wearing her wedding ring); the wistful (a romance rewind and the couple's cutest moments with their kids); and even combing her Instagram for clues (Kim Kardashian Shares How She's Getting Her 'Mind and Body Right' Amid Kanye West Divorce Speculation.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd if you're wondering why this is all coming from the Kardashian perspective, there's a reason for that: Behind the scenes, the family and their team have a reputation for trying to control all aspects of stories about their personal lives. Kris Jenner's Christian name is Multiple Sources, one popular tweet about Kardashian's mother read on Tuesday, succinctly capturing how the family operates.\n\nPeople and Us Weekly — also known to have symbiotic relationships with the family — ran their own versions of the story that echoed the same details: Kardashian and West are living apart, nothing is official, a split appears inevitable. Then, in one mildly unexpected place, the Today show also published a confirmation of their separation, noting that the couple is in marriage counseling, crediting a source close to the family.\n\nOf course, the Today show chiming in shouldn't be too surprising: The show is under the NBC News umbrella, which is owned by NBCUniversal — which, as you might know, also owns E!.
While I'm away, readers give the advice.\n\nOn becoming a better person for your child:\n\nWhen my son was born (he's 24 now), I was very socially awkward and frightened by social interactions. I would become so nervous that my head and neck would visibly tremble. Fortunately, I knew I needed to fix this for my son's sake.\n\nAnd did. In fact, now no one would ever guess at how stifled and frightened I felt in social situations.\n\nIt became a lifelong lesson for me: For your child, you fix things in yourself that you wouldn't address for you. It is my favorite unintended consequence of parenting — getting back much more than I gave.\n\nA.\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/The Washington Post)\n\nOn getting to know people who make themselves hard to know:\n\nBest practice is to start with the outermost circle of their lives, and allow feelings to reveal themselves.\n\nAsk about how their town has changed, where else they have lived, what grocery stores were like when they were little, what team sports they played, what the worst weather event was that they can remember, stuff like that. Once they get going on a topic that is comfortable for them, they may reveal far more than if they are asked directly to articulate their feelings.\n\nAdmire the things they have created, the choices they have made, ask about the history of their community. Talk about actions and things, offer them an opportunity to brag about their lives, and don't make them nervous about being judged.\n\nSometimes, actions speak louder than words.\n\nJ.\n\nOn marriage after infidelity:\n\nMy husband and I have traveled the long, hard road back from infidelity. Although very painful, this path was also achingly tender and deeply humbling. Did I mention long?\n\nBut it is the best thing we ever did; it is our warrior secret. So I guess I want to say, don't give up. It's messy. Sometimes morbidly funny. It takes time. But the regrowth of gladness, spontaneity and trust IS possible. Happiness is possible.\n\nAnonymous\n\nOn planning on intending to expect to get married:\n\nIf people want to live together, it's no skin off my nose, but what makes me crazy are the people who say we're planning on getting married. Unless you've picked a date and started making arrangements, you are not.\n\nAnd I'm NOT saying people should rush into it, but they should own up to their truth. Nothing wrong with saying you're not ready to make that decision yet.\n\n26 Down and Eternity to Go\n\nOn needing help with a partner who needs help:\n\nA while back, I went through a series of ordeals — depression was but one of the results. And yes, I worked with a psychologist and a psychiatrist.\n\nWhile my wife didn't have to endure what I did, she had to soldier on for the household and its stability. My deepest regret from that period is that I didn't realize just how much she had to go through.\n\nI wish more people had recognized that it was just as hard on her. Love is a beautiful but dangerous thing because it makes us invest of ourselves in others. When they suffer, so do we. When we suffer, so do they.\n\nBeen There, So Has My Wife
Dear Amy: I am a nurse. I started dating a police officer seven months ago.\n\nWe like each other and are getting along. We are both working full time and going to school.\n\nHe lives two hours away from me. While we talk on the phone daily, he only wants to see me once every six or seven weeks.\n\nI asked him if we could see each other once every four weeks (because I know he is busy), but he doesn't want that. He says, This is the only way the relationship works.\n\nI complained a few times and asked him if we could see each other more often.\n\nHe suggested that I should find a new guy. I am offended. I like him so much, but I am lonely. I feel like he has more fun being alone rather than being with me.\n\nDoes this man even want to be in a relationship? Am I forcing myself on him?\n\nConfused Girl\n\nConfused: Your question prompted me to do some reading on the whole nurse-police officer dating nexus, and my casual research reveals that, yes, nurses and cops can make great partners. Both professions seem to draw plucky, hard-working people who are drawn toward service, and can tolerate challenging shift work.\n\nYou don't realize it but you are lucky. Why? Because you have clarity.\n\nYour officer-friend is telling you exactly where he stands. He is saying, This is what works for me. If it doesn't work for you, you should find someone else. If he was more into you, he would probably beat a path to your door, no matter the distance. But — he is not.\n\nYou are saying, But this doesn't work for me.\n\nBoom. You have your answer.\n\nDear Amy: I agreed to be the maid of honor at a friend's wedding — six months from now. She has been with the guy for just over a year.\n\nThe bride admitted to a mutual friend that she knows she's the groom's rebound girl and is only marrying him because he asked. I feel like I should tell the groom this — just in case the marriage doesn't last.\n\nI feel that she isn't getting married for the right reasons.\n\nNot only is she expecting me and my boyfriend to pay gobs of money to attend the destination wedding that she can't afford, but she has also been messaging my boyfriend behind my back (my boyfriend is showing me the messages), saying how she can't wait for the wedding — so my boyfriend can see her in a bikini.\n\nI'm to the point now where I want to drop out of the wedding party, but I have already paid for my trip. What do I do? I've tried confronting her, but she denies it all.\n\nDon't Know What to Do\n\nDon't Know: This sort of frenemy drama is how I'm getting through the winter. So — thanks for that.\n\nYou quite obviously don't like this bride. You don't like the way she is behaving and you don't intend to honor your maid of honor duties.\n\nYou seem to want to turn the bride in to her fiance to retaliate because she is messaging your boyfriend. Your boyfriend could easily stop the messaging, so it seems that the two of you might be enjoying it (on some level).\n\nThe worst, most ridiculous bride in the world deserves to have a maid of honor who believes in what she is doing — or is at least willing to put her blinders on and go along with it.\n\nYou are not that person.\n\nYou've already spent money to go to this destination wedding, but attending the wedding when you obviously can't stand the bride is like eating a hot fudge sundae when you don't want to, just because it came with the meal. You should turn in your maid of honor badge. Tell the bride, I'm very sorry, but I can't perform these duties for you. We also won't be able to attend the wedding. You staying home would be better for everyone.\n\nDear Amy: Dismissed Wife talked about the lack of emotional support her husband offered her. You picked up on the detail that she had lost a child. Many years after our son died, my marriage started to fall apart. I now realize it was delayed stress from our terrible grief. Thank you for recommending Compassionate Friends support group.\n\nSurvivor\n\nSurvivor: Support and fellowship from other parents who have experienced terrible loss is a lifeline for survivors.
Such unions are prohibited by Methodist doctrine, but church trials over same-sex marriage have become increasingly controversial in recent years, with a growing number of congregations and individuals supportive of both same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy.\n\nIn early January, leaders in the United Methodist Church tentatively agreed to spin off a traditionalist Methodist denomination that would continue to oppose same-sex marriage and decline ordination to LGBT clergy — allowing the remaining portion of the United Methodist Church to permit same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy for the first time in its history. The plan will be voted on at the church's denomination-wide conference in May.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe proposal between Methodist leaders outlining a future split suggested that clergy who conduct same-sex marriages should remain in good standing and that any judicial processes should be put on hold as of Jan. 1.\n\nBut in a Jan. 17 letter, Bishop Sharma Lewis of the Virginia Conference announced that she would continue to process complaints — including against Ensz — until the church's rule book, the Book of Discipline, is changed. The book says, The practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.\n\nThe letter was first reported by DCist.\n\nEnsz said he was asked to officiate the wedding by one of the grooms, whom he had confirmed and was a youth minister to. He declined to provide more details about the wedding to protect the couple's privacy.\n\nAD\n\nI knew it was a risk, he said. I couldn't sit by and not do something when this couple had invited me to officiate their wedding.\n\nHe said he is surprised his disciplinary case is still open while others have been put on pause.\n\nBishop Sharma Lewis is bound by oaths she took as both a pastor and a Bishop to uphold the Book of Discipline and she processed both complaints, Paul Steidler, a spokesman for the bishop, said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nMethodist church trials over same-sex marriage have been controversial since 2013, when a Pennsylvania pastor was defrocked after officiating at his son's marriage to another man. Other pastors have gone through mediation with their accusers after performing a same-sex ceremony.\n\nThe denomination uses an internal judicial system with judges and trials led by clergy. In 2019, the church adopted new penalties, effective Jan. 1: The mandatory penalty for officiating a same-sex marriage would be a year's suspension without pay, and a second conviction would mean a pastor would be defrocked.\n\nEnsz, whose ministry at George Mason is ecumenical, said that because this was his first offense, he doesn't expect his credentials to be pulled. If they were, Ensz might be able to seek credentials from a different conference. Because his ministry is ecumenical, it would probably still keep him on staff, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut his ties to the UMC are deep, and it's the denomination he grew up in.\n\nIt would be incredibly hard to leave, he said. This is my spiritual home and what I've known.\n\nTwo complaints were filed against Ensz after he conducted the wedding, including from the Rev. Amanda Miller Garber, pastor of Rise Church in Harrisonburg, Va., who herself had conducted a same-sex ceremony in 2014 (she was suspended without pay for a month). Disciplinary actions are worked out at the local level, and Miller said that she thought if she filed a friendly complaint, Ensz might be dealt with less harshly.\n\nI had a different bishop. I hoped the system might respond differently, she said.\n\nAD\n\nThe second complaint was not what you would call friendly, Miller said. Neither she nor Ensz would say who submitted the complaint, citing an ongoing process.\n\nAD\n\nSteve Brown, chancellor for the Virginia Conference, said that the names of the complainants are confidential. He said that there is no way to predict the speed of the process or whether anything will be decided before the denominational meeting in May.\n\nJohn Lomperis, a United Methodist who advocates with the traditionalist Protestant group Institute on Religion and Democracy, said that the bishop and Ensz might agree to a just resolution, which is like an out-of-court settlement.
Priefer's stint with the Vikings is also noteworthy for a two-game suspension in 2014, after an outside investigation determined that there was credibility to a former player's accusation that he once said, We should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows.\n\nAD\n\nThat accusation was made by ex-punter Chris Kluwe in a January 2014 essay he wrote for Deadspin in which he claimed that his advocacy for same-sex marriage probably led to his release the previous year by Minnesota after eight seasons with the team. Kluwe wrote that, in addition to the nuke comment, Priefer's other remarks on the topic included: disgust at the thought of two men kissing; belittling any idea of acceptance or tolerance; and claiming more than once that the punter would wind up burning in hell with the gays.\n\nAD\n\nHours after Kluwe's essay was published, Priefer issued a statement in which he vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nI want to be clear that I do not tolerate discrimination of any type and am respectful of all individuals. I personally have gay family members who I love and support just as I do any family member, Priefer said in his statement. The primary reason I entered coaching was to affect people in a positive way. As a coach, I have always created an accepting environment for my players, including Chris, and have looked to support them both on and off the field.\n\nAD\n\nThe Vikings hired a pair of attorneys to investigate Kluwe's allegations about Priefer's comments and the reasons for the punter's release. In a July 2014 report they noted that the team's long snapper at the time, Cullen Loeffler, told them he also heard Priefer talk about putting all the gays on an island and nuking it. For the attorneys, that provided an important piece of corroboration, although they wrote that no other witnesses they interviewed recalled hearing any remarks of that nature by Priefer.\n\nAD\n\nThe report also stated that the special teams coach initially denied to investigators that he made any inappropriate remarks about the LGBTQ community or marriage equality, and that he categorically denied making the nuke comment. However, when presented with Loeffler's recollection, Priefer said he was not going to disagree with it.\n\nAt that point, per the report, Priefer told investigators, It was a joke between three people, three men.\n\nAD\n\nIn announcing a three-game suspension for Priefer, the Vikings said their organization does not accept, condone or tolerate any type of insensitive or disparaging remarks. Priefer expressed regret at the time, and he added, I am extremely sorry, but I will learn from this situation and will work on educating others to create more tolerance and respect.\n\nAD\n\nThe Vikings also noted then that the ban could be reduced to two games if Priefer attended sensitivity training, and when he was reinstated after the first two weeks of the 2014 season, the team said it was informed that he had been fully and thoughtfully engaged throughout the process and successfully completed the [training] program.\n\nAt his introductory news conference with the Browns in February 2019, Priefer addressed his suspension, telling reporters (via cleveland.com), A situation occurred in Minnesota where I made a comment I shouldn't have made. I apologized for that comment.\n\nAD\n\nAnd I learned a lot from it, he continued. What I learned is that you can't say hurtful things about people, period. No matter where you are or who you are talking to.\n\nPriefer, who was born in Cleveland, noted at that news conference that he grew up in Northeast Ohio. He went on to attend the U.S. Naval Academy, where he began his coaching career after serving as an officer for six years, including tours of duty in the Persian Gulf and in the Mediterranean Sea. According to his team bio, he also earned a master's degree from the University of Maryland.\n\nAD\n\nAfter cutting his teeth as a graduate assistant with Navy, Priefer's first coaching jobs were at the college level, including a brief stint at Virginia Military Institute, before he was hired in 2002 by the Jacksonville Jaguars to assist with their special teams. He held the same role with the New York Giants the following three years, then oversaw special teams for the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos.\n\nAD\n\nNow Priefer has been tasked with leading the Browns to a victory on the road in their first postseason appearance in 18 years. The team hasn't won a playoff game since 1995, when then-head coach Bill Belichick defeated Bill Parcells and the New England Patriots.
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Alan Oakes as a government IT manager and Veronica Branch as a government procurement expert. Oakes is a government procurement expert and Branch is a government IT manager. This story has been updated.\n\n\n\nVeronica Branch, 56, government IT manager, and Alan Oakes, 59, government procurement expert. (Photo courtesy of daters)\n\ninterviews by Debra Bruno\n\nVeronica Branch, 56, a government IT manager, describes her dream date as an educated man who has traveled some, has his own means and wants a companion who is his equal. Alan Oakes, 59, a government procurement expert, is looking for someone who laughs easily and is intelligent but not too engrossed in their work. The pair agreed on everything necessary to make a great long-term relationship, and that this thing called sparks is for crazy youngsters. Or is it? If not sparks, then what would it take for them to make a romantic connection? We sent them to Ophelia's Fish House on Barracks Row to find out.\n\nVeronica: I got there early. I'm always early. He was just a little late, and he said that time management was one of his issues.\n\nAlan: She was a charming, attractive lady. There wasn't a love connection, that's for sure, however, and I say that because the type of lady I'm attracted to is someone who is fairly active.\n\nVeronica : He was well-dressed and looked friendly.\n\nAlan: She was a widow. Fortunately for her, she had been in a very good marriage and lost him about three years ago. We talked a lot about that. It was still very obvious that the pain of losing her spouse was present.\n\nVeronica : I could see why we were set up. We had a lot of things in common. He's a government worker, and so am I. He's financially responsible, and so am I. He has children and I have children.\n\nAlan: She's originally from Philly, and my ex was originally from Philly.\n\nVeronica : He said he was a Catholic, and I'm a Christian. I go to a nondenominational church.\n\nAlan: We were together about two hours, and for probably the first hour we discussed our past relations. I had been married about 15 years and divorced about 12, but I said my ex and I are friends. We occasionally — this is true — meet and do things together.\n\nVeronica: I told him I'm a widow. It's been only three years. But I'm good. God is good. I've worked on becoming a full person. And with grief support for a couple of years, it really helped, spiritually, physically, mentally. It's not a difficult conversation now.\n\nAlan: It didn't bother me. I wanted her to feel comfortable and relaxed, and I didn't mind talking about it. That was a large part of her conversation — her husband, who she said was her best friend. I complimented her and her marriage, and that she was in such a satisfying marriage.\n\nVeronica : He talked about his ex, that they have a great relationship, and he talked about his daughter. He's a proud father. There weren't any lulls in the conversation.\n\nAlan: Once she mentioned how close and how satisfying her marriage was, I wanted her to know that there wasn't any current angst between me and my ex. That sort of cleared the air, that there was no lingering anger over any past relationships.\n\nAlan: I've been dating more than she had. She said I was her first date in three years. She asked candidly how she could spot a man who was, for example, not sincere in dating.\n\nVeronica : We also talked about the politics of the day. We both have a little anxiety about our country right now.\n\nAlan: I asked her about her definition of the chemistry thing. I told her with the women I have met it seems like ladies want bells and whistles on the first date. I told her that's basically not true of men. Even though we are visual creatures and our eyes can light up, men aren't into that instant chemistry.\n\nVeronica : I feel that only crazy young people can have that kind of craziness. Not that I think you can't find love, or that it's not romantic, but it's a little bit more evolved.\n\nAlan: We're mature people who are, I guess, out in the singles dating world, so we agreed, based upon our situation, that we don't need to beat around the bush.\n\nVeronica: Were there sparks? That is so young. I would say we were in the friend zone.\n\nAlan: I think neither of us felt the wow factor. But she's a gracious lady. She asked to stay in touch, and we swapped numbers.\n\nVeronica: I called a friend of mine to come and get me. You can't be too safe, and you just don't know if people are crazy.\n\nAlan: Her escort was already there. We went outside and he honked, and she introduced me to him. We shook hands, it was all very gracious, and I gave her a hug, and off to the vehicle she went.\n\nVeronica: I could have driven, but if things go south, now you know where I live and know what my car is.\n\nAlan: I've dated ladies in their 50s who are angry at their ex-spouse and angry at the dating scene. This was not like that at all. It was a nice, friendly date.\n\nVeronica : He brought me a flower and a valentine card. A good date is a good date.\n\nRate the date\n\nVeronica: I would give it a 3 [out of 5]. Like I said, we were more in the friend zone.\n\nAlan: I'd say a 4, in terms of friendliness, relaxation and respect for her.\n\nUpdate\n\nThe two have not been in touch since their date.
With one side selling products online and the other delivering goods and people, the natural symbiosis would appear to be through logistics in a sprawling country that spans 5,100 kilometers (3,200 miles) across about 18,000 islands. That's the kind of end-to-end infrastructure that companies like Amazon.com Inc. dream about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet the killer combo comes on the back end in the fintech realm. Both companies, along with Gojek rival Grab Holdings Inc., are keen to expand beyond their founding business models into services such as payments, banking, insurance and loans. Ride-hailing provider Gojek has over 190 million app downloads across the region, with its core market among Indonesia's 267 million people. Fintech will be the next growth driver. More than half the nation's adults don't even have a bank account, it said recently.\n\nWhen consumers and businesses are using your apps to buy and sell products, as well as book and deliver transport, you've suddenly got access to millions of customers at multiple touch points. This boosts sales and marketing opportunities exponentially, and provides a depth of data that few rivals can compete with.\n\nThrow in the required regulatory licenses, and the possibility of creating a financial powerhouse is right there. But so too is the potential to mess it up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMergers rarely go smoothly, and unicorn marriages are even more unusual. While now may be the perfect time to hook up, since the growth of their core businesses was already set to slow even before Covid-19 hit the broader economy, the mechanics and internal friction from a deal could threaten their momentum. Any shakeup of management, job losses, integration of systems, or clashes over direction could distract from the larger challenges of transitioning into a giant company that's really ready for public scrutiny.\n\nThat's not to say they shouldn't try. As the world's fourth-most-populous nation, Indonesia deserves a glorious unicorn wedding. But don't be surprised if the couple discovers that married life isn't always blissful.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

At home in San Antonio for more than a month now, Reschman is the kind of wife and mother who takes pride in keeping it all together. Every little thing, I'd solve it, she said. But she's running out of problems to solve in a situation controlled by microscopic, unseen forces.\n\nEven for those who have not fallen ill with the novel coronavirus, this is a time when many Americans don't feel in control, a time of loneliness, a time when home is more a cage than a refuge, a symbol of a world flipped upside-down.\n\nAcross the country, the homebound are finding ways to cope, creative sources of joy, or just mindless pursuits to make the days go by. They are also bickering with the kids, missing their parents, counting the Oreos left in the bag, counting the hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Vermont, tension over what the virus has done to daily life is revealed in Josh Manheimer's house as repeated tiffs over the dinner dishes. I can't get my family to stack the dishwasher correctly, despite individualized in-person training, PowerPoint presentations, and graphic comics, quipped Manheimer, an advertising copywriter who has long worked from home — but not with his whole family there all day, every day.\n\nIn Redmond, Wash., Vanessa Kritzer and Trevor Willett have been working from home for more than a month, but the hard part didn't begin until their 15-month-old daughter Fiona's day care closed two weeks ago. Now, Kritzer, who works in marketing for Microsoft and serves on her city's council, and Willett, a researcher for a consulting firm, pass Fiona back and forth between conference calls, depending on who has the more urgent meeting, Kritzer said.\n\nI'm on teams for calls, like, eight or nine times a day, Willett said. You end up thinking about the level of priority of the calls, to figure out which ones we can have the baby in the background screaming during the call, and which ones we can't.\n\nThe constant togetherness of the new life within four walls can feel like confinement , or a second honeymoon — or both, in the same afternoon. The extended home stay is a novel experience for most people, and they are casting about for comparisons, for something to make this seem a touch more normal.\n\nReschman, 57, was trapped in an anxiety dream the other night. She was screaming but she didn't know it. Her husband, Noel, 61, shook her awake. Esther got a glass of water and, at 3 a.m., started her day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer mind wouldn't rest. She took stock of every minute, searching for meaning in the meaningless. Her mind wandered to Noel's grandmother, and how, after living through the Great Depression, she stored canned food and clothes in every room of her house. Esther used to laugh at the hoarding.\n\nNow she understands: The old woman was worried it would happen again and that she would have nothing, again.\n\nEsther recalled an old co-worker she used to think was crazy for washing her hands obsessively. The woman had lived through a tuberculosis outbreak decades earlier. The woman had explained to Esther that they had to wash everything they touched. And now, Esther thought, a thousand Americans die of the coronavirus in one day. Some days more.\n\nAD\n\nThe memories bounce around in her head. Sometimes, she and Noel talk about the situation. But after four decades of marriage, they've found their equilibrium. When they get on each other's nerves, they just stop talking.\n\nAD\n\nWhat do you want for lunch? Esther yells through the back door.\n\nSilence.\n\nWhat do you want for lunch? she tries again, louder.\n\nI don't know, he yells back. How about a burrito?\n\nWell, you have a choice between a sandwich and rice.\n\nWhy do you ask if I don't really have a choice?\n\nReschman has not left her South San Antonio home except to pick up groceries curbside or try to clear her head with a slow drive down Roosevelt Avenue. She has found relief in art. Noel fixed up the living room with a desk where she keeps her paint and other materials; she embosses and paints aluminum from old beer cans, making sacred hearts, roses and other pop art. She had always wanted to make her own clothes, so she watches YouTube and recalls her mother's design patterns, sewing dresses, blouses and purses made of old blue jeans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo lift her spirits in the evening, she has started dressing for dinner. She puts on the earrings she once bought in Mexico but never got around to wearing. Then the finishing touch: a flower in her hair.\n\nOn her birthday on March 29, there were lemon cakes. Her husband grilled steaks and she watched her grandbabies play in the waning afternoon sunshine. Then they sang to her.\n\nThat was a good day.\n\n'Incredibly difficult'\n\nAlex Lohman likes to sing. Stuart Rimland, her husband, likes to rap. These days, they're combining their talents for an audience of each other.\n\nThey watch Westworld together. They talk about their day and their dog. And sometimes about how very alone they are, because husband and wife are 2,700 miles apart, stuck on opposite coasts.\n\nAD\n\nTheir movie nights are parallel viewings on Netflix; they share their comments on the flick via FaceTime or text. That's as close as they'll get to each other for as long as this virus keeps everyone inside.\n\nAD\n\nSometimes we'll just have to pause it, and say, 'I've had a really rough day,'  Lohman said.\n\nRimland, 29, is a lawyer who clerks for a federal judge in South Florida. Lohman, a lawyer as well, took a six-month job with a firm in Los Angeles to learn about representing clients in human trafficking cases.\n\nShe planned to be home in May. They had it all set, in terms of how many times we would visit each other, and we'd be texting and all that fun stuff, said Lohman, 31.\n\nAD\n\nNow, instead, We'll be on the phone, and there are times when we'll both sit in silence, she said. It's tough for us.\n\nShe's living with relatives in Los Angeles, but Rimland is by himself at their place in Palm Beach County. He likes to be around people, likes to talk, likes to make people laugh.\n\nBut I have bronchitis and I realized I should start staying at home, he said. So it's just him, his work, and the couple's rescue dog, Albie. Other than walking the mix of Maltese, Shih Tzu and poodle, he's left the house four times since March 2, mainly to pick up takeout food.\n\nAD\n\nAfter 10 days without an in-person conversation with anyone, he visited the Falafel House in Boynton Beach. The falafel guy was blessedly friendly.\n\nWe chatted back and forth, Rimland said. It was like a bonding experience. He used hand sanitizer before he gave me my food. We stayed several feet apart. But . . . it gave me a sense of normalcy. I miss that.\n\nAside from the takeout ventures, Rimland, not much of a cook, is living on leftovers and supplies he and his wife had squirreled away ahead of last year's hurricane season.\n\nAD\n\nStuff that's almost expiring, he said. Ritz Bits cracker sandwiches, applesauce, instant mashed potatoes. There's Almond Silk.\n\nHe isn't worried about running out of food, but I've noticed that, almost subconsciously, I've been rationing a little, he said.\n\nRimland has been playing lots of NBA2K on Xbox. Being able to hang out with people in that virtual world is helping me, he said. We're on the phone or FaceTime or headsets, so we're together. He also plays online trivia daily at 9 p.m. with friends he's known since high school.\n\nAD\n\nRimland and Lohman say they have no regrets about the decision that has kept them apart.\n\nBut I don't think I've struggled as much with anxiety as I am now, she said. This is incredibly difficult.\n\nAD\n\nOne night last week, after a solid 14 days by himself, Rimland gave himself a present — a visit in person with his sister and her family, who had also been home for 14 days.\n\nI felt so normal, he said. We had conversations like we'd normally have.\n\nBut after that taste of the old life — and after his sister sent him home with Cheerios, Oreos and hummus — the isolation of the following days was all the more stark.\n\nNow that I've seen them, I think I'm going to miss them that much more, Rimland said. But I'm good at compartmentalization. I'm going to stay focused on work, and bonding with my dog. It's not the pinnacle of living. But I can be happy. I'm day-to-day happy for now.\n\nA portrait\n\nAs isolating as the directives to stay home can be for some, the situation has brought others together in new ways. Paul Moscatt's life as a painter usually depends on the models who pose for him — the nudes and the musicians who would play for him as he painted them.\n\nAD\n\nNow, the models are gone, replaced by a new, more intimate, opportunity — his wife of 56 years, Carlene. In his student days, she was an early muse and occasional model. A quick painting he did of her in a colleague's illustration class remains among his best works.\n\nBut I haven't really focused on her as much as I should have, said Moscatt, 88, a figure painter and portrait artist. He still leaves home most days to drive eight minutes to his creative home, a third-floor studio in Baltimore's retro-chic Cork Factory building. But now his subject is the woman he would ordinarily come home to each evening.\n\nThis is a lovely time to get into a real official portrait of Carlene, Moscatt said.\n\nArt has always been Moscatt's escape, his therapy session. Now, it is his wife's, too. Carlene, 85, has also lost her community, her classes at the Renaissance Institute, a group of over-50s committed to learning for its own sake, and the tai chi sessions the couple did together.\n\nBut the change has been okay. Paul has kept the virus out of his art, refusing to let it dominate their conversations. I'm not painting the covid-19 into this painting, he said. Then he paused to consider his wife's expression. Maybe the virus had made its way into the image: She looks a little like she is angry about it.\n\nThe Brown Volcano\n\nGordon Wood was about to start a software venture in March, and then he had to go home and stay home. He's a real estate broker, and most everyone is staying home, not buying homes. His daughter Allison, a student at Virginia Tech, was on her dream semester abroad in Switzerland — she had saved up for three years to make it happen — and then she, too, had to come home.\n\nAllie was supposed to spend her 21st birthday with friends on the Greek island of Santorini, and her father was going to make a surprise appearance.\n\nSo when the birthday rolled around last week, Allison was feeling sorry for herself, her father said, and he and his wife decided that would not do. He found a recipe for a Greek cocktail, the Brown Volcano, made with brandy, orange juice and Vinsanto, a dessert wine from Santorini. He drove by a carryout in Alexandria, Va., and got the ingredients. He set up a bar in the garage — Gordon's Pub — invited Allie to order her ritual first legal drink, and then carded her.\n\nHe wasn't about to cut her a break because she's his kid. He sent her to her room to fetch a second form of ID. She went.\n\nWe had three or four hours where we weren't focused on the news, Gordon said.\n\nThey posted the whole thing on social media and it went mini-viral, extending the entertainment into the next few days.\n\nIt's been a strange few weeks. Stranger than after the 9/11 attacks, when the girls were little and the fear, though rattling, dissipated pretty quickly. Now, by day at the Wood house, everyone finds a place to work or study. Then they come together after 5 p.m., taking a walk, working out, playing Scrabble, watching movies. With three of his four daughters at home, Wood has grown accustomed to watching chick flicks. I got to the point where 'This Is Us' really struck a nerve, he said.\n\nThings can get a little tense with everyone in the house all the time.\n\nGirls can say things that are really hurtful, Wood said. But we're getting along pretty well. You don't always know what's going through their minds, and I don't pretend to have the answers, but I try to listen and see what's really worrying them.\n\nEvery night, before going to sleep, my last prayer has always been: 'Thanks for all my kids being safe,'  he said. And now, it's also: 'Man, are we really?' \n\nAltered days\n\nManheimer, the advertising writer in Vermont, has lived and worked in his farmhouse for three decades, going days without talking to too many people, he said, doing chores and feeding the draft horses.\n\nThe virus, though, has sharply altered his days. His wife Renee, a middle-school teacher, conducts class from the family's home gym, between the elliptical and the Concept II rower. She works now under a microscope, her online instruction watched by school administrators, and by parents, who have their own opinions of each teacher's work.\n\nHis daughter Mia, a high school senior, studies online in the kitchen, then jumps in her car to meet friends and walk — six feet apart. But Manheimer found himself pushing back when she made a quick run to the store to buy chocolate.\n\nI went ballistic, he said. An unnecessary extra trip — for what? And when her boyfriend brought over a tray of food he made to celebrate their two-month anniversary, I went into lecture mode, droning about how long the virus can last on surfaces, Manheimer said. Is it paranoia if you are on high alert about whose air your child might breathe?\n\nBut his fear of letting in a deadly germ wanes as he walks miles of dirt roads near his house.\n\nEach step feels precious, he said. Each wave to each passing car seems important. Each small discussion with neighbors about compost and maple syrup seems to add ballast, so the world won't sink under its misery.\n\nIn San Antonio, Noel ​Reschman had the radio on, and Alan Jackson's Remember When reminded Esther of better days. Remember when I was young, and so were you, the song begins. Remember when we vowed the vows.\n\nEsther found different lyrics drifting into her imagination. Remember when we could go outside the house? Remember when we could see our sons and friends?\n\nThis was not a good day. Esther needed to get out.\n\nShe and Noel got in her Jeep and went to see their city. They passed the shuttered businesses, the empty lot at Don Pedro's Mexican restaurant. It was real peaceful and real quiet, she said. But it was shocking and sad. How many things are going to change.\n\nShe remembered how her sons told her not to worry, that they'd all be together again by Thanksgiving.\n\nEsther turned to her husband: We keep saying we will all see each other again soon. But we don't know if that's going to happen.\n\nYou know, Noel replied, I've already thought of that.
WHEREAS, the American Federation of Teachers has spent more than a year engaging members and affiliates in the most intensive, inclusive, transparent and engaging presidential endorsement process in our history and has seen unprecedented engagement by members; and\n\nWHEREAS, the AFT's endorsement decision in the presidential primary has been guided by three essential criteria: a candidate who shares our values, a candidate who has the support of our members, and a candidate who can defeat President Trump. And in the more than 300,000 conversations we have had, our members believed when the time came, we would unify as a national union behind one candidate; and\n\nWHEREAS, in February, the AFT's executive council concluded that three candidates shared our values and had a path to winning the nomination—Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren—and encouraged our members to actively support any or all of them; and\n\nWHEREAS, since that point, our members, like Democrats across the nation, have coalesced around Biden, who now has clear majority support of our members across all constituencies; and\n\nWHEREAS, with nearly 60 percent of the delegates allocated, Biden has a sizable lead and has proven he has the ability to attract voters and build a coalition to win not just the primary but also the general election; and\n\nWHEREAS, this election has taken on an increasing urgency since the actual voting has begun. The world, including the United States, is facing a global pandemic threatening the health, well-being and economic security of our members, our communities and our nation. The dire need for personal protective equipment for our essential personnel is a case in point, which is why now more than ever we need to unite behind a strong, effective, empathic leader who can help families and lead a fractured nation. A leader who offers a stark contrast to the incompetent, ineffective and narcissistic actions of Trump, who even in these times of crisis continues to only focus on what is good for himself at the expense of the American people; and\n\nWHEREAS, the economic harm caused by COVID-19 will be particularly devastating to working families. Even before the pandemic hit, nearly 40 percent of Americans said they couldn't cover a $400 emergency expense. Just as Franklin D. Roosevelt after Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression and Barack Obama and Biden after George W. Bush and the Great Recession, this moment calls for a Democratic president who has the competence and compassion to not just bring us out of the depths of economic ruin but also rewrite the rules so working families thrive and heal our nation:\n\nRESOLVED, that the American Federation of Teachers endorses Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States as the candidate who shares our values, has the support of our members and has the path to the nomination and to the presidency. Biden has proven he is best able to bring the necessary coalition of Americans together to defeat Trump, handle this pandemic and its aftermath, and create a better life and future for all Americans; and\n\nRESOLVED, that AFT members have a long history with Biden and know him as someone whose life experiences crafted a resilient, competent, compassionate and honest leader with an unbending optimism and commitment to working people. Biden has spent his entire career championing the values of strong public schools and higher education; healthcare and college as rights not privileges; and labor and civil rights. He believes in the dignity of every person and the importance of the labor movement. He was a trusted vice president, at home and abroad, and he, with President Obama, helped America get through a terrible recession. He is the leader we need in this moment; and\n\nRESOLVED, that Biden's proposals demonstrate his deep belief in the promise and purpose of public education, higher education and the labor movement. He understands healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and was instrumental in the passage of the Affordable Care Act. He championed the Violence Against Women Act and led the administration's fight for marriage equality. Biden's healthcare plans will make healthcare more affordable by offering a public option for families and reigning in drug companies to make medicine affordable. He will fight to make it easier for workers who choose to unionize to do so and has adopted plans to reform bankruptcy laws for struggling families. He will strengthen and invest in public schools, including by tripling funding for Title I, fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, expanding community schools, investing in school infrastructure and doubling the number of psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers and other health professionals in our schools; limit testing; support educators; and invest in higher education and make college affordable, including by establishing a Title I for postsecondary education, investing in public colleges and universities and historically black colleges and universities, strengthening Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment, and making public colleges and universities free for most families. These plans stand in stark contrast to the Betsy DeVos agenda to defund and destroy public education. Biden's education plans are informed by his wife, Jill, who has been a teacher her entire career, even while Biden served as vice president; and\n\nRESOLVED, that the AFT will use our endorsement, our appointment to the platform committee, and our relationship with the Biden campaign to strengthen both the national Democratic platform and the policy positions of the eventual Democratic nominee in the way AFT members envision; and\n\nRESOLVED, that the AFT commits to continuing our unprecedented level of engagement to ensure nobody is on the sidelines in the November elections and that we do everything in our power to help Biden win the democratic nomination and then elect him president.\n\n(2020)\n\nPlease note that a newer resolution, or portion of a resolution, may have superseded an earlier resolution on the same subject.
I'm concerned that she and I have fundamentally different attitudes toward money, and also that we have fundamentally different attitudes toward communication, as I think she should have spoken up when I first proposed splitting 50-50, not waited until after the vacation was over.\n\nDo you think this is a major problem? We have talked about marriage, and now I'm starting to think we're not as compatible as I thought we were.\n\nAD\n\n— First Vacationer\n\nFirst Vacationer: I'm definitely with you on the communication problem. Yes, it would have helped for her to say something beforehand — if in fact she had doubts then. But even if she wasn't sure till she actually saw what you meant by 50-50, then speaking up on the spot would have been the more productive thing to do: Hey, when you said 50-50, I thought you meant we'd share expenses — but I wasn't expecting that we'd split every meal down to the loose change.\n\nAD\n\nYou can have widely varying attitudes on money or faith or nutrition or whatever else, but it's hard to get by contentedly unless you're able to talk to each other when you're bothered by something.\n\nAD\n\nShe did eventually speak up, though, so you have that. Use it by responding honestly with your concerns. Say you wish she had said something as soon as this bothered her, and ask if there's a reason she didn't.\n\nAnd ask how she would have preferred to handle the money. Maybe she was fine with splitting but wished it had been less rigid — say, she buys dinner tonight, and you pick up the tab tomorrow, and so on. There's trust-centered splitting and nitpicky splitting and a vast range in between.\n\nMaybe talking about it will confirm your new suspicions of a significant difference in attitude, which is a good, if painful, thing to do early. However, a frank discussion might also reveal that she has some ideas good enough to change your mind. People bring all kinds of differences to a relationship, and while it's important to keep your essential self intact, it's also a chance to learn other ways to do things and even incorporate a few upgrades into your world view and routine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDear Carolyn: What is your opinion of someone who goes to lunch with a friend and says nothing as the friend grabs the check and pays the bill? No offer to pay, no Thank you, no words spoken at all.\n\n— Paid for Lunch\n\nPaid for Lunch: My opinion of any non-extreme weirdness, once, is that it's always possible the person felt awkward and froze.\n\nIf it happens multiple times, then my opinion becomes that the recipient of your generosity is either an ingrate or highly socially awkward. And then you face a decision: Is this person's company worth the price you have to pay for it, literally and figuratively?\n\nActually, that's always the question, but it can be helpful to walk ourselves up to it.
Dad, a White man, knew the power of grievance politics, what he believed to be a sustaining element of Trumpism, better than most. It didn't come just from his fascination with the Civil War; my own family fractured over one woman's prejudice even before I was born. His mother's rejection of his marriage to a Black woman, my mother, and the fallout that ensued, didn't define him. His work ethic and kindness did that. But it shaped his understanding of the origins of bigotry and the power of forgiveness.\n\nIn his study, my father kept figurines of Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee standing atop wall-mounted displays. As a half-Black, half-White child, I had trouble understanding his reverence for both sides. He told me he was captivated by this period of time when the American experiment nearly failed. And he loved learning about the characters of the war and the multitudes they led, scores of poor White men who stood little to gain from the abolishment or continuation of slavery, yet for varying reasons were willing to die for their side's cause. Alex wondered what side he would've ended up on, having grown up in Virginia. He couldn't rule out the Confederacy. Big, sweeping political movements influence people to make decisions in spite of their moral compasses, he reasoned. You can only fight so hard against the tide.\n\nThe earliest tide in my father's life was his mother, Antonia, and it carried dark currents. During World War II she made her way from Ukraine to Berlin as a refugee, and when the war ended, she worked in a military hospital operated by the Allies. There she met an officer from the American Midwest and conceived my father, who was born in Heidelberg after his father shipped home. Five years later, my grandfather sponsored her and their son's emigration to the United States on the condition that they never contact him. She settled in Virginia, married, had another son, divorced and kept dating. Antonia was prone to fits of anger and verbal abuse. In one episode my dad recalls, she took the large tin can of his collected marbles and dumped them in a sewer drain in front of him when he was 12.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe joined the Navy after high school and served in Vietnam. After he returned home, he worked as a mover, started a moving company and bought his mother a townhouse in Alexandria, Va. He met a young veterinarian at the University of Maryland. Antonia was thrilled that my father was dating a doctor. At first, he concealed her race. One day, several months into the relationship with my mom, Antonia phoned her son to let him know she'd be dropping by his house to pick something up. That's great, he told her. You can meet my girlfriend, who's Black.\n\nShe paused. Fuck you, she said after a moment. Then she hung up and didn't speak to her son for five years.\n\nWhen my parents married in 1987, Antonia gathered most of my father's childhood pictures and destroyed them. With what few she didn't burn, she scrawled NIGGER LOVER in black marker over each image, put them in an envelope and mailed them to my parents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAntonia was the daughter of a respected man in Poltava, Ukraine, who navigated through a devastating famine in 1933 only to see his family and community torn apart with the Nazi invasion in 1941. Her arrival in the United States must have been an instant blow to her pride: She worked as a maid, cleaning the homes of rich, White families while living with them. She relied on government assistance in a foreign country. My father suspected she dated mostly for financial reasons; she had two young boys to support and no hope for them to attend college without a partner's income or help from the government.\n\nBut despite her poverty, she could still cling to one vanity: She was a White woman in a segregated world, a member of the protected class. In her mind, she was better than at least one group of Americans, and so were her sons.\n\nMy father never explained to me how he had eluded his mother's thinking on race, and I never asked. It's a strange thing for a Black son to ask his White father: Why aren't you a racist? He met Black men in the Navy and while working as an office mover, and at some point simply decided that his mother was wrong about Black people. He avoided the romance of the Lost Cause, relying instead on what he saw in the real world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFive years after Antonia defaced the photos, she asked to come back into my dad's life. She was no longer collecting an income and was in danger of losing her home. Dad saved the house. Still, she declined to apologize for her actions, and when he brought up the destroyed photos in later years, lamenting that he had no record of his childhood, she pretended not to know what he was talking about. She told him she pitied my brothers and me for being Black but didn't blame us. For the rest of her life, Alex visited her on Sundays, a secret he kept from me until I was a teenager. He didn't bother trying to reconcile his mother and brother and his wife, who tolerated his loyalty to blood. (My mom could have easily poisoned us against our grandmother and prevented us from ever seeing her, but I believe she wanted us to see for ourselves who and what Antonia was.)\n\nAntonia and Alex shared this binding experience, the gravity of which I can scarcely fathom: They got on a boat and together made a life in this foreign land. For that bond, he decided he could coexist with this unapologetic racist. He decided he could move forward.\n\nI met my White grandmother for the first time at 17, in 2004, 13 years before she died, in the townhouse my father bought. My mom had given her grudging approval. I hugged her that day out of a sense of obligation. She was a small, blonde woman, hunched over and shuffling in a threadbare navy-blue robe. Makeup covered the blemishes and liver spots on her face, though not the ones on her neck and chest. She was 83. Antonia stared at me with blue eyes, smiled and touched my cheeks with wonder. I had been a grinning picture on the wall for 17 years, and now I was sitting in her living room.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere was a woman who had tried to poison her son and failed, who felt so desperate in her inadequacies that she'd effortlessly added American anti-Black racism to the European anti-Semitism she brought over. She called my mother the n-word, in writing, and I still couldn't hate her. There was some hate there, sure, but the overwhelming emotions were pity and heartbreak. She had done something extraordinary in rescuing my father from postwar Europe, instilled in him a tremendous work ethic and — even if it was by accident — a sense of fairness. Yet as a consequence of her hate, she didn't get to be a part of the world she helped create for him, and for me.\n\nMy mom thought she had the answer to that sort of bigotry. When my grandmother died in 2017, a dozen of her friends and family members came to her funeral: her two sons, women who knew her from the hair salon and other forays into town, her caretakers and neighbors — all White. My two brothers were there too, and my mom's brother and his new bride, all Black. I chose not to attend.\n\nThey made a point of introducing themselves, shaking hands or hugging, and smiling sympathetically as they did. They stood somberly as Antonia was lowered into the ground. They held my father's hand as they walked to his car. We wanted those people to know we weren't the monsters she must've told them we were, my mom told me later. Even if they couldn't change any minds, they declined to use the event to exorcise their frustrations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, my dad was cremated; his ashes will be interred at Arlington National Cemetery, on the former grounds of Robert E. Lee's plantation. He'll rest alongside thousands of men who, like him, had ideas about what this country ought to stand for and were willing to die for that vision, however flawed.\n\nI don't have to wonder what my dad would've said about the men who brought the Confederate flag into the Capitol, and violence with it, in a failed effort to overturn the results of a democratic election. He would want them and those who inspired and organized the riot to be held responsible, just as my grandmother lost precious years with her grandchildren. He would want them prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And ultimately, he would want these men and women in the grips of a dark tide — his siblings in this American experiment — to be forgiven.
About three months ago my wife told me she was unsure about our relationship. She said the reason she fell in love with me was because I would make a good father, but since kids aren't immediately on the horizon, she feels I don't give her enough energy as a couple, and that, while she loves me, she has felt more in love with previous boyfriends. This would have been great to hear before we got married.\n\nI'll be the first to admit I'm an introvert and probably not the most exciting person to hang out with, but I treat her well, and we have fun.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe're in therapy, but it's been very hard for her to come to grips with her emotions. I can't help feeling like she married a concept instead of me. I also think part of the difficulty is her coming to terms with not being able to have a child as quickly and easily as she wanted.\n\nWhile I love her and want to continue the relationship, I can't help but think the foundation of our marriage isn't solid enough to last, and I'm getting deeply hurt in the process. How much is enough? Is this worth trying to salvage, or should I try to minimize the damage to both of us and move on?\n\n— Frustrated and Confused\n\nFrustrated and Confused: Uuuugh. I'm so sorry.\n\nAD\n\nAnd of course you're hurt. You thought she married you for love, and you just found out she hired you for a job.\n\nWhat is enough, you ask? That. That is enough.\n\nAD\n\nBut first, please know this, because it's important: It doesn't mean you're not the most exciting person to hang out with. Your wife's unhappiness is not rooted in your failure to provide what she needed. It's rooted in her decision to marry someone who didn't provide what she needed — to think she could set those misalignments aside for the purpose of getting the family she wanted. (Not uncommon — even with wonderful people.)\n\nThis matters because what you provide is what somebody wants, needs, finds exciting. Someone else. Maybe you haven't met her yet, and I won't give you empty assurances that you will, but it's a no-brainer that there are women more in love with an introverted, respectful, fun, he'd-make-a-good-father style.\n\nAD\n\nWhich is why this wretched thing might be good for you. When your wife married you for the wrong reasons — I take her word for all this, I should emphasize, and draw no conclusions of my own — she stopped your search for that woman.\n\nAD\n\nSo step away from your marriage, for now if not permanently, and think it all over, and heal. Maybe then you'll see what you were denied by this marriage, that more in love feeling, and you'll grow ready to look again. We all deserve people who feel lucky to have us.\n\nIt's a long shot, but maybe, too, it'll help her see you differently. Good news for you either way, if painfully achieved.
All in all, life is perfect.\n\nAD\n\nBut. I've been offered my dream job 12 hours away. During our divorce we agreed our child has a say in his living situation should I move. I'm pretty confident he will choose to stay in his hometown, but hopeful he will choose to move with me.\n\nAD\n\nI've made peace with it. The logistics aren't that hard to manage. But I feel guilty. Society judges absent mothers so harshly. I'm worried about him having the support and compassion he needs.\n\nI'm worried I'm abandoning him and he will end up with weird issues.\n\nI feel justified after so many years of abuse and sacrifice that I deserve to chase my own dreams.\n\nBut am I being selfish? A bad mother?\n\n— Woman on Hold\n\nAD\n\nWoman on Hold: Tempting.\n\nBut first: Seriously?\n\nYou have an amazing job and loving friends and found family and your child is thriving and you're in love and you're a . . . Woman on Hold?\n\nThey're your feelings to feel, of course, but I see room — as in, pristine acres of rolling landscape — for you to reframe your view of your life, if you really wanted to do that.\n\nAs you did just a few paragraphs prior, with perfect.\n\nAD\n\nI also don't think it's possible to make peace with it and feel guilty and be worried, all about the same move.\n\nAnd you won't get a you-go-girl (or, alas, a bad-mother) answer from me, because to treat this as an issue of society and judgments — and misogyny, if that's what you're implying — sounds like a cynical dodge.\n\nAD\n\nJust facts: The price you pay for a bad decision here won't be charged to your public-image account — it'll come straight from your kid's emotional health. And he didn't choose to be born or move anywhere or marry badly.\n\nYet, as you yourself describe your decision, it will take either his mother or his father out of your son's day-to-day life, because I deserve to chase my own dreams.\n\nHow is this not selfish?\n\nThat's not a rhetorical question; my advice for you is to answer it.\n\nAD\n\nEspecially since the nature of the dream matters. Parents live away from minor children plenty, for reasons society accepts and even applauds. Military deployments; diplomatic or political positions; humanitarian aid work; career necessity (astronauts, journalists, mountaineers, ship captains); economic pressure — anything from a job transfer to emigration from an impoverished country.\n\nAD\n\nThese have in common some combination of necessity and a higher purpose — and typically an end date. That's still often wrenching for kids, however, I wanted to be with you, but I had to protect the world/lead the world/save the world/conquer space/keep us all from starving?** At least it feels important.\n\nIf you really are just talking about dream-fulfillment beyond your current perfection, then your decision feels heavily optional. Like, second-cherry-on-a-sundae optional. I'd say this about any dad or mom who has viable and non-soul-crushing local employment options and whose affected child is just 12.\n\nAD\n\nThe chances you'll have other dreamy career opportunities, especially if you're brilliant at it: excellent.\n\nAD\n\nThe chances your child will have another crack at childhood: zero.\n\nAnd I can't believe I'm only now getting to this (the issue is deceptively complex): You're also dumping a horrific choice on your child. Who, presumably, has just found stability after being put through a wringer by his parents' abusive marriage and divorce. So, which parent can you do without? Take your time, Honey. Seriously.\n\nAnd, you're doing this just as he has one foot on the threshold into adolescence, one of the most dizzying, unnerving and impressionable times of our lives.\n\nOne promising element is that you're even torn about it. You don't say so yourself, but your peace-guilt-worry pretzel does. Your asking this question does.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, the only one whose vote counts is your son. So, again, my advice is to give yourself an honest, non-self-serving answer to the baseline question: Will he grow up to respect your reasons or will he look back and say, She shook my whole world? For that?\n\n**Extra credit: Read Reyna Grande's The Distance Between Us for a child's nuanced perspective on parents who leave.

A self-described mild radical in the 1950s, Dr. Glazer was part of a group of left-leaning thinkers who were mugged by reality, in journalist Irving Kristol's formulation, and turned against the social programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society initiative in the 1960s.\n\nAD\n\nThat group became known as the neoconservatives, a term that originated as a pejorative under socialist political theorist Michael Harrington before being embraced by Kristol and rejected by Dr. Glazer, who ultimately considered himself a centrist Democrat, according to friends. He told the Wall Street Journal last year that he voted Republican only once, in Massachusetts, to protest the fact that some Kennedy was being elected from the district again and again.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Glazer worked in the John F. Kennedy administration, in what is now the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and was a consultant to Johnson's Model Cities program. But he drew on social science research to conclude that programs designed to alleviate poverty — including Head Start, the Job Corps and Meals on Wheels — were counterproductive.\n\nStates that emphasized such programs did not always see results, he found, particularly in the realm of education. In Dr. Glazer's view, those initiatives discouraged self-sufficiency and were incapable of addressing the real issue: a deterioration of the family and other social units fundamental to American life.\n\nAD\n\nWhereas the prevailing wisdom was that social policies would make steady progress, I came to believe that although social policy had ameliorated some of the problems we had inherited, it had also given rise to other problems no less grave in their effect on human happiness, he wrote in The Limits of Social Policy (1988).\n\nAD\n\nDr. Glazer was one of the last surviving members of the New York Intellectuals, a group of sharp-elbowed writers and critics who helped drive the country's intellectual discourse in the middle of the 20th century, writing articles in the pages of small magazines such as Commentary, Partisan Review and eventually the Public Interest.\n\nFounded in 1965 by Kristol and sociologist Daniel Bell, the Public Interest became a bastion of neoconservative thought, even as Dr. Glazer tried to preserve it as a space for rigorous public policy analysis while serving as co-editor from 1973 to 2002.\n\nHe was the most inductive thinker I ever knew, and the most curious, said Mark Lilla , an intellectual historian at Columbia University who edited a book with Dr. Glazer and worked with him at the Public Interest. He was interested in looking at the evidence, rather than looking for evidence that supported whatever hypothesis he had, and was always on the lookout for evidence that he was wrong.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, Dr. Glazer's intellectual reputation was primarily that of a perennial reassessor. A New York Times profile in 1998, headlined Nathan Glazer Changes His Mind, Again, began: Nathan Glazer has had more second thoughts in his lifetime than most people have had thoughts.\n\nA longtime professor at Harvard University, Dr. Glazer was a co-author of two seminal works of social science. The first, The Lonely Crowd (1950), is sometimes cited as the most popular work of American sociology.\n\nPrimarily written by David Riesman, with contributions from Reuel Denney and Dr. Glazer, the book proposed three character types with which to divide society — other-directed, inner-directed and tradition-directed — and was widely seen as a swipe at American consumerism and conformity.\n\nAD\n\nHis other signature work, Beyond the Melting Pot (1963), was one of the first serious studies of ethnicity and assimilation. Written with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the scholar turned U.S. senator, the book examined black, Puerto Rican, Jewish, Italian and Irish populations in New York City. America, the writers found, was less a melting pot than a mosaic, in which the identities of different racial and ethnic groups persisted generations after their arrival in the United States.\n\nSomewhat controversially, Dr. Glazer also argued that prejudice and racism alone could not explain the concentration of problems in the Negro community. Values and behavior also played a significant role, in his view, although he believed that civil rights legislation passed in the mid-1960s would effectively enable African Americans to rise up the social and economic ladder.\n\nAD\n\nWhen that advancement never came to pass, his views began to shift, perhaps most notably in the field of affirmative action. While his 1975 book Affirmative Discrimination argued that public policy must be exercised without distinction of race, color or national origin, he later championed a pragmatic approach to higher education admissions, one that employed a racial preference.\n\nAD\n\nWhile conservatives lambasted him, suggesting he had sold out in the face of pressure from liberal colleagues, Dr. Glazer insisted he was once again changing his views only in the face of shifting evidence. He had never abandoned his ideals, he said, only adjusted his thinking on how best to achieve them.\n\n[When] I look at policies that are trying to improve welfare, he said in the 1997 documentary Arguing the World, according to the magazine City Journal, I think you must keep on trying even if you have not had great success.\n\nAD\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Nathan Glazer was born in Manhattan on Feb. 25, 1923. Both parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland; his father was a sewing-machine operator, and his mother was a homemaker. A brother, Joe Glazer, became a protest singer known as labor's troubadour for his performances at picket lines and union rallies.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Glazer studied sociology at the City College of New York, where, according to Arguing the World, he argued, ate lunch and played table tennis in a cafeteria alcove with Bell, Kristol and literary critic Irving Howe. One of the characteristics of [our] group was a notion of its universal competence, he said, adding that he and his friends shot our mouths off on everything from culture to politics. Their approach, he added, stemmed from the arrogance that if you're a Marxist, you can understand anything, and it was a model that even as we gave up our Marxism we nevertheless stuck with.\n\nHe received a bachelor's degree in 1944, earned a master's degree in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania that same year, and went on to work as an editor at Commentary, Anchor Books and Random House. Dr. Glazer received his doctorate in sociology from Columbia University in 1962 and taught at the University of California at Berkeley, Bennington College in Vermont and Smith College in Northampton, Mass., before joining Harvard in 1969.\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to writer Ruth Slotkin, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 57 years, the former Sulochana Raghavan of Cambridge; three daughters from his first marriage, Sophie Glazer of Stuart, Fla., and Elizabeth Glazer and Glazer Khedouri, both of Manhattan; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Glazer sometimes traced the pivotal moment in his intellectual evolution — his mugged by reality moment, as it were — to the 1960s, when he became disillusioned with the student Free Speech Movement while teaching at Berkeley. But that was just the beginning of a career spent grappling with the chief tenets of the left and the right.\n\nYou begin to break with orthodoxy, and then you see other challenges to it, he told the New York Times in 1998. They don't seem so outlandish or threatening as they once did.\n\nAD\n\nIt reminds me of the old Leninist line, he added:  'Who says A, must say B.' From saying B, you'll go on to C, D and you'll end up at Z. There's no stopping.
She moved recently and I don't have her address. If I ask her parents for her address it will raise a red flag, but I do want her to hear at least one positive voice over her engagement. If I contact her, I also risk her telling her parents, who will be mad at me. Looking for a safe road through the minefield.\n\nAD\n\n— Concerned Aunt\n\nConcerned Aunt: If you're not close enough to know how to get in touch with her, then I'm not sure you're close enough to her to be a significant source of support for her right now.\n\nAD\n\nPlus, countering her parents' message is your only motive; you know nothing of this guy; and your niece might use your support as leverage against her parents, right? Thus the red flag of just getting contact information? Scenes like this usually involve caution tape.\n\nYou can, of course, always, get in touch with your niece just to say hi and congratulations, assuming you can restrain yourself enough to stay in a listening role. For this, you can request your niece's contact info without guilt or ulterior motive.\n\nAD\n\nDear Carolyn: My first anniversary is coming up, and I haven't sent thank-you notes. I know. I know. But — I really have been busy. I lost my job a month before the wedding. I was focused on finding work and then I got a job (a temp position) and then was focused on finding a permanent job, which I did, and then was focused on keeping that one. Plus I work a second job and have a side hustle, too, for extra cash.\n\nAD\n\nI've tried several times to finish. All I managed to do was print out a form letter to send everyone (which is now out of date) and write thank-yous to five people. Should I just give up? Send them out? I literally don't have a free night or weekend for seven more weeks. My husband has offered to help, so that's not the issue. He helps with the side business, so he's just as busy.\n\nI've thanked people locally but there are others who were not local. What to do?\n\nAD\n\n— I've Tried\n\nI've Tried: Make a list of gift givers you haven't thanked, and split the list in half between you and your husband.\n\nOffered to help? Pah. The gifts were for both of you, so you both say thank you and you don't position yourself to be the social load-bearing entity in your marriage because that idea is so tired and tiring.\n\nBut: Yes. Just send them. Email if you have to, at the rate of one a week if that's all you can manage. To speed it up, use a template: We're not ungrateful, we're just late, or some such. If you need updated addresses, ask sympathetic family or friends to help.
The General Assembly convened earlier Wednesday for its 400th annual session with a little extra pomp, a potential breakthrough on the Equal Rights Amendment and disappointment for gay rights advocates.\n\nIn his speech, Northam pitched tax and budget plans that hinge on using $1.2 billion in new revenue that the state expects to collect as a result of last year's federal tax overhaul. He also urged the GOP-controlled legislature to consider his plans to address gun violence — legislation that Republicans snuffed out last year.\n\nAlthough he is backing those same bills again, including measures that call for universal background checks and an assault-weapons ban, Northam chose to highlight just a single bill in his speech — one that he said Republican legislatures in other states have adopted. The extreme risk law would make it easier for law enforcement and the courts to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt shouldn't be a partisan issue to make sure that weapons are not in the hands of people who pose a threat, especially when the threat is to their own safety or their family's safety, Northam said.\n\nInvoking the Virginia Way of political compromise, Northam catalogued the accomplishments of his first year in office — including expanding Medicaid to hundreds of thousands of low-income Virginians, raising the larceny threshold and securing funding for Metro — and he urged both parties to cooperate.\n\nThe successes in this past year have come about not because I, or you legislators, did something individually — but because we worked together, he said. When we work together and help provide a strong foundation for Virginians, our families and businesses thrive.\n\nAD\n\nBut Northam's vision of a rapidly rising state flush with cash to build on its success is based on a fundamental disagreement with Republicans, who still control both houses of the legislature. The governor wants to spend some $1.2 billion that could flood state coffers because of changes to the federal tax code under the tax cuts President Trump signed last year.\n\nHe wants half of that amount tofund tax breaks forVirginian households making less than $54,000 a year, the state's median income. He would use the other half to shore up the state's reserve funds and make historic investments in schools, the environment, rural broadband and other priorities.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans, though, want to change Virginia tax code so that much of that money goes back to taxpayers at middle- and higher- income brackets.\n\nAD\n\nRepublican leaders embraced Northam's language of cooperation before drawing a sharp line over taxes.\n\nI appreciated very much the tone that he started out with, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City) said in the Capitol rotunda after the speech.\n\nBut Northam's spending plan seemed aimed at his Democratic base and will not pass muster with Republicans looking to cut taxes, Norment said. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Norment said he is committed to working with the governor and Democrats to overcome this impasse.\n\nHouse Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) also praised Northam's tone and added that I do think there are some places we can work together. He mentioned K-12 education and teacher pay as examples.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans also said they were open to dialogue about gun safety — though House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) cautioned that Democrats must do that in the context of respecting our traditional rights.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike cheered and rose at a few points during Northam's 50-minute speech, such as when he called for extending broadband access to rural areas and pledged to make the state the best for business.\n\nBut with few exceptions, Republicans sat stone-faced as Northam called for dialogue about gun safety and ending the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court costs. His call to allow early voting seemed to fall especially flat on that side of the aisle, particularly as he tied prohibitive barriers to voting to the state's history of slavery. So did his call to add language to the state code declaring that a woman has the fundamental right to make her own health-care decisions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginia's General Assembly marks its 400th anniversary this year, and there were nods to its history throughout the opening day of the legislative session.\n\nThe House of Delegates was in full history mode, with four honor guards from Jamestown in Colonial armor — red plumes on their helmets, halberds in hand. Cox, a former high school government teacher, offered lofty words about the meaning of the first gathering of representative democracy in 1619 in the New World.\n\nWhen our predecessors first assembled at Jamestown Island all those years ago, they changed everything. Those first citizen servants forged a path we continue on today, four centuries later, he said.\n\nAD\n\nCox included a nod to Del. ­Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax), whom Democrats chose as the first female caucus leader in our history, he said, to raucous applause.\n\nFor all the bipartisan niceties of opening day, political reality settled in quickly. The House Appropriations Committee wasted no time brushing off the governor's proposed amendments to the state's $117 billion biennial budget.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to tax breaks for low-income workers, Northam wants to increase spending on teacher salaries, mental-health services and other state programs.\n\nRepublicans, however, have argued that much of that windfall should go toward tax breaks for a wider swath of Virginians. Del. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), chairman of the budget-shaping Appropriations Committee, said he will set aside all of that $1.2 billion and instead focus on smaller adjustments to the spending plan.\n\nAD\n\nThe Senate's Privileges and Elections Committee got right down to work on two proposed constitutional amendments — one related to the ERA, the other to same-sex marriage.\n\nSens. Glen H. Sturtevant Jr. (R-Chesterfield) and Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax County) proposed a measure to make Virginia the 38th and final state to ratify the federal Equal Rights Amendment. The bill died in House and Senate committees last year, although it had cleared the full Senate in previous years.\n\nOn Wednesday, the committee passed the bill on an 8-to-6 vote, with two Republicans among the yeas: the panel's chair, Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (Fauquier); and Sen. William R. DeSteph Jr. (Virginia Beach).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe committee then went on to consider a proposal from Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria) to remove the state's defunct gay-marriage ban from the state Constitution. The ban has been unconstitutional since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a right to marry nationwide. The plan from Ebbin, who in 2003 became the state's first openly gay legislator, would have put the matter to a referendum.\n\nThe measure died on a tied 7-to-7 vote, with Vogel the only Republican voting for it.
At first Hang the DJ's premise appears to be a more cheerful version of The Lobster, a dark comedy about a hotel where singles are sent to meet their match, or else. After 45 days, those who don't find a suitable mate get turned into the animal of their choosing. It took the idea of dying alone to frightening heights.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven if the constant pairings in Hang the DJ seem like drudgery, the episode is far more optimistic than The Lobster. Even as Frank and Amy drudge through unsatisfying matches, success seems more inevitable than a lifetime of loneliness.\n\nIn fact, there are a few elements in Hang the DJ's fictional universe that, at least at first glance, might seem like improvements on the real-life Tinder slog.\n\nSingles get to meet each other right away. Are you tired of coming up with small talk with strangers over Tinder messages? Of course you are. Instead, the System pairs people instantly and picks the meetup spot.\n\nBack in 2013, OkCupid tried something like this: an app called Crazy Blind Date, where profile photos were displayed as a scrambled image. Users would input the times they had available to meet up and preferred locations. The app would then either set people up blindly or allow them to schedule with another user based on the times and locations they had on offer. It sounds like a brilliant way to do an end-run around endless predate conversing, but OkCupid got a lot of backlash over the app. Why? Well, one of the reasons people often don't want to go on dates immediately with strangers from the Internet is that they want to make sure they'll be safe — and often picking a public place isn't enough to ensure that. However, in the serene yet sanitized world Frank and Amy find themselves in, the danger seems to come not from their dates but from the security officers stalking about with stun guns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEveryone seems to be looking for the same thing: a relationship. What a concept. In real life, not only do daters experience bad matches (someone who doesn't like you, you don't like them, or you clearly both don't like each other), but they also endure the heartbreak of good matches with bad timing (such as one person being off to a job or grad school in a different city). Not to mention online daters having to shoehorn these meetups and their relationships into their busy, stressful lives. In Hang the DJ's community of singles, everyone seems to be on the same timeline, or at least they're willfully submitting to the System's.\n\nWould devoting every waking hour to finding a partner be better than the balancing act most singles experience now? It might be more effective, but it could drive you crazy in the meantime. Do the contestants on The Bachelor, who are doing pretty much that, seem well-adjusted to you?\n\nIt gives couples certainty about how long they'll be together. Call me a cynic, but when Frank and Amy hit their System buttons on their first date and found out their relationship would last a grand total of 12 hours, I was incredibly relieved for them. They both seemed disappointed. But all I could think was: Wow, that makes it easy! No anxious thoughts about whether and when the person you're with might break up with you; no energy spent on the uncertainty of dating. Everything is decided for you. What a relief!\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut also: What a nightmare! This is basically technology-brokered arranged marriage with zero human input. The horrors of which are obvious when you see how miserable some of the Frank and Amy's other matches are.\n\nYou have lots of options, but you know you'll end up with the best. When the dangers of online dating are discussed in real life, the paradox of choice comes up. This is the idea that, faced with an abundance of choices, be it on Tinder or brands of cereal, we've become not freer and happier but more paralyzed and dissatisfied. The System aims to offer the best of both worlds: Lots of options, and at the end of it you get the best one.\n\nI won't give away the ending, but ultimately the episode becomes not an indictment of dating apps like Tinder but an endorsement of them. In a story that starts by telling its characters to hand over their free will to the supremacy of technology, it ends up melding the two. Yes, the app puts two people together, but they still have to make choices to be happy.
Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama — who starred in an Inauguration Day video playing up the democratic transfer of power — will also soon be jointly urging wary Americans to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to sources familiar with the project. The sources requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGathered to watch President Biden take the oath of office and film a message emphasizing the ceremony's importance to the republic, they also recorded a PSA [public service announcement] aimed at building confidence in the safety and efficacy of the covid vaccine, one of the sources said. That message will be released in the coming weeks, the source added. Another source said the PSA was a work in progress and confirmed the rough timetable.\n\nFormer presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton on Jan. 20 celebrated the inauguration of Joe Biden. (The Washington Post)\n\nThe idea of bringing the three former presidents together to film the handover-of-power video came from Stephanie Cutter, a veteran Democratic operative who served as an executive producer of Biden's inauguration, the sources said.\n\nCutter took a novel approach of trying to really make the program completely apolitical and patriotic and genuine in its appeal to all Americans. All the former presidents were happy to do it, one of the sources said. Plus, it helped them kill some time while they waited for the president and vice president!\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTheir view was 'because [former president Donald] Trump's not participating, how do we showcase the passage of power, and how do we visually represent the restoration of norms, another source said, noting the unusual video was weeks in planning.\n\nBiden's inaugural committee felt both for small-d democratic purposes but also aligned with Joe Biden's values and message, we are going to restore confidence in government again, or at least build some of it back, the source continued. That posed a challenge given the absence of the outgoing president, who plays a pretty starring role in Inauguration Day — the greeting at the White House — the whole nine yards.\n\nThe other flourish was the reimagining of the traditional wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery, usually a more low-key affair, to compensate for the absence of the parade that usually stretches from the Capitol to the White House after the president's swearing-in. The 2021 version, rather than just featuring the outgoing president and vice president, included Biden, Vice President Harris, Bill and Hillary Clinton, George W. and Laura Bush, and Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bipartisan bonhomie is a stark departure from Trump's approach to the coronavirus pandemic. His Health and Human Services Department crafted a never-aired $250 million campaign to defeat despair featuring celebrities like Dennis Quaid, which was criticized for being designed to boost Trump's reelection chances.\n\nTrump appointees vetted celebrities for the public health campaign based on whether they had ever criticized the president, or supported former president [Obama], gay rights or same-sex marriage, reported my colleague Yasmeen Abutaleb.\n\nIt also comes as Biden makes an all-out push to tackle to the pandemic, issuing executive orders to increase mask-wearing and implementing a national strategy to expand access to testing and vaccines.\n\nThe planned PSA aims to erode stubbornly robust American skepticism about coronavirus vaccines.\n\nForty percent of Americans say they definitely will get inoculated when they can, and another 23 percent say they probably will, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. But just one quarter of Republicans say they definitely will get vaccinated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnthony S. Fauci, the nation's most prominent infectious-disease expert, expressed concerns Thursday about public resistance to getting the vaccine.\n\nThe concern I have, and something we're working on, is getting people who have vaccine hesitancy, who don't want to get vaccinated — because many people are skeptical about that. So we really need to do a lot of good outreach for that, he said in a White House briefing.\n\nFauci told reporters If we get 70 to 85 percent of the country vaccinated — let's say by the end of the summer, middle of the summer — I believe by the time we get to the fall, we will be approaching a degree of normality.\n\nAD\n\nFormer presidents tend to come together under sad, even dire circumstances — the funeral of a prominent political figure, or a horrific natural disaster.\n\nAD\n\nTen days after the Dec. 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Bush enlisted Clinton and George H.W. Bush to lead what became a successful a global campaign for private donations. Five years later, it was Obama's turn to task Clinton and the younger Bush with collecting aid in the aftermath of an earthquake that devastated much of Haiti.\n\nAs the scope of the destruction became apparent, I spoke to each of these gentlemen, and they each asked the same simple question: 'How can I help?' Obama said with his two predecessors at his side in the Rose Garden. In the days ahead, they'll be asking everyone what they can do — individuals, corporations, NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] and institutions.\n\nWhat's happening now\n\nThe Senate just confirmed Lloyd Austin, 93 to 2, to become the nation's first Black defense secretary\n\nCongress waived a requirement for the defense secretary to be out of the military for seven years. Austin retired as a four-star Army general in 2016, served as head of U.S. Central Command and previously was commander of U.S. troops in Iraq, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. GOP Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Josh Hawley (Mo.) were the two dissenters.

It is essential for residents of the City of St. Louis and our state to have confidence in their leaders, she said. They must know that the Office of the Circuit Attorney will hold public officials accountable in the same manner as any other resident of our city. Both parties and the people of St. Louis deserve a thorough investigation of these allegations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe alleged actions, which have been denied by Greitens' lawyer, stem from a report by KMOV in St. Louis which featured a surreptitious recording purportedly of the woman with whom Greitens acknowledges having an affair in 2015. She describes Greitens inviting her to his home and taking pictures of her naked and then threatening to use them against her if she ever mentioned their relationship.\n\nGreitens (R), responding to media reports, acknowledged Wednesday night that he was unfaithful to his wife a few years ago before being elected. But his lawyer denied the blackmail allegation.\n\nThe lawyer, James F. Bennett, responded to the prosecutor's statement Thursday, saying the governor is very confident he will be cleared in any investigation, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch. This is a three-year-old personal matter that presents no matters of public or legal interest. The facts will prove that fully.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe woman, who has not been named publicly, was Greitens's hair stylist, according to media reports confirmed by The Washington Post with a source familiar with the situation.\n\nA joint statement posted Wednesday night by Greitens and his wife, Sheena, said in part that a few years ago . . . there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage. This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately.\n\nGreitens, 43, is a relatively new star in the Republican Party who boasts an extraordinary résumé: Former Navy SEAL and Lt. Commander, attended Duke University on scholarship; Rhodes scholar at Oxford; PhD, author and White House Fellow during the administration of President George W. Bush. He is the author of Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life and, according to a profile in St. Louis Magazine, has had presidential aspirations since he was a young man. His wife, Sheena Chestnut Greitens, is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Missouri, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Center for East Asian Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\nA Democrat-turned-Republican, Greitens was elected governor in November 2016 after a campaign that emphasized his status as a family man. Greitens and his wife have two children. I'm Eric Greitens, he said during the campaign. I'm a Navy SEAL, native Missourian and most importantly, a proud husband and father.\n\nMissouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) ran a television commercial featuring him with an assault rifle during the 2016 campaign. (Eric Greitens)\n\nThe governor had just delivered his state-of-the-state address Wednesday when KMOV in St. Louis broke the story about his affair with his former hairdresser in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe extramarital relationship itself, however, may have been the least explosive part of the story.\n\nMore unusual was what she purportedly said in a recording made surreptitiously by the woman's jealous ex-husband, which the station played.\n\nIn it, she can be heard telling how Greitens invited her to his home in 2015. Once she arrived, he told her he would show her how to do pullups, taped her hands to exercise rings and blindfolded her, all with her consent.\n\nThen, to her shock, she alleged, he snapped photographs of her naked and threatened to distribute the pictures if she revealed the relationship.\n\nOn what was supposed to be a banner evening for Greitens, he then was forced to issue the statement with his wife confirming the affair. His wife also issued her own statement:\n\nAD\n\nWe have a loving marriage and an awesome family; anything beyond that is between us and God. I want the media and those who wish to peddle gossip to stay away from me and my children.\n\nNeither the governor or his wife said anything about the reported photo shoot or the alleged blackmail threat.\n\nAD\n\nThat came in a separate statement by the couple's attorney, Bennett, who denied the blackmail claim. There was no 'blackmail,'  lawyer Bennett said in a written statement, and that claim is false . . . The outrageous claims of improper contact regarding these almost three-year-ago events are a lie.\n\nThe whole story, which had been the stuff of wild rumors for weeks, originated with the spurned ex-husband, who told KMOV that the relationship between Greitens and the man's then-wife had led to the breakup of their marriage.\n\nAfterward, the ex-husband went on social media calling Greitens a homewrecker, according to KMOV. He then tried to go public with his story and with the recording, speaking with both of Missouri's major newspapers.\n\nAD\n\nThe St. Louis Post Dispatch and the Kansas City Star reported that they too had possession of a transcript of the surreptitious recording and had interviewed the ex-husband. Both papers said they had decided against writing a story because the woman declined to be interviewed. Once the governor released a public statement the papers pushed ahead with their stories.\n\nAD\n\nKMOV decided otherwise. Although it said it had no on-the-record-comment from the woman, it went with the story Wednesday night under the headline Blackmail alleged as Governor Greitens admits to extramarital affair and took credit for prompting Greitens's statement.\n\nI am not after anything, the ex-husband, who was also unnamed, told KMOV. I am not a part of politics. I am not a part of anything. I just want to move on with my life.\n\nAD\n\nHe claimed to have been contacted by law enforcement authorities as well as members of the media.\n\nBennett, Greitens's lawyer, said in his statement that there was nothing about the relationship that has generated or should generate law enforcement interest.\n\nGreitens has received mixed reviews in as governor. While campaigning on a platform of cleaning up government, he admitted to the Missouri Ethics Commission that he had violated campaign finance law, according to the Kansas City Star. He was fined $1,000. He and his senior staff have also come under fire for using an app that deletes text messages after they've been read, raising concerns about trying to subvert Missouri open records law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nComments posted on Greitens's Facebook page reflected a mixed reaction to the Wednesday's revelations.\n\nThis was March of 2015, wrote one woman, most likely when your wife was pregnant or had a new baby. There are transcripts. What is so fraudulent is that Eric Greitens ran as a 'family man.' \n\nThere are many in Missouri who stand behind you as governor, wrote another, and support your family . . . Lead on and God Bless!\n\nHere is the full statement, as posted on Facebook, by Greitens and his wife and the couple's lawyer:\n\nI wanted to share with you some statements that are important in light of news you may have seen tonight. A statement from James F. Bennett, our attorney: The Governor has now seen the TV report that ran tonight. The station declined to provide the tape or transcript in advance of running their story, which contained multiple false allegations. The claim that this nearly three-year old story has generated or should generate law enforcement interest is completely false. There was no 'blackmail,' and that claim is false. This personal matter has been addressed by the Governor and Mrs. Greitens privately years ago when it happened. The outrageous claims of improper conduct regarding these almost three-year-ago events are a lie. Joint statement from Sheena and I: A few years ago, before Eric was elected governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage. This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately. While we never would have wished for this pain in our marriage, or the pain that this has caused others, with God's mercy Sheena has forgiven and we have emerged stronger. We understand that there will be some people who cannot forgive — but for those who can find it in your heart, Eric asks for your forgiveness, and we are grateful for your love, your compassion, and your prayers.\n\nThis story has been updated.
Dear Amy: I recently started working for a new company in a pretty heavily male-dominated field.\n\nOn certain emails sent to large groups of co-workers, I've noticed that my colleagues address the email to Gentlemen.\n\nThere are at least two females cc'd on most of these emails.\n\nI feel as though the emails are not addressed to me with this greeting; I believe that it is old-fashioned and offensive. Do you have thoughts on how to address this — without ruffling feathers or coming off the wrong way?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo Gentleman\n\nNo Gentleman: When composing a professional group email, the writer needs to imagine the intended recipients gathered together in a conference room.\n\nIt is not professional (or polite) to address a group of colleagues — where at least one is a woman — as gentlemen.\n\nOne option for you now is to compose a group email addressed to your colleagues with the salutation: Ladies.\n\nAh, but you and I know that you probably cannot do this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps you could send out a group email to your work group with the subject line, A Quick Suggestion.\n\nIn the body of the email you could write: It would be helpful (certainly to me) if we could address emails to our working group as 'Colleagues' or a similar gender-neutral term. I don't speak for the other women in our group, but when I am included on emails addressed to 'Gentlemen,' I'm sometimes unsure if they are intended for me.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you are not willing to do this, or are unable to because of your position, you could ask your supervisor or HR representative for suggestions on how to handle this salutation situation. This is not the biggest (or the most sexist) issue you will encounter, but you should react honestly. — May 2015\n\nDear Amy: I started a new job four years ago and within a couple of weeks began to develop feelings for my supervisor.\n\nOver the years we have gotten to know each other well. We are similar in temperament and personality. I am very attracted to him and I have sensed all this time that the feeling is mutual; there's clearly a connection between us.\n\nAD\n\nBesides the fact that he is my supervisor, we are also both married. For four years I have attempted to push down, ignore, cover up, rationalize and in every other way remove my feelings from my heart and mind. Obviously there is no future for us, and I can't figure out why I can't just accept the attraction and move on.\n\nAD\n\nI'm in my mid-40s; too old for this! Sometimes it feels like I'm keeping a secret that has power over me, and if I could just share the secret with him it would diffuse the power. But I realize that would endanger my job and my reputation, so I immediately put that thought out of my mind.\n\nHow can I work out these feelings? Honestly, it's become exhausting. Is leaving my job the only way?\n\nAD\n\nMy husband is a good man. He is hard-working, smart and he loves me deeply. I hope you can provide some insight into how to control my mind and feelings while working for this wonderful man whom I admire and adore.\n\nConflicted\n\nConflicted: Having a great spouse doesn't make you blind. And most people continue to feel attractions to people other than their partners throughout their lives. Mainly, this is relatively benign and even life-affirming. But the key to how you are feeling now is to be found in your marriage and your inner life. You are at a midlife transition and you can grow through it.\n\nAD\n\nI give you credit for not blaming your husband for this or inventing faults to justify your feelings. This is an opportunity, really, to reassess your life (personal and professional).\n\nAD\n\nPlease, find a counselor to share this with before you do anything drastic. I agree with you that sharing this secret may diminish its power, but you need to share it with the right person.\n\nFor insight, read The Breaking Point: How Female Midlife Crisis Is Transforming Today's Women, by Sue Shellenbarger (2005, Henry Holt and Co.). — April 2013

With this deal, both sides also achieved their secondary mission. For LeMahieu, 32, that meant securing a guaranteed figure — $90 million — that represents by far the largest in baseball this offseason (though Trevor Bauer, George Springer or J.T. Realmuto eventually could exceed it) and one that comes close to the $92 million third baseman Josh Donaldson (over four years) received from the Minnesota Twins a year ago. The latter was thought to be LeMahieu's target at the start of the free agent signing period.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the Yankees, the secondary mission was keeping LeMahieu's average annual value — $15 million, as it turns out — low enough to allow room for the addition of a starting pitcher while still keeping their 2021 payroll below the luxury tax threshold of $210 million. The Yankees may have made their move later Friday, when they reportedly agreed to a one-year contract with right-hander Corey Kluber, a two-time AL Cy Young winner. The trendy phrase of this offseason is financial flexibility, and the Yankees — despite being on the hook for more than a half a billion dollars to Giancarlo Stanton and Gerrit Cole through 2028 — achieved a measure of it with the LeMahieu deal.\n\nBut consider the significant concessions each side had to make to keep the marriage together. LeMahieu, coming off an MVP-caliber season in which he hit .364 with a 1.011 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, receives an average annual salary that probably won't rank among the top 60 in the game in 2021. It is lower, in fact, than the MLB-wide qualifying offer of $18.9 million that teams could offer their free agents this offseason to stay for another year — and that all but two players rejected.\n\nIt is a solid bet LeMahieu could have made more on a per-year basis elsewhere — with the Toronto Blue Jays believed to have been the most aggressive suitor — had he opted for that over the larger guarantee. But it is also possible he encountered a free agent market that had been depressed somewhat by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Yankees' concession was related to LeMahieu's age. He turns 33 in July, which means the team will be paying him an average of $15 million annually through the end of 2026, by which point he will be 38.\n\nOf course, if LeMahieu becomes unproductive in the late stages of his career, the Yankees, with their vast resources, can afford to carry him — particularly at such a relatively low salary. But it is still jarring, in the age of financial flexibility, to see a team overextend in terms of years to sign a player who is soon entering his mid-30s, and it is a safe assumption that, all other things considered, the Yankees would have preferred a shorter deal. Just as LeMahieu chose guaranteed dollars over AAV, the Yankees chose the opposite.
Dear Amy: I am a 33-year-old woman who has kept a secret since I was in junior high school.\n\nA relative who is a few years older than me, Steve, did some sexually inappropriate things to me. It didn't involve nudity, and I'd rather not get into detail, but it was very inappropriate and made me quite uncomfortable.\n\nI never told anyone about this. Our parents were close, and I never wanted to cause any hardship between them.\n\nAD\n\nIt has not mattered before because we would see that part of the family so infrequently that I was able to avoid him.\n\nAD\n\nI have mostly forgotten about the incident except for occasional flashbacks that I quickly repress.\n\nWe were recently sent a save the date announcement for Steve's wedding.\n\nI have no desire to celebrate him in any way, much less be forced to go to his wedding.\n\nMy mother takes these occasions very seriously and has not responded well to my initial attempts to tell her that I do not want to attend.\n\nI don't think any excuse (except telling her the truth) will get me out of this and still be in her good graces.\n\nI don't want to tell the truth now because our mothers are very close, and I don't want to upset that relationship.\n\nAD\n\n— Worried\n\nWorried: If you try hard enough, you can always find a good reason for not revealing the truth — to protect your mother's relationships, for instance.\n\nShedding light on this secret might be the best thing for you, and I could well imagine that your mother would want to know (most loyal mothers would).\n\nAD\n\nYou should get used to the idea that your mother is going to be upset, regardless of what you choose to do.\n\nYou could try to hedge by saying, Mom, I really don't like 'Steve.' I haven't liked him since we were kids. I don't want to go to his wedding.\n\nThat might be enough of an explanation for your mother, but you should ask yourself if this is really right for you.\n\nAD\n\nAugust 2020\n\nDear Amy: I'm getting married in September and have been planning my wedding for quite a while. My mom and I have been paying for everything related to the wedding, and my father and stepmother haven't offered any money.\n\nThey've been telling me about financial hardships that they've been having, but I notice they have been buying high-ticket items for their three girls.\n\nHow can I ask them to contribute when they claim to have no money?\n\nAD\n\nMy fiance's family also hasn't offered to contribute.\n\nHow do I broach that subject with them — I know his mom doesn't like me, but I'd appreciate the support.\n\n— Fed Up\n\nFed Up: You and your fiance (not you and your mother) should be in charge of paying for and financing your wedding.\n\nAD\n\nConsider this the first test of your marriage. If you and your fiance tackle this together, you will have the benefit of each other's assistance when trying to raise the money for your nuptials. If your mother isn't in the mix, your father may be more inclined to contribute, and if your future husband takes the lead in approaching his family, they may pony up. The best way to do this is respectfully — and in person.\n\nYou should take your discomfort as a sign that you should be judicious and realistic when asking people to open their wallets.\n\nAD\n\nYou two should plan only the wedding you know you can afford.\n\nJanuary 2010\n\nDear Amy: Responding to the question of what to do with your wedding gown (after you've used it), I got married in a Jessica McClintock ensemble of white lace jodhpurs, a black silk jacket and a lace jabot.\n\nAD\n\nThis Halloween for our neighborhood pet costume contest I made my cat, Roscoe, a wedding dress and used my lace jabot as his veil.\n\nRoscoe won best in show!\n\nOf course, my jabot went back in the cedar chest afterward.\n\n— Proud Cat Owner\n\nProud Cat Owner: And people say that cat owners are a little eccentric! I'm imagining your costumed cat, as well as the next use for your lace jabot.\n\nNovember 2010
Six days earlier, Cheney was in the House chamber, urging that Republicans reject efforts pushed by Trump and many others in her party to challenge the electoral college results that determined Trump had lost his reelection bid.

Then she heard a mob banging on the chamber's doors and a shot fired, and realized that an attempted insurrection was underway. She hustled to a secure location and later called Fox News.\n\nThere is no question that the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob, Cheney told the network where she once worked and whose pundits had long supported Trump.

He did not.\n\nThe decision marked an extraordinary denouement for Cheney and her potentially precarious perch in the party's leadership. She had feuded for months with Trump and lately had been at odds with the majority of her caucus, even as speculation mounts about whether she might one day seek the speakership. The move was applauded by those in the party who have urged a clean break with Trump.\n\nIt is a remarkable statement that sets a new bar for leadership in the House, said Brendan Buck, a former aide to House Speaker John A. Boehner. She is turning the page on Donald Trump. I think she is doing the right thing in her mind, and when you do the right thing for the right reasons you have to hope the politics work out for you.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, he said, the decision will prompt Republicans who disagree with her decision to consider whether there should be political consequences for her internally.\n\nTuesday night, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) called for Cheney to step down as the chair of the House Republican Conference. She is weakening our conference at a key moment for personal political gain and is unfit to lead, he said in a statement.\n\nLiz Cheney, 54, has been a member of the House of Representatives for only four years, coinciding with Trump's presidency. But she rose in meteoric fashion to the top ranks of GOP leadership after just one term representing Wyoming, leaving admirers and enemies in her wake.\n\nAD\n\nLiz Cheney declined to comment. Richard Cheney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nShe and her father have had an up-and-down relationship with Trump that turned toxic. As she heard Trump and many of her colleagues declare several weeks ago that Congress should seek to challenge the electoral college results, she sat down to write a 21-page memo warning Republicans against the effort.\n\nAD\n\nBy objecting to electoral slates, members are unavoidably asserting that Congress has the authority to overturn elections and overrule state and federal courts, she wrote in the memo, which she released last week. Such objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the President and bestowing it instead on Congress. This is directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nCheney's memo was hailed by Democrats. But the advice was not heeded by the vast majority of those in Cheney's caucus, as 139 out of 211 House Republicans voted to challenge electoral college votes from Arizona, Pennsylvania or both.\n\nAmong those supporting the effort to challenge the results was Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), a potential rival to Cheney for the speakership if Republicans regain the House in two years. McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks said Republicans welcome differing views and said the leadership team is united.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday night, in a conference call with Republicans, McCarthy said he opposed impeachment, while Cheney declined to reveal her view, other than to say, This is going to be a vote of conscience.\n\nAttacking Democrats\n\nCheney served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs during the administration of her father's first term as vice president. She then played a crucial role in the 2004 Bush-Cheney reelection campaign, after which she returned to her post at the State Department and later served a stint as a Fox News pundit.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, Cheney sought Wyoming's lone U.S. House seat, which her father had once held. After winning the seat, Cheney's ambition was to become one of the most powerful women on Capitol Hill.\n\nAfter winning reelection in 2018, a year in which Republicans lost control of the House, enabling Nancy Pelosi to become speaker, Cheney ran for a post traditionally sought by longtime members: leadership of the House Republican Conference Committee.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nShe won the post by arguing that Republicans needed to change their messaging and be more aggressive. Soon she was launching all-out assaults, saying in March 2019 on NBC's Meet the Press that Democrats were the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party of socialism.\n\nAD\n\nModerator Chuck Todd responded by asking Cheney, Do you feel comfortable that President Trump has done enough to tamp down this right-wing fringe anti-Semitism that has been rising up?\n\nCheney did not directly answer the question, which foreshadowed elements of the attack on the Capitol. Look, I don't believe this is right or left, she said. I think this is an issue on which all of us should come together.\n\nTrump had feuded with Cheney's father, saying in 2011 that I didn't like Cheney when he was a vice president. Here's a guy that did a rotten job as vice president. Nobody liked him.\n\nAD\n\nRichard Cheney, meanwhile, said in February 2016 that Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat and that he would not endorse him. But two months later, CNN reported that Cheney was breaking with the two former Bush presidents, who did not support Trump, and endorsed him at a time when the candidate had all but wrapped up the nomination.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the election, with Liz Cheney winning a House seat at the same time Trump captured the presidency, Trump baldly tried to win the Cheney family's goodwill. He pardoned the elder Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis Scooter Libby, who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice. Trump said Liz Cheney had pushed for the pardon.\n\nSpeaking at the White House in July 2019, Trump said, Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly and Liz was right in the forefront of that one and I said, 'What do you think, Liz,' and you said, 'Absolutely, he deserves it,' and it's been a very popular pardon. At another event, Trump said that Liz Cheney was so dedicated — and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it. He called Cheney a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future.\n\nAD\n\nSoon, however, Cheney and Trump were at political war.\n\nA fight with Trump\n\nCheney criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus, seeming to scorn the president's resistance to wearing a mask by tweeting a picture of her father wearing a face covering with the hashtag #realmenwearmasks. After Trump said I appreciate support from QAnon, the conspiracy theory group, Cheney called it a dangerous lunacy.\n\nCheney blasted Trump's proposal to withdraw U.S. troops from Germany as dangerously misguided, prompting a rebuke from Trump, who tweeted that Liz Cheney is only upset because I have been actively getting our great and beautiful Country out of the ridiculous and costly Endless Wars. The dispute prompted some House Republicans to launch a failed effort to oust her from her leadership post.\n\nIn his speech inciting the mob to storm the Capitol, Trump sounded obsessed with Cheney's criticism of him on the issue. After saying we got to get rid of Cheney, he said, You know, she never wants a soldier brought home. I brought a lot of soldiers home.\n\nCheney, who was unanimously reelected to her leadership position in November, has a voting record that underscores her conservatism. She has high ratings from right-leaning organizations and zero percent ratings from groups such as the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for gay rights; the League of Conservation Voters; and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, according to GovTrack.\n\nStuart Stevens, a political consultant who worked with Liz Cheney during both Bush-Cheney campaigns and recently wrote a book in which he predicted she would run for president, said she has become the de facto leader of the Republican Party, which he said should be distinguished from what he called the pro-Trump authoritarian party.\n\nCheney's recent actions helped mend a family rift. She was once criticized by her sister, Mary, who is openly gay and married, for opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nAs many people know, Liz and I have definitely had our differences, but I am incredibly proud of how she handled herself during the fight over the Electoral College, Mary Cheney wrote on her Facebook page last week. She stood up to President Trump. . . . He even denounced her by name from the stage at yesterday's rally — something that should definitely be considered a badge of honor. Good job Big Sister.
Bearded, baggy-eyed, habitually high on drugs or alcohol, Stone cut a curious figure at catered cocktail parties. He resembled an avatar of old Key West, a shrimper or deep-sea fisherman, a hell raiser temporarily ashore squandering his pay and his health. But he didn't behave like an island brawler. His bruises and scars came from falling down or stumbling into plate glass doors, not from fighting. He seldom raised his voice — which was surprisingly patrician — and rarely cut short his autodidactic monologues. Although a college dropout with a GED high school degree, he possessed arcane knowledge of religion, art, literature and history. Stone's most striking feature, however, was his hands — not big work-roughened mitts, but soft palms and the gentlest grip of any man I've ever met.\n\nBecause Stone knew I had been a friend of Graham Greene, whom he loathed, we danced around that subject. It was a shame, I thought, since Greene and Stone had so much in common — disorder and early sorrow, a weakness for drink and drugs, and an enduring interest in women, all tidily packaged in Catholic guilt.\n\nIn the biography Child of Light, Madison Smartt Bell captures every aspect of Stone's contradictory nature, especially his work ethic. Each of Stone's novels — from Hall of Mirrors (1966) through the National Book Award winning Dog Soldiers (1974) to his final book, Death of the Black-Haired Girl (2013) — was achieved despite the author's crippling depressions, repeated bouts of ill health and unwise dependence on self-medication.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA prolific writer himself, with more than 20 books, including a biography of Haitian revolutionary leader Toussaint L'Ouverture, Bell was also a friend of Stone's and occasionally a traveling companion. One of the best sections of this praiseworthy biography is the account of a trip he took with Stone to Haiti, along with one of Stone's mistresses, who had to nursemaid the novelist when it appeared that he might die while traveling to a voodoo ritual.\n\nYet sympathetic as he is to his subject, Bell never softens his focus or smooths over Stone's less admirable traits. A great deal of the credit for this candor goes to Stone's partner, whom Michael Herr christened the patron saint of writers' wives. Janice Stone served as her husband's muse, first reader, typist, cook and caretaker, accountant, travel agent and life coach. Unlike so many literary marriages, theirs lasted 55 years, and after Stone's death Janice remained her husband's helpmate and his biographer's enabler. Where other widows might protect a great man's reputation (and perhaps their own financial interest) by destroying unflattering documents or restricting access to diaries and letters, Janice set nothing off the record. Along with accounts of Stone's medications (recreational and otherwise), his stretches in rehab and his suicide attempt, Janice provided information about Stone's sexual escapades and her own affairs, which he encouraged. They had married young, before the late 60s' sexual liberation, and the Stones allowed each other astonishing leeway. Stone fathered a child with another woman, and even that didn't alienate Janice.\n\nBell has a novelist's gimlet eye for details, and the Stone archive offered him rich material. It revealed as much about the state of publishing in the 21st century as it did about Stone. By any objective standard, Stone was a successful author whose novels were critically acclaimed and received geometrically increasing advances. Paid $1,500 for his first novel, Stone finished his career with a million-dollar multi-book contract. As Bell reminisced in the New Yorker, Stone's life could be read as a fulfillment of the American dream of which his work was so critical.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut he never escaped the damage he suffered during his Dickensian childhood. Raised by an unmarried schizophrenic mother in a series of squalid hotel rooms, Stone was never told anything more about his father than his mother's unreliable report that the man was a Greek, a Jew, or a Lebanese. (A DNA test contained no information to support his mother's claims.) When his mother became unfit to care for him, Stone was consigned for four years to a Catholic orphanage where the faith was literally pounded into him. By the time mother and son were reunited, Stone was essentially a street child, and by his early teens, a drunk and a drug user. A stint in the U.S. Navy introduced him to a life more abundant, although it also reinforced his appetite for intoxicants and women.\n\nNot unreasonably, Bell maintains that Stone's accomplishments more than outweigh his transgressions. And who would argue otherwise when his wife forgave him everything? While I wish there had been more about Stone's early life, the daughter he fathered outside his marriage and the sexual partners who clearly influenced his fiction, Bell does a laudable job of explicating Stone's novels, including the dark ones like Outerbridge Reach, and the breezy autobiography Prime Green, which describes Stone's friendship with Ken Kesey. In the end, Child of Light leaves the reader with the urge to return to all of Robert Stone's work — surely the best sign of a fine biography.\n\nMichael Mewshaw's most recent book, The Lost Prince: A Search for Pat Conroy, was longlisted for the PEN biography award.\n\nCHILD OF LIGHT\n\nA Biography of Robert Stone\n\nBy Madison Smartt Bell
The former Republican senator from Indiana, appointed by President Trump, has sought to protect the independence of spy agencies to provide candid and cleareyed assessments of what's really going on in the world, especially vis-a-vis the threat posed by Vladimir Putin's revanchist Russia.\n\nAD\n\nIn the past, there's been a public report and a separate classified version. But this year there is only one version – and it's entirely unclassified. This is part of an effort by Coats to be more transparent in the face of sustained attacks from the president and his allies on the right against what they've taken to calling the Deep State.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has routinely clashed with the intelligence community, likening the agencies to Nazi Germany shortly before he took office, repeatedly questioning their expert consensus that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and boasting about his inauguration crowd size during a speech in front of the wall of stars that honors the fallen at CIA headquarters.\n\nWe need to assure our policymaking community, and the American people, that we can be trusted with this responsibility to use our information appropriately to protect the nation, Coats said in an afternoon speech to more than 150 members of his staff in McLean, Va. Through transparency, we will strengthen America's faith that the intelligence community seeks the truth – and speaks the truth.\n\n-- Here are the 10 biggest truth bombs from the 36-page Coats report. These are direct quotes:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n1. Traditional adversaries will continue attempts to gain and assert influence, taking advantage of changing conditions in the international environment — including the weakening of the post-WWII international order and dominance of Western democratic ideals, increasingly isolationist tendencies in the West, and shifts in the global economy.\n\n2. Russian efforts to increase its influence and authority are likely to continue and may conflict with U.S. goals and priorities in multiple regions.\n\n3. No longer a solely U.S. domain, the democratization of space poses significant challenges for the United States. Adversaries are increasing their presence in this domain with plans to reach or exceed parity in some areas. For example, Russia and China will continue to pursue a full range of anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce U.S. military effectiveness and overall security. Increasing commercialization of space now provides capabilities that were once limited to global powers to anyone that can afford to buy them. Many aspects of modern society—to include our ability to conduct military operations—rely on our access to and equipment in space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n4. The ability of individuals and groups to have a larger impact than ever before—politically, militarily, economically, and ideologically—is undermining traditional institutions. This empowerment of groups and individuals is increasing the influence of ethnic, religious, and other sources of identity, changing the nature of conflict, and challenging the ability of traditional governments to satisfy the increasing demands of their populations, increasing the potential for greater instability. Some violent extremist groups will continue to take advantage of these sources and drivers of instability to hold territory, further insurgencies, plan external attacks, and inspire followers to launch attacks wherever they are around the world.\n\n5. Increasing migration and urbanization of populations are further straining the capacities of governments around the world and are likely to result in further fracturing of societies, potentially creating breeding grounds for radicalization. Pressure points include growing influxes of migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons fleeing conflict zones; areas of intense economic or other resource scarcity; and areas threatened by climate changes, infectious disease outbreaks, or transnational criminal organizations. All of these issues will continue to drive global change on an unprecedented scale.\n\n6. Advances in nano- and bio-technologies have the potential to cure diseases and modify human performance, but without common ethical standards and shared interests to govern these developments, they have the potential to pose significant threats to U.S. interests and security. In addition, the development and spread of such technologies remain uneven, increasing the potential to drastically widen the divide between so-called 'haves' and 'have-nots.'\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n7. Despite growing awareness of cyber threats and improving cyber defenses, nearly all information, communication networks, and systems will be at risk for years to come. Our adversaries are becoming more adept at using cyberspace capabilities to threaten our interests and advance their own strategic and economic objectives. Cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to public health, safety, and prosperity as information technologies are integrated into critical infrastructure, vital national networks, and consumer devices.\n\n8. Many adversaries continue to pursue capabilities to inflict catastrophic damage to U.S. interests through the acquisition and use of [weapons of mass destruction]. Their possession of these capabilities can have major impacts on U.S. national security, overseas interests, allies, and the global order. The intelligence challenges to countering the proliferation of WMD and advanced conventional weapons are increasing as actors become more sophisticated, WMD-related information becomes broadly available, proliferation mechanisms increase, and as political instability erodes the security of WMD stockpiles.\n\n9. Continued federal budget uncertainty strains the [intelligence community's] ability to make deliberative and responsive resource decisions. The outcome may be overextended budgets or lack of cost-effective solutions to address intelligence issues. The [intelligence community] needs to develop methods to efficiently shift resources to mitigate programmatic (fiscal) risk and avoid loss of vital programs, capabilities, and resource investments.\n\n10. There will likely be demand for greater intelligence support to domestic security, driven in part by concerns over the threat of terrorism, the threat posed by transnational illicit drug and human trafficking networks, and the threat to U.S. critical infrastructure. Intelligence support to counter these threats must be conducted … with adequate protection for civil liberties and privacy.\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Despots — and would-be despots — have seen in Trump a model, as well as an alibi, Griff Witte, Carol Morello, Shibani Mahtani and Anthony Faiola report in today's newspaper. The strongman style of leadership is not new, of course, and it is not always obvious who is inspiring whom. But in interviews on four continents, diplomats, rights activists and foreign officials said that after two years of Trump using the world's most powerful megaphone to cheer authoritarians, bully democratic allies and denigrate traditional American values, the impact on how others govern is becoming clear.\n\nViktor Orban, Hungary 's increasingly autocratic leader, said Trump represents 'permission' from 'the highest position in the world.'\n\nTo Jair Bolsonaro, the new president of Brazil , the U.S. president is … proof that incendiary comments about women or minorities and a history of trafficking in conspiracy theories don't need to stand in the way of taking power.\n\nWhen the Nigerian army opened fire on rock-throwing demonstrators last fall, killing as many as 40 people, it defended itself by citing Trump's threats to do the same at the Mexican border.\n\nWhen the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia criticized ruler Hun Sen for cracking down on the opposition and the media, the authoritarian leader pointed out that Trump had his back — not the diplomats.\n\nAnd when members of the U.N. Security Council visited Myanmar 's commander in chief in late April to demand explanations for the expulsion of more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, he used the phrase 'fake news' — the only words he spoke in English — no less than a dozen times.\n\nIn Honduras , President Juan Orlando Hernández backed Washington in a vote at the United Nations over U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Then Hernández allegedly used fraud to steal an election, triggering mass protests. Rather than condemn the move, the United States offered its congratulations.\n\nGuatemala also voted with the United States on Jerusalem and announced it would move its own embassy to the city. Months later, in August, President Jimmy Morales declared he was abolishing the mandate of a U.N.-backed commission that had long been known as an effective watchdog in curbing corruption. As he spoke, a column of three dozen jeeps — some with roof-mounted machine guns — that had been supplied by the United States for anti-narcotics operations rolled through Guatemala City, pausing at the commission's offices and the homes of human rights activists.\n\nKey quote: While the global decline in freedom didn't begin with Donald Trump's presidency, I do think he has been an accelerant, said Uzra Zeya, a State Department veteran who resigned last spring following a 25-year career that culminated as the nation's top Foreign Service officer in Paris.\n\n-- Trump's assistant secretary of state in charge of European affairs, who has overseen U.S. relations with NATO and the European Union for the past 16 months, announced his resignation. He cited personal and professional reasons. Carol Morello reports: In September 2017, [A. Wess] Mitchell became one of the first assistant secretaries of state in the Trump administration confirmed by the Senate, and his departure creates another vacancy in the ranks of senior officials. Currently, six of the 24 spots have nominees awaiting Senate confirmation. … In an interview, Mitchell said his resignation is not a protest of the administration's policies or the direction of foreign policy, and he praised [Mike] Pompeo's leadership and vision.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- The House overwhelmingly passed a bill aimed at preventing Trump from trying to pull out of NATO. Karoun Demirjian reports: The vast majority of House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the bill by a vote of 357 to 22, after members of both parties gave impassioned speeches for why the alliance was so vital to preserve and protect. 'Time and again the alliance has proven that the free peoples of the world are strongest when they stand together,' said Rep. Michael McCaul (Tex.), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He called the alliance 'a bulwark against international terror' and 'critical to our national security, and to the preservation of our military prowess around the world.'\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nGET SMART FAST:​​\n\nA North Carolina judge declined Republican congressional candidate Mark Harris's request to certify the results of his race amid an ongoing election fraud investigation.

(Jon Thurber)\n\nThe FBI Agents Association held a news conference Jan. 22 to talk about how the ongoing government shutdown is affecting cases. (Reuters)\n\nSHUTDOWN, DAY 33:\n\nAD\n\n-- Hundreds of IRS workers have gotten permission to skip work because of financial hardship, just as the tax season gets busy. Danielle Paquette, Lisa Rein, Jeff Stein and Kimberly Kindy report: The Trump administration last week ordered at least 30,000 IRS workers back to their offices, where they have been working to process refunds without pay. … But IRS employees across the country — some in coordinated protest, others out of financial necessity — won't be clocking in, according to Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, and several local union officials. The work action is widespread and includes employees from a processing center in Ogden, Utah, to the Brookhaven campus on New York's Long Island.\n\nAD\n\nThe move is the leading edge of pushback from within the IRS, and it signals the potential for civil servants to take actions that could slow or cripple government functions as the political stalemate continues in Washington. U.S. Department of Agriculture meat inspectors have begun to call in sick, Transportation Security Administration sickouts at airports have been rising, and federal law enforcement agencies say the shutdown is increasing stress among agents and affecting investigations. … Not receiving pay for more than a month has taken a toll on employees across the government, but especially on those who are not in high-salary jobs. The employees summoned back from furlough to process tax refunds are paid between $25,800 and $51,000 a year, depending on their seniority.\n\n-- Irony alert: The shutdown has forced the State Department to postpone an international conference on border security. CNN's Michelle Kosinski and Jennifer Hansler report: The 16th International Export Control and Border Security Conference was scheduled to take place in Edinburgh, Scotland, in mid-February, with a goal of preventing the proliferation and transfer of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons across borders. However, it has been postponed 'due to uncertainty associated with the continuing partial U.S. federal government shutdown,' according to a letter ... signed by Kathryn Insley, the director of the Office of Export Control Cooperation.\n\nAD\n\n-- A group representing FBI agents issued a report saying the shutdown is affecting investigations on child trafficking, terrorism and more. The New York Times's Katie Benner reports: Because of the shutdown, the F.B.I. has been unable to issue grand jury subpoenas and indictments in several cases cited in the report. An agent working on an MS-13 investigation that has gone on for more than three years and resulted in 23 gang indictments for racketeering, murder and money laundering has been hamstrung by his inability to pay for an interpreter who can communicate with his Spanish-speaking informants, the report said. The bureau has also not been able to pay its informants, an important source of intelligence in terrorism, narcotics, gang, illegal firearm and other national security cases. The F.B.I. could lose those informants. (Read the full 72-page report here.)\n\nAD\n\n-- The funding lapse has also delayed the trial of a man accused of murdering two police officers in the U.S. Virgin Islands because expert witnesses in the case have been furloughed. Deanna Paul reports: Days before the Jan. 10 trial date, assistant attorneys general from the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Justice filed a motion with the local St. Croix court. 'Due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the People's control,' they requested a fourth continuance in the [Francis] Williams murder trial. 'Virtually all of the forensic evidence in this case was processed by scientists and agents attached to the FBI, ATF and the Department of Homeland Security,' prosecutors said in court filings.\n\nPresident Trump said he would be proud to shut down the government. Now the longest government shutdown in history is jeopardizing some of his top priorities. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nPOLITICAL POSTURING:\n\n-- Lawmakers agreed … to more show votes that probably won't end the government shutdown. The Senate will vote tomorrow on competing measures from Trump and Democrats. Both are expected to fail. Erica Werner, John Wagner and Jeff Stein report: The result could be only to prove that some other solution is needed to end the partial shutdown, even as 800,000 federal workers face the loss of a second straight paycheck Friday. Trump's proposal, which the president announced in a weekend speech from the White House, would open the government through Sept. 30 while providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and giving temporary deportation protections to about 1 million unauthorized immigrants. But it also contains stringent changes to the nation's asylum rules, and Democrats who were already united against funding Trump's wall described these asylum provisions Tuesday as a new poison pill. The Democrats' plan is a stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8 without providing any new money for the wall. That would let both parties negotiate on border security while the government is reopened, a respite Democrats have been demanding. …\n\nThursday's planned votes are a product of an agreement between [Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer]. But even as the leaders announced the deal, they traded barbs in speeches on the Senate floor. McConnell accused Democrats of rejecting a reasonable proposal from Trump because of political opposition to the president, and Schumer argued that Republicans and Trump were operating in bad faith by including new asylum curbs and failing to consult with Democrats.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to decline the Trump administration's request for an expedited review of DACA weakened the president's hand: If the court sticks to its normal procedures, even accepting the case at a later date would probably mean the justices would not hear arguments until the court's new term starts in October. That would probably keep the program in place until at least next year. With the court seemingly keeping the program safe for at least a year, Trump's offer to suspend his efforts to end it became less appealing to lawmakers who were already skeptical.\n\n-- Trump is preparing two versions of his State of the Union address, even if Nancy Pelosi declines to invite him to the House chamber and he is forced to give the speech somewhere else. Seung Min Kim reports: The administration is trying to conduct advance work to prepare for an address in the House chamber, originally scheduled for Jan. 29, even though Pelosi has the power to determine whether Trump can do so. … It's unclear what options for venues the White House is exploring aside from the House chamber, where State of the Union addresses have been delivered since President Woodrow Wilson's speech in 1913. On Tuesday, the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said Trump called him to thank him for offering the Raleigh legislature as a venue. Trump told Moore in the phone call Monday evening, which lasted for about 10 minutes, that his staff was still determining where the address would be delivered. Trump also called Lee Chatfield, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, who similarly offered up the chambers in Lansing.\n\n-- Pelosi remains adamant that Democrats will not vote to fund the wall, but several more moderate members want to compromise. Politico's Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report: A group of centrist House Democrats, sick of political posturing, is pressing [Pelosi] to counter Trump's immigration proposal with her own potential compromise. The group, led by freshman Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, is asking the California Democrat to offer Trump a vote on his border wall or some sort of negotiated security package in February if he first signs a bill reopening the federal government … 'Give Trump the money,' Rep. Collin Peterson, a centrist Democrat from a red Minnesota district, told a local radio station Tuesday. 'I'd give him the whole thing…and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this? We're going to build that wall anyway, at some time.'\n\n-- Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) introduced a bill called the Stop STUPIDITY Act to prevent future shutdowns. From Felicia Sonmez: The measure would automatically keep all of the federal government running in the case of a future funding standoff — with the exceptions of the legislative branch and the Executive Office of the President. 'The Stop STUPIDITY Act takes the aggressive but necessary step of forcing the president and Congress to do the jobs they were elected to do,' Warner said in a statement. ... The full name of Warner's measure is the 'Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act.'\n\n-- The bigger picture: Democrats note that Trump is following an established pattern of attempting to force his opponents to capitulate by offering to resolve a disaster of his own making. Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey report: Trump has described this approach as creating leverage and negotiating, but Democrats and other opponents have said it amounts to 'hostage taking.' 'It's sort of like bartering with stolen goods,' [Schumer] said Tuesday. Trump has used the same playbook during confrontations with Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, South Korea, North Korea and the European Union in the past two years with mixed success. … It is a well-worn tactic from Trump's business career, but this is the first time the livelihoods of so many U.S. workers and households have hung in the balance as a result of it.\n\n-- The shutdown has forced Trump to sideline the rest of his agenda. The New York Times's Peter Baker reports: The standoff has already forced Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Europe to meet with global business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown. The president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax-cutting plan he promised last year. He has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy.\n\nThe Supreme Court lifted an injunction on President Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military while the legal battle continues in lower courts. (Reuters)\n\nSCOTUS WATCH:\n\n-- The Supreme Court allowed Trump's transgender troop ban to go into effect as it works its way through lower courts. Robert Barnes and Dan Lamothe report: The justices lifted nationwide injunctions that had kept the administration's policy from being implemented. The Trump policy reverses an Obama administration rule that would have opened the military to transgender men and women and instead bars those who identify with a gender different from the one assigned at birth and are seeking to transition. The court's five conservatives — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh — allowed the restrictions to go into effect while the court decides whether eventually to consider the merits of the case. The liberal justices — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — would have kept the injunctions in place.\n\n-- The high court announced it will consider a New York City gun law, marking the first time the justices have taken up a Second Amendment case in nearly a decade. Robert Barnes reports: The decision to hear the case in the term that begins in October may signal that the reinforced conservative majority on the court is ready to examine more laws that restrict gun rights. New York's law is not replicated elsewhere: It permits transporting handguns only to firing ranges within the city. Those who challenged the law have licenses to keep a handgun at their homes. Petitioners included those who want to take their guns to firing ranges or competitions outside the city, and one who wanted to take the gun to his second home upstate.\n\n-- Barnes, our SCOTUS beat reporter, notes the decision to grand cert on the gun case may provide the most insight yet about where the conservative majority will take the court: The speculation had been that neither conservatives nor liberals knew whether they could count on the vote of the court's median justice, Anthony M. Kennedy. The court turned aside numerous challenges to restrictions on the kinds of guns that could be purchased, and whether they could be carried outside the home. After one such decision in 2018, a frustrated Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that 'as evidenced by our continued inaction in this area, the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court.' But, [law professor Adam] Winkler said, 'there is no hesitancy in Justice Kavanaugh,' who replaced Kennedy and has an expansive view of gun rights.\n\n-- The Trump administration asked the court to accelerate the review of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Barnes reports: Last week, U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman of New York ordered the administration to stop its plans to add the question to the survey. Furman said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross broke a 'veritable smorgasbord' of federal rules by overriding the advice of career officials who said including the citizenship question was likely to cut down the response rate and make the census less accurate. Normally, the Justice Department's next stop would be the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. But Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said that would not leave enough time for a final ruling from the Supreme Court. 'The government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of June 2019 to enable it to be printed on time,' he told the court.\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- Trump's legislative affairs director, Shahira Knight, is looking to leave the administration, Politico's Eliana Johnson and Nancy Cook report: Knight's talk of exiting a job she took less than seven months ago comes as she plays what some call a thankless role in talks between [Trump] and Capitol Hill lawmakers skeptical of cutting a deal [to end the shutdown] with her erratic boss. In recent weeks, she has taken a back seat to the stepped-up efforts of Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\n-- Behind the scenes, Trump's communications team is struggling to convey a consistent message on the shutdown amid an ongoing power struggle. CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak report: The lack of a cohesive strategy emanating from the White House communications team has frustrated people throughout the West Wing who have deemed the press shop 'irrelevant' ... according to interviews with several current and former White House officials. No one has emerged as the clear leader among Sarah Sanders, Bill Shine, Kellyanne Conway or Mercedes Schlapp, leading to deep divisions among one of the administration's most fractious departments and causing a void for a coverage-obsessed president. The communications team has also drawn the ire of dozens of senior staffers, including Trump at times, who have blamed them for failing to blunt PR missteps and allowing them to turn into full-blown disasters.\n\nThe Trump White House in a nutshell: Trump was impressed by [deputy press secretary Hogan] Gidley's television appearances during the previous government shutdown. Once, after watching Gidley on his screen in the residence, the President walked over to the communications office to tell the staff he thought they were handling the shutdown well. In the days afterward, Trump confused several officials when he directed them to, 'Get me Tidley.' 'Who?' puzzled staffers asked. 'Tidley,' Trump replied. 'I want to talk to Hogan Tidley.' They informed him that the deputy press secretary's last name was Gidley, not Tidley.\n\n-- Trump tweeted that he has directed Sanders not to bother with press briefings. From John Wagner: Sanders has not provided an on-camera briefing for more than a month, including the duration of the partial government shutdown. 'The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the 'podium' much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press,' Trump said on Twitter. ... Olivier Knox, president of the White House Correspondents Association, said in a statement that the Trump administration's move 'sets a terrible precedent.'\n\n-- Former White House communications aide Cliff Sims recounts in his new tell-all that the president offered NASA all the money you could ever need to get an astronaut to Mars during his first term. New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi reports: The day of [Trump's televised call to the International Space Station in 2017], Sims conducted a final briefing in the Private Dining Room with Trump, [Betsy] DeVos, [astronaut Kate] Rubins, and Robert Lightfoot Jr., the acting NASA administrator. … Lightfoot explained to the president — who, again, had recently signed a bill containing a plan for Mars — that NASA planned to send a rover to Mars in 2020 and, by the 2030s, would attempt a manned spaceflight. … Sims wrote that [Trump] leaned in toward Lightfoot and made him an offer. 'But what if I gave you all the money you could ever need to do it?' Trump asked. 'What if we sent NASA's budget through the roof, but focused entirely on that instead of whatever else you're doing now. Could it work then?'\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, dialed back comments he made Jan. 20 about negotiations over a Trump Tower project in Moscow. (Drea Cornejo/The Washington Post)\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- BuzzFeed obtained documents outlining detailed plans for Trump Tower Moscow, contradicting comments from Trump and his allies that the proposal fizzled in its earliest stages. BuzzFeed News's Azeen Ghorayshi reports: The plan was dazzling: a glass skyscraper that would stretch higher than any other building in Europe, offering ultra-luxury residences and hotel rooms and bearing a famous name. Trump Tower Moscow, conceived as a partnership between [Trump's] company and a Russian real estate developer, looked likely to yield profits in excess of $300 million. … On Monday, Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said 'the proposal was in the earliest stage,' and he went on to tell the New Yorker that 'no plans were ever made. There were no drafts. Nothing in the file.' However, hundreds of pages of business documents, emails, text messages, and architectural plans, obtained by BuzzFeed News over a year of reporting, tell a very different story. Trump Tower Moscow was a richly imagined vision of upscale splendor on the banks of the Moscow River. …\n\nBy September 2015, a New York architect had completed plans for a bold glass obelisk 100 stories high, to be topped by a gleaming, cut-diamond–like shape emblazoned on multiple sides with the Trump logo. … The Trump team would also have the option to 'brand all or any portion of the spa or fitness facilities' as 'The Spa By Ivanka Trump,' according to the plans. … The top residence of the Moscow tower, enjoying a view without equal in all the continent, was to be a gleaming penthouse, the most luxurious property in a seriously luxurious building. A show-stopping apartment like that could have been marketed for $50 million. But as BuzzFeed News reported in November, Trump's fixers planned not to sell it — but to give it away for free, to none other than Vladimir Putin himself.\n\n-- Trump, like many of his advisers, has grown tired of Giuliani's gaffe-prone media appearances frequently requiring the ex-mayor to walk back his comments, Politico's Eliana Johnson and Darren Samuelsohn report: Trump was apoplectic after a pair of weekend media interviews by his personal lawyer, in which Giuliani said that the president had been involved in discussions to build a Trump Tower in Moscow through the end of the 2016 campaign … Trump spent much of Sunday and Monday fuming to aides and friends about his lawyer's missteps. … Giuliani's public remarks — typically made in sporadic clusters of freewheeling media interviews — have long exasperated White House aides, including the president's in-house lawyer handling the Russia investigation, Emmet Flood. … Asked who in the White House is responsible for handling Giuliani's missteps, a White House aide said, 'Handling Rudy's f--- ups takes more than one man.'\n\nON CAPITOL HILL:\n\n-- In a divorce filing, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) alleges that her husband mentally and emotionally abused her — and even once physically assaulted her. The Des Moines Register's Luke Nozicka and Linh Ta report: 'We went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage,' Ernst wrote [in her affidavit]. 'I very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical.' Joni Ernst said she fled to her mother's house with her daughter in the middle of the night. Gail Ernst followed soon after, crying and apologizing, according to her affidavit. The next day, a victim's advocate at the courthouse performed an examination of Ernst's throat and head, she said; the advocate wanted to take Ernst to the hospital, according to the court filing. Ernst declined, writing that she was 'embarrassed and humiliated' and did not want people to know about what she described as an assault.\n\n-- Ernst, up for reelection next year, also claimed in the court filing she turned down Trump's offer to be his running mate in 2016. The Guardian's Ben Jacobs reports: The Iowa Republican met with Trump in New Jersey at his Bedminister golf course on [July 4, 2016] and gave a positive statement about the meeting. However, within two days, Ernst told Politico: 'I made that very clear to him that I'm focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is.'\n\n-- This Sunday's New York Times Magazine has a lengthy cover story on Mitch McConnell's legacy. The president whom the Senate Republican leader helped elect has turned out to be the one thing he can't control, Charles Homans writes. When I asked Elaine Chao, who is Trump's secretary of transportation and McConnell's wife of 26 years, if Trump and McConnell liked each other, she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, 'You'll have to ask the president that, and you'll have to ask the leader that.' When I did ask McConnell, all he said was, 'Yeah, we get along fine.' …\n\nWhen I asked McConnell how he felt about his legacy and Trump's being so closely linked, he rejected the premise. 'I don't think so,' he said. 'I think the most consequential call I made was before President Trump came to office.' I asked what he meant. 'The decision not to fill the [Antonin] Scalia vacancy,' he said. 'I think that's the most consequential thing I've ever done.'\n\n-- A group of progressive Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), secured seats on the House Oversight Committee, giving them a platform to grill Trump administration officials in a wide variety of investigations. Politico's Andrew Desiderio and Heather Caygle report: [Ocasio-Cortez], Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) won spots on the high-profile committee on Tuesday … Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the Oversight Committee, dismissed concerns about the outspoken freshman lawmakers. 'If I based the choices going on the committee based on what people said or their reputations or whatever, I probably wouldn't have a committee,' Cummings said.\n\n-- Ocasio-Cortez a popular choice for president — even though she's too young to serve, by John Wagner: A new poll finds that 74 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults would consider voting for [Ocasio-Cortez] for president if they could. For now, they can't. Ocasio-Cortez, who last year became the youngest woman elected to Congress, is 29. Under the Constitution, you must be at least 35 to be president. The Axios-SurveyMonkey poll highlights the splash that Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, has made since her arrival this month on Capitol Hill. The 74 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults who say they would vote for her for president includes 17 percent who say they would 'definitely' do so.\n\n-- Ocasio-Cortez Builds a National Platform, but a District Office? Not Open Yet, by the New York Times's J. David Goodman: In three short weeks in office, [Ocasio-Cortez] has shaped a national conversation on taxation, emerged as the face of a green jobs plan in Washington and elevated her initials into a worldwide brand. But she has not yet opened an office in her own New York City district — a delay that may give a sense of her priorities early in her tenure. During an appearance on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' on Monday, she blamed the government shutdown. … But the shutdown has not had a similar effect on other first-term Congress members from New York State.\n\n-- Rep. Maxine Waters, the new chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, intends to call three major credit reporting firms to testify on Capitol Hill. From Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt: Top executives from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are expected to appear at a hearing anticipated for Feb. 26, the sources said. … Waters, a California Democrat, is an outspoken critic of the industry, and the hearing will put a spotlight on legislation she drafted to revamp its practices. … The hearing will be a preview of the kind of intense scrutiny that Waters has vowed to direct at big banks and top Trump administration officials in the coming months.\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg entered the 2020 Democratic primary. Cathleen Decker reports: Buttigieg made his plans official in a video and email sent to supporters early Wednesday, before taking part in the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in Washington, D.C. He announced in December that he would not seek a third term as mayor of the Indiana city, a move widely seen as a precursor to a presidential run. He said Wednesday he was setting up an exploratory committee for president, the legal mechanism allowing him to raise and spend money on behalf of his campaign. Buttigieg suffused his announcement with references to his youth and the generational exception he represents compared to most of the Democratic field. He turned 37 on Saturday, making him the youngest entrant so far in the presidential race.\n\n-- The narrative: Democratic presidential candidates across the board are embracing liberal and populist policies, demonstrating how much the party has transformed in recent years. David Weigel and Jenna Johnson report: For years, Democratic presidential candidates have been skittish about taking positions that were considered too liberal, for fear of scaring off moderates and independent voters. That caution seems to be gone, along with soul-searching about making explicit appeals to conservative voters. … The party's swift shift has left vulnerable several Democratic candidates or likely ones who have voting records and previous stances that are out-of-line with current Democratic thinking. Those who defend their earlier stances risk seeming stuck in time to party that's quickly transforming, while those who have changed their positions risk being labeled as flip-floppers and opportunists.\n\n-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) used a visit to the early primary state of South Carolina to pitch himself to black voters in a stark difference from his 2016 campaign. Annie Linskey and David Weigel report: 'Racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality,' Sanders said, in a speech that used the refrain 'racism is alive' to walk through a litany of problems faced by minorities. The changes from Sanders's last campaign were hard to miss. In 2016, he said that 'identity politics' distracted from what he considered real issues, like economic inequality and the decline of organized labor. This week, on his first trip to an early-primary state since the midterm elections, Sanders called [Trump] a 'racist,' pushed for an end to private prisons, endorsed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote and advocated for an end to the cash bail system. He spoke at two black churches, mingled with supporters at a barbecue joint and met with the state's legislative black caucus, which had largely rejected him in 2016.\n\n-- The South Carolina primary is taking on outsize significance in the 2020 Democratic nominating fight. The New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Astead W. Herndon report: The primary here may still be 405 days away and only fourth on the calendar of early-nominating states, behind Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. But at a time when [Trump] has stoked racial divisions and black voters have become an increasingly crucial Democratic constituency, South Carolina is already looming larger at the outset of this race than in any recent Democratic nominating contest. … The winner here will enter the March 3 Super Tuesday contests with a burst of momentum.\n\n-- Michael Bloomberg, who is weighing a presidential bid leaning on his centrist image, emphasized the importance of compromise in an Annapolis speech. Rachel Chason reports: He gave the keynote speech Tuesday at a leadership conference at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, praising the late senator John McCain — an academy alumnus — for his independence and willingness to work across the aisle. … Following meetings with Maryland lawmakers and state Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D), Bloomberg spoke at a news conference about the importance of 'balancing' different priorities. He called the partial federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, a 'disgrace.' 'You can't be an absolutist . . . life is much more complex than that,' he said. … Asked about the timing of an announcement about 2020, Bloomberg said: 'Well, I said I'd take a look at it in January, February. We're still in January.'\n\n-- Love a candidate but don't think she can win? You've been infected with Pundititis, by Ben Terris: Pundititis [is] a virus affecting the nervous system of Democratic voters that was born out of the 2016 elections. Those infected find themselves unable to fall in love with candidates, instead worrying about what theoretical swing voters may feel. Signs of Pundititis include excessive electoral mapmaking, poll testiness, and an anxious, queasy feeling that comes with picking winners and losers known as 'Cillizzasea.' If you experience any of these symptoms for three hours or more, please stop consulting your television. Although Pundititis afflicts voters, it can be deadly to politicians. And there is, perhaps, no potential presidential candidate more susceptible to its effects than [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThe commandant of the Coast Guard lambasted the ongoing shutdown and its impact on service members:\n\nA House Democrat expressed dismay over government employees working without pay:\n\nBut he then had to issue this mea culpa:\n\nA conservative commentator answered a Republican senator's rhetorical question about the shutdown:\n\nThe vice president expressed support for anti-government demonstrations in Venezuela:\n\nThe secretary of state virtually joined the World Economic Forum, per a CBS News reporter:\n\nA Post reporter panned the Brazilian president's performance at the forum:\n\nHarris's communications director tweeted a video of the candidate dancing to Cardi B:\n\nA Democratic senator and Iraq War veteran reacted to the Supreme Court's decision on transgender troops:\n\nFrom the Democratic mayor of South Bend,, Ind., an openly gay veteran and new 2020 candidate:\n\nThe Post's Fact Checker defended White House press briefings:\n\nChelsea Clinton announced she is expecting a third child:\n\nAnd some saw a possible metaphor in this road hazard near the White House:\n\nGOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:\n\n-- Yahoo News, Operation Cobra: The untold story of how a CIA officer trained a network of agents who found the Soviet missiles in Cuba, by Sean D. Naylor: A 10-year veteran of the CIA, [Tom] Hewitt had spent the previous six months teaching the principal agent everything he knew about how to run an effective espionage network, doing all he could to mitigate the substantial risks that the agent would have to take in Fidel Castro's Cuba. The team's mission was to establish a network that could be used to gather intelligence and, if necessary, to foment counterrevolution against the Castro regime. Getting rid of Castro was a high priority for the administration of President John F. Kennedy and for the CIA. Hewitt knew this was an important mission, but he could not have imagined that his team would soon play a vital role in preventing nuclear Armageddon.\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT: Passenger Confronts GOP Congressman Over Flying First Class During Shutdown, from HuffPost: [A] Republican lawmaker had an uncomfortable run-in Tuesday when a fellow airplane passenger found him flying first class from Chicago to Washington, D.C., according to a video of the encounter shared with HuffPost. 'Congressman, do you think it's appropriate to fly first class while 57 TSA agents aren't being paid?' the person says to Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), in an apparent reference to [TSA's] 57,000 employees, who are being required to work without pay. … Davis remained silent, prompting the person to say, 'Taking that as a yes.' HOT ON THE RIGHT: GOP strategist blasts Stephen Miller, says 'Maybe someday he'll have a relationship with a live human woman,' from Fox News: Rick Wilson, the strategist, was on MSNBC's 'All in with Chris Hayes' and was discussing Miller's behind-the-scenes influence over [Trump's] immigration policies. There's something deeply wrong with Stephen Miller… and maybe someday, he'll have a relationship with a live human woman,' Wilson said, in response to Hayes criticism that Miller's hard-line views on immigration are what's driving the ongoing government shutdown. 'I don't know if that has anything to do with it,' Hayes' responded, according to a video obtained by MEDIAite.\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\nTrump will host a briefing call on his immigration proposal with state and local leaders and later participate in a roundtable on health-care pricing.

Faiz Siddiqui reports: The 11-to-2 vote to override the veto — Bowser's second in office — means the legislation now heads to Congress for final review. … Bowser expressed concern about the impact the legislation could have on Metro's bottom line, arguing it could exacerbate the agency's revenue problems and create potential safety issues. … But the council overruled the mayor's objections and rejected her argument that lessening the penalties for fare-jumping would encourage potential lawlessness and make Metro less safe.\n\n-- Federal judges chose a Virginia House of Delegates redistricting map considered highly favorable to Democrats.

No current Democrats would see their voter majority change to Republican, based on those election results.

I'm now in my mid-30s. My ex-girlfriend and I had talked about possibly adopting a child, but unfortunately that relationship broke up.\n\nHowever, I still want to adopt. The only problem is, I don't know if I should try to adopt now — or wait.\n\nI have a job, but that job pays me only when I am needed (which is rare). I have my own home and own my own vehicle, etc.\n\nAD\n\nI don't know how to bring this up to my family. I wonder what their reactions will be. I'm sort of afraid to say anything to them about it.\n\nAD\n\nMy dad was adopted, and I saw the problems he faced, and I just don't know what to do.\n\nProspective Dad\n\nProspective Dad: You seem to have put a lot of thought into this, but you don't seem to have done any research about adoption (other than writing to me). Becoming a parent (especially a single parent) is a heavy lift. It is emotionally, physically and financially taxing. It is also the greatest and most important thing you will ever do.\n\nI applaud the fact that parenthood is calling to you and hope you will answer the call.\n\nAD\n\nStart right now — by researching your options. Your local office of family and children's services would be a good first stop. Make an appointment to talk to a social worker. Ask any and all questions and take careful notes.\n\nYou might be a good candidate for fostering a child. Becoming a foster parent would give you the opportunity to see if full-time parenting is something you can tackle. You will be interviewed and educated about what is required, and you would be supported through your efforts.\n\nAD\n\nMany prospective parents enter the parenting journey through the foster-to-adopt program. This effort requires both fearlessness and faith.\n\nI hope you will also consider becoming a Big Brother. The Big Brothers Big Sisters of America program (bbbs.org) is a wonderful way for adults to connect with kids who are looking for a positive adult role model in their lives. Do you have what it takes to be a big? Check the organization's website.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: After 13 years of marriage, I recently learned through a good friend that my husband, Charlie, dated my daughter's longtime travel soccer coach for three years, before he and I got married.\n\nI was told the relationship was so serious that they had discussed marriage!\n\nI couldn't understand why my husband would keep that information from me all this time.\n\nAD\n\nCharlie confirmed that this was true but said he didn't feel it was necessary to tell me.\n\nI feel I have been lied to and have lost all trust in him.\n\nShould I be upset?\n\nUpset?\n\nUpset?: If you are upset and questioning or wanting permission to feel your own honest emotions, then you have some work to do,\n\nAD\n\nYou have the right to your feelings. If I were you, I would be bewildered and upset.\n\nI'm going to assume that your daughter might be older — and that you are not encountering this coach regularly, and so there is no personal overlap between the three of you. This might account for how this news took so long to get to you.\n\nA three-year serious relationship is a major life-event not to disclose, but I don't think it is necessarily a total trust-breaker.\n\nYou should ask your husband what other minor details he neglected to share with you, pre-marriage. Does he have children you don't know about? Was he in the military, the seminary, a boy band?\n\nAD\n\nStay calm. It's time to talk.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: If the man who signed his letter Love Story truly wants to leave his wife for his lost love, but wants to leave gracefully, why doesn't he let his wife and children stay in their home?\n\nHe should accept his responsibility for his children's well being and leave the house to his wife and kids, if he must move on to chase happiness.\n\nDisheartened\n\nDisheartened: I agree. This man's Love Story spelled heartbreak for others.
Next, two prominent officials in the Arizona GOP, Reps. Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, became ringleaders of a plot to overturn the election results. They have been identified as architects of last week's protest that turned into a deadly invasion of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what is the Arizona Republican Party doing to recover? Why, it's attacking John McCain's widow.\n\nThe party just rolled out a censure resolution against Cindy McCain. Childish and bizarre, it attacks the wife of Arizona's beloved late (Republican) senator for having a past riddled with drug abuse. (She admitted three decades ago to a previous pain-medication addiction.)\n\nIt admonishes her for supporting leftist causes such as gay marriage. It scolds her for endorsing Biden, in direct opposition to … the Constitution. It upbraids her for objecting to Trump's criticism of her husband — and then it repeats such slander, saying the late senator, a war hero and POW, committed serious wrongdoing during his military service.\n\nAD\n\nThe text then says Republicans will officially censure her at their Jan. 23, 2020 Mandatory Meeting. (I'm still writing 2020 on my censure resolutions, too.)\n\nAD\n\nThe state party is apparently one-upping the Maricopa County GOP, which on Saturday censured Jeff Flake (Arizona's last elected Republican senator, who retired after denouncing Trump) but was prevented by parliamentary reasons from adding Cindy McCain to the resolution.\n\nThis follows the state party's Jan. 1 tweet announcing that we're never going back to the party of [Mitt] Romney, Flake and McCain. Thus, in one clause, did the Arizona GOP disavow both the last two Republican presidential nominees before Trump and the state's last two elected Republican senators.\n\nAD\n\nWhat next? A resolution denouncing Barry Goldwater as a socialist? Labeling Sandra Day O'Connor as antifa?\n\nThe self-destructive madness can be traced to the 2019 election of Kelli Ward (R-Wackadoodle) as state GOP chairwoman. Under the leadership of Ward — a two-time loser of Republican Senate primaries, one against McCain — the party embraced election conspiracy theories: It called for the state legislature to DE-CERTIFY the false results, and when the state's Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, an erstwhile Trump ally, defended the count, Ward tweeted that Ducey should #sthu — shut the hell up.\n\nAD\n\nCindy McCain reacted mildly to the party's attack, saying she's a proud lifelong Republican who supports candidates who put country over party.\n\nAD\n\nTV personality Meghan McCain was less tolerant of the latest attack on her parents. This is THE REAL problem facing the Arizona GOP, my mom! she tweeted. A few days after a domestic terror attack led by maniac Trump supporters.\n\nThere had been a strain of McCain antipathy within the Arizona party well before Trump, who served in the First Bone Spurs Division during Vietnam and attacked McCain's heroism for years, even posthumously. Meanwhile, a younger, multiracial electorate has been gradually turning against Republicans in the state, as in Texas, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nBut ruin accelerated with the takeover of the party by pro-Trump extremists. (Ward famously suggested in 2018 that the McCain family disclosed his imminent death because the narrative would be negative to me.) Republican operatives in 2019 were so concerned about Ward's competence — justifiably so, given the 2020 results — that they tried to circumvent the state party.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump is now spending his final days in office fomenting insurrection and giving medals to sports figures. But the Arizona GOP debacle, and the obsession with demonizing a revered, deceased leader, show the lasting damage Trump has done to the party. In place of McCain, the faces of the state party are now Gosar and Biggs, who along with Alabama's Rep. Mo Brooks allegedly organized last week's protest-turned-riot.\n\nI was the person who came up with the Jan. 6 idea with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Mo Brooks and then Congressman Andy Biggs, said Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander in a pre-event video. We four schemed up of putting max pressure on Congress while they were voting so that … we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud roar from outside.\n\nInstead, they sacked the Capitol, and five died — the latest and surest sign that the party ennobled by John McCain's patriotism has become the refuge of scoundrels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSign up to receive my columns in your inbox as soon as they're published.\n\nThe U.S. is more politically polarized than ever.

But wait. This is where Peter Weber's season departs from the routine. One of them, he never makes it past the front door of her family's home. And he yet still keeps her around.\n\nFirst up is Hannah Ann, 23, a model from Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nAD\n\nThere's a particularly ugly convention in romantic comedies that finds the male protagonist fighting for a woman's affection by listing all the things he loves about her. Inevitably, as words spill out of his mouth, he starts enumerating behaviors that clearly irritate him, activities that are usually gendered in one way or another: He loves that she always takes exactly 53 minutes to pick out her entree, no matter how many times she's been to the restaurant. He loves that she always wears three sweaters to the office, even though her male colleagues seem just fine with the temperature. He loves that they're always late to meet his friends because she takes so long to get ready.\n\nAD\n\nNear the start of this episode, Peter does just that for Hannah Ann, though he organizes his thoughts on paper, an entreaty of affection on what appears to be a lined yellow legal pad, which is, as everyone knows, the most romantic kind of stationery. High on the list: He loves that she has a name for every dress [she's] ever worn. Does he, though?\n\nHannah Ann, to her credit, doesn't share our skepticism with the gesture. To the contrary, she so admires the trope that she had composed a similar document for him in an earlier episode. As she tells her sister, When he gave it to me I was like —. Here, her mouth hangs open. As the literary theorist Roland Barthes might put it, the pleasure of the text is clearest when it falls silent. Or when we do. Or something.\n\nAD\n\nHer father, meanwhile, is concerned with a different list — the many other women still in the running. There is other young ladies involved, he tells Peter, skepticism apparently overwhelming his capacity for ordinary grammatical speech. Attempting to reassure this nonplussed patriarch, Peter suggests that he plans to tell Hannah Ann this very night that he is falling in love with her. I wasn't expecting that, the concerned parent replies. I'd rather you not say that to her unless you mean it.\n\nAD\n\nI hear your concerns and I'll take those to heart, our protagonist responds. Soon after, he proves that he has done just that by telling Hannah Ann that he is falling for her. And she, with composure that would surely please her father, tells him in kind, And I'm in love with you.\n\nIt's all I wanted, is that validation, Peter says to the camera. In this regard, too, he is exactly like the hero of a romantic comedy.\n\nKelsey, 28, a professional clothier from Des Moines\n\nAD\n\nViewer, those are not wine grapes. Those are table grapes being stomped, crushed and danced on beneath Kelsey and Peter's feet. Iowa is not exactly known for its viticulture — and yet Kelsey takes Peter to a winery for their hometown date. Perhaps this is a chance for Kelsey to make up for her champagne crisis earlier this season, and there are moments of class. Their toes in a tub of grapes, Peter dips Kelsey as if they're gliding on a dance floor, not ankle-deep in fruit. Later, they create their own bottle of wine, which we hope is drawn from grapes untouched by toenail fungus.\n\nAD\n\nYour recappers checked in with some Des Moines residents, who confirm that many establishments in the Hawkeye state only serve Iowa wine, and it's brutal. Viewers on Twitter also were unconvinced.\n\nPeter runs with the wine analogies, describing his relationship with Kelsey as very bold with a hint of spice. It's that perfect blend that keeps you wanting to come back, he tells the camera. Which might be believable if they were in California, Oregon, even Virginia. But in Iowa, the analogies are the ultimate tell: Peter won't be subscribing to this wine club.\n\nAD\n\nPeter meets Kelsey's mother, stepdad and two sisters. He doesn't ask for Kelsey's hand in marriage. Her mother can tell Peter is at ease around Kelsey, but she's concerned, telling Peter: Don't break my girl's heart, do you understand?\n\nAD\n\nAlas, by the end of the episode that's what happens. Back in an airplane hangar in Los Angeles, Peter tells Kelsey he couldn't get to the I love you stage. She goes home.\n\nMadison, 23, a foster parent recruiter in Auburn, Ala.\n\nWhen we first met Madison back in the first episode, her father played almost as large a role in her intro video as she did. It should be no surprise that he casts an equally large shadow over her hometown visit.\n\nAD\n\nBefore he arrives, things go well: Madison takes her gentleman caller to an Auburn college basketball court where they are greeted by a prerecorded clip from alumnus Charles Barkley. The school's coach then leads them in drills where Peter struggles to dribble two balls simultaneously. And though Peter is terrible at this task, that shouldn't surprise us: He was just as bad at axe-throwing earlier in the episode. After the coach leaves, the couple makes out on the floor of the abandoned court like the last lovers after the rapture.\n\nAD\n\nBut the rapture will not come for them yet. No, first Peter must be judged, and judged he will be by her father, an elfin-featured man named Chad who kicks off Peter's visit by leading the whole family in a prayer. Madison, as her mother puts it, has made some very specific faith decisions. To put that in plainer language, she is saving herself for marriage, the ostensible endpoint of The Bachelor, though certainly not the only destination on Pilot Pete's flight plan.\n\nWell, obviously this is all happening really fast for dad, says dad when he learns that Peter has told Madison that he is falling in love with her. She's so pure, he adds, which is a totally normal thing for a dad to say about his adult daughter, probably. I just don't want you to break her heart.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike the more enthusiastic Hannah Ann, Madison seems to take her pater familias' concerns to heart, coming away from the evening unsure how to proceed. I really think I was hoping to be there. To tell Peter that I was in love with him, she says. Alas, she is not sure whether our spirits and our souls, apparently two different forms of disembodied personhood, are compatible.\n\nAD\n\nVictoria F., 26, a medical sales representative from Virginia Beach, Va.\n\nIf you hate-watch this show as much as we do, you know that there is a moment in every season of this garbage show that can break a person. That moment arrived on Peter and Victoria's date. Pete is the worst. Victoria is the worst. This season is the worst! This show is the worst. We are all the worst, for watching and enjoying it.\n\nAD\n\nPeter meets Victoria in her hometown of Virginia Beach, Va. Her black lab, Buxton, is with her, and when she jumps up on him and wraps his legs around him to make out — a move that we've deemed the koala — her dog runs away, into the ocean, without her even noticing. We are all Buxton, forever trying to escape the drama, running headlong into the tide.\n\nAnyway, they go to one of those touristy old-timey photo booths, where you put on petticoats and top hats and try not to think too hard about how long it's been since the photo place washed the costumes. They pose for a photo. Buxton is the only one who seems happy. They have ice cream and walk into a producer-arranged impromptu concert from Hunter Hayes, another country singer who, thankfully, Victoria has not dated. Somewhere, Chase Rice lets out a deep, wearied sigh.\n\nAD\n\nBut there's another dangerous ex lurking. A woman in a jean jacket approaches Peter at the concert with information about Victoria. She used to date our protagonist. Though her face is blurred out, she already came forward to US Weekly. Her name is Merissa Pence. The magazine doesn't manage to extract many more details about Victoria's crimes from her than the vague accusation Pence lobs in person, telling him: I don't think you deserve what you're on a date with right now. Victoria has allegedly broken up relationships. In US Weekly, Pence says that Victoria threatened to slash her tires.\n\nAD\n\nYears later, Peter will tell his therapist that country music, especially when performed live, is a major trigger for his anxiety.\n\nHours later, Peter arrives at Victoria's family's home with flowers, but she can sense that something is wrong.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he tells her about Merissa, she gets hostile.\n\nVictoria, do you think I enjoy this right now? Do you think there's any way I couldn't address this? She turns it back on him. You're supposed to meet MY family tonight and you decided that what Merissa told you is more important than meeting my family? she said. I'm so done with this right now, I can't do this. The last part was addressed to the producers — nothing better than when a contestant breaks the fourth wall! — and she walks away.\n\nPeter leaves without meeting her family, a Bachelor first.\n\nThey meet again at his Virginia Beach hotel, when she comes to apologize.\n\nFor some reason I can't walk away from you, she says.But you kind of do, he says. She ends it by telling him that she's falling in love with him, and giving him the old-timey photo.\n\nWhen everyone is together again in an airplane hangar for the rose ceremony, Peter gives his last rose to Victoria, despite the fact that they've spent approximately 35 percent of their short relationship fighting.\n\nShe is going to the fantasy suites, and we are going to keep hate-watching this show.
Enjoy today's Best of column from 2010.\n\nI'll be back with fresh Q and A next week.\n\nDear Amy: Recently, I virtually reconnected with a woman I knew more than 25 years ago.\n\nA few months ago, I was in her hometown and she came to my hotel. We had a few drinks and spent the night together. Recently, I was at a convention she also attended, and we spent the week together. We virtually skipped the convention and just enjoyed each other's company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore recently, I was back in her town and we spent a few days together.\n\nWe talk about everything, share everything and have started talking about a new life together. This would entail us both leaving our spouses.\n\nWe talk every day, and know the pain this may cause, but we truly are in love and want to be with each other.\n\nWe both have high school-age children.\n\nDo I just tell my wife I am leaving her? Should I wait for a job in the new city first?\n\nI am conflicted about the how/when/where.\n\n— No Tiger\n\nNo Tiger: I've managed to stay sentimental enough about marriage that I would urge you to try to stay with — rather than flee from — your family.\n\nAll I can say is that there is no easy way to dump your family, certainly if in the course of leaving them you intend to also leave town.\n\nAD\n\nWhen faced with such a monumental life choice, it is helpful to sit down with a counselor to discuss your intentions. Try this first.\n\nAD\n\nJanuary 2010\n\nDear Amy: A long time ago, I broke off my engagement and shortly afterward married another man. We were married for more than 30 years when he died of cancer.\n\nDo you feel it would be inappropriate for me to try to contact my former fiance after 40 years? After I broke our engagement, we had no further contact.\n\nI am curious as to where life has taken him. I would like to drop him a note and offer to meet him for coffee and conversation to catch up.\n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\n— Curious\n\nCurious: My opinion is that you are lonely for companionship, and so you want to test the waters by returning to a familiar lost love.\n\nAD\n\nThis is a completely understandable impulse. I've had it myself, which is why after my long-ago divorce I dated everyone I ever knew in college.\n\nYour motives might not be completely clear to you — or your motive might be mixed — but you should be prepared for the fact that he has changed, that you have changed, and that, if he is married or in a committed relationship, he might see this contact as an unwelcome intrusion.\n\nAD\n\nYou should familiarize yourself with Facebook. Post an online profile, and then use it to get in touch with all sorts of people. The way all of our personal webs intersect, I bet it wouldn't be two weeks before he was aware of how to contact you.\n\nAD\n\nFebruary 2010\n\nDear Amy: I've had a friend from work for 25 years. We solved problems together, griped about conditions, lunched and played tennis. We retired and have remained friends, albeit with less get-together time.\n\nWell, suddenly my friend says he has to meet with a group every morning, including weekends. He is mysterious about the group, saying that he is not permitted to talk about what they do.\n\nThough I know his wife, I feel I can't ask her about this because I'm embarrassed.\n\nNow I am not permitted to talk with him during the day. No more lunches. I should let it go, but I feel as if a friendship that I valued is devalued. Do you have any idea what sort of group could have such requirements as abandoning longtime friends?\n\n— Puzzled Pal\n\nPuzzled Pal: Your friend might be attending AA meetings, religious meetings, getting dialysis treatments or playing poker. He also might want to exit the friendship, but not know how to tell you.\n\nIf you are truly worried about him, yes — you could reach out to his wife with an expression of concern.\n\nMarch 2010
Nicole Kidman in HBO's Big Little Lies. (Hilary Bronwyn Gayle/HBO)\n\nNicole Kidman. The name conjures many images and associations: the tumble of red curls and pert, blue-eyed face of the star as a young newcomer to the screen; the marriage to Tom Cruise and ensuing escape from Scientology; the lithe physique and dewy features that she wears easily to this day. But one phrase we often forget to attach to her is great actress.\n\nPerhaps because of her demeanor of self-effacing, even demure, modesty, it's been easy to underestimate Kidman over the course of a career that now spans three decades. But this week has offered a reminder of why we should prize an actress who has fashioned one of the most fascinating careers in a business notorious for pigeonholing its starlets early, keeping them boxed in and discarding them when their physical attributes show signs of sagging, bagging or otherwise naturally evolving.\n\nKidman has largely escaped that trap, as anyone who watched the recent HBO series Big Little Lies can attest. The stylish, compulsively engrossing thriller-slash-domestic-melodrama turned out to be a sleeper peak TV hit largely on the strength of its ensemble cast, which included Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz, Shailene Woodley and Kidman, who played the abused wife of a prosperous executive. Kidman — who co-produced with Witherspoon — was a standout in the series, her portrayal of a woman fighting for her own physical and psychic survival radiating shame, ambivalence, glazed confusion, determination and barely perceptible ripples of latent power. Never showy or gratuitous, it was a performance as delicate and fine-grained as the porcelain that her doll-like character, Celeste, sometimes seemed to be made of.\n\nNo sooner had Kidman delivered a powerhouse with Big Little Lies than she whipsawed her audience into another direction entirely: In Queen of the Desert, out Friday, she portrays the storied explorer, writer and photographer Gertrude Bell, a contemporary of T.E. Lawrence who traveled the Arabian Peninsula in the early 20th century and helped redraw the region's national boundaries after World War I. Written and directed by Werner Herzog with an uncharacteristically blunt and stodgily sentimental hand, Queen of the Desert isn't a great film. In fact, it's often a very bad one, its strenuous efforts to be the female version of Lawrence of Arabia notwithstanding. But none of its faults lie with Kidman, who dominates the screen in nearly every shot with regal composure and restraint (and, apparently, a generous supply of SPF-50 sunscreen).\n\n\n\nNicole Kidman as Gertrude Bell and Damian Lewis as Charles Doughty-Wylie in Queen of the Desert. (Lena Herzog/IFC Films)\n\nKidman in Lion. (Weinstein Co.)\n\nThis is a familiar dynamic in Kidman's filmography: She's made some famous duds, most recently the overbaked historical pseudo-epic Australia, the deliciously campy The Paperboy and the ill-advised Grace Kelly biopic Grace of Monaco.\n\nBut even in her worst movies, Kidman is never the problem; her performances rise above whatever dreck they're in, as if her supreme self-possession as a performer inoculated her against the toxic material she was working with. And the bad movies are relatively thin on the ground compared with the myriad triumphs: She won an Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours (we're still arguing about that nose), but that was a full seven years after her astonishing portrayal of a fame-hungry TV journalist in To Die For, in which she permanently shut up the doubters in a triumphantly crafty, satirical turn.\n\nOne need only consider Kidman's vanity-free supporting appearance in last year's Lion, alight quickly on Moulin Rouge! and The Others and go all the way back to her breakout roles in Dead Calm and Days of Thunder to appreciate the rigor and expressive range of an actress who can easily hold her own with the Meryl Streeps, Viola Davises and Cate Blanchetts of the world but is rarely mentioned in their company.\n\nRigor, range and — most crucially — curiosity: Just as admirable as the performances have been Kidman's choices when it comes to material and the filmmakers she wants to work with.\n\nEver since becoming a star, she's made small, artistically risky films that may not have had an upside where finances or fame or fan service were concerned but pushed the medium in exhilarating and sometimes strange, even alienating ways. For every conventional Hollywood production such as Cold Mountain or The Interpreter, she's made a chilly, Brechtian experiment in actorly submission, such as Lars von Trier's Dogville, or supported a still-emerging filmmaker, as in Jonathan Glazer's superb spiritual thriller Birth.\n\nNot many people saw Kidman's mesmerizing portrayal of the photographer Diane Arbus in the boundary-breaking film Fur, or her turn as a grieving mother in Rabbit Hole, or as the traumatized grown-up daughter of self-involved artists in The Family Fang. But she has become one of the industry's most valuable and adventurous side players, a headliner who — Q Scores and likability be damned — leverages her gifts and box-office pull in service to pushing the art form forward. It should surprise no one that her upcoming projects include the edgy, feminist TV mystery series Top of the Lake and films with Sofia Coppola and the Greek provocateur Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster).\n\n\n\nNicole Kidman in Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus. (Abbot Genser/Picturehouse via WireImage)\n\nKidman as Virginia Woolf in The Hours. (Clive Coote/AP)\n\nLast year, writing about actress Isabelle Huppert in the New Republic, the critic Miriam Bale noted that in the movie Elle, Huppert herself became an auteur, her craft and potent persona transcending the material and taking a hand in creating the movie that was every bit as crucial as the director's. The same, writ even larger, could be said for Kidman, whose shrewd auteurist eye is revealed not just in one movie but through the arc of her career. In an industry dedicated to escapism, shallow reassurance and dumbing down, she has single-mindedly pursued thoughtfulness, intelligence and risk, as an actor and a producer. (Check out the flawed, weird but wonderfully woman-centric erotic thriller In the Cut for an early example of the latter.)\n\nIt's nothing new for actresses to search out envelopes to push, edges to explore or boundaries to transgress in the name of publicity, stretching or simply staying relevant. In Kidman's case, her finest performance may be a cumulative one, far outstripping the workaday job of taking a character from the page to the stage. Her genius is just as strategic as it is technical, in how she's consistently leveraged stardom on behalf of growth, taste and sophistication. With her preternatural technical and physical gifts, she easily could have been sleepwalking through the past 30 years. Instead, she's chosen to keep her eyes wide open.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Queen of the Desert will be showing on Netflix starting Friday. It is out in theaters Friday and will be available via on-demand services April 14.
I want to be respectful of how people choose to refer to themselves, but the grammarian in me cannot tolerate using they'' or them'' to refer to a single person. Thus, I find myself sticking to the person's name only, as in How long will Jordan be in Wisconsin?'' Does Miss Manners, in her sagacity, have any suggestions for a better gender-fluid pronoun?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou are kind to believe that Miss Manners can solve this problem, but this is a rare case in which she would like to appeal to her Gentle Readers for help.\n\nYou have stated the ground rules:\n\nBe respectful of others. In this case, it means not using masculine or feminine pronouns for those who object.\n\nDo not refer to a person as it.''\n\nResist using plural pronouns when referring to a single person.\n\nSo far, the solution has been to go around the problem: Make the subject plural, when possible, to use they'' correctly, or use he or she'' with single nouns. But this is getting tedious and doesn't cover everybody. What we need is something simple that can be easily learned, so that no one is confused or insulted.\n\nAD\n\nSo would someone please come up with a solution?\n\nDear Miss Manners: What is the appropriate way to address a couple who are technically engaged but have no plans to marry?\n\nAD\n\nFor example, one couple I know has been engaged for many years (including a ring), but have subsequently moved on with all significant milestones outside of marriage — home, children, major life changes, etc. No mention of marriage arrangements have come up since the initial engagement. So is it still appropriate to refer to them as one another's fiance(e)''?\n\nOr does using the term fiance(e)'' run the risk of sounding insulting, since it seems to highlight an unmet promise?\n\nWhat did they promise you? A weekend of lavish festivities?\n\nAD\n\nIt seems to Miss Manners that such a couple alone can define the relationship. If they are affianced, they must mean something slightly different from the term now available to committed but unmarried couples, who call themselves partners. Meanwhile, the rest of us should look for our champagne elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nDear Miss Manners: Do salad and dinner forks go on top of the napkin, or between the plate and napkin on the table itself?\n\nThe latter. As the first thing to do when sitting at table is to put the napkin on one's lap, Miss Manners would not run the risk of someone's not noticing the flatware and sending it crashing to the floor.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Friday's incident near the Lincoln Memorial in which a group of high school boys confronted an elderly Native American man sent a ripple of fear and anger across the country. The image of a group of high school boys clad in Make America Great Again hats, smirking and laughing resurfaced tensions that have been simmering since President Trump's campaign began. At one point, some reportedly chanted, Build the wall! though such chants are not audible on widely circulated video.\n\nWhile the general assumption is that younger Americans are more liberal, and therefore less likely to support Trump, we noted earlier this year that young white men are the only members of the millennial generation — generally but informally defined as those born between 1980 and 2000 — who lean more Republican than Democrat. Millennial men and millennial women tend to identify as Democrats more heavily, as do millennial whites and nonwhites.\n\nBut among white millennial men, the picture is different.\n\nThese kids on the Mall, though, aren't millennials. They're members of a younger generation that doesn't have a broadly accepted name. The previous administration dubbed them the Homeland Generation, but a recent survey from Pew Research Center labeled them Generation Z — presumably following Generation X and Generation Y, an early name for millennials. (The groups are defined here.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore importantly, Pew also dug into the political views of that group, born in 1996 or later by Pew's definition. The group mostly mirrors the generally liberal social politics of the millennials. In data provided to The Washington Post, though, we see this holds true even among the white men in the generation.\n\nConsider the question of whether respondents think racial and ethnic diversity is good, bad or makes no difference. Nearly 6 in 10 white males who are in Generation Z hold the view that racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing, vs. fewer than 4 in 10 white males born before 1946 (the Silent Generation, per Pew's labels). The drop-off is similar across Gen Z groups, but only among white men are the oldest members more likely to say diversity makes little difference than that it's a good thing.\n\n(There aren't enough nonwhites in the Silent Generation to be statistically significant, which is itself telling.)\n\nOr another question related to race: Which group is treated less fairly, blacks or whites? Gen Z white males are far more likely to say black Americans are treated less fairly, even compared to Generation X, those born from 1965 to 1980 under Pew's definition.\n\nWhite males in Gen Z and who are millennials are more likely to say government should do more to solve problems. The change over time here is stark, with responses among white men inverting neatly as the respondent gets older.\n\nPew's research on the generation established a lot of comfort among members of the generation on LGBTQ issues. The oldest whites who spoke to Pew saw same-sex marriage as a bad thing; the youngest, including young white males, disagreed.\n\nMind you, on these four subjects, white males generally offered more conservative views than their peers. But compared particularly to older white men, their views on diversity and racial bias were starkly different.\n\nIt's clear from Friday's incident on the Mall that the young men who confronted the Native American protester had somehow internalized that their behavior was acceptable. It's hard to read from that one scenario how they look at issues of race more broadly. But if part of the incident on the Mall reflected opposition to diversity, those views would be in the minority.
I want to adopt so badly, Tebow said to People. I can't wait. It's definitely something I see in my future.\n\nYou know what I think would be awesome? If I could adopt a kid from every continent. I think that would be a pretty cool goal, he said. I want to sit around the dinner table every night and see kids from Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, right here in the States. How cool would that be? It's one of my favorite things to dream about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTechnically, Tebow omitted Antarctica, which is understandable, and Australia, which is a bit more odd, given that he has a close connection to the relatively nearby Philippines. Also, some scientists are pushing for the recognition of an eighth continent, Zealandia, so Tebow might need to further expand his brood.\n\nWhile the 29-year-old former Heisman winner is single, he is looking for a woman to share his life, one who checks off a few boxes. Of course I want a woman who I'm attracted to, he said. That's a very big part of it. But I'm looking for someone who loves Jesus and loves people. Someone who makes me want to be a better person for her.\n\nAnd she has to want kids, and has to want to adopt. That's a requirement.\n\nAD\n\nTebow's faith has led him to proclaim an intention to abstain from sex before marriage, which reportedly was a factor in a 2015 breakup between him and a former Miss Universe, Olivia Culpo. It wasn't clear from his comments to People if Tebow plans on having kids of his own, but he clearly wants a diverse family.
