{"sentence": "both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. certain economic systems allow families to thrive. thriving families make market economies possible. you can't separate the two. it used to be possible to deny this. not anymore. the evidence is now overwhelming. consider the inner cities. thirty years ago, conservatives looked at detroit or newark and were horrified by what they saw. conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. the majority of children were born out of wedlock. single mothers were the rule. crime and drugs and disorder became universal. what caused this nightmare? liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. they were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.", "label": 0}

{"sentence": "two different worlds. similar outcomes. how did this happen? you'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. mostly they're not. they don't have to be. it's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born americans who are slipping behind. but republicans now represent rural voters. they ought to be interested. here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. all that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. in many places, women suddenly made more than men. before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. maybe they should want to, but they don't. over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. this isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. it's social science. we know it's true. rich people know it best of all. that's why they get married before they have kids. that model works. increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in america can afford.", "label": 0}

{"sentence": "when you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. our leaders don't even try. they hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. there's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. under our current system, an american who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. we tax capital at half of what we tax labor. it's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. in 2010, for example, mitt romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. he paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. for normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. no wonder romney supports the status quo. but for everyone else, it's infuriating. our leaders rarely mention any of this. they tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. please. it's based on laws that congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. it worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else. unfairness is profoundly divisive. when you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. they hate each other. that happens in countries too. it's happening in ours, probably by design. divided countries are easier to rule.", "label": 0}

{"sentence": "there's going to be an african component to that and we need to be mindful of that. two, and this has been something that i've learned in my career, africa's problems and opportunities don't stop at the water's edge. what happens in africa changes the way the world works. african migration crisis changed european politics. the ebola crisis changes the way we think about global health security. you may remember the piracy off the coast of the horn of africa, it changed actually how maritime commerce worked in the shipping industry.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so i think that it's really important to be mindful of these events in these different countries because they do change the way people and systems work. and then finally, our allies and adversaries understand those first two points really well and i think they understand it probably better than we do.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "we are seeing this dramatic increase in engagement by allies and adversaries. between 2010 and 2015, 150 foreign embassies were built in sub saharan africa. trade is up for most countries, 65 countries have increased their trade. and military bases all across africa. indian ocean, the horn of africa and western saharan, i'm sorry, western africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so i think that we have to recognize that if we are not there to shape what is happening on the continent, to referee, to make sure that we are not blocked out by opportunities, it is going to affect our national interests.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so talk a little bit about kind of the state of africa today. you know, what's going on there? what are the challenges these countries face? and what are some of the positive things that are happening?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "chinua achebe, the author of things fall apart, said when talking about nigeria, the problem with nigeria is leadership. and i think for many of these countries, leadership and governance and sort of the economic problems that flow from that are still probably the biggest challenges these countries face. there is instability.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "it's true. it's true of a lot of countries.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "it's true of a lot of the countries, right? but you know, instability in the sahel, challenges in eastern congo with ebola, we have been talking for so many years about urbanization and greater connectivity and youth bulge and climate change. and i would argue right now, those things are really coming together.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "governance has been hard in africa, but it's become really complex. and i think some governments are failing in the way they respond to that. and i think it's making conflicts more protracted, more deadly, and i think it is denying people the ability to live their lives. and these all, as we have said, have all these effects for us.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "but there's some good news stories. and i always like the opportunity to talk about good news because the u.s. media on africa, it's all negative. i mean, it's disproportionately negative. and", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "they're going in a different direction than the rest of the world in some cases. so while there's this global recession in democracy, there are people who have less confidence in it. africans really strongly believe in democracy. 68% of africans support democratic principles.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "in some countries, it's like in the 80s. there's been 28 transfers of power since 2015, peaceful, more than half. that's historic. while the rest of the world has become protectionist and imposing tariffs, africans have created a new continental trade arrangements.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "it's the largest trading block since the w2o was founded. and finally, while the rest of the world or at least the united states are thinking about pulling out, the africans are stepping up and they're working together to deal with trans-national threats. so i think those are really good stories.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and just the last thing that i think maybe your audience hasn't thought about that is really exciting to me is african soft power. africa, africans are changing our global entertainment and cultural trends in ways that i think are unprecedented. our music, our films, our sports, africans are shaping it at the lead.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and i'd love to see african governments take advantage of their soft power and i'd like to think of ways that our government could be more effective in navigating it.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so find this, you know, cutting against the trend on democracy and trade to be fascinating.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "well, let me start with trade first. for the africans, their economies are too fractured, fragmented. no one's going to invest in the small little gambia, which just covers the river within senegal. inter trade within africa has been historically low.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and the africans under the leadership of paul kagame, president of rwanda, realized that if they are going to increase inter-african trade, if they were going to become a better investment destination, they had to remove some of these barriers.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so i think that's what explains the integration, economic integration. on the democracy side, i think it's a number of trend lines that are coming together. first, as i said, still strong support for democracy, but i think there are new ways in which people can organize and mobilize that has changed politics in africa. as it's become more urban, you've been able to communicate with each other in new ways through telephones and mobile phones.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "we're seeing more protests on the streets. we're seeing more people push for change. and so, whether it's the uprising in sudan that ended president al bashir's rule or it is the remarkable changes in ethiopia or just increasingly cyclical transfers of power, i think a number of things are happening that really cut against the grain in both the global trends, as you've talked about, but even the way people think about sub saharan africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "because you can always pull out the autocracy or the democracy that is in recession or is regressing. but if you step back and look at the picture, it's actually very exciting. and what i tell people is, let's not look at this about democracy as up or down, let's look at the forces that have sort of created a status quo around governance are changing. and i expect a lot of volatility.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "we'll come to you and have these really big surprises and we'll have these setbacks. but i think that people, the governed and the governing, are working on the new rules of the game. and so, it's a really interesting time right now.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "are there countries, and i'm thinking of south africa, i'm thinking of nigeria, i'm thinking of kenya, are there countries that kind of lead the continent? or is that not a right way of thinking about it?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "u.s. policy has always thought about sort of anchor states: nigeria, south africa, kenya and ethiopia. they have outsized military forces, they are loud and vocal globally and on the continent. i don't think that is as true as much anymore. nigeria has been dealing with its own internal security problems.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "their president isn't the most dynamic. ethiopia is in the middle of a transition; south africa is way down by economic problems. and so, what i think you've seen is a democratization of leadership in africa. different countries step up at different times.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so there's not one single voice. you can't as you did under the bush administration or under the obama administration say, well, nigeria is going to carry our water in west africa. it just doesn't happen anymore. you've got to, i think, build these coalitions with the senegals and the ghanas in some regions and still rely on south africa and kenya for other things.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "you, judd, you mentioned earlier that other countries are paying attention to what's going on in africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and seeing some of the opportunities that you talked about. so can you talk a little about what third party actors, namely china and russia, are doing on the continent? and if there are others, to, that are interesting, please mention those.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yeah. let me start with china. i think it's really important to say that china poses some threats to the u.s. in what it's doing. but i've been really disappointed with our policy, because we haven't been precise about what we're trying to counter when it comes to china.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "with china. we seem to want to focus on blocking them at every turn in sub saharan africa. and i don't know, it's like mad libs right now. it's we are worried about activity, fill in the blank, in country, fill in the blank, because of china. and i don't even think we have articulated at least publicly what is the end state that we are looking for.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and it's that because of china that is the driver, right?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yeah, it's the because of china. and i think that if we are going to be effective at managing what china is doing in sub saharan africa, we need to be specific about what the threats are. so i would say, first of all, it's chinese investment in critical infrastructure. ports. we just did a paper at csis, 46 ports the chinese are invested in, operating or building in africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "that's a risk because it can limit our mobility, our access to these countries, our ability for our military, our ability for our private sector to get involved.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and the chinese port could eventually become a chinese military base?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "absolutely. that's what we saw in djibouti.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so i worry about ports. i worry about cyber and telecoms. the chinese have built about 70% of africa's 4g, it will be 100% of their 5g. even satellites, africa is starting to launch more and more satellites and the chinese are behind it. so we should focus on that.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "we should focus on the people-to-people investment that china is doing. they're actually focusing on winning hearts and minds. more african students study in china than they do in the united states. china has a program now where they're trying to provide satellite television to 10,000 villages.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "i think that's decadal, the impacts of that. but the thing about china that gets the most oxygen in washington is economics. and here is where i think we need to be a lot more nuanced. china is addressing the needs of africans. this is a region that has the lowest railroad density in the world.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "they need between $130 billion and $170 billion of infrastructure investments per year, according to the african development bank, and china is doing a lot of that stuff. so what we need to do with china in my view is we can't tell africans not to take the money, because our private sector is not providing that.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "china does $200 billion a year and we do $40 billion. but we can help them to make sure the deals are better, that they don't discriminate against the u.s. private sector, that they have the environmental regulations. so that's how i think about china.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yeah, russia is an easier conversation that china, right? i don't need much nuance. there is very few upsides to what russia is doing. essentially, president putin needs permissive environments for his companies to invest in after the sanctions were imposed on his government and he's looking to score points.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "africa is a place where he can work asymmetrically. they don't do much that helps african economies. they sell arms. they're the largest exporter of arms to africa in the world. they are involved in oil and gas industries, in energy. but often, that comes with a side of corruption. what they're really doing is being fairly disruptive to politics.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "if they have an opportunity to side with an autocrat to provide technical expertise to help al bashir stay in power, that's what they'll do. so they are looking to sell themselves as returning to the glory days of the soviet union in africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and i think one of the things that we need to be careful about is not call them a great power. they're not. and i think when we call them a great power in africa, we do putin's bidding. they're a minnow. at least compared to us, the chinese and europe.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so i think that we need to do a better job at isolating and not elevating russia. we need to close some of the loops that make it permissive for their companies to work in this area. and we need to be better about gauging africans to inoculate them from these kinds of intrusions.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yeah, france is still very involved. and in fact, president macron just recently had a summit where he talked about what his government is doing on the sahel. the u.k., the week of this recording, just had its first u.k. africa investment summit. malta, i don't know why i'm sharing this, but malta just came out with their own africa strategy, just to give you a sense of the diversity here.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "the other region that i should spend just a second talking about is the gulf. the gulf is very active in africa and turkey is very active in africa. in some cases, that's not bad, they're doing some of the investments. dp ports is investing in lots of places all over the continent.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "but what they've done that has been really negative is they have exported their political riffs to the region and it's been problematic for somalia and countries that don't want to choose between the uae on one side and qatar on the other side. turkey has also been involved on the commerce commercial side. they are doing some security assistance. as i said, it's a crowded space.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so extremist, jihadist extremism, seems to be to be a growing problem on the continent.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "is that right? and if so, why is it happening and how much of a threat is it to europe, to us?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yeah. we have to remember that al-qaeda's major attack was in africa, right, against our embassies in tanzania, in kenya. but in the last couple decades, i think the problem has become more diverse, more geographically dispersed and more deadly.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "there are al-qaeda and isis affiliates in west and east africa and southern africa. we are seeing unaligned extremist groups like boko haram. the number of attacks that they are doing are increasing and i think the lethality of them are increasing.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "primarily against local targets. so in nigeria, for example, according to a council on foreign relations database, 35,000 have died from boko haram in isis west africa attacks or in conflict between those groups and the nigerian military. in the sahel, there's been a fivefold increase in deaths since 2016, 4,000 people.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so it's primarily african targets. but i just testified in front of the house, and what i said is that it's probably a low probability that they are going to attack the u.s. directly, but i think it has some significant impacts for us. first of all, it endangers our citizens that live in africa and our economic investments. there was an attack by al-shabaab earlier this year, where they hit a kenya military base, where the u.s. trains kenyans and an american service person died and two contractors.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "they tried to attack our base in somalia, as well. and americans have been caught up in the hotel attacks and the mall attacks. there is a group affiliated with isis right near a huge l&g find in mozambique. so it does threaten our interests about the people who live in africa, our facilities and our economic investments.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "it also, as it continues to fester, entangles us in very expensive peace keeping and humanitarian operations. so i think we need to be proactive when we think about that there is the secondary effects. and the last one is the more that extremist deepens and we are seen as less responsive, i think we lose the trust of our partners.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "i mean, macron made a very clear pitch that he felt like the u.s. wasn't there helping. our african partners have said the same. and russia, particularly, has rushed in to kind of find an opportunity here. so it's not a direct threat to the homeland, but a huge amount of sort of impacts downstream.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "what's behind the expansion of extremism on the continent?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yeah, i think partly it's a matter of governance and poor governance. and i think the affiliates, al-qaeda and isis have been sort of shopping for partners. i try to be very careful about talking about isis and aq as if they're drivers because we don't want to lose the local elements. it's just as helpful for the local extremist group to work with al-qaeda and isis as it is vice versa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so in a lot of cases, these groups existed already with local grievances and then they took on the name?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yes, yes, yeah. they take on the name and there is a back and forth between the network and the local group and the network doesn't always get what it wants. but i think that those relationships have improved recruitment, have improved some of the tactical and strategic efforts maybe even to help them, like, ieds and other things.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so i think poor governance, the attraction of networking with these groups and then the most important part is government mistakes. there is a study by undp that looked at sort of extremists in africa and 71% of militants, former militants, said they joined an extremist group because a family member or friend was abused, detained by the security forces.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so many of these african militaries make the wrong moves that push people further into the arms of the extremists. so those are a couple of the things that i would highlight is why we keep seeing this proliferation of these groups.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "you talked earlier about the expansion of democracy. you talked earlier about poor governance, extremism now being a consequence of that poor governance. is there a correlation or causation between a state being more democratic and the quality of its governance in africa?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yeah. oh, sorry, i thought you were going to go in a different direction. i thought you were going to as whether or not correlation between democracy and extremist activity, which there is actually some good evidence. on the democracy and the governance, i don't have the numbers. but my experience says that it depends, right? i mean, if you are a democratic state and you are being responsive to your citizens, then in theory, the governance will improve over time.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "but in some cases, what happens is because the democracy, people are elected through (unintel) networks, that you can actually use corruption to sort of focus on your own personal constituents, as opposed to the betterment of your total population. so you really have to go case by case to talk about, you know, where are all people benefiting versus people who are sort of in the circle of the president and the ruling party?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "so judd, i think this is a good place to switch to u.s. policy and maybe we'll finish up on this. u.s. policy toward the region. how would you characterize it? what's working? what's not? if", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "you could advise the president, what would you tell him?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "yeah. you know, i think that our policy makers on africa are stuck with the challenge of being asked to do less with less. and it's taken them a while to i think figure out how they are going to push policy. and i want to give them some credit because it's taken a little while, but i've been happy with some of the results, but just to kind of go back a little bit.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "like in many other parts of the world, we didn't have policy makers on africa for a long time in washington or in the field. and so, there was this period where it was really this unhappy marriage between obama policies they weren't sure they were going to dismantle and trump policies that hadn't been constructed yet. and so, you've got a lot of contractions. and then you had tweets and other sorts of, you know, travel bans that made things worse.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and then president trump's national security advisor, john bolton, unveils the strategy, and this doesn't go off very well either because it's almost entirely about russia and china. the africans felt like they were not part of the strategy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "but in the last year, i've been pleased with the bureaucracy finding a way. they launched an economic initiative called prosper africa, it's a lot to go still, but it's a good step, right? it's addressing some of the challenges that the u.s. private sectors had in investing in africa. they've kind of found their footing on democracy and governance, which isn't really in any of the strategy documents or speeches.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "but sanctions now on election spoilers in nigeria, on corrupt officials in kenya, on people who are stopping the peace process in south sudan. so those are positive. the big question in year four is: where is the dod going? and you may know there is a proposal in front of secretary of defense esper about withdrawing maybe even completely our troops in africa, about 6,000 people. they already had reduced west african forces about 10%. i think this is a really dangerous policy. i think it's reckless.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and they are there supporting local forces who are fighting extremists?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "local forces, yeah. and it's not just sort of the ct side of the house, they're building capacity for africans to deal with security challenges and they're there at the request of african governments. and we are there in partnership with our european friends.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "and this has caused great anxiety amongst the global community that we may walk away from the continent. we have done this before and it wasn't very good. so you may know, michael, that in the '90s, we dramatically reduced our presence in africa. and then after 9/11 and the growing ct threat, we realized, actually, we need to be back. so reset those relationships.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "rebuild capacity. reinvest in infrastructure. a lack of dod presence is going to not only, you know, make us seem less committed to these challenges, but there are the other effects. our", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "diplomats and our development officers depend on the military to get out to these hard-to-reach places.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "i think our analysts are going to have a harder time understanding dynamics in africa if there is less u.s. presence in these places. so i'm really concerned. i'm elated that the hill has stepped up. senator graham, senator coons, a number of people on the house side have said this is a bad idea. and hopefully, secretary esper will decide not to do this.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "john avlon, cnn contributor: well look the growth of lobbying over the past decade in particular has been a real problem. many people point to it as a cause for not just the increased spending we've seen but things like the lobbying that has watered down the volcker rule. much of it was pursued by jpmorgan chase. so lobbyists do have their thumb on the scale and it's a growing problem in washington. and it's contributed to a lot of the frustration that people feel at home, the sense that washington isn't working. lobbyists are an important reason -- part of the reason why.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "burnett: jay, do you think it's fair to say that the biggest threat to the united states could be from our southern border, whether from drug wars or from other terrorist organizations? you know, i was in laos a year ago and a mexican drug dealer had been with someone i was with doing a deal for drugs coming from southeast asia, so it's certainly more than colombian cocaine now.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "ahern: sure it is. but, i think, erin, let's put a couple of things in perspective. certainly when you aggregate the amount of cartel deaths, again action 47,000 or 50,000, it's more than any other loss of life anywhere else on the globe so that poses a significant threat.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "let's also focus on some of the facts that occurred the last few years as well. when you take a look at the apprehensions along the mexican border coming into the united states, last fiscal year was 340,000. that's down 53 percent from 2008, and one-fifth in 2000, when it reached the tied of 1.6 million coming across the border.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "2. solvable problems may escalate to entrenched, bitter hurts.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "couples who reach out earlier for support when things are amiss often head off a caustic, ugly pattern of hurting each other in ways that are hard to forget or forgive. marriage therapists should be able to help partners identify the ways they express themselves when they are hurt or angry and to recognize how they may unintentionally put their partners on the defensive.― linda lipshutz, a psychotherapist in palm beach gardens, florida", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "3. asking tough questions now will save you a world of hurt later.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "in my opinion, the ideal time for couple's therapy is pre-engagement. like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. when you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that's when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. so many of the issues i see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: people who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. a few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you're signing up for. ― ryan howes, a psychologist in pasadena, california", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "4. you lose empathy for your spouse the longer you stay bitter.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "when issues remain unresolved, resentment can create a large and ugly divide between two people. this often manifests as lack of empathy, disinterest and at times, even disrespect. go to therapy before arguments seem insurmountable because one or both of you have become apathetic. ― talia wagner, a marriage and family therapist in los angeles, california", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "5. the earlier you nip problems in the bud, the better.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "i'd say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. that means they'll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. therapy can help you prioritize 'repair,' or staying connected over 'resolution,' which is often out of reach. ― zach brittle", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "6. crisis is a horrible time to work on things.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "i often share a folksy old saying with my clients: 'it's best to fix the roof when the sun's shining.' we all know that when we're in the midst of crisis we make hasty, impulsive decisions that strive for immediate safety instead of long-term sustainability. maybe you've noticed the relationship is strained every time a partner has a job change and you see a new career shift on the horizon. the wise choice may be to go to counseling now, when things are still calm, to learn tools to cope with the changes. it's ok to go to counseling when things seem 'fine' so that you are more resilient when they aren't. even the strongest marriages will encounter tough times eventually, and it's good to be equipped when they come. ― ryan howes", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "let me explain: marriage, or any duet or intimate partnership needs plenty of caring, lots of tolerance and acceptance and enough humor to take the edge off. but a pattern of too much politeness or caution in one or both partners kills the spark, and pretty soon the marriage is limping along, barely alive, or, sometimes, so turbulent that it can break apart.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "beth and larry, a mid-30's couple with two young daughters, came to see me on the verge of divorce. at least, beth is on the verge of divorcing her mild-mannered husband. from the first visit, beth was large and in-charge. this attractive woman, who runs a child-developement center, indicated that she felt let down by larry in every way. he was no longer affectionate with her, he argued with her over what she considered petty things, and beth had begun making plans to, as she put it, work on becoming effective co-parents-i.e., she was giving up on the marriage. this was her second marriage, by the way.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "beth fell for larry shortly after she left a really turbulent relationship with her bi-polar-ish first husband. beth felt responsible for him, and said she hung on much longer than she should have. devastated and emotionally drained following her break-up, this handsome, capable and calm larry felt like just the ticket. they dated for several years, during which time they each pursued professional degrees. beth remembered that they fought rather intensely during periods of separation from each other, but had long months where they enjoyed a close and loving connection.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "in the sessions, the most striking quality of this couple is larry's reticence with beth. he's a really smart guy, thoughtful, a well-regarded environmental specialist, but he seems dumb with his wife. while she threatens to give him the boot, he looks unruffled. but he's clearly hurt, and at our initial meeting he acknowledged not being able to sleep because of worry that beth would leave.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "at our last session, i wondered about larry's quiet demeanor. this followed my umpteenth observation that larry appears to be a caring, engaged guy who loves his family and wants to make things better. that's worth a lot. when i asked larry what keeps him so polite with beth, he responded, i'm afraid of offending her. she easily gets offended. on a roll now, he described how he had been sleeping on the couch for a couple of years-!-because his wife was committed to co-sleeping with the kids. he didn't like the idea, he wanted his bed-and his wife-back, but, according to him, she became offended when he tried to bring this up. wow!", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "this was the problem with these well-meaning people in a nutshell. when beth gets upset, or fights larry on an idea, he withdraws. i'm not sure if he's protecting himself or her, but my guess is that it's a bit of both. and even though beth says she wants a relationship of equals with two strong voices, she has a subtle way of appearing to be the expert. she says she wants an equal, but a real equal partnership will challenge her status as exclusive expert, especially on the kids. i'm not sure she's ready for that.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "the few policies still in existence often focus on relationships that put the company as risk, such as a romantic relationship between a manager and their employee, or one that runs contrary to the checks and balances that exist within the company ― like quality assurance and customer service or finance and sales, marzolph told huffpost.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "if no guidelines exist, marzolph recommends gauging the workplace culture around you: have you heard of other office relationships developing in the past? does the company encourage after-hours camaraderie among the staff?", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "a company that sponsors or hosts non-work events and activities may be an example of a culture that's much more tolerant or even supportive of relationships in the workplace, marzolph said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "avoid going from zero to 100 by establishing a friendship first, said lynn taylor, a workplace expert and author of tame your terrible office tyrant: how to manage childish boss behavior & thrive in your job. this way, you'll find out early on whether you have anything in common besides mutual disgust of your boss' tupperware lunches.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "establish a foundation and find out if you're compatible, personality-wise, taylor said. then, take cues. gauge your next actions off the responses you generally receive from the person.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "take some of the stress out of the situation by suggesting a casual location for your date, said neely steinberg, a dating coach and image consultant.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "coffee is usually a good suggestion because it's low key and really, who doesn't like coffee? steinberg said. plus, it may be perceived as a friend thing as opposed to an actual 'date.' if you're not getting a good romantic vibe, you can always just chalk it up to a friendly co-worker coffee.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "4. when you do ask, don't make it weird.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "in the 12 years marzolph has worked in human resources, sexual harassment complaints have almost always been about how someone went about asking, not the fact that they had asked.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "the common theme is that the interaction left one person feeling uncomfortable, she told us. whether intended or not, most filing a claim or complaint describe the pursuing employee's approach as awkward or inappropriate.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "don't come on too strong or corner the person, and ideally, approach them outside of work or in the communal area, marzolph said. try to keep your approach light; be ready to give the person an easy out if they're not interested, so you both can continue working together without tension.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "don't take it personally if your crush is just not that into you, taylor said.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "luckily, some work relationships work out great, edmonds said. i met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. you just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. pda or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "well, a couple of things. first of all, this speech that they continually quote from joe biden when he was on the judiciary committee — if you actually read the speech, number one, he was speaking hypothetically. [cellphone rings]", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "wow, nina. you're supposed to turn off your phone.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "i'm not — i'm supposed to be a pro.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "i'm assuming you can just splice the question and i'll just answer it, so nina doesn't have to answer — ask it again.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "well, first of all, if you look at what joe biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a supreme court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "well, you know what? that's exactly what i've done. and so there's no contradiction between what i'm doing and what joe biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "number two, with respect to my actions when i was a junior senator, you will recall that i never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. i never said that a nominee should not get a vote. and what i also said at the time was that i was concerned about some of judge alito's views that i considered more troubling. but in the case of merrick garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "this is just raw politics. we don't want somebody who's been nominated by a democrat — a claim that i would have never made at the time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "now what is true, nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. justice scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. and so i understand the politics that republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "here's the problem we have, though: if in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, we've got another excuse for not confirming a democratic president's nominee?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and at that point the process has broken down. democrats have not been blameless in this process. you cannot point to me a circumstance in which democrats have left a seat open when a republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "justice kennedy was confirmed by ronald reagan, and i'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. but ultimately, he was confirmed. and he was confirmed in the last year of president reagan's office. so we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the supreme court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the supreme court, but the integrity of the senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. i'm not demanding that republicans vote for merrick garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. and at some point, it's got to stop.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "a good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a supreme court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "are you taking this on the road?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "well, you know, i'm going to make the case — i'm going to make the case for a fair process. give judge garland a hearing; give him a vote. and look at the qualities of the man. that's what the american people expect. and, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that i've heard from mitch mcconnell and some other republicans is this notion that the american people should decide — we should let the american people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "well in fact, the american people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the united states with sufficient electoral votes. and they also decided that the republicans would be in the majority. they didn't say, we're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. they said, no, you're the president for four years, and mr. mcconnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the senate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "so the american people already have decided. they've already weighed in. they will have another opportunity to weigh in, so that if there is another vacancy that comes up, the next president will fill that vacancy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. the real argument is the one that you made, nina, which is that they don't want a democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a democrat to fill the seat.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. and sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the american people actually matter more than your short-term politics. they actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. and there have been a number of times where, as president of the united states, i've had to do things that i knew were bad politics but i understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and i would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on earth.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "he may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation, gessen writes, a climate of more anxiety and fear of change. gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar hannah arendt, author of the origins of totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability while at the same time dangling the promise of stability.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "gessen clearly regards trump not only as a putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a putin impersonator. the author argues that trump models himself on putin, not because he expects to replicate russian political culture here but because he wants america to see him the way russia sees putin — as someone who can return his country to the glories of an imaginary past.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "gessen says putin and trump were elected president without really wanting the job. they ran not for president but for autocrat, and they did not expect to settle for anything less. putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say trump 2024 and trump 2028 and so on into the future.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "the first three years [of trump's term] have shown that an autocratic attempt in the u.s. has credible chance of succeeding, gessen writes. worse than that, they have shown that an autocratic attempt builds logically on the structures and norms of american government; on the concentration of power in the executive branch, and on the marriage of money and politics.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "gessen says the institutions and traditions americans thought would protect them have proven weak because they were not built to withstand a personality such as trump. the author had little faith that robert mueller's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election would be the magic bullet that would rid washington of trump. instead, gessen writes, it drew attention away from what trump was doing in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "at this point, of course, one must wonder who gessen means by we. one impression easily taken from surviving autocracy is that trump has been visited on americans by some mysterious force or personal magic. there is a lack of focus on the manner by which trump, as opposed to putin, came to office.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "gessen's perceptions about russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). but by the same token, average americans might well ask how much gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most americans.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "wine-banks: no, that came from the testimony at the senate. and we heard it the same way that all americans heard it, which was on television. alexander butterfield was an aide to richard nixon who had been instrumental in installing the taping system. and a sort of happenstance question by one of the senate staffers on a friday revealed this, and it remained confidential and secret until monday, when it was publicly revealed in senate hearings.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "wine-banks: yes. he thought that it was a trap. and i am much less skeptical. maybe i was more naive, but i believed that it was a make or break for us. i knew that it either was going to confirm what john dean said and make our case, or if it deviated from what he said, we would have been in serious jeopardy of not being able to prove the case because then there would have been serious doubt about his credibility. and so the only question we had was not if we would subpoena tapes, but which ones. and we foresaw executive privilege claims being raised.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "davies: now, what's interesting, you initially request - i think - nine tapes, and you had to ask for specific dates. and this is an interesting fact that occurred to me as i read this. it helped in asking for specific dates to have white house logs, which you had been provided by whom?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "wine-banks: we got them from the white house. it was something that helped enormously. we had all sorts of call logs and meeting logs. and it is something that is very important in developing our case to have had that kind of information. so, for example, on one of the conversations that we subpoenaed in that first nine, we at first thought that it was from, like, 10:30 to noon. but when we checked the logs, we sent an addendum by letter to the white house saying this conversation actually took place from this time to this time. and we were very precise because we had the call logs. and we knew who came into the meeting and when they left and who entered the meeting after that person left. and it made it much easier to identify the exact times of conversations.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "wine-banks: it does, and it's something that needs to be brought back to the supreme court to get a final ruling because there's no question that these are public records that should be turned over. there's no privilege and no reason not to have the witnesses and the documents. and it's very important if the american people are going to be able to know the truth and the facts. i'm very fact-based. and i can see information. people can evaluate and judge what it means to them, but at least they have the facts. and if the facts are withheld, you have nothing.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "wine-banks: she was feisty for sure. we definitely had a situation where i knew that nothing that i got from her would be easily obtained, that i was going to have to be very precise and careful in my questioning to get information. but at the first time, she wasn't suspected of having done anything. i, by some amazing coincidence, asked her questions that turned out to be devastating once we found out that she had possibly erased 18 1/2 minutes of a tape because she had told me about working on it for 29 hours at camp david - that very tape - without ever mentioning that, oh, by the way, there was an 18-minute gap in that tape.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "and then to make it even worse, when the court ordered that we have the tape investigated, we hired a group of professionals in this field, first of all, hoping that we could recover the erased material. but we couldn't. but also what they discovered was that it was not one erasure. there were multiple erasures.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: now, this photo, ironically taken by white house photographers, kind of made rose mary woods a laughingstock because it showed her in this incredibly contorted position where she's stretching, holding her foot on a pedal and reaching for a phone. it just seems kind of ridiculous. did you have sympathy for her?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "wine-banks: probably at that moment i didn't. i have an ability to sort of compartmentalize. and i was really compartmentalized on, what questions do i have to ask while listening to her answers so that i can follow up and make sure she's not evading my questions? in retrospect, i definitely have sympathy for her because i know that she may actually believe that she did that, but she certainly didn't.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in today for terry gross. our guest, alia volz, writes that before she could spell her own name, she knew she was from an outlaw family. in the late '70s when she was a baby and a toddler, her parents had a roaring business baking and selling marijuana-laced brownies. thousands a month to hippies, artists, office workers and activists in san francisco. volz often made the rounds with her mom, selling their wares to grateful customers every friday. as colorful as that sounds - and it was - it's no less interesting than another story told in her new memoir, the tale of her parents' relationship.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "two free-spirited psychics who made their way in a city of enormous cultural and social change - the explosion of the counterculture, the growth of the gay liberation movement, the horror of the aids epidemic, as well as the assassinations of mayor george moscone and city supervisor harvey milk and the suicides in guyana of the followers of jim jones, whose peoples temple was an influential presence in the city for years. alia volz's writing has appeared in the best american essays 2017, the new york times and other publications. her new book is home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco. like many of you, i'm working from home these days. i spoke to alia volz, who was at her office in san francisco.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "alia volz, welcome to fresh air. this book is, in part, about the city of san francisco. and your mom was there, i guess, in the mid and late '70s. it was a city undergoing remarkable change. just paint a little bit of a picture. what was going on at the scene at fisherman's wharf, the performances? give us a sense of it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "alia volz: of course. well, san francisco in the 1970s was coming out of the summer of love, this huge influx of young people who'd come out to experiment with new lifestyles. that was very much over. but all kinds of new subcultures were flourishing. the way that i think about it sometimes is if the '60s were a sketchpad, the '70s would be the box of crayons. there was just wonderful and crazy experimentation. some of it went horribly awry. and some of it was spectacular.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "so the scene down at fisherman's wharf was one of the spectacular emergences. there were, actually, at the time, thousands of artists and crafts people who sold to tourists on the street all kinds of things they made themselves. and there was a busking scene of people like robin williams and penn and teller and magicians and tap dancers and musicians and whole dance troupes - this really elaborate scene that was called the new vaudeville.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: right. and then, through all this, there was your mom with sticky fingers brownies, the marijuana-laced brownies, which, at its height, was, you know, moving something like 2,800 brownies a week - your mom and an interesting crew of others that distributed these. what's interesting is that this wasn't the kind of operation where you'd knock on the door and get a password. explain how this enterprise connected with its customers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: my mom came up with this really innovative business plan where she sold exclusively to people on the job. so she would go around to boutiques and restaurants and real estate offices and even medical offices and only sell to the people who were working. they would buy at large volume and then redistribute the brownies through their own social circles.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and in this way, the brownies were really all over town. by late 1977, i think, is when they were doing 10,000 brownies a month. it was smart in that there was no fixed location for police to find. the brownies seemed to come from everywhere. and at the same time, it enabled them to reach all of the little culture pockets that were flourishing in the late '70s.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: you were born while the business was going. and after your mom recovered from the birth, she started bringing you along on her deliveries. what was that like? what did you learn about how she carried you, kind of how you fit into this whole thing?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: my mom, from the beginning, she just sort of took me everywhere. and so in the early days of sticky fingers, this meant that i went on brownie runs with her. first, she had me in a front carrier, then on a gerry carrier and, eventually, in the stroller. and she would hang duffel bags of brownies from the back bars of the stroller because they were very heavy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "so she would use the stroller to transport the brownies. and we'd go from business to business. and her customers just absolutely adored me and fawned over me. so i was very little. obviously, i don't remember much clearly from this period. but i do have these flashes of memory. and there's a certain feeling that comes to me when i think of it. it was a very exuberant period in the city and especially in the castro, where my mom was mostly working. and there was, i think, a lot of cheek-pinching and fawning and a lot of joy around it is the feeling that i get, anyway.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: the business was still going when you were a toddler and, i guess, into kindergarten, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: yes. well, in some form or another, it continued until i was an adult. but this original iteration carried on until about second or third grade.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: which meant that you as a kid had to keep a really big, important secret, a family secret. do you remember being told what the stakes were or how you knew?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: no. and i know that seems strange. but it was something that i learned so young that i don't have a specific memory about it. it was always who we are. so i had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: and did you know that that could mean prison and, you know, foster care for you? or...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: to an extent. my parents weren't trying to scare me with it. but from a practical standpoint, they needed me to understand that what we were doing was illegal and that if i told anyone, including other children - who might tell an adult - it could have very serious consequences for our family. so i did know from the very beginning that if i told anyone what my parents really did that they could go to prison.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: and do you remember ever finding that hard, you know, as you got a little older and had friends?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: not in a very conscious way. although, i think it did affect me. i was a child who always enjoyed hanging out with adults and was awkward around other children. and i didn't have a lot of friends growing up. as an adult, i look back at it and wonder how much of that might have come out of the idea of carrying a big secret and how that makes you build walls around it and how that makes you shut down, in some ways. at the time, i wasn't very conscious of it. i just - i had a pat answer for when people asked what my parents did. and i knew very clearly that there were huge parts of our home life that i couldn't talk about.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: what was the pat answer when kids asked what your parents did?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: which is also true. so it wasn't an outright lie. it was a withholding of information.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: and so while you had this secret and you knew that you were an outlaw family, it was illegal, did it ever seem wrong to you?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: no. my parents, i think, like a lot of hippies, a lot of people from their generation, saw marijuana as wholesome and harmless. and i was taught that the legislation around it and the government's view of it was wrong and that what they were doing was right. so i grew up with that idea that we were outlaws, but good outlaws - kind of like robin hood outlaws. and i didn't question that for a long time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: well, it came from the people you loved and trusted, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: it did. and i think that by the time i was maybe old enough to really question those ideas myself, the role of marijuana had changed so much culturally that i had a whole different answer.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: you know, you write in the book that brownie crumbs blanketed the floor where you played. between secondhand smoke, secret finger swipes of batter and stolen crumbs, you - the tots probably consumed a significant amount of cannabis. and there was some drug use among your parents and your friends beyond marijuana, you know, a lot of cocaine. you know, there are people who would be appalled reading this. what's your take on this? did you ever feel like any of this seemed irresponsible in retrospect?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: in retrospect, sure, of course. i feel in general that marijuana is relatively harmless. it's certainly not something that should be consumed by children. and i want to be clear that i don't think i was tottering around stoned during my childhood. i was certainly discouraged from consuming marijuana as a kid. it was grown-up stuff. that was something that i understood.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but it was around. it was so much a part of the environment that it would be unreasonable to assume that i didn't inhale it as secondhand smoke. and of course, the brownies taste like chocolate, so i'm sure i snuck some. but it's not like i was - you know, it's not like my parents were feeding me pot brownies. i want to be really clear about that. where i think it might be more damaging is with the harder drugs. cocaine is a substance that alters one's personality in a fairly significant way. so there's that. but i also want to say that all of the kids growing up in the sticky fingers warehouse came out just fine. we're all responsible adults and contributors to society. so...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: i don't want to be an apologist, either. so, you know, clearly, this was not an ideal situation.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: on the other hand, i mean, it sounds like you felt very much loved and accepted, which probably has a lot more to do with how a kid grows up than what they necessarily inhale or eat.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: absolutely. i - you know, i want to say that i was so well cared for and surrounded by love and affection. i was not left to run wild. i was looked after - basically, at my mom's hip through my entire childhood. so there's no neglect in that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: alia volz's new memoir is called home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco. we'll be back after a short break. this is fresh air.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "(soundbite of the kinks song, the village green preservation society)", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: this is fresh air. and we're speaking with writer alia volz. she has a new memoir about her mother's business selling pot-laced brownies in san francisco in the 1970s. it also deals with volz's parents' relationship and some remarkable events in san francisco in the period. the book is called home baked.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "you know, the relationship between your parents, as described in the book, is just fascinating. these are two really interesting people, and this is a very intimate portrait of them - their courtship, their marriage - involving events that were, in many cases, before you were born. and i know you did lots of interviews. i'm wondering what it was like to kind of get in your parents' heads, your parents-in-their-20s' heads, and kind of - almost, like, kind of reconstructing a 360-degree view of your early life a little at a time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: so i have a very intimate relationship with my mom, and it's nothing unusual for us to talk about her very personal feelings about things both from the past and today. but i started this book having been estranged from my dad for many, many years. and really, for the first couple of drafts, i didn't ask his side of the story because i didn't know how.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "i finally realized that i could not write an honest book without spending as much time on his thoughts and feelings and motives as i had with my mom. and what surprised me so much is how ready he was to go there. we dug through boxes together. we talked about some of his actions from back in the day that were really hurtful to other people. and he was, i think, very brave about it, acknowledging his role in it and also having a certain curiosity himself about both how he had acted and what drove him to act that way.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: you write about the first night they had sex, which is interesting both because you know about it...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: ...but also for what happened during the night. tell us about this.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: how awkward is that, writing about your parents having sex? (laughter). i tried to skip it, and my writing group - that's wonderful - kept saying, look; you can't cop out on this (laughter). but what's - so my father is a grand mal epileptic, and my mom didn't know he was an epileptic. they had slept together for the first time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "in the middle of the night, my mom wakes up and the bed is shaking like crazy. here we are in san francisco. she thinks it's an earthquake. she sits up, realizes that nothing else in the room is moving, that it's doug shaking wildly in bed, and she thought he might be having a drug overdose. but then he stopped and was sleeping calmly. and it wasn't until weeks later that he told her he had grand mal epilepsy, and he'd had an epileptic seizure in the middle of the night.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: your parents were really interested in the occult, both, you know, psychics, i think. they thought of themselves as psychics. your mom read tarot cards. your dad was a graduate of the berkeley psychic institute. he at some point describes a vision that he has for a child. you want to describe this?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: (laughter) yes. and it was very early in there dating, in fact. he told my mom at dinner that he was carrying a child, and she's like, what are you talking about? (laughter). but he explained that he was carrying a spirit child. this is a spirit that he felt was traveling with him and waiting to be born into the world. ostensibly, this is me (laughter).", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "my mom, upon receiving this information, after only dating the guy for three weeks, was a little taken aback. she wasn't looking to have a child. so there became a little push-pull between them for a while around the idea of this spirit child, which is, obviously, kind of a crazy thing to write about years after the fact, but i wanted to be true to my parents' visions of what was going on in their lives.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: right. and so he actually, the night of conception - at least he thinks - he told your mom, ok, that's it; you're pregnant.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: and i guess they both expected that the spirit child was on its way to the earth. you want to share that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: sure. and i want to say that my mom also confirms and describes that my dad identified the moment of conception and didn't even bother getting a pregnancy test. she believed him, and it turned out that he was right. she began to show. it became obvious. so that is a kind of a story, kind of a myth that i grew up with. i don't know how many people have these really high and magical myths about their births (laughter), but i sure had one. my dad, however, was convinced that i was going to be a boy - absolutely certain. and because he'd been right about everything else, my mom went along with it, too.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: the description of the delivery is really something. i mean, your mom wanted a natural childbirth, and it turns out you were breached. and it was long and arduous and painful. and then the doctor declares, she's a girl.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: what was your dad's reaction to this? i mean, he was so sure.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: i think it was a blow to him. i think it was a blow to his ego. and the story that i had grown up with in my family - and i don't - i'm not even sure when i was told this - but was that he left the hospital and went to a gay bathhouse and spent the day there, which is a difficult moment to begin with. that was one of the more challenging conversations i had with my father in writing this book, i have to admit.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: you said - that was the story in your family. your mom didn't know it at the time, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: no, but she found out. so apparently, what happened is that my dad - who can't keep a secret - told cheryl (ph), the other salesperson, at a point. he just had to get it off his chest. and i think that she told my mom. and then he, later on, during a big fight, he told her in an angry way. so my mom found out fairly shortly thereafter. this wasn't something i was told about as a kid. but i think as a teenager - was when i found out. and it is the kind of story that sticks in your craw.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: well, and what's fascinating is that, you know, your dad - i mean, you write about this in the book - because he would sometimes not take his medication, he's had some really difficult mental episodes, and his memory is not reliable. and when you went to ask him, is this true that you went to a gay bathhouse after your child was born, what was his reaction?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: he didn't remember, which seems convenient and perhaps was. but i should say about my dad and his epilepsy that the grand mal seizures would wipe out huge chunks of his memory, and there are many things that he wishes he remembers that he can't. he's a good custodian of the memories that he has, and they check out with my research and with the stories that other people i interviewed told. but there are huge episodes, huge swaths that are simply not there, and this was part of what wasn't there.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "so i talk about my father and i reconciling, and confronting him about this moment was very difficult. it was difficult for me, and it was difficult for him. it upset him. and one of the things that i think really helped us come back together is that when this happened, he got very quiet, and he asked who was saying it. and when i said that it was both cheryl and my mom who had told me this, he accepted it and took some ownership for the action. it made him very sad, you know, to think of having done that, right? i thought it was very brave of him to allow that to be the story.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "this operation got pretty big. your mom was moving something like 2,800 brownies a week at its height. how did she manage the risk? i mean, this was, after all, a class 1 narcotic. you know, these were felonies every day or every week. how did she manage the risk of it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: ok. so this is kind of, i want to say, a ridiculous part of the story. although, i think my parents would disagree. but my mom - both of my parents, actually, believed strongly in the occult and specifically the i ching, which is a 4,000-year-old chinese divination method rooted in daoism and confucianism. and you would consult it in the way that you might consult tarot cards. and my mom believed wholeheartedly in this practice.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and so every week, she would throw the i ching coins and ask about their safety and ask about the risk. and she always did what the i ching said. i mean, the business opened following an i ching hexagram. there was a point when the business closed following an i ching hexagram. there was no question too big or too small to run past the i ching.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: you know, your dad had a habit of not taking his medication for epilepsy, which led to some really troubling and bizarre incidents at times. it was one point where he said he had to go off hitchhiking to meet the dalai lama. and other things like that happened. do you have insight into why he chose not to take the medicine for the epilepsy?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: i've done a lot of thinking about this. and i think it's pretty interesting. my dad has a spiritual relationship - or had a spiritual relationship with his epilepsy. he described that in the moments leading up to a seizure, his pre-seizure aura would appear in his peripheral vision as a multi-colored mandala with all colors of the spectrum, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. he describes it as being like looking at god. and my dad is such a spiritually serious person that this really attracted him.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "and so i think he would kind of edge up to it. he didn't want to deny himself that connection with the godhead that he felt was there. and so he would try to control his seizures internally. at a point, he had a method where he thought that if - when the mandala appeared, if he shifted his eyes hard in the opposite direction, he could stop himself from having a seizure. so he kept trying to control it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but he would have these grand mal seizures. and sometimes they led to psychological instability, as well as memory loss. but i find it fascinating because the idea of a spiritually associated seizure is not new. dostoyevsky wrote rapturously about seizures. and some pretty interesting historical figures have been posthumously diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. so i don't know if my dad might be in that category. in any case, it was a strong force in his life.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: yeah. does he still have seizures today?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: he takes, not dilantin, but another medication. i think it's tegretol. and he says he hasn't had a seizure in 20 years.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: you know, you mentioned that your mom would often make business decisions and life decisions often by consulting the i ching, you know, this way of tossing these coins to get a reading on what should be done. i'm wondering, as a kid, did you ever feel like your life was being governed by these forces that couldn't be seen? that ever bother you?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: (laughter) that question makes me laugh a little bit. so as a child, i was pretty accepting of especially my mom's worldview. i had a lot of trust in her. she was always cool in a crisis. and i believed that she knew what she was doing. my parents, i would say, did not use the i ching to decide what i should or shouldn't be allowed to do. i didn't have a whole lot of rules as a child. i kind of felt like i was part of the decision-making process to a degree that, i think, is pretty unusual.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "but my relationship with the i ching as a kid was that i trusted it. and the fact that my mom felt confident using it made me feel confident as well. so i sometimes think about how, you know, the knowledge that my parents could have gone to prison at any time, how that should have been terrifying to me as a kid. and yet, it didn't keep me awake at night because i trusted my mom's decision-making abilities. and i trusted the i ching then. it was later, more as a teenager, that i was like, oh, no. wait. science (laughter), you know? and i started to rebel more against the idea. but it's really only as an adult that i look back at the situation we were in and worry about the kid i was.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "one of the things that you do in the book is you talk about kind of the history of san francisco. and in the 1970s, there was all of this kind of explosion of creativity and art and experimentation. but there was also some really dark stuff. you know, the peoples temple, which was led by jim jones, was active in the city and very connected to a lot of the liberal politicians. and then there was the horrific assassinations of the mayor, moscone, and then the supervisor, the councilman, harvey milk that, i guess, was not a customer of your mom, but somebody that she met on her rounds a lot. how did all of that affect her?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: well, first of all, so harvey was not a customer. he had sworn off drugs. but his camera shop, which was also his campaign headquarters, was one of my mom's regular stops because other people around him and who were working on his campaign were customers. so that was how that connection happened. but he was very much out in the neighborhood walking around, talking to people. he was very personable and very connected to the community. and so my mom knew him.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "davies: you moved out of san francisco. and there's an eight-year stretch of your childhood. and you described them as pretty tough. you know, your parents' relationship fell apart, in part, because, you know, your dad would not take the medicine for his epilepsy and had some pretty strange experiences. your mom ends up reviving the business kind of with once-a-month trips into san francisco from where they were living outside of town.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "as you moved into the '80s, the brownie business changed in a way, right? it wasn't just recreational because it became a way to ease the suffering of people afflicted with aids. and this was at a time when the epidemic was, you know, poorly understood scientifically. there was little treatment. and it was, you know, deeply associated with homophobia. as your mom made these trips to the city, how did the epidemic present itself to her?", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "but the illnesses varied a lot. and there was a long time when nobody knew what it was. some people got the pneumocystis carinii. some people had the wasting syndrome and terrible diarrhea. some people had the kaposi's sarcoma lesions. the variety of presentations of the symptom made the onset very mysterious. and it didn't get a lot of press at first because it emerged first within the gay male population. and this was a community that broader society was maybe eager not to look at and not to acknowledge.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "davies: as you and your mom made these deliveries, did you find people who you had known for years and years getting sicker and sicker?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "volz: yeah. of course. so as a kid, it was something that i was - of course i was aware of it. you would see - the presentation of aids was so dramatic physically. and it could happen very quickly. we'd be gone for a month and come back the next month. and somebody who had been a beautiful 30-year-old would look 70.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "it was really striking, you know, the weight loss and the way that it transformed how people carried themselves. suddenly, a young man would be using a walker. it was terrible. and then people started to disappear. as a child, i only understood so much, you know? as the years passed, i came to understand what was going on. and people began to disappear from our lives.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "the plot is simple: a married woman is trying to forget her lover. the woman, maggie ellmann, a contented mother of two grown children, meets james, a married poet, at a conference. they spend two years falling into a long-distance emotional affair. the affair culminates in a single, searing night together in chicago, after which they part for good. in the unsent letters she writes to james during this embargo, maggie struggles to find a theological framework for her longing and her pain. in one such letter, she admires the buddhist notion of death as the ultimate lack of attachment, noting, what relief there would be in no longer longing to feel, again, your whiskers on my inner thighs. her antagonist is time — so slow when she is trying to forget, so quick when she reflects on the simpler years with her husband and children, before the erotic disruption.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "indeed, medieval legends, repeated in modern media, had st. valentine performing christian marriage rituals or passing notes between christian lovers jailed by gothicus. still other stories romantically involved him with the blind girl whom he allegedly healed. yet none of these medieval tales had any basis in third-century history, as the bollandists pointed out.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "in any case, historical veracity did not count for much with medieval christians. what they cared about were stories of miracles and martyrdoms and the physical remains or relics of the saint. to be sure, many different churches and monasteries around medieval europe claimed to have bits of a st. valentinus' skull in their treasuries.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "nicole kidman. the name conjures many images and associations: the tumble of red curls and pert, blue-eyed face of the star as a young newcomer to the screen; the marriage to tom cruise and ensuing escape from scientology; the lithe physique and dewy features that she wears easily to this day. but one phrase we often forget to attach to her is great actress.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "perhaps because of her demeanor of self-effacing, even demure, modesty, it's been easy to underestimate kidman over the course of a career that now spans three decades. but this week has offered a reminder of why we should prize an actress who has fashioned one of the most fascinating careers in a business notorious for pigeonholing its starlets early, keeping them boxed in and discarding them when their physical attributes show signs of sagging, bagging or otherwise naturally evolving.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "kidman has largely escaped that trap, as anyone who watched the recent hbo series big little lies can attest. the stylish, compulsively engrossing thriller-slash-domestic-melodrama turned out to be a sleeper peak tv hit largely on the strength of its ensemble cast, which included reese witherspoon, laura dern, zoë kravitz, shailene woodley and kidman, who played the abused wife of a prosperous executive. kidman — who co-produced with witherspoon — was a standout in the series, her portrayal of a woman fighting for her own physical and psychic survival radiating shame, ambivalence, glazed confusion, determination and barely perceptible ripples of latent power. never showy or gratuitous, it was a performance as delicate and fine-grained as the porcelain that her doll-like character, celeste, sometimes seemed to be made of.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "no sooner had kidman delivered a powerhouse with big little lies than she whipsawed her audience into another direction entirely: in queen of the desert, out friday, she portrays the storied explorer, writer and photographer gertrude bell, a contemporary of t.e. lawrence who traveled the arabian peninsula in the early 20th century and helped redraw the region's national boundaries after world war i. written and directed by werner herzog with an uncharacteristically blunt and stodgily sentimental hand, queen of the desert isn't a great film. in fact, it's often a very bad one, its strenuous efforts to be the female version of lawrence of arabia notwithstanding. but none of its faults lie with kidman, who dominates the screen in nearly every shot with regal composure and restraint (and, apparently, a generous supply of spf-50 sunscreen).", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "but even in her worst movies, kidman is never the problem; her performances rise above whatever dreck they're in, as if her supreme self-possession as a performer inoculated her against the toxic material she was working with. and the bad movies are relatively thin on the ground compared with the myriad triumphs: she won an oscar for her portrayal of virginia woolf in the hours (we're still arguing about that nose), but that was a full seven years after her astonishing portrayal of a fame-hungry tv journalist in to die for, in which she permanently shut up the doubters in a triumphantly crafty, satirical turn.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "one need only consider kidman's vanity-free supporting appearance in last year's lion, alight quickly on moulin rouge! and the others and go all the way back to her breakout roles in dead calm and days of thunder to appreciate the rigor and expressive range of an actress who can easily hold her own with the meryl streeps, viola davises and cate blanchetts of the world but is rarely mentioned in their company.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "it's nothing new for actresses to search out envelopes to push, edges to explore or boundaries to transgress in the name of publicity, stretching or simply staying relevant. in kidman's case, her finest performance may be a cumulative one, far outstripping the workaday job of taking a character from the page to the stage. her genius is just as strategic as it is technical, in how she's consistently leveraged stardom on behalf of growth, taste and sophistication. with her preternatural technical and physical gifts, she easily could have been sleepwalking through the past 30 years. instead, she's chosen to keep her eyes wide open.", "label": 9}
