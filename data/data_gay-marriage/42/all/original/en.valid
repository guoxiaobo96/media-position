They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. Consider the inner cities. Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal. What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner city dysfunction: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what they called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "There was truth in what the conservatives said. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit. This is striking because rural Americans don't seem to have much in common with people from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly. Yet the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. Mostly they're not. They don't have to be. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind. But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many areas were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men. Before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out of wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that follow: more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation. This isn't speculation, or propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. Increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "And yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married.

Sheryl Sandburg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandburg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandburg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich. What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded. We didn't question why Sandburg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandburg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In.

Libertarians tell us that's how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting.

Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us. Maybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not.

They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close. Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate of someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of the richest people do. In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid a federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating. Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people, but at a big cost to everyone else.

You represent all the 17 intelligence agencies, in all policy meetings. C.I.A. might have a seat at the table, but I represented the DNI. And I would do the briefing that usually kicked off these policy meetings. So that was sort of one of the responsibilities.", "label": 1}

But I find each and every one of them fascinating.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And I've had the fortune of working first in West African issues and then I moved to East African and Central African, so I've sort of moved around enough, and then my academic work was on southern.

{"sentence": "So this great job that you had in the intelligence community you left in 2018?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Well, I always think it's important to say it has nothing to do with politics. I spent 18 months as the National Intelligence Officer under President Obama and then 18 months under President Trump, and I actually really liked working and trying to support this administration. It forced me to challenge my assumptions.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So you were the National Intelligence Officer during the Trump [administration]?", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "But the NIO job was the pinnacle for me. That's the best job you can have in my career of service. I thought maybe in 30 years I would be able to get to that point, and I was about halfway through in my career and I didn't see a job in the community that would sort of push me forward. I wanted a new challenge.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And quite honestly, I wanted to do policy again. I really liked being at the NSC, and I wanted to think about what our policy should be. And you know, one of the things you can't do as an analyst is give policy prescriptive.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "And as CSIS, you are able to do both the analysis and policies, right?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah. It's actually a lot like my old job. I read a lot, I write a lot, but then I have recommendations on what I think we should do. Plus, I get to do things, like I have a podcast, that's fun. I talk to journalists.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Podcasts are the best. You know, I travel a lot. I meet with African and European and other government officials and get to interact with them in a different way, speaking for myself, not for my government.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So Intelligence Matters has now been around for a couple of years, we have never had anybody on talking about Africa. So I think the key question is: How does Africa matter to our national security? And how much does it matter?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "How do you answer that question?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "This is a difficult question because as we've just talked about, there are 49 countries in sub Saharan Africa, 54, if you include the North African countries. 55 if you're the African Union because you include Western Sahara. And as our interests evolved, the way we look at Africa changes. And if you would just allow me a quick tangent, because this is very nerdy, but if it's going to be successful, it's going to be successful on Intelligence Matters.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Well, you're talking to a nerd, so we're in good shape here.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yes. I teach a class at George Washington University on the History of U.S. Intelligence Analysis in Africa, and I found this piece, a National Intelligence Estimate from 1971 in East Africa, and there's a line in it, maybe you've seen this before, I've never seen it before, the analyst said, The significance for the United States of developments in East Africa depends on what the U.S. says is important.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Right? It sounds circular, but it's true. And then, the analysts go further than that, right? They say if you're going to look at this in a narrow perspective, we don't have many interests, 1971 in East Africa. There's not a product that we get there, we don't have economic investment.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But if you step back, and I'm paraphrasing here, if you step back, these are countries that could be models, open societies. These leaders have influence, both in Africa and globally. And if they should go south, if there should be instability, it would affect our interests.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And I like to use that story because it tells me don't undersell and don't oversell. Look at all the angles and present all the arguments. So the way that I think about Africa right now is in three ways: First, the future is African, demographically. The continent will double in size. It will go from 1.2 billion people to 2.4 billion people by 2050. That means a quarter of the world's population will be Africa. Nigeria is going to be larger than the United States.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So fastest growth by any continent?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah, fastest growth, youngest continent. Nigeria is going to be the third-largest country in the world, it's going to surpass us. And so, every global problem is going to have an African dimension to it. What is going to be the norms around Internet privacy? How are we going to deal with climate change?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "There's going to be an African component to that and we need to be mindful of that. Two, and this has been something that I've learned in my career, Africa's problems and opportunities don't stop at the water's edge. What happens in Africa changes the way the world works. African migration crisis changed European politics. The Ebola crisis changes the way we think about global health security. You may remember the piracy off the coast of the Horn of Africa, it changed actually how maritime commerce worked in the shipping industry.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So I think that it's really important to be mindful of these events in these different countries because they do change the way people and systems work. And then finally, our allies and adversaries understand those first two points really well and I think they understand it probably better than we do.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "We are seeing this dramatic increase in engagement by allies and adversaries. Between 2010 and 2015, 150 foreign embassies were built in sub Saharan Africa. Trade is up for most countries, 65 countries have increased their trade. And military bases all across Africa. Indian Ocean, the Horn of Africa and Western Saharan, I'm sorry, Western Africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So I think that we have to recognize that if we are not there to shape what is happening on the continent, to referee, to make sure that we are not blocked out by opportunities, it is going to affect our national interests.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So talk a little bit about kind of the state of Africa today. You know, what's going on there? What are the challenges these countries face? And what are some of the positive things that are happening?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Chinua Achebe, the author of Things Fall Apart, said when talking about Nigeria, The problem with Nigeria is leadership. And I think for many of these countries, leadership and governance and sort of the economic problems that flow from that are still probably the biggest challenges these countries face. There is instability.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It's true. It's true of a lot of countries.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It's true of a lot of the countries, right? But you know, instability in the Sahel, challenges in Eastern Congo with Ebola, we have been talking for so many years about urbanization and greater connectivity and youth bulge and climate change. And I would argue right now, those things are really coming together.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Governance has been hard in Africa, but it's become really complex. And I think some governments are failing in the way they respond to that. And I think it's making conflicts more protracted, more deadly, and I think it is denying people the ability to live their lives. And these all, as we have said, have all these effects for us.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But there's some good news stories. And I always like the opportunity to talk about good news because the U.S. media on Africa, it's all negative. I mean, it's disproportionately negative. And", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Africa is doing some things that are really interesting.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "They're going in a different direction than the rest of the world in some cases. So while there's this global recession in democracy, there are people who have less confidence in it. Africans really strongly believe in democracy. 68% of Africans support democratic principles.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "In some countries, it's like in the 80s. There's been 28 transfers of power since 2015, peaceful, more than half. That's historic. While the rest of the world has become protectionist and imposing tariffs, Africans have created a new continental trade arrangements.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It's the largest trading block since the W2O was founded. And finally, while the rest of the world or at least the United States are thinking about pulling out, the Africans are stepping up and they're working together to deal with trans-national threats. So I think those are really good stories.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And just the last thing that I think maybe your audience hasn't thought about that is really exciting to me is African soft power. Africa, Africans are changing our global entertainment and cultural trends in ways that I think are unprecedented. Our music, our films, our sports, Africans are shaping it at the lead.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And I'd love to see African governments take advantage of their soft power and I'd like to think of ways that our government could be more effective in navigating it.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So find this, you know, cutting against the trend on democracy and trade to be fascinating.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Well, let me start with trade first. For the Africans, their economies are too fractured, fragmented. No one's going to invest in the small little Gambia, which just covers the river within Senegal. Inter trade within Africa has been historically low.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And the Africans under the leadership of Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda, realized that if they are going to increase inter-African trade, if they were going to become a better investment destination, they had to remove some of these barriers.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So I think that's what explains the integration, economic integration. On the democracy side, I think it's a number of trend lines that are coming together. First, as I said, still strong support for democracy, but I think there are new ways in which people can organize and mobilize that has changed politics in Africa. As it's become more urban, you've been able to communicate with each other in new ways through telephones and mobile phones.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "We're seeing more protests on the streets. We're seeing more people push for change. And so, whether it's the uprising in Sudan that ended President Al Bashir's rule or it is the remarkable changes in Ethiopia or just increasingly cyclical transfers of power, I think a number of things are happening that really cut against the grain in both the global trends, as you've talked about, but even the way people think about sub Saharan Africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Because you can always pull out the autocracy or the democracy that is in recession or is regressing. But if you step back and look at the picture, it's actually very exciting. And what I tell people is, let's not look at this about democracy as up or down, let's look at the forces that have sort of created a status quo around governance are changing. And I expect a lot of volatility.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "We'll come to you and have these really big surprises and we'll have these setbacks. But I think that people, the governed and the governing, are working on the new rules of the game. And so, it's a really interesting time right now.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Are there countries, and I'm thinking of South Africa, I'm thinking of Nigeria, I'm thinking of Kenya, are there countries that kind of lead the continent? Or is that not a right way of thinking about it?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "U.S. policy has always thought about sort of anchor states: Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and Ethiopia. They have outsized military forces, they are loud and vocal globally and on the continent. I don't think that is as true as much anymore. Nigeria has been dealing with its own internal security problems.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Their President isn't the most dynamic. Ethiopia is in the middle of a transition; South Africa is way down by economic problems. And so, what I think you've seen is a democratization of leadership in Africa. Different countries step up at different times.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So there's not one single voice. You can't as you did under the Bush Administration or under the Obama Administration say, Well, Nigeria is going to carry our water in West Africa. It just doesn't happen anymore. You've got to, I think, build these coalitions with the Senegals and the Ghanas in some regions and still rely on South Africa and Kenya for other things.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You, Judd, you mentioned earlier that other countries are paying attention to what's going on in Africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And seeing some of the opportunities that you talked about. So can you talk a little about what third party actors, namely China and Russia, are doing on the continent? And if there are others, to, that are interesting, please mention those.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah. Let me start with China. I think it's really important to say that China poses some threats to the U.S. in what it's doing. But I've been really disappointed with our policy, because we haven't been precise about what we're trying to counter when it comes to China.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "With China. We seem to want to focus on blocking them at every turn in sub Saharan Africa. And I don't know, it's like mad libs right now. It's we are worried about activity, fill in the blank, in country, fill in the blank, because of China. And I don't even think we have articulated at least publicly what is the end state that we are looking for.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And it's that because of China that is the driver, right?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah, it's the because of China. And I think that if we are going to be effective at managing what China is doing in sub Saharan Africa, we need to be specific about what the threats are. So I would say, first of all, it's Chinese investment in critical infrastructure. Ports. We just did a paper at CSIS, 46 ports the Chinese are invested in, operating or building in Africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "That's a risk because it can limit our mobility, our access to these countries, our ability for our military, our ability for our private sector to get involved.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And the Chinese port could eventually become a Chinese military base?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Absolutely. That's what we saw in Djibouti.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So I worry about ports. I worry about cyber and telecoms. The Chinese have built about 70% of Africa's 4G, it will be 100% of their 5G. Even satellites, Africa is starting to launch more and more satellites and the Chinese are behind it. So we should focus on that.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "We should focus on the people-to-people investment that China is doing. They're actually focusing on winning hearts and minds. More African students study in China than they do in the United States. China has a program now where they're trying to provide satellite television to 10,000 villages.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I think that's decadal, the impacts of that. But the thing about China that gets the most oxygen in Washington is economics. And here is where I think we need to be a lot more nuanced. China is addressing the needs of Africans. This is a region that has the lowest railroad density in the world.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "They need between $130 billion and $170 billion of infrastructure investments per year, according to the African Development Bank, and China is doing a lot of that stuff. So what we need to do with China in my view is we can't tell Africans not to take the money, because our private sector is not providing that.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "China does $200 billion a year and we do $40 billion. But we can help them to make sure the deals are better, that they don't discriminate against the U.S. private sector, that they have the environmental regulations. So that's how I think about China.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah, Russia is an easier conversation that China, right? I don't need much nuance. There is very few upsides to what Russia is doing. Essentially, President Putin needs permissive environments for his companies to invest in after the sanctions were imposed on his government and he's looking to score points.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Africa is a place where he can work asymmetrically. They don't do much that helps African economies. They sell arms. They're the largest exporter of arms to Africa in the world. They are involved in oil and gas industries, in energy. But often, that comes with a side of corruption. What they're really doing is being fairly disruptive to politics.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "If they have an opportunity to side with an autocrat to provide technical expertise to help Al Bashir stay in power, that's what they'll do. So they are looking to sell themselves as returning to the glory days of the Soviet Union in Africa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And I think one of the things that we need to be careful about is not call them a great power. They're not. And I think when we call them a great power in Africa, we do Putin's bidding. They're a minnow. At least compared to us, the Chinese and Europe.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So I think that we need to do a better job at isolating and not elevating Russia. We need to close some of the loops that make it permissive for their companies to work in this area. And we need to be better about gauging Africans to inoculate them from these kinds of intrusions.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah, France is still very involved. And in fact, President Macron just recently had a summit where he talked about what his government is doing on the Sahel. The U.K., the week of this recording, just had its first U.K. Africa Investment Summit. Malta, I don't know why I'm sharing this, but Malta just came out with their own Africa strategy, just to give you a sense of the diversity here.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The other region that I should spend just a second talking about is the Gulf. The Gulf is very active in Africa and Turkey is very active in Africa. In some cases, that's not bad, they're doing some of the investments. DP Ports is investing in lots of places all over the continent.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But what they've done that has been really negative is they have exported their political riffs to the region and it's been problematic for Somalia and countries that don't want to choose between the UAE on one side and Qatar on the other side. Turkey has also been involved on the commerce commercial side. They are doing some security assistance. As I said, it's a crowded space.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So extremist, Jihadist extremism, seems to be to be a growing problem on the continent.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Is that right? And if so, why is it happening and how much of a threat is it to Europe, to us?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah. We have to remember that Al-Qaeda's major attack was in Africa, right, against our embassies in Tanzania, in Kenya. But in the last couple decades, I think the problem has become more diverse, more geographically dispersed and more deadly.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "There are Al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates in West and East Africa and Southern Africa. We are seeing unaligned extremist groups like Boko Haram. The number of attacks that they are doing are increasing and I think the lethality of them are increasing.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Primarily against local targets. So in Nigeria, for example, according to a Council on Foreign Relations Database, 35,000 have died from Boko Haram in ISIS West Africa attacks or in conflict between those groups and the Nigerian military. In the Sahel, there's been a fivefold increase in deaths since 2016, 4,000 people.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So it's primarily African targets. But I just testified in front of the House, and what I said is that it's probably a low probability that they are going to attack the U.S. directly, but I think it has some significant impacts for us. First of all, it endangers our citizens that live in Africa and our economic investments. There was an attack by Al-Shabaab earlier this year, where they hit a Kenya military base, where the U.S. trains Kenyans and an American service person died and two contractors.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "They tried to attack our base in Somalia, as well. And Americans have been caught up in the hotel attacks and the mall attacks. There is a group affiliated with ISIS right near a huge L&G find in Mozambique. So it does threaten our interests about the people who live in Africa, our facilities and our economic investments.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It also, as it continues to fester, entangles us in very expensive peace keeping and humanitarian operations. So I think we need to be proactive when we think about that there is the secondary effects. And the last one is the more that extremist deepens and we are seen as less responsive, I think we lose the trust of our partners.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I mean, Macron made a very clear pitch that he felt like the U.S. wasn't there helping. Our African partners have said the same. And Russia, particularly, has rushed in to kind of find an opportunity here. So it's not a direct threat to the homeland, but a huge amount of sort of impacts downstream.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "What's behind the expansion of extremism on the continent?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah, I think partly it's a matter of governance and poor governance. And I think the affiliates, Al-Qaeda and ISIS have been sort of shopping for partners. I try to be very careful about talking about ISIS and AQ as if they're drivers because we don't want to lose the local elements. It's just as helpful for the local extremist group to work with Al-Qaeda and ISIS as it is vice versa.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So in a lot of cases, these groups existed already with local grievances and then they took on the name?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yes, yes, yeah. They take on the name and there is a back and forth between the network and the local group and the network doesn't always get what it wants. But I think that those relationships have improved recruitment, have improved some of the tactical and strategic efforts maybe even to help them, like, IEDs and other things.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So I think poor governance, the attraction of networking with these groups and then the most important part is government mistakes. There is a study by UNDP that looked at sort of extremists in Africa and 71% of militants, former militants, said they joined an extremist group because a family member or friend was abused, detained by the security forces.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So many of these African militaries make the wrong moves that push people further into the arms of the extremists. So those are a couple of the things that I would highlight is why we keep seeing this proliferation of these groups.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You talked earlier about the expansion of democracy. You talked earlier about poor governance, extremism now being a consequence of that poor governance. Is there a correlation or causation between a state being more democratic and the quality of its governance in Africa?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah. Oh, sorry, I thought you were going to go in a different direction. I thought you were going to as whether or not correlation between democracy and extremist activity, which there is actually some good evidence. On the democracy and the governance, I don't have the numbers. But my experience says that it depends, right? I mean, if you are a democratic state and you are being responsive to your citizens, then in theory, the governance will improve over time.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But in some cases, what happens is because the democracy, people are elected through (UNINTEL) networks, that you can actually use corruption to sort of focus on your own personal constituents, as opposed to the betterment of your total population. So you really have to go case by case to talk about, you know, where are all people benefiting versus people who are sort of in the circle of the President and the ruling party?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So Judd, I think this is a good place to switch to U.S. policy and maybe we'll finish up on this. U.S. policy toward the region. How would you characterize it? What's working? What's not? If", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "you could advise the President, what would you tell him?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah. You know, I think that our policy makers on Africa are stuck with the challenge of being asked to do less with less. And it's taken them a while to I think figure out how they are going to push policy. And I want to give them some credit because it's taken a little while, but I've been happy with some of the results, but just to kind of go back a little bit.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Like in many other parts of the world, we didn't have policy makers on Africa for a long time in Washington or in the field. And so, there was this period where it was really this unhappy marriage between Obama policies they weren't sure they were going to dismantle and Trump policies that hadn't been constructed yet. And so, you've got a lot of contractions. And then you had Tweets and other sorts of, you know, travel bans that made things worse.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And then President Trump's national security advisor, John Bolton, unveils the strategy, and this doesn't go off very well either because it's almost entirely about Russia and China. The Africans felt like they were not part of the strategy.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But in the last year, I've been pleased with the bureaucracy finding a way. They launched an economic initiative called Prosper Africa, it's a lot to go still, but it's a good step, right? It's addressing some of the challenges that the U.S. private sectors had in investing in Africa. They've kind of found their footing on democracy and governance, which isn't really in any of the strategy documents or speeches.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But sanctions now on election spoilers in Nigeria, on corrupt officials in Kenya, on people who are stopping the peace process in South Sudan. So those are positive. The big question in year four is: Where is the DOD going? And you may know there is a proposal in front of Secretary of Defense Esper about withdrawing maybe even completely our troops in Africa, about 6,000 people. They already had reduced West African forces about 10%. I think this is a really dangerous policy. I think it's reckless.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And they are there supporting local forces who are fighting extremists?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Local forces, yeah. And it's not just sort of the CT side of the house, they're building capacity for Africans to deal with security challenges and they're there at the request of African governments. And we are there in partnership with our European friends.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "And this has caused great anxiety amongst the global community that we may walk away from the continent. We have done this before and it wasn't very good. So you may know, Michael, that in the '90s, we dramatically reduced our presence in Africa. And then after 9/11 and the growing CT threat, we realized, actually, we need to be back. So reset those relationships.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Rebuild capacity. Reinvest in infrastructure. A lack of DOD presence is going to not only, you know, make us seem less committed to these challenges, but there are the other effects. Our", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "diplomats and our development officers depend on the military to get out to these hard-to-reach places.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I think our analysts are going to have a harder time understanding dynamics in Africa if there is less U.S. presence in these places. So I'm really concerned. I'm elated that the Hill has stepped up. Senator Graham, Senator Coons, a number of people on the House side have said this is a bad idea. And hopefully, Secretary Esper will decide not to do this.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah. And if we're not there, who fills the vacuum?", "label": 1}

Oh, no I don't have 'em -- he's still copying 'em. Dr. Phil: OK. You can come back. Mark Castellano: Sorry, I thought he brought them back but he didn't. Dr. Phil: You said you were gonna show those to us and you got up and walked to the door -- and then said, Oh, that's right, they're not here. But not 15 minutes before we got here, you told my producer they weren't here. You already knew they weren't here when you got up to get 'em. Mark Castellano: My mind is scatterbrained right now.

Mark Castellano: I mean, as far as everybody has exhausted the leads that I have. I don't know where else to go. The police are looking for her. They're professionals. Dr. Phil: Did you do anything to her that would be considered foul play or criminal? Mark Castellano: No, no. Dr. Phil: Did you kill her? Mark Castellano: No, sir.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "This was it. This was it, Waters told Smith. We had no evidence, we had nothing.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So, Detective Waters started looking for motive. If Castellano was a killer, did something push him over the edge?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Det. Waters: Pressure's building? Mark Castellano: The pressure's building on me, yes. When she gets mad, she's violent. She'll hit you, she thinks she has the right to ... you know, the man has to take up crap. She's a pretty girl and she gets everything she wants. She has that princess attitude.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "That princess attitude phrase was a flag for detectives -- an insight into how Castellano viewed the relationship:", "label": 1}

When she gets mad she's violent I don't care what anybody she says, she is. I said something about you take too many pills, you can't watch Cayden or something. She's like, I can't tolerate Cayden.

{"sentence": "Everyone we talked to, not just family members, described her as a loving mother, said Harris.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Was there any evidence that Michelle was abusive to Mark?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Not anything that was documented ... other than Marks story, Waters replied.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "After his confession, Castellano is left alone with his phone. Instead of calling a lawyer, he called his parents: Hey Mom. Well, I confessed. I did it.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "Castellano had also told Detective Waters what happened moments after he killed Michelle -- as he stood over her body, lying on the bed.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "He said that Cayden walked in and said, 'What's wrong with Mommy?' Waters said. And he turned around and his response was, 'Mommy's taking a nap.'", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "How did he get her out of the building? Smith asked Waters.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "He packaged her up in a large container, plastic container, and duct taped her hands and feet, put a bag over her head, he replied. He explained he put a bag over her head 'cause he was tired of looking at her.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "It turned out Michelle's body was somewhere out in the endless West Texas oil fields. Castellano had drawn a map and given police a rough idea of where the grave was. But it wasn't a good enough description. The key to finding Michelle's body was as close as an iPhone.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Harris and Walters stayed in Houston with Castellano, while local police and FBI agents tried to locate Michelle's body with the map. But it only got them in the general vicinity.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So they called us in the interview room and we decided to try the FaceTime, said Harris.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "FaceTime is the Apple iPhone's video phone app. You can see and hear whatever the person on the other end of the line wants to show you.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "Just walking around aiming it, said Smith.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Correct. And so they panned the area and then he told them to stop and he directed 'em towards - it was like more of a big scrub brush, Harris said. When they got closer, that's when the FBI agent -- we could hear her say, 'I found her, I found her.'", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "With the discovery of Michelle's body, Castellano was finally arrested and charged with murder eight days after she went missing.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "From the start, Mark Castellano had told everyone lies. So 48 Hours' Correspondent Tracy Smith wanted to set the ground rules before their interview.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So here's the thing Mark. You lied to the cops, you lied to Dr. Phil, you lied to your parents ... why should we believe you now? Smith asked.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "What's the -- there's no point to lie about anything, Castellano replied. I don't like lying. I don't like lying at all. It's not me. I'd rather just go ahead and tell the truth and get it over with.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Are you telling me the truth now? Smith asked.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yes. Of course I'm telling you the truth, he said.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The first thing Castellano wanted to tell 48 Hours was that he was not a murderer.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "We got into a fight it just - it just happened all wrong, he told Smith. It wasn't, you know, not my finest hour.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Why do you say that? Smith asked.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Well, I mean the whole thing wasn't my finest hour, Castellano replied.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "He says yes, it was true -- the couple had a fight that night, but he was the victim.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Asked if it got violent, Castellano said, Oh yeah, they always get violent. She beats the hell out of me. ...I've been beaten by this woman for a long time.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But this time Castellano says he'd had enough. Remember - there's never been an official report of abuse in this case.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So, did you just snap? Smith asked.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "...to, to retaliate back from her swinging at me? Yeah, he replied. I snapped or hit her back ... this time I was tired of being hit ... and yeah, then I was gonna defend myself this time around.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So you threw stuff back and forth and then you grabbed her, said Smith.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I didn't grab her yet. She threw another punch at me, Castellano said. That's when I grabbed her and lunged forward.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "This is where Castellano's story changes from his confession to police:", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Mark Castellano to Det. Waters: I grabbed her and I broke her neck.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "That's what we're not going to talk about, Castellano's lawyer interrupted, telling him not to reveal all of what happened that night.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Still, he did tell 48 Hours a few details. Castellano now says it was all an accident. In the struggle, he says, Michelle died when he ended up falling on top of her neck.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Michelle's death was my fault because ... I'm the one that fell on her, said Castellano.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "That fell on her, Smith repeated.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yes, I did fall on her. I mean, she just, like that, I mean she was just lifeless, Castellano said, snapping his head back. And all of a sudden you know, her body let go ... and it was an accident.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Michelle's mother, Donna Malone, can barely contain her disgust.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "First of all, I will never believe it was just an accident, she said. You just don't on accident murder someone and feel nothing.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "When you drive a car and you hit somebody, did you want to hit them, no. You're like, 'It was an accident. ...' You might be at someone's house and they just had brand new carpet put in and you're eating velvet cake and you dropped in on the floor. Did you want to do it, no. Do you feel bad about it, yes. But still, accidents are still accidents, they are not planned. That's why they're called accidents, Castellano went on, shedding a tear.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "That tear was the only time during the interview that Castellano showed any emotion.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "He's a liar, Malone said. Comparing it to spilling cake on someone's floor? To murder someone, that's a violent act.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Did you choke her? Smith asked Castellano.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "No, I didn't choke her, he replied.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "But you said you were angry.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You said you snapped, Smith continued.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Yeah, and to go ahead and actually raise my hands against her, Castellano said. I had a gun. I've always had a 9mm. If I really wanted to kill Michelle, I would have shot her. ...I would have taken my gun and shot her.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "That he could just have shot her if he wanted to kill her, that's just nonsense talk. It's nonsense, said Malone.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "What did you do with Michelle's body, Smith asked.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Ummm, it stayed, it stayed, ummm, it stayed in the closet. You know ... I looked at her and it was just like 'Oh, my god.' So that's when I put the bag over her head and I put her in the closet.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Why the bag over her head? Smith asked.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Because, just her face -- the way it was frozen, Castellano told Smith. I knew I messed up.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Did it occur to you as you were handling her body that this was the woman that you loved? That this was the mother of your child? Smith pressed.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I did I did. And I also know I couldn't bring her back, he said.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Three days later, Castellano would dump Michelle's lifeless body in that shallow grave.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Asked how he feels about misleading people for so long, Castellano told Smith, Well, it was a tough call. ...It was a very tough call. ...I didn't plan on getting away with this. If I had planned on getting away with this, I would have gotten away with it.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I feel very angry about the fact that Mark lied to all of us. He could have just told the truth from the beginning. It was obvious that everyone was onto him -- family, law enforcement. Why not just tell the truth, get it over with, said Malone.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "She did attack me first, Castellano told Smith.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The more Mark Castellano talked, the more it seemed he was angry with women.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I mean that's just a fact. Women are now -- y'all are replacing men in a lot of aspects. Ya'll are becoming big time aggressors, he said. Women are now the new aggressors.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "She was beautiful, and you're a beautiful woman yourself. Life's a little easier for women like you, because people can't put bad things with pretty people, Castellano continued.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It sounds like you resent that a little bit, Mark, Smith commented.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Well, when you sit there and have been told that when you're are not a pretty person, that, ya know, life's gonna suck for you... he replied.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Mark Castellano's bizarre answers during 48 Hours' jailhouse interview raised more questions about what makes him tick. So we wanted to talk more about it with Dr. Phil McGraw.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Mark Castellano to Tracy Smith: I gotta say I really screwed myself over the way I confessed everything. And because, first of all, I didn't really describe everything accurately, and second of all, I didn't really think every word was going to be used completely out of context, which it was in a lot of ways.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "He's criticizing the process. Things were taken out of context. Here's the context: did you kill her? Or did you not? I think this guy has such an inferiority complex and that's one of the things about narcissism. There's a false sense of superiority, but it's a false sense of superiority, McGraw said as he and Smith watched the interview.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The truth is, they really feel inferior, said Smith.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "They really feel very inferior, very put upon. And he felt very much that he had reached above his level with Michelle, said McGraw.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "That she was out of his league, so to speak, Smith noted.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Out of his league. She was way over his head. In this instance, she did not reject him. He had the ultimate rejection of her, said McGraw.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "What do you think his motive was? Smith asked.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I think this guy is very hedonistic, McGraw replied. I think this relationship was on the down slope. I think it was falling apart. And I think he felt her slipping away. ...I think it was one of those situations where, 'If I can't have you, nobody will.'", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "At his trial, Castellano's attorneys will present his new version of what he says is the truth. Will the jury buy it?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "It was very hard to wait on the trial. We wanted some form of justice for Michelle, Donna Malone, said. We felt that we were building up to this pinnacle ... that would bring us some sort of peace.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "May 27, 2014. Mark Castellano is on trial for the murder of Michelle Warner, the mother of their son, Cayden.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "This is a case about obsession, rage, and this defendant's calculated attempts to get away with murder, Assistant District Attorney Jamie Reyna told the court in her opening. He became so upset with Michelle, that he grabbed her by the neck ... that he started to choke her, he started to squeeze her neck. You'll hear him tell those officers he choked her for one-and-a-half to two minutes.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "...she comes at him, he grabs her, he's controlling her and he falls down with his weight on hers and hears a pop. When he reached out to defend himself to protect himself. He didn't anticipate that she would fall down and break her neck, defense attorney Eric Davis told jurors.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "An expert for the defense, a forensic engineer, testifies Castellano's accident story was a possibility.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "I didn't find any real evidence that the throat was disturbed, John Charles Laughlin testified. There's no physical evidence that shows any type of squeezing or sideways forces. All of the physical evidence shows is forces applied from the front.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So what's the detectives' reaction to Castellano's defense?", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Is that possible that he fell on her and that's how her neck snapped? Smith asked Sgt. Brian Harris.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The problem is that you cannot accidentally strangle someone for a minute-and-a half to two minutes, said Det. Fil Waters.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Show me what you think he did, what he told you he did to Michelle. What did he do? Smith asked Harris.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "He's so mad he follows her in the bedroom and he goes and whatever takes place, he reaches out and he's just grabbing her, for a minute-and-a-half or two. He's grabbing her, grabbing her, and she has nowhere to go, said Harris.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "If Castellano thought the jury might take pity on him, prosecutors would present more evidence that shows the actions of a cold, callous killer.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "Weeks after Castellano's confession, detectives discovered a chilling piece of surveillance video taken by a camera on a building located across from his apartment.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The video showed a shadowy view of the back stairs of Castellano's apartment.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "So he drags her body in a bin down the stairs, Smith said of the video, which shows a figure dragging something.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "You see him stop. He has worn himself out, Waters explained. He even says when he's on the phone with people he's confessing to, 'You know, Michelle had gained a lot of weight.' So it was really an exercise to bring her down the steps and put her in the car.", "label": 1}

He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities.

He also backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's leadership challenge against then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016. O'Rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust Cruz in 2018. His robust Senate bid in Texas -- along with his Obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas -- including the state's large and growing Latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. No Democrat had come that close to winning a Senate race in Texas since 1988. Despite the loss, O'Rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. Although he told 60 Minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, O'Rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea.

He also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship. During a fiery speech in El Paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, O'Rourke condemned Mr. Turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border.

After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994.

Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels.

The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.

What investigators discovered next put Jennifer's estranged 51-year-old husband on the top of the list of suspects. That's when his girlfriend Michelle Troconis became a person of interest as well.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "After Fotis Dulos gave investigators his cellphone, they discovered that he had been on Albany Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut, the night that Jennifer went missing. As they collected surveillance footage of the area, they saw a man who looked like Fotis Dulos dropping off black bags in trash cans on the street. And a woman seen leaning out of his truck appeared to be Michelle Troconis. What investigators later found in those bags convinced them they had Jennifer's killer: zip ties coated with human blood and Jennifer Dulos' DNA, two ponchos covered with copious amounts of blood and more DNA belonging to Jennifer Dulos. As lead investigator Sergeant Ken Ventresca of the Connecticut State police later said, It's not every day someone throws out bloody evidence, bloody clothes, you know, cut up. I mean who does that?", "label": 1}

Seven months later, in January 2020, when investigators still could not locate Jennifer Dulos, they charged her husband with murder and upgraded Troconis' charges to conspiracy to commit murder. Kent Mawhinney, a friend and sometime lawyer for Fotis Dulos, was also charged with conspiracy to commit murder. All three pleaded not guilty. Just weeks later, Fotis Dulos was dead after taking his own life.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "The death of Fotis Dulos left Michelle Troconis in a precarious legal position, says her attorney, Jon Schoenhorn. I think the right expression here is, 'she's left holding the bag.'

Many people point to it as a cause for not just the increased spending we've seen but things like the lobbying that has watered down the Volcker Rule. Much of it was pursued by JPMorgan Chase. So lobbyists do have their thumb on the scale and it's a growing problem in Washington. And it's contributed to a lot of the frustration that people feel at home, the sense that Washington isn't working. Lobbyists are an important reason -- part of the reason why.", "label": 2}

The question is, is it not just about asking regulators what went wrong but bringing members of JPMorgan Chase and of course this is all complicated by the fact that JPMorgan Chase has been the responsible bank and they've been powerfully arguing against regulation, against the Volcker Rule. Well, that argument is going to be a lot tougher to make going forward as we find out this loss isn't two billion as they said last week, but now four billion perhaps or higher.

Take this story on the front page of today's Washington Post. Quote Iran unable to sell oil stores it on tankers. Literally they're storing it on tankers, turning off the GPS on the tankers so that -- because it's against maritime law to do so because they don't want anyone to know where the tankers are (INAUDIBLE) they're trying to sail into ports and just find anyone to buy their oil.

The Associated Press obtained this from a government that is skeptical of Iran's honesty in its nuclear program and they say this is a chamber used for testing explosives for nuclear weapons. We did make some calls today and experts said indeed this would be consistent with that, but we haven't independently verified the source government.

I think that the -- frankly, the Mexican government needs to stand up and stop blaming the United States for arming them.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "They have -- they need to address the issue of the cartel that say they have in Mexico and certainly we work very closely with foreign governments to stop the illegal flow of weapons in any direction.

I think that the efforts that our government is doing to stop that flow is commendable because our agents work very hard to stop that flow of weapons into Mexico.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "BURNETT: Jay, do you think it's fair to say that the biggest threat to the United States could be from our southern border, whether from drug wars or from other terrorist organizations? You know, I was in Laos a year ago and a Mexican drug dealer had been with someone I was with doing a deal for drugs coming from southeast Asia, so it's certainly more than Colombian cocaine now.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "AHERN: Sure it is. But, I think, Erin, let's put a couple of things in perspective. Certainly when you aggregate the amount of cartel deaths, again action 47,000 or 50,000, it's more than any other loss of life anywhere else on the globe so that poses a significant threat.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Let's also focus on some of the facts that occurred the last few years as well. When you take a look at the apprehensions along the Mexican border coming into the United States, last fiscal year was 340,000.

That's not to say that 300,000 is an adequate number to apprehend, we need to do better. But I think the key to continue to make sure we protect the country is to continue the strategy of not only controlling our own border, but Mexico needs to control the borders coming into their country from Central and South America where all of those drugs originate.", "label": 2}

One of the main effects immediately it's going to have to Greece is that the country will run out of money.

{"sentence": "The other impact Greece crashing out of the euro may have is the impact of contagion. If Greece crashes out of the single currency, what's to stop other debt-laden economies like Ireland, like Spain, like Portugal, like Italy from doing exactly the same thing? Up until now, this big European project of getting all these countries together, these diverse countries together, diverse economies together and bringing them all under the umbrella of a single currency has been something that's really dominated European politics. If that ends, if Greece exits the euro, that whole project comes to an end and it potentially puts the European Union and the cohesion of the European Union under threat.", "label": 2}

I mean, if private equity really is bad, if it does more harm than good, it's free to operate in the Obama administration. President Obama isn't proposing to do anything to restrict private equity.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "MICHAEL WALDMAN, BRENNAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE, NYU: Well, I think that part of this is in a sense kind of a brush-back pitch.

And this is saying, you know, when one thing when Governor Romney talks, he talks about success and we ought not penalize success.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "And to a lot of people the way he says it sounds a little smug.

{"sentence": "But I think, you know, this is not even an economic ad. This is an attempt by the Obama camp to draw an early contrast to define the candidate further as a person. It is a personal attack, a personal characterization about values underlying the economy, rather than anything aiming to provide a prescription for how to solve this problem. BURNETT: Speaking of how the president wants to be seen. So, today, he gave the commencement address at Barnard College. And I watched it, and I watched the introduction to him. It's very laudatory. This is a women's college.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So, David, we know he's trying to build a case to get women's votes. But at best it split. CBS poll came out today, Mitt Romney is leading among women 46 to 44 percent. I want to emphasize that's within the margin of error, but still.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "FRUM: You know, it's kind of a screwy poll, I have to say. Among other things, one of the questions it asks, are you less likely to vote for the president because of his stance on same-sex marriage.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Well, they have 43 percent of Americans saying I'm less likely, even though Republicans disapprove of the president 90-10. So, they've gone from saying, I will absolutely never vote for the president, too. I will double absolutely never vote for the president.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "I don't know how meaningful that is. I wonder the gender gap is usually about 10 points. So if it's shrunk to two, that is true. That would be colossal news. It's also possible the polls make mistakes.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "BURNETT: Well, and we have many polls coming out everyday.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "AVLON: I do get the sense, as David does, that this is a bit of an outlier. That said, it could be on the leading ledge of the other shoe dropping with the regard to the political consequences of the president's decision to back gay marriage.

{"sentence": "BURNETT: And one thing that could make you very nervous, Michael Waldman, is what came out of this same poll in terms of independents. Mitt Romney now leads independents, according to the CBS poll, by 43 percent to 36 percent. That's well -- that's no margin of error.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "WALDMAN: Well, again, if the numbers for women or the numbers for independents on election day are on this poll, then it's president- elect Romney. But it is a bit of an outlier. The one bit of good news for President Obama in that poll, interestingly, was that independents and women and young people were more likely to be supportive of the president's stance on same-sex marriage than other voters.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "You never know entirely -- it's true. This could play out in a bad way for him or in a good way. Remember during the 1960 campaign -- we all read about, I should stress, wasn't actually playing attention then. We read about John F. Kennedy's outreach to Martin Luther King's family and the kind of surprising impact that that had.

{"sentence": "17 days later, as recovery operations were getting established, a 7.3 magnitude quake caused further destruction.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "In the desolation, chaos and widespread panic that followed, a surge in child trafficking was inevitable. Just as it was after the 2004 tsunami in southern Asia, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the 2011 drought in Horn of Africa, the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines, and many other natural disasters besides.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "So why do these disasters make children so vulnerable to trafficking – and what can be done about it?", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "UNICEF defines child trafficking as the act of recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation either within or outside a country.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "The exploitation of trafficked children can take many forms – forced prostitution, labor, marriage, militia, domestic servitude and more – but nearly always means dirty and dangerous work for little or no pay, often involving sexual abuse and enforcement through threat and violence.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "According to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the most common form of human trafficking (79%) is trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "In Nepal, as in other developing countries, birth registration is poorly enforced, making children difficult or impossible to track in any system.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "People living with poverty are especially vulnerable to the false promise of a better future, and in an economy that depends heavily on dividends from migrating workers, desperation can lead people to consider risky opportunities.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Families are often enticed by the offer of well-paid work for their child in another region or country.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "They may even be given an advance against the child's anticipated earnings, and trafficked children hope to improve their lives and send money back to their families. But when they arrive at their destination, they find that the situation is very different.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "In most poor societies, it's the girls who are more readily taken out of school (or never sent in the first place). Parents may believe that education is wasted on a girl whose destiny is to marry and leave home.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "That leaves them open to persuasion that the opportunity to go away and gain life experience is in their daughter's best interests. Girls – especially those with disabilities or from ethnic minorities or certain castes – are therefore particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "A 2001 estimate suggested that 12,000 girls are trafficked from Nepal to India annually for prostitution, a horror highlighted in the book and movie Sold.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "This number took no account of any other trafficking from or within Nepal. Current estimates put the annual total at around 20,000.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "It's easy to see how a natural disaster can amplify the conditions that enable and attract traffickers. The immediate disruption of state and civil society institutions, particularly schools, means the usual child protection systems aren't in place. Regulatory mechanisms and border controls are also in chaos.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Under the cover of rescue efforts, traffickers (often women) can pose as religious leaders, relief workers or representatives of government-accredited employment agencies promising jobs.

{"sentence": "Children separated from their families may be believed missing or dead. The assumption, genuine or otherwise, that a child is an orphan makes them especially vulnerable. Sadly some families even send their children to orphanages because they can't afford to care for them.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Less than two months after the Nepal quakes, UNICEF reported that 245 children had been intercepted and saved from trafficking. That number has shocking implications for how many might not have been so lucky. Dr Tshering Lama of ChildReach Nepal recently estimated that hundreds if not thousands of children will have been trafficked as a direct result of conditions caused by the earthquakes.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "In the direct aftermath, UNICEF worked in collaboration with the Nepali government on a range of responsive and preventative measures, and with civil society and a number of national and international NGOs to prioritize getting children back into school as quickly as possible.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "A fundamental strategy to fighting child trafficking in Nepal is to keep children in schools, protecting their right to education and a safe environment.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Campaigns such as Taught Not Trafficked, working in partnership with survivors' group Shakti Samuha, promote crucial awareness and have been providing education, shelter, legal aid, vocational training and counseling before, during and after the period of the quakes.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "But more than that, it's essential that child trafficking everywhere is not treated as a symptom of crisis during times of natural disasters.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "It must be recognized as a scourge that requires coordinated international action, including advocacy and awareness integrated across all programs that work with vulnerable children and their families and communities. In this way, agencies will be prepared to respond quickly and effectively when – not if – the next disaster strikes.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Not surprisingly, that boy I longed for from across the way never reciprocated. He had probably never heard of Valentine's Day or more likely of me, despite all my doleful staring. As a middle-class Pakistani girl from a conservative family, I was not allowed to speak to boys, let alone fall in love with them. I didn't let this keep me from either, pursuing both love and forbidden conversations with boys with great resourcefulness and assiduity.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "I fell in love with the boy who dropped his telephone number in my lap through the open car window while my mother was not looking. I fell in love with a boy whom I beat in a debate competition and the boy who called several evenings in a row demanding to speak to a different Bollywood character each time. Some reciprocated my feelings; most had little clue about Valentine's Day unless I told them.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Of course, they also did not really know me. Falling in love in those pre-Instagram, pre-cell phone days was understood as a mysterious matter, where facts and the onerous getting to know each other played little part. Some of this was understandable. Where marriage was a matter of careful arrangement, love had to be left wild and chaotic, without being hemmed in by the constraints of data or some similar bubble-bursting encumbrance.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Things have changed in Pakistan. Not only is Valentine's Day a pretty big deal now – there are specials at florists and displays at stationery shops and tinsel-wrapped candy everywhere – the encroachment of the semi-arranged marriage, on the realm between love and arranged marriage, seems to have altered the path and pattern of both. These semi-arranged marriages, particularly popular among the growing urban middle class, seek to add a little of love's mystery to the once standard arranged marriage, whose closely chaperoned interactions leave little room for romance and where the two being wed do not know each other at all.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "In the semi-arranged marriage, there may be room for a few solo coffee dates. And the newly paired duo can announce to their friends that they are in love, while their parents can insist that the match was entirely arranged. In other words, parents can find possible spouses who meet a certain combined checklist of qualities identified by both the bride or groom-to-be and the parents. Veto power, however, lies with the young couple.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Added volume to the Valentine's Day business comes from the virtual realm that has made most everything including love and/or marriage a competitive sport. Cheaply available cell phones are everywhere in Pakistan, and nearly all are equipped with social media, such that everyone can see the presents that those in love are bestowing on one another.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "In addition, celebrating Valentine's Day gives the upwardly mobile urban couple's love the legitimacy of individual choice – with roses, chocolates and jewelry adding a bit of luster to the worn and antiquated patina of an arranged marriage. If the celebration is attended to with some gusto, even an entirely arranged match can be passed off as one in which the parties fell in love without any machinations of their aunt or uncle or the neighbor lady-turned-matchmaker who lives three doors down.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Even in rural Pakistan, where marriages are still generally arranged and love is a separate realm, Valentine's Day is now a known, if not openly, celebrated quantity. Where trysts between lovers can be arranged via the ubiquitous cell phone, any excuse to meet in the sugarcane field – including Valentine's Day – is used. Men and women who may have to endure spouses chosen by mothers, fathers and the village council, one theory goes, are especially entitled to a bit of fun on the side.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "Love in Pakistan may seem like a tale from a very distant elsewhere, but one could argue that the slightly waning popularity of Valentine's Day here (or at least the cynicism that hangs over some) is for reasons remarkably similar, if reverse, from those seen in Pakistan.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "While Pakistanis may have moved from the arranged to the semi-arranged sort of marriage, Americans have moved from the love by accidental chance or serendipity to a more calculated – if not algorithmic-driven – sort of love. In the data-driven, virtually-infused and forever-impatient realm of finding a partner, social media and the internet provide a ton of information faster than the spark of attraction.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "For those actively and intentionally looking for love, a dizzying array of apps, many with the ability to match a staggering set of data points – looks, income, language, location – can help with pairing with far greater precision than the most enterprising set of Pakistani parents. In some, bucket lists and credit reports can be exchanged even before the trouble of a first meeting. Why waste a couple of hours when artificial intelligence can tally up the possibility of true love using hundreds of variables? Mystery is the enemy here and data is the friend; love is made (like Valentine's Day) utterly predictable.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "In Pakistan, the United States and likely anywhere on our data-driven globe, the role of Valentine's Day is changing. In the West, marketing departments of dating apps can rely on the fact that many more will sign up for their love-on-demand services on or around that day. In Pakistan, even those betrothed who have spoken barely a sentence to each other will send cards, flowers and chocolates.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "Marriage therapy only works if both partners are committed to the process. But by the time some couples schedule an appointment, one or both partners has already checked out.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Below, marriage therapists around the country share seven reasons to head to therapy sooner than later.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "1. Struggling alone does you no favors.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The average couple that comes in for therapy has been struggling for about six years. This means they've been unhappy for much longer than they needed to be. One reason to get into therapy early is to get ahead of the curve and address issues before they become problems. ― Zach Brittle, a therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forBetter", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "2. Solvable problems may escalate to entrenched, bitter hurts.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Couples who reach out earlier for support when things are amiss often head off a caustic, ugly pattern of hurting each other in ways that are hard to forget or forgive. Marriage therapists should be able to help partners identify the ways they express themselves when they are hurt or angry and to recognize how they may unintentionally put their partners on the defensive.― Linda Lipshutz, a psychotherapist in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "3. Asking tough questions now will save you a world of hurt later.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In my opinion, the ideal time for couple's therapy is pre-engagement. Like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. When you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that's when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. So many of the issues I see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: People who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. Couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. Couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. A few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you're signing up for. ― Ryan Howes, a psychologist in Pasadena, California", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "4. You lose empathy for your spouse the longer you stay bitter.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "When issues remain unresolved, resentment can create a large and ugly divide between two people. This often manifests as lack of empathy, disinterest and at times, even disrespect. Go to therapy before arguments seem insurmountable because one or both of you have become apathetic. ― Talia Wagner, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "5. The earlier you nip problems in the bud, the better.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "I'd say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. That means they'll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. Couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. Therapy can help you prioritize 'repair,' or staying connected over 'resolution,' which is often out of reach. ― Zach Brittle", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "6. Crisis is a horrible time to work on things.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "I often share a folksy old saying with my clients: 'It's best to fix the roof when the sun's shining.' We all know that when we're in the midst of crisis we make hasty, impulsive decisions that strive for immediate safety instead of long-term sustainability. Maybe you've noticed the relationship is strained every time a partner has a job change and you see a new career shift on the horizon. The wise choice may be to go to counseling now, when things are still calm, to learn tools to cope with the changes. It's OK to go to counseling when things seem 'fine' so that you are more resilient when they aren't. Even the strongest marriages will encounter tough times eventually, and it's good to be equipped when they come. ― Ryan Howes", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "7. And ultimately, life is too short to be miserable in your marriage.", "label": 4}

I imagined that they were thinking, This family therapist is crazy. But I was pretty sure I was right.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Let me explain: Marriage, or any duet or intimate partnership needs plenty of caring, lots of tolerance and acceptance and enough humor to take the edge off. But a pattern of too much politeness or caution in one or both partners kills the spark, and pretty soon the marriage is limping along, barely alive, or, sometimes, so turbulent that it can break apart.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "A recent couples' session illustrates this dynamic:", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Beth and Larry, a mid-30's couple with two young daughters, came to see me on the verge of divorce. At least, Beth is on the verge of divorcing her mild-mannered husband. From the first visit, Beth was large and in-charge. This attractive woman, who runs a child-developement center, indicated that she felt let down by Larry in every way. He was no longer affectionate with her, he argued with her over what she considered petty things, and Beth had begun making plans to, as she put it, work on becoming effective co-parents-i.e., she was giving up on the marriage. This was her second marriage, by the way.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Beth fell for Larry shortly after she left a really turbulent relationship with her bi-polar-ish first husband. Beth felt responsible for him, and said she hung on much longer than she should have. Devastated and emotionally drained following her break-up, this handsome, capable and calm Larry felt like just the ticket. They dated for several years, during which time they each pursued professional degrees. Beth remembered that they fought rather intensely during periods of separation from each other, but had long months where they enjoyed a close and loving connection.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In the sessions, the most striking quality of this couple is Larry's reticence with Beth. He's a really smart guy, thoughtful, a well-regarded environmental specialist, but he seems dumb with his wife. While she threatens to give him the boot, he looks unruffled. But he's clearly hurt, and at our initial meeting he acknowledged not being able to sleep because of worry that Beth would leave.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "At our last session, I wondered about Larry's quiet demeanor. This followed my umpteenth observation that Larry appears to be a caring, engaged guy who loves his family and wants to make things better. That's worth a lot. When I asked Larry what keeps him so polite with Beth, he responded, I'm afraid of offending her. She easily gets offended. On a roll now, he described how he had been sleeping on the couch for a couple of years-!-because his wife was committed to co-sleeping with the kids. He didn't like the idea, he wanted his bed-and his wife-back, but, according to him, she became offended when he tried to bring this up. Wow!", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "This was the problem with these well-meaning people in a nutshell. When Beth gets upset, or fights Larry on an idea, he withdraws. I'm not sure if he's protecting himself or her, but my guess is that it's a bit of both. And even though Beth says she wants a relationship of equals with two strong voices, she has a subtle way of appearing to be the expert. She says she wants an equal, but a real equal partnership will challenge her status as exclusive expert, especially on the kids. I'm not sure she's ready for that.", "label": 4}

It is more than simple math … Differences in money management and unspoken rules about how it is discussed (or not) can lead to significant friction or fracture in a relationship.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "If you're concerned that debt will ruin your relationship, know that's not necessarily the case. It depends on how you and your partner handle it together.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "When it comes to couples with debt, the money alone is not the root cause of relationship problems. It's the pressure and conflict that often arises from dealing with that debt that can bring to light other issues in the relationship.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Debt can serve a stand-alone stressor, but when superimposed on other relational strain can amplify problems in a relationship, Lere said. Issues such as secrecy about spending, disagreements on how to handle finances and varying levels of comfort carrying a balance can all be sources of tension.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "That's because money also is a sort of emotional currency in relationships. It can be a vehicle for communicating certain messages that are not being put into words between two people. When misused, money can be a bid for power, control or punishment. Spending can also be used as a stand-in for other unmet needs.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Amy Rollo, a psychotherapist and owner of Heights Family Counseling in Houston, agreed. As a couples therapist, it is actually rare for money stress to be the biggest issue. For most couples, it is difficulty managing conflict, feeling disconnected, trust issues, commitment difficulties or an inability to create shared meaning in their relationship that causes the most distress, she said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "While some couples may view debt as a deal breaker, Rollo said that for most, it's dishonesty. I've had several clients present to couples counseling because they feel deceived by their partner. They share they did not realize their partner's debt burden until they were already married or engaged, Rollo said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Lere put it this way: Money is rarely just about numbers. For a couple to solve financial issues that may be leading to strain in the relationship, they need to develop insight into their own relationships with money and figure out the psychological reasons behind the mismanagement.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Additionally, Lere said that the circumstances and spirit under which the debt was accumulated can color the impact it has on a couple. If a disproportionate amount of debt belongs to one person (whether it was accumulated before or during the relationship), it can lead to feelings of resentment if the repayment requires deep sacrifice of a partner.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "PeopleImages via Getty Images Money is rarely just about numbers, said psychologist Joy Lere. But it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "That's not to say that dealing with a massive amount of debt isn't stressful on its own. Debt is a major burden that makes it difficult to spend on activities and shared goals as a couple. But when it comes to the relationship, it shouldn't be something that tears you apart unless there are other factors, such as communication and coping skills, that need some work, too.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In my work with couples, I've found debt can negatively impact a relationship, but doesn't have to, said Brent Sweitzer, a marriage counselor in Cumming, Georgia. Family therapist Virginia Satir famously said, 'Problems are not the problem. It's the coping.' I see this truth play out daily in couple interactions and communications.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "After all, higher levels of debt ― particularly student loan debt ― are becoming the norm for millennials entering relationships and starting families, according to Sweitzer. What seems to make the difference for couples that are able to navigate it successfully and even get closer through managing debt is how they communicate about it, he said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Communication Is More Than Just Talking", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "When you get down to it, the root of most problems between couples is communication. If debt is placing undue stress on you or your partner and it's leading to conflict, there's a good chance that your communication about the problem needs some work ― or isn't happening at all.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "However, Sweitzer points out that communication is much more than simply airing your grievances to each other. It's seeking to understand the other person and the many factors that shaped them, he said. For instance, how did the person with the debt get in that situation in the first place? What did they learn from childhood about managing money and the ethics of debt? Did they learn to cope with emotional difficulties by spending, by depriving themself?", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "If both people can seek to understand, they can both feel understood, Sweitzer said. Then debt could be a catalyst for connecting at a deeper level and uncovering solutions to problems that each person wouldn't have come up with on their own.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Debt Can Make Or Break A Relationship", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "To say that debt is ever a blessing is probably a huge stretch. However, it can serve as a tool for helping couples learn how to work together.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "For couples who are honest from the start, the debt might not be a big deal or it can even be something that strengthens the couple, Rollo said. You can join forces to tackle the debt and really feel like you're on the same team, working toward a larger goal.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "However, if you struggle to see finances in the same way, or have different values when it comes to money, it can be helpful to work with a couples therapist. Counseling can help each person learn how to express their needs, while also providing validation and empathy for their partner's needs and viewpoint, according to Rollo. The way we view money can be such a personal thing … this is why it is important for each partner to really get to the root with empathy and respect, she said.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "1. Check what HR policies are in place.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Your workplace is just that: a workplace, not a bar or a dating app for download. None of the HR experts we spoke to encouraged actively looking for love at the office, but they acknowledged it happens. And while it's less common for businesses to enforce or even have a non-fraternization policy, it's still important to determine if your company has one, said Teresa Marzolph, founder of Culture Engineered, a human capital consulting firm in Phoenix.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The few policies still in existence often focus on relationships that put the company as risk, such as a romantic relationship between a manager and their employee, or one that runs contrary to the checks and balances that exist within the company ― like quality assurance and customer service or finance and sales, Marzolph told HuffPost.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "If no guidelines exist, Marzolph recommends gauging the workplace culture around you: Have you heard of other office relationships developing in the past? Does the company encourage after-hours camaraderie among the staff?", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "A company that sponsors or hosts non-work events and activities may be an example of a culture that's much more tolerant or even supportive of relationships in the workplace, Marzolph said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Avoid going from zero to 100 by establishing a friendship first, said Lynn Taylor, a workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior & Thrive in Your Job. This way, you'll find out early on whether you have anything in common besides mutual disgust of your boss' Tupperware lunches.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Establish a foundation and find out if you're compatible, personality-wise, Taylor said. Then, take cues. Gauge your next actions off the responses you generally receive from the person.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Take some of the stress out of the situation by suggesting a casual location for your date, said Neely Steinberg, a dating coach and image consultant.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Coffee is usually a good suggestion because it's low key and really, who doesn't like coffee? Steinberg said. Plus, it may be perceived as a friend thing as opposed to an actual 'date.' If you're not getting a good romantic vibe, you can always just chalk it up to a friendly co-worker coffee.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "4. When you do ask, don't make it weird.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "In the 12 years Marzolph has worked in human resources, sexual harassment complaints have almost always been about how someone went about asking, not the fact that they had asked.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The common theme is that the interaction left one person feeling uncomfortable, she told us. Whether intended or not, most filing a claim or complaint describe the pursuing employee's approach as awkward or inappropriate.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "To avoid becoming an office-wide pariah, be mindful of your surroundings and your body language when floating the idea of a date, Marzolph said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Don't come on too strong or corner the person, and ideally, approach them outside of work or in the communal area, Marzolph said. Try to keep your approach light; be ready to give the person an easy out if they're not interested, so you both can continue working together without tension.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "5. If they say 'no,' maintain professionalism throughout the experience.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Don't take it personally if your crush is just not that into you, Taylor said.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "If the person declines, remember that this is a risky proposition, she explained. Your co-worker might have otherwise said 'yes' if you hadn't met at work. Many are averse to dating co-workers as a personal policy.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "6. If they say 'yes,' still maintain professionalism throughout the experience.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "From the beginning, recognize that this is an imperfect dating situation. Asking a colleague out isn't simply about two people getting together ― it almost always complicates the workplace dynamic, said S. Chris Edmonds, a human resources expert and founder of The Purposeful Culture Group.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Luckily, some work relationships work out great, Edmonds said. I met the woman who became my wife at work and we've been married 38 years now. You just need to be diligent in keeping work separate from your outside relationship. PDA or arguing at work will only increase tension and discomfort by other team members and observers.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "Whatever happens, Edmonds recommends keeping your personal policy on interoffice romances as simple as possible.", "label": 4}

While I was aware that home pregnancy tests always need to be confirmed by a doctor, I really didn't realize that false positives were very much of a possibility. The instructions even say that false negatives are more likely than false positives, and that both are extremely rare. The over 99 percent accuracy that is advertised on all HPTs leads one believe that they are trustworthy. Imagine the toll on my emotions when, after taking a test one day, I peeled back the shower curtain to discover a little blue plus sign. Shock, excitement, fear, anxiety, and general head-spinning were in order. I stared at the test for a good five minutes before bringing it outside, taking a few pictures in different lighting to make sure it wasn't all in my head, all in between a pounding heartbeat and clasping my hand over my mouth and wondering how in the world I was going to tell my husband. Would he be worried since this was before we had decided to get pregnant? How would we pay for all of this? How would I continue working during the dreaded vomiting of the first trimester? I immediately ran out to the store and picked up different brands of tests to confirm. I waited until the next morning to test again, only to be greeted by only one pink line, not two. The test was negative.", "label": 4}

This entire experience caused a very unnecessary roller coaster of emotions that, when paired with an already hormonal time of the month, absolutely wore me out.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "The above leads me to the reason for the pregnancy test in the first place. I really had no idea how much my cycle would change after getting married. It was very difficult to adapt. I'm sure it has to do partly with getting older and into my upper twenties, but I know marriage plays a role as well. My cycles had been like clockwork since the very beginning. From age 12, I always knew exactly when to expect their arrival, and never once were they missed or late. I do not exaggerate when I say I never missed a period, even during my early twenties when I was constantly traveling, changing time zones, and alternating my sleep schedules from day-shift to night-shift and then back again. The thing was a rock that wouldn't budge. Fast forward to my life as a new wife, and pair that with turning 26, and you get a recipe for disaster. Well, not really disaster. Maybe just extreme stress. Several times during my first year of marriage, my period was late. Not just a few days. Late, as in 2 weeks, sometimes 3. What do you think this resulted in? Me rushing out for pregnancy tests. Oh my gosh, why is it so late? It's never late! I've got to be pregnant! Nope, not pregnant. Just late. This left me very frustrated.

Now is the time to be consistent and trustworthy, so I can properly carry out married life without the stress of trying to prevent pregnancy or become pregnant. Sadly, this was not the case. After visiting my doctor, I received the wisdom that I wish I would have received before this started happening. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. You are very healthy. You are older now, so your body is changing. This is is your new normal. As frustrating as this was, I was comforted by this being my new normal. I just so wish I would have been told to expect my cycle to change, as this would have saved so much unnecessary stress.", "label": 4}

But I have been blessed with people in my life who encourage me in this area, most especially my husband. I think the wrestle ended before we even got married. What really drove it home was coming to the place where I knew that God created me this way, just how He wanted me to be, no more and no less. He wanted every detail about my appearance to be there. Once I accepted this, I was awestruck by the truth of it. Thinking of Who wanted me to be this way, blew my mind. I can honestly say that I don't struggle with my body-image now. Of course some days are better than others, and there are days in every woman's life where she feels average, plain, not pretty.

This played out in the simplest of things such as shaving my legs. Of course my goal is always to be well-kept, but I am amazed just how much insecurity regarding how I look has been lost. I just don't really care anymore. This is not to say that I no longer care about keeping up with my appearance. Quite the opposite - my husband's affirmation of my looks and him telling me regularly that I am beautiful gives me the extra boost of confidence I need to care just enough. Not too much to where I obsess over my appearance, but not too little to where I become lazy and unkempt. While I love how good and confident it feels to be well-kept, I also know that my husband just doesn't care if it's been 4 days since I shaved my legs, or if I wake up and decide not to do my hair.

I found myself moving towards things I'd always wanted to do, exploring my passions with great zeal for life, and completing tasks and projects I'd always meant to finish. Being with the right person has a way of giving you that zoom of strength you need to be fully and 100% yourself. The knowledge that someone not only loves and accepts, but also genuinely enjoys, you as a person, brings a steadiness to the heart like never before. I grew to a place where it didn't really matter anymore who thought what about me. I felt no shame in being 100% myself.

That puts the pet question in a special category.", "label": 4}

Nina writes about the conversation here; a full transcript is below.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "And so although I've always believed that he would make an outstanding Supreme Court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the Supreme Court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring — or at least increasing — the American people's confidence in our justice system.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Did you talk to him about being a piñata, as Sen. Cornyn put it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We had a very candid conversation. He's chief judge of the D.C.

You know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we're — we call folks like Judge Garland civilians. And so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But, you know, I think the way he described it — and I'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself — the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. He has loved being a judge for a very long time. He occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. He's got a great job.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared I think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that I might make. Because he thinks it's important.", "label": 5}

They clearly don't want to look rude, so they'll meet with him and tell him that they don't want to meet with him. [Laughter]", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But — but how do you keep it up there? When the Supreme Court, frankly — I've written more pieces in my life saying, This year it may be an issue, and then it never really is.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "This year it may be an issue. In fact I think it is, in part because of the circus that has been the presidential campaign season so far.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. I think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in Washington. I think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the Senate saying, I won't meet with a nominee; I won't provide a nominee a hearing; I will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. That matters to people.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so, you're right, Nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following Supreme Court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. But people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. And this becomes I think a symbol of a process that, if Republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're Democrats or Republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the Senate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. And that damages people's faith in the judiciary — because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so I — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just Democrats, but a sizable number of Republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government. And what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the Constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "There's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the Supreme Court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. George Washington nominated a couple of Supreme Court justices in his last year. And obviously George Washington had better poll numbers, I'm sure, than I did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, I think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So we've reported that Republican — leading Republican senators sent a message sort of back-channel: OK, if you appoint Merrick Garland, we — we still will oppose him now, but we would confirm him in the lame-duck session after the election if there's a Democratic president. Did that play any role in your decision?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I have not had conversations like that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "No, I didn't say you had.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What I have seen are the public statements of leading Republicans like Orrin Hatch broadly complimenting Judge Garland as a brilliant, fair jurist, who should be confirmed to the Supreme Court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that Republicans really do like him?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, there's no doubt that what played a role, as I said earlier, was that, number one, I think he's the best person for the job. Number two, I think he's a consensus builder. And the court would benefit from that at the moment.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Justice Scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. But if you think about when the Supreme Court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. And Judge Garland, if you look at his work on the D.C. Circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. And I think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by Republicans.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. And I said at the outset I would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base.

He's not, you know, he's not going to — this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the Supreme Court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What do you say to that — those folks?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, first of all what I would say is take a look at the appointments I've made since I've been president of the United States. I've appointed as many African-Americans to the Circuit Court as any president ever; more African-American women on the federal courts than any other president; more Hispanics, more Asian-Americans, more LGBT judges than any president in history.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on the Circuit Courts, something that's never happened before. So my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "When it comes to the Supreme Court, I've appointed two women, one Hispanic. And in each case, the good news is that I appointed the person who I absolutely thought was the best person for the job. In this case, Merrick Garland is the best person for the job.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And I have confidence that — without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case — he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the Constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What do you ask these folks in your interviews? I mean, you can't say, So, what do you think of Roe v. Wade? That would be improper, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So, I'm Judge Totenberg. I'm here for my interview. What are you going to ask me? What kinds of things do you ask?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, sometimes I just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. You learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And when you hear Judge Garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the Oklahoma City bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. And I spent a lot of time on that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "With respect to judicial philosophy, I have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so I don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases — because I can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and I have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One thing I, I do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the Constitution might be ambiguous. What do they do to — to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? You know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. And they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "But can you blame the Republicans who look at this nomination and say, There's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court. So can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win the presidential nomination [sic]. And if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the Democrats do the same? They called — they're all already calling it the Biden rule.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, a couple of things. First of all, this speech that they continually quote from Joe Biden when he was on the Judiciary Committee — if you actually read the speech, number one, he was speaking hypothetically. [Cellphone rings]", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Should we start that one over? [Laughter]", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Wow, Nina. You're supposed to turn off your phone.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I'm not — I'm supposed to be a pro.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I'm assuming you can just splice the question and I'll just answer it, so Nina doesn't have to answer — ask it again.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, first of all, if you look at what Joe Biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a Supreme Court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, you know what? That's exactly what I've done. And so there's no contradiction between what I'm doing and what Joe Biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Number two, with respect to my actions when I was a junior senator, you will recall that I never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. I never said that a nominee should not get a vote. And what I also said at the time was that I was concerned about some of Judge Alito's views that I considered more troubling. But in the case of Merrick Garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "This is just raw politics. We don't want somebody who's been nominated by a Democrat — a claim that I would have never made at the time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Now what is true, Nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice Scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. And so I understand the politics that Republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Here's the problem we have, though: If in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a Democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, We've got another excuse for not confirming a Democratic president's nominee?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And at that point the process has broken down. Democrats have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which Democrats have left a seat open when a Republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Justice Kennedy was confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and I'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of Democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's office. So we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that Democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the Supreme Court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the Supreme Court, but the integrity of the Senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. I'm not demanding that Republicans vote for Merrick Garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. And at some point, it's got to stop.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a Supreme Court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the Republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Are you taking this on the road?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well, you know, I'm going to make the case — I'm going to make the case for a fair process. Give Judge Garland a hearing; give him a vote. And look at the qualities of the man. That's what the American people expect. And, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that I've heard from Mitch McConnell and some other Republicans is this notion that the American people should decide — we should let the American people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Well in fact, the American people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the United States with sufficient electoral votes. And they also decided that the Republicans would be in the majority. They didn't say, We're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. They said, No, you're the president for four years, and Mr. McConnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the Senate.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So the American people already have decided. They've already weighed in. They will have another opportunity to weigh in, so that if there is another vacancy that comes up, the next president will fill that vacancy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. The real argument is the one that you made, Nina, which is that they don't want a Democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a Democrat to fill the seat.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. And sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the American people actually matter more than your short-term politics. They actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. And there have been a number of times where, as president of the United States, I've had to do things that I knew were bad politics but I understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And I would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on Earth.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "WOODFIN: When we look at the history of America, we haven't always been honest. Well, what's on paper wasn't necessarily in practice. Racism was real. It was tangible. And the difference between Birmingham and any other city in America at that time was our differences were actually wrecking on the world stage. So everyone saw it. They saw the brutality. They saw the racism. They saw the bigotry. They saw the evil. They saw it. At the exact same time, they saw the Fred Shuttlesworths of our world, the Martin Luther King Jrs. of our world, others fight back.

And she spoke in front of an audience, but the majority of the room was full of children. And she spoke of forgiveness and forgiving to what happened to her, what happened to her sister, what happened to her friends. And I think if I had a tangible example to give of just what reconciliation means, she embodies that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: But earlier you talked about how, you know, 88 of the 99 neighborhoods here are black and 11 are white.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "WOODFIN: You're right. There's a massive amount of, not just poverty, but concentrated poverty in the city of Birmingham. When we think about everything in the '50s and '60s around - the intentionality around housing, housing discrimination, it wasn't just at the local level. It actually started at the federal level. And it was at the state level as well. And those policies were enacted at the local level. And then, when there was a final breakthrough in the late '60s, we all know white flight took place. The National Realtors Association talked about how when that happened across the entire city of Birmingham - and other cities in America, too - property value went down. Suburban - more suburban America came online. That includes the fragmentation of Jefferson County, more - expanding of other municipalities in - suburban municipalities outside of the city.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "You fast forward to today in Birmingham, and that's reflected in the makeup of a city that's probably the fifth-blackest city in America. That's how you get three-fourths. That's how you get 88 neighborhoods with 11 majority. Those 11 neighborhoods are concentrated in the south and southeastern portion of the city. And they backend one of the wealthiest cities, suburban cities in America. Mountain Brook's probably like - it's in the top 20 most richest cities in America, next to the seat city of the 7th Congressional District in Alabama, which is the third-poorest U.S. congressional district in America, right?

She says everything she knows about how to treat people comes from growing up in Alabama, comes from her childhood here in Alabama. But things have changed for Lisa. And we're going to listen to her question.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "LISA GARAYA: When I came to college, I learned about various theories surrounding race such as microaggressions and power dynamics. These are words that I had obviously never heard, but I began to feel like these examples of casual racism hit a little too close to home. For example, growing up, it was a pretty normal occurrence to be asked what kind of Indian I was - red dot or feather. I thought back on how time after time my white peers made me feel uncomfortable with their comments about my racial background, except at the time they were saying it, I didn't know why I was uncomfortable. Learning about microaggressions provided clarity but also introduced a lot of anger in my life. It's frustrating. Do any other people of color who go through this epiphany feel this way? How do you decompress your past with this new outlook on it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: So we have somebody who has some newfound information. It's making her angry and a little bit agitated. And she doesn't quite know what to do with that information. Gigi?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: So this goes way back for me. So when I was in high school - and this was - I've got to add - this was in New York - both my parents are from Egypt. And my high school economics teacher said, so, Gigi, are you going to grow up to become a terrorist one day?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: Right? In the moment, it just kind of like - I don't know, it just didn't really register. And then you have that moment later where you're like - you're thinking, did that really just happen...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: ...Just happen. Did that actually happen? Yeah.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: Did this person just say that? And that - you know, since moving here, I've gotten a lot of, what are you?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: Where are you from? And where are you from is kind of, you know, for me, I never know what they mean, whether people mean where are you from geographically - because I might not sound like I'm from the South - or ethnically. And so I'll say, well, what do you mean? And then they have, you know, sort of, you know - oh, I meant you don't sound like you're from the South, or ethnically, I mean, what's your ancestry, what's your heritage? I feel like sometimes it is a little jab, but other times, sometimes people just might not know, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: So you ask a clarifying question.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: When you run into something that you feel like might be what Lisa calls a microaggression, you ask a clarifying question to figure out, all right, was that really a microaggression or was it an honest question...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WOODFIN: Yeah. Definitely. So I would agree with her that microaggressions exists in Birmingham. But I think college is one of the best places to explore issues of race and ethnicity, et cetera because, even from Morehouse - being an all-male, all-black campus - it's one of the most diverse places I've ever been to. I spent four years there. This is the time for her, personally, to address that microaggression, but at the same time, colleges and universities across our nation - I think UAB can be a center of that to talk about this.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "MERAJI: I'm Puerto Rican and Iranian.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: I don't know if you heard that before.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: I don't know if - has anyone heard it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: If you listen to the CODE SWITCH podcast, they say it every episode. But it's a very confusing thing for people, and I feel like my whole life has been navigating - what are you, where are you from? - these type of questions. And it was in college when I decided I am going to learn as much as I can. And so I took a bunch of ethnic studies courses, and I really made answering these questions and dealing with these kinds of overt and maybe not so overt microaggressions - I made this my life's work. She can - Lisa, you can do this, too. You know, you can get paid to have these conversations.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: It's not all horrible if that's what you want to do. And, I mean, another thing is she talked about really caring about what Alabama taught her and what she learned here in Birmingham. So to me, that sounded like she really cares about this place, and she really cares about the people here. And I feel like if that's the case, and she really wants to maintain these friendships, if someone says something to her that feels off or feels like a microaggression, yes, ask the clarifying question, and then if she still feels like it was a microaggression, explain how to ask this question in a better way - if she feels like doing it - you know, if she wants to maintain these relationships because sometimes people say things, and they have no idea what they're saying. So yeah. If she's open to having these conversation with friends and family here in Birmingham, I would say do that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: But I would say that, sometimes, people say those things and they're invested in not knowing what's wrong with it. You know what I mean? Like...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WOODFIN: Being comfortable in their ignorance.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, and it's not just ignorance, right? There's, like, power behind a lot of it, right? So, I mean, I do think that there should be space for her to cut her friends off. I mean, I do think that there's so much psychic energy that comes along with trying to shepherd your friends. I mean, you can have that conversation with somebody, right? It doesn't mean they want to come along with you - right? - and see what was janky about what they asked. And so, you know, you should feel empowered. I know it is really hard in some cases. So cut people off. Their enlightenment is not your responsibility, especially when it comes at the cost of your, like, you know, psychic health, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: All right. Let's go to the next question.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: The second question is from a listener named Leah Abrams (ph). She's 20. She's of Middle Eastern Jewish descent. She moved to Alabama in May for a summer internship. And here's Leah's question.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "LEAH ABRAMS: I grew up and I spent my whole life in North Carolina, where race and identity played integral roles in my upbringing. Yet, being in Alabama, I feel like I've noticed that race and segregation are more explicitly entrenched in daily life. In particular, a friend talked about being warned from a young age not to talk to white women because of his county's violent legacy of lynching black men for even looking at white girls. I feel like I haven't met many interracial couples in my time here at all. Is it really that taboo to be in an interracial relationship in Alabama? If so, why?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: So when we got this question, we decided to do a little digging. And according to a report from the Pew Research Center, metro areas in the South are the least likely to have new marriages be between people of different races. The Birmingham Hoover Metro, in particular, was in the bottom 10 for new interracial marriages in the whole country. Only about 6 percent of newlyweds in Birmingham are interracial couples. Anybody want to guess where the No. 1 - No. 1 metro area for interracial marriages is in the United States? Just take a wild guess.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: You heard D.C.? I heard Seattle, which is crazy. Have you been to Seattle? What...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: Y'all are like thousands of thousands miles off. It's actually Honolulu.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: Something like 44 percent of the new marriages in Honolulu, Hawaii, are between people of different races.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: Let's just keep in mind that Alabama was the last state to overturn its ban on interracial marriage. That was in 2000, which when you think about it, was not all that long ago.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: Right? So, you know, I've talked to a lot of people about this - a lot of interracial couples, and there's a lot going on. Long story short, it is not all that common, although it kind of depends on where you are. So if you are in the city Birmingham, if you are on the campus of UAB, not that big a deal, not that uncommon. But if you're in maybe Coleman County or someplace like that...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: ...Probably not going to find very many interracial couples.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: It was a knowing laugh.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: So it kind of depends on where you are. I spoke with a woman who is white whose husband is from Kenya. And she told me that when they married back in the '90s here in Alabama, her grandmother said to her, I'm glad at least that your grandfather has passed away already because this would've killed him.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: That's deep. But it's on the other side as well, where, you know, a lot of African-American men might still have that sort of - you know, maybe have been told by their fathers not to talk to white women, not to look at white women, not to get into relationships with white women because it's just not going to go over well. It's just not something that you do. And it wasn't that it was just inconvenient or anything like that. But, I mean, there was a point in history - and it was not all that long ago - where your life would be in danger if, you know, you were a black man pursuing a white woman.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so I spoke to a sociologist at UAB who studies race and culture. And she said there are a lot of young people who feel like that was 200 years ago in their minds, but in reality, we're not all that far removed from that part of history. So that still lives on in a lot of people. That said, the vast majority of people told me that, for the younger generation, it is more and more commonplace, and it's OK by them as opposed to their parents who might still be resistant to interracial relationships.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "MERAJI: Were you discouraged from having interracial relationships growing up?", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "MERAJI: Is this a conversation that happened for you?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: How did that work in high school? I mean...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WOODFIN: If I reflect back when I was 15 and 16, 17 in high school, I don't think that's something that you actually did for real. Was it explicit not to do it? No. Was it something that you just - that you felt? Yes. Now, she's right. I don't know how much more I can add to what she just said. My mother is married. She's in an interracial relationship. Her husband is white. They've been married over a decade now. I think it's interesting watching my own mother, from a personal standpoint, be in an interracial relationship. I think for each generation we see, not just in Birmingham, but in the state, things have changed for each generation for the better.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: And, Gigi, I mean, this is still - like, this a lot of - this is about the segregation we see elsewhere - right? - the segregation we see in schools and elsewhere, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: Yeah. I mean, pretty much all of our public spaces, you know? Kids from a young age mostly go to segregated schools, so...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: ...Churches, parks, restaurants. You know, a lot of times, there's - pretty much segregated, right? So you don't have to work that hard to stay away from somebody in another race. It's almost kind of done for you in the circles that you kind of grow up in.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: You're not making things up. All right. We have one last question. It comes from a listener named Mallory Mitchell (ph). She's 26. She's black. She's originally from Alabama, and she has a question regarding Mayor Woodfin's election. Let's hear it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MALLORY MITCHELL: When you look at Alabama's largest cities - Birmingham, Montgomery, Mobile and Huntsville - they all have very different histories and demographics. Of all four, Birmingham is the one city that seems progressive enough to elect a young black man to the office of mayor. However, that looks like it might be changing. What makes Birmingham different from other large cities in the state?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: Mayor Woodfin, you've got to take this first.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WOODFIN: I think one of the things that makes our city different is that we're the economic development engine of the entire state. When you think about workforce that the organizations, whatever lane they're in, whether it's health care or whether it's financial services, manufacturing, which are some of our top three industries here in our city, I think about their workforce becoming younger. So all my friends - when I moved back here 15 years ago, no one my age at 22 and 23 wanted to be in the city. They wanted to go to Atlanta. They wanted to go to Nashville. They wanted to go somewhere else.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But I think the same cohort of people now, who are 22 and 23 - they want to stay here. And so it's good to see our city be a part of the national trend of people wanting to be in the urban core in the central city. With that, that's bringing a whole new flavor of young people and new people, I think, from a governing standpoint. People want their municipal government to reflect the same thing we're seeing in the private sector. They want it to reflect the same thing they're seeing on the social scene, which is something new. And that's what our candidacy and campaign represented.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DEMBY: Now, does having a city that is as black as Birmingham is - does that just make it bluer to start with, right? Like, are you starting a little bit - you just - you have this, like, very deep Democratic base here, I imagine?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WOODFIN: It does - it is a very - it's a huge Democratic base here, but that that goes for the entire city, black and white.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: Gigi, is there anything you want to add to that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DOUBAN: So, I mean, if you - just listening to him speak, he mentioned young voters so many times. And that was key, I think - not just young African-American voters but white millennial voters as well. I think - yeah. Young people were and are a big part of this city's moving to the next level.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: All right. Listen. How about this? There were over 5,000 18 to 35-year-olds who participated for the first time in a municipal election in the city of Birmingham because of what I said earlier. Like, millennials definitely want to be here.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MERAJI: All right. So I want to sum this up for Mallory. She wants to know what makes Birmingham different, and what you're saying is there is more economic opportunity here, there's an economic engine that's moving. It's drawing in young people. It's also a predominantly African-American city, which makes it tend towards being more democratic and progressive, and, you know, you've got young millennials who are out exercising their right to vote. Would I have summed that up for Mallory?", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Americans are suddenly consumed with multiple crises. Even before the outbreak of social unrest following yet another African American's death in police custody, the ravages of COVID-19 and economic free fall had disrupted the national life.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "All of which means conditions are ripe for President Trump to assume more power and move closer to the status of autocratic ruler, says New Yorker writer Masha Gessen in a new book Surviving Autocracy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen's viewpoint may be head-spinning for many, especially those who believe today's maelstrom of disease, unemployment and racial violence represent failures by the incumbent president. Yet Gessen argues that Trump may see it all as an opportunity, not just in his pursuit of re-election, but in what Gessen believes is his longer-term concept of his own career trajectory.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "He may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation, Gessen writes, a climate of more anxiety and fear of change. Gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar Hannah Arendt, author of The Origins of Totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability while at the same time dangling the promise of stability.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In uncertain times, the aspiring autocrat promises a restoration, a return to greatness — all the while reaching for more power and permanence. Gessen suggests Trump will seek to use all that has happened in his tumultuous term to achieve a breakthrough to unlimited power on the model of Russian President Vladimir Putin.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "For many readers, comparing an elected American president to a Russian dictator is simply beyond the pale. But if the comparison seemed strained a week ago, it seems less so on the morning after Trump dressed down the governors of the affected states and brandished the threat of federal troops taking over their streets.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen clearly regards Trump not only as a Putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a Putin impersonator. The author argues that Trump models himself on Putin, not because he expects to replicate Russian political culture here but because he wants America to see him the way Russia sees Putin — as someone who can return his country to the glories of an imaginary past.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen says Putin and Trump were elected president without really wanting the job. They ran not for president but for autocrat, and they did not expect to settle for anything less. Putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. Trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say TRUMP 2024 and TRUMP 2028 and so on into the future.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Born in Moscow in 1967, Gessen has won acclaim largely for writing on this native land, including winning a National Book Award for a 2017 examination of Putin's rise and suppression of democracy. And while the Putin-Trump link has been made elsewhere, it is forged here in Gessen's own personal history.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Brought to New York by immigrating parents in the early 1980s, Gessen returned to this birthplace on journalistic assignment a decade later. Gessen then spent most of the next 20 years as a writer, editor and activist in post-Soviet Russia, observing the rise of the former KGB officer who now holds that nation's highest office.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen wrote books on a wide array of subjects, including a grandmother's struggles to survive the Nazis and the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin. Another is about the female punk band Pussy Riot, sentenced to prison for its protest songs.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen cites an array of scholars in this, the writer's 11th book. One is Hungarian sociologist Bálint Magyar, who has described the present condition of his own country as a mafia state, ruled by a crime family in which one man distributes money and power to all other members. (Viewers of The Sopranos will understand how this model works.) Magyar also identifies three stages by which a ruler is transformed into an autocrat: the attempt, the breakthrough and the consolidation.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen sees Trump's term so far as the autocratic attempt, his re-election as a prospective breakthrough and a second term as the green light to consolidate his power.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The first three years [of Trump's term] have shown that an autocratic attempt in the U.S. has credible chance of succeeding, Gessen writes. Worse than that, they have shown that an autocratic attempt builds logically on the structures and norms of American government; on the concentration of power in the executive branch, and on the marriage of money and politics.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen says the institutions and traditions Americans thought would protect them have proven weak because they were not built to withstand a personality such as Trump. The author had little faith that Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election would be the magic bullet that would rid Washington of Trump. Instead, Gessen writes, it drew attention away from what Trump was doing in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Since 2013, Gessen has been back in the U.S., writing and also teaching at Amherst College. Although Gessen's been widely published, the writer's main main outlets have been in the Big Apple — The New York Times, The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker, where Gessen has been a staff writer since 2017. Regular readers of that magazine will recognize some of Surviving Autocracy from columns in The New Yorker.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen brings to all work a unique blend of intellect and manifold passions — for math and science, for language and politics, and for the cause of LGBTQ people in both homelands. (Gessen also identifies as nonbinary.) The writer flashes the fierce attitude and language of the partisan activist one moment, returning to the cooler mien of a public intellectual the next.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen is particularly sensitive to issues of linguistics and the subtle shifts of wording that can mean so much — noting how the words immigrant and refugee (both relatively sympathetic terms for most Americans) have been systematically replaced by such terms as migrant or invasion.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen is also exercised about the change Trump has wrought in the perception of reality. In a chapter titled The Power Lie, Gessen explains the difference between an ordinary lie that may collapse in the face of facts and the Trumpian lie.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The latter is the power lie, or the bully lie ... the lie of the bigger kid who took your hat and is wearing it — while denying that he took it. There is no defense against this lie because the point of the lie is to assert power, to show 'I can say what I want when I want to.' ", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The media generally assist in this, Gessen argues, even when serious news organizations fact-check the president, by presenting two notions of reality side by side and inviting the audience to decide. Right there, the president has won, Gessen says. The lie has been given equal standing with verifiable facts, and the concept of truth has been devalued.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen objects repeatedly to the reluctance of legacy newspapers and broadcasters (including NPR) to call the president a liar (or for that matter, a racist). Even when pointing out the inaccuracies and falsehoods the president peddles, traditional journalists balk at terms such as lie and liar. In part, the idea is to keep the door as wide open as possible to attract and retain as wide an audience as possible. Gessen understands this reasoning but says it allows the liar or the racist to persist and normalizes such behavior until it appears less objectionable — or simply not objectionable at all.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But getting back to the word surviving and its implicit promise in the title, Gessen gives us this:", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Recovery from Trumpism — a process that will be necessary whenever Trumpism ends — will not be a process of returning to government as it used to be, a fictional state of pre-Trump normalcy. Recovery will be possible only as reinvention: of institutions, of what politics means to us, and of what it means to be a democracy, if that is indeed what we choose to be.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "At this point, of course, one must wonder who Gessen means by we. One impression easily taken from Surviving Autocracy is that Trump has been visited on Americans by some mysterious force or personal magic. There is a lack of focus on the manner by which Trump, as opposed to Putin, came to office.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gessen's perceptions about Russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of Americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). But by the same token, average Americans might well ask how much Gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most Americans.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In a 2018 interview with The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, Gessen volunteered an empathetic reference to those Trump has called the forgotten man and the forgotten woman, the middle-aged and older members of the middle class who felt less at home in their own country in recent decades.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "What if Gessen had spent more time in the country these people feel they have lost? It would not likely change Gessen's mind about Trump. But it might alter the writer's perspective on Trumpism. It might help translate a deep empathy for the plight of ordinary Russians and relate it to the fears and frustrations of their American counterparts — the millions who voted for Trump and now accept his authoritarian tendencies as being in their own interest.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Bill Kurtis reads three quotes from the week's news...You're Fired!, Return of the Mac, Real Women Have Curvy Bottles", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. U-tah (ph), me-Bill (ph).", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "KURTIS: I am Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Abravanel Hall in Salt Lake City, Utah, Peter Sagal.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Thank you, Bill. Thank you, everybody. It is great to be back in Salt Lack City. Salt Lake, of course, is a beautiful city surrounded by mountains. Later on, we're going to be talking to somebody who specializes in descending those mountains rather quickly, Olympic gold medalist Hannah Kearney. But first, we want to congratulate our friend Terry Gross and her staff on this week's 30th anniversary of the show Fresh Air. It is an awesome thing.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Every week, we at WAIT WAIT try to rise to her level of skill, grace, honesty and professionalism, and then we shrug and say nah (ph), let's just stick to our fart jokes. I mean, she does her thing, we'll do ours.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Another difference - you do not have to write a brilliant novel to get on our show, just give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAITWAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. Now, let's welcome our first listener contestant. Hi, you are on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "GROVE: It's in Western Maryland. It's a little small town. And we just got a second gas station, so we are rapidly...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Oh, congratulations. Well, Landon, welcome to our show. Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First up, it's a comedian performing this upcoming week - May 15 to the 21 - at the Brad Garrett Comedy Club at the MGM Las Vegas. It's Alonzo Bodden.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "SAGAL: Landon, welcome to the show. You're going to play Who's Bill This Time. Bill Kurtis is going to perform for you three quotations from the week's news. Your job - correctly identify or explain just two of them. Do that, you will win our prize, the voice of scorekeeper emeritus Carl Kasell to do whatever you will with. Are you ready to play?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: All right. Your first quote is from naturally, inevitably, the president of the United States.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "KURTIS: Look. He's a showboat. He's a grandstander. You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: So who did our modest, thoughtful president fire for being a, quote, showboat?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROVE: I think President Trump said James Comey, you're fired.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "ROCCA: You already won the game.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: That was scary good. On Tuesday afternoon, the president fired James Comey, the head of the FBI. He did this, the White House said, because Mr. Comey had treated Hillary Clinton so unfairly. And if there's one thing we know about Donald Trump, when there's a woman being mistreated, he won't be far away.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: But on Thursday of this week, we heard that the president had really fired Comey because he didn't like him, and he thought that he was making too much noise about the Russia investigation. The White House dismissed that though because it came from a completely unreliable source - President Donald Trump.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "ROCCA: Comey found out by - right - somebody was watching TV right behind us him or something, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Yes. He was in an event in Los Angeles. He was speaking to the agents. And there was a TV on, and it said, you know, Comey fired. And apparently Comey thought it was a prank. You know, one of those jolly little jokes where you sneak up behind somebody with an inflated balloon and then subvert the rule of law.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "BODDEN: Well, the great thing about the event, it was actually a recruiting event. So can you imagine as you're recruiting - does anyone here need a job?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "BODDEN: They're kind of like, well, you do.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Comey's like, well, we have 41 openings - oh, 42.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "NEGIN FARSAD: And can you imagine, like, Hillary Clinton having fired James Comey if she was president? People would like, oh, my God, emails, Benghazi, evil lady. She would have had to wear like a scarlet letter C on her pantsuit. There would have been like a burning at the stake. Like, it would've been a whole thing. But with Donnie, we're just like, it's kind of funny, you know?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "ROCCA: He fired Gary Busey with more tact.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "BODDEN: Do you think it took Trump this long to fire Comey because he just found out he could?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "BODDEN: The whole investigation's been going on, and it's getting closer and closer. And then somebody said something to him, he's like, wait, I can just fire him? Done.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "FARSAD: Eventually he'll read the entire Constitution, and then we'll really be screwed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "BODDEN: No, he won't. He won't.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Here is your next quote.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "KURTIS: He's so handsome, and his name sounds like my favorite dessert.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: That was a commentator on deadline.com celebrating the election of whom as president of France?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "GROVE: I want to say Macron.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Emmanuel Macron, the new president, he's a rich businessman who has never held office before. And he ran for the presidency saying that politicians have failed the people, and it was time to return when France was great. All true. He's just like Donald Trump, except Macron can speak better English.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "ROCCA: Yeah. When Macron meets with Justin Trudeau, I mean, gay Twitter is going to explode.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: This is very strange. In some way, Emmanuel Macron is President Trump's mere image. Trump is 70, the oldest American president ever. Macron is 39, the youngest French president ever. Macron, like Trump, is in a May-December marriage. Well, in Trump's case, it's more like May of the following year marriage. But in his case, Macron is the young one. Did you know this? When he was 16, he fell in love with his 40-year-old drama teacher.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: And then he was sent away by his parents, who tried to break up this forbidden romance. And he said, I will return and marry her. And he did it. And everybody's like, whoa, this kind of salacious. But it's covering up the real interesting thing, which is that a drama geek is now the president of a major Western power.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "FARSAD: And his wife is a MILF, a mother I'd like to French.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "FARSAD: But the thing about Marine Le Pen, she didn't ever scare me as much as Trump, I think, because she spoke in complete sentences. And her, like, white nationalism had a certain je ne sais quoi.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "ROCCA: How - I mean, not that there's anything wrong with it, but Macron's wife is how much older?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Twenty-four years older, which by coincidence again, is exactly the same difference in age between Donald Trump and Melania.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "ROCCA: And Melania. So - OK.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "BODDEN: The difference is his wife will live with him.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Landon, we're going to leave politics behind, thankfully, if just for a second. Your last quote is a reaction to yet another failed marketing campaign this week.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "GROVE: A jar of margarine? I have no idea.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: You've already won, so we'll just give it to you. They're making their soap bottles look like bodies.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: Right, different kinds of female physiques. Some companies looked at the failed Pepsi ad campaign of a few weeks ago and said, oh, thank God that wasn't us. But Dove soap said, oh, yeah? Watch this.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: So Dove this week introduced a line of soap bottles that are intended to look like different types of women's bodies.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "ROCCA: You're going to get ripped off if you get the Kate Moss one.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: I know. There's hardly anything in it. Yes, there are some that are tall and thin. There's narrow. There's shapely. There's short and round, pear-shaped, you know. The idea is that it's soap for all types of women, but no woman basically wants to be stopped at the checkout counter and be told, you sure you don't want that fat bottle?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SAGAL: If you are a man - and I know some of you are - and you're finding it hard to understand why this is so offensive to women, just imagine going into the shaving cream aisle where they have those tubes of shaving cream. And imagine that in order to represent different kinds of men, all the cans are different lengths.", "label": 5}

Elizabeth Warren; former Vice President Joe Biden; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. NPR reached out for comment to all seven campaigns, but most declined to respond on the record.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "A spokesman for Buttigieg, who was criticized by a prominent conservative Christian leader this week for being gay, said he would consider attending.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In a statement to NPR, a spokesman for O'Rourke said the former congressman would not accept the invitation. Vander Plaats and the Family Leader have unapologetically provided a forum for dangerous anti-LGBTQ hate speech on numerous occasions, Chris Evans said. They are the antithesis of the unifying, inclusive, welcoming atmosphere that our campaign prides itself on in Iowa and across the country. We will not be participating in this forum.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The event has loomed large in past Republican caucus campaigns, drawing about 3,000 voters in 2015, when then-candidate Donald Trump famously criticized the late Republican Sen. John McCain's military service at the event.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It's the first time The Family Leader has invited candidates actively seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to the event, a spokesman said. Vander Plaats acknowledged that the group – known for fighting same-sex marriage – is an unlikely venue for Democrats, but added, If you're going to cast a vision of unity, I think you need to be able to have the courage then to go to that venue ... and cast that vision.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Vander Plaats noted that in recent weeks, several candidates have woven their personal faith into their pitches to voters. Warren has made the case that her Christian faith helped shape her liberal political values. Harris opened her campaign by calling for unity and speaking of her faith in God during her announcement speech in January.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Buttigieg has spoken openly about his Episcopal faith, his sexuality and his marriage to his husband Chasten — and has sparred with conservatives including Vice President Pence.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "This week, Franklin Graham, son of the late Rev. Billy Graham, questioned Buttigieg's claim to Christianity in a series of tweets, saying in part, As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Large majorities of Christians in the U.S. support same-sex marriage, though a majority of white evangelicals oppose it, according to a 2018 survey by PRRI.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Vander Plaats is a controversial figure, who has been regarded as a kingmaker among white evangelicals in Iowa, where the conservative Christian vote is a vital voting bloc for Republicans. During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Vander Plaats sparked criticism — including from within the Republican Party — for asking candidates for the GOP nomination to sign a marriage vow promising fidelity to one's spouse, rejection of Sharia Islam and support for robust childbearing and reproduction, among other things.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "After widespread condemnation, The Family Leader issued an apology and removed language stating that slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an African-American baby born after the election of the USA's first African-American President.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "It potentially could show the audience of The Family Leader a visible, positive representation of an out gay man who's running for the highest office in our land, he said.

{"sentence": "Hoffman-Zinnel added that if candidates accept the offer, Vander Plaats has a responsibility to create a very safe environment where folks feel comfortable being there.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "During a recent visit to Iowa, Hoffman-Zinnel noted, Buttigieg was met with anti-gay hecklers.

{"sentence": "Democratic candidates oftentimes talk about Jefferson, and Madison, and founding ideals – but we need candidates that can talk about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Hale said, referring to the first four books of the Christian New Testament.

Which of course leads to a lot of incompetent waiters who are liars. But directors are like that, too. You really don't know what you're doing, and I think in a lot of ways these ideas [of improv], these principles, are what got me through — this idea of, like, listen to people more than you talk. ... I don't know anything about costume design, but I hired someone whose work I admire and then I listened to her when she made recommendations. ...

There were still dark clouds and furrowed brows of my dad and the teachers and their friends and every adult that I knew.

The U.S. Justice Department sided with a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. To advocates in the LGBT community, it is just the latest disappointment from the Trump administration. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here to tell us more. Carrie, thanks so much for joining us.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "JOHNSON: Sure. The owner of a Colorado shop called Masterpiece Cakeshop refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple several years ago. Colorado, like a lot of states, has public accommodation laws that are designed for businesses that interact with the public to prevent discrimination. And this baker, Jack Phillips, said no. He violated the statute on the books in Colorado, saying he didn't want to be compelled to violate his First Amendment rights, his deeply held religious beliefs, by celebrating this gay couple's marriage. But the same-sex couple said the baker was violating their rights.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And now we're into this tug of war. This week, the Justice Department and the Trump administration sided with the baker, said the government couldn't compel him to engage in free speech. And in their brief, said an artist cannot be forced to paint. A musician cannot be forced to play, and a poet cannot be forced to write. A baker can't be forced to make a wedding cake.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MARTIN: So in this country, laws saying you can't discriminate against people and offering public services were very hard won, as I think many people will remember. But they've been on the books for decades, so I think some people might ask, why is this any different from someone who is refusing to serve black people at a lunch counter, for example, or at a restaurant? What's the difference?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JOHNSON: Well, and the Justice Department briefing anticipated this argument. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall says race is different. There's a compelling government interest in eradicating discrimination based on race. Laws that target racial bias can survive very strict scrutiny, strict review under the First Amendment. But those same classifications aren't so clear, the Trump DOJ says, for sexual orientation. Colorado only began issuing same sex-marriage licenses in 2014. And a divided Supreme Court only ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. There's still a lot of litigation out there on how and if old civil rights laws that mention sex actually covers sexual orientation too.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MARTIN: So what have you been hearing about reaction to the Justice Department's decision to weigh in on the baker's behalf?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JOHNSON: More than 80 Republican members of Congress say they're going to file their own briefs supporting this cake shop owner. He even appeared on Capitol Hill this past week with Utah Senator Mike Lee. But this matter has been getting a very different reception in the LGBT community. The American Civil Liberties Union says it was shocked that the Justice Department would support what it calls a constitutional right to discriminate. And at Lambda Legal, which fights for LGBT people, Sharon McGowan, who directs strategy for Lambda Legal, says the Trump White House has put a target on the backs of LGBT people in order to score points with its political base.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "MARTIN: You know, on the campaign trail last, year some might remember that President Trump - oh, then-candidate Trump - made certain statements that at least some gay and lesbian supporters took as assurances of his support for them. So how is his record now bearing out that point of view?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "JOHNSON: His record in office has not quite backed that up according to gay rights advocates. Early on in this administration, the Justice Department revoked guidelines for how schools should treat access to bathrooms and locker rooms for transgender people. In July. The president tweeted would ban transgender people from the military. And his Justice Department also went out of the way to file a brief in another case.

Eventually, the barrier went up, the train disappeared down the tracks, but I was just sitting there in my car in this kind of daze until cars behind me started honking and wondering what was wrong with me. So that was the day I came home and I said to my wife, I think I'm gonna get back into therapy.

She was a Republican, and I had a pretty good sense that my coming out as trans was not going to strike her as the greatest thing that had ever happened to her — and yet I came out to her. I told her the story and I started to cry. And she got up out of her chair and she put her arms around me and she said, I would never turn my back on my child. I will always love you. And I said, But, mom, won't it be a scandal when everyone finds out that I'm your daughter now? And she said, Well, quite frankly, yes, but I will adjust. And then she quoted First Corinthians and said, The greatest of these is love. She said to me, love will prevail, and in large measure, it has in my life.

But what her friends who know her very well have told me is that she is deeply concerned and afraid for her life after discovering details of the escape last year of her stepdaughter Sheikha Latifa, who is one of the daughters of Sheikh Mohammed. She was a 33-year-old Dubai princess who put a video out online saying if you're seeing this, then I have not managed to escape. And she fled by sea. She got as far as the coast of India.

And Princess Haya, according to her friends, feels that she was, in some way, hoodwinked and given a wrong version of events. The bottom line is that Princess Haya is now in hiding in London, preparing for a legal battle, which we don't know exactly what it's going to be about - whether it's custody or money or whatever. But that is coming up at the end of July. So this is pretty embarrassing for the Dubai government. Why does it involve several countries? Princes Haya is the daughter of the former king of Jordan, King Hussein. And she is - that makes her the half-sister of the current king of Jordan. She has chosen to come to England, to Britain, where she was educated. Britain has very close ties to the UAE, so this is, potentially, a very awkward diplomatic spat between two close allies - Britain and the United Arab Emirates.", "label": 5}

Now, many people would say she had every possible luxury, what - she wanted for nothing. But she, obviously, didn't want to be there. She wanted to get away and live a normal life, and that wasn't being offered to her.

{"sentence": "And part of the trial strategy for cross-examining him was to get him angry and to get him arguing with me because we really felt that if he yelled at me and showed his true personality, it would definitely hurt him much more than if he yelled at Rick Ben-Veniste. And my strategy had worked. He was getting angry. The jury was hating him. And Judge Sirica stopped him.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "My law school - I went to Columbia in New York. The students there wrote a letter to him complaining about his treatment of me, and he did apologize for that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Yeah. It's interesting because there are a lot of circumstances where if a lawyer says something to you in an office, you can call him on it. You don't call out a judge in public.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: No, you don't. You just smile and stand there, all the blood draining from your face and in total horror. I mean, it was very hard to be the first. And I always felt that as the first, if I screwed up that I was going to make it harder for anyone to follow me. It would be easy for someone to say, well, women just can't do it. And so I really felt that pressure to perform well so that other women could follow me.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "That's been one of the things I'm proudest of is, for example, when I was general counsel of the Army - another first as a woman - my successor was a woman. And that meant that I had done a good enough job that they were willing to hire another woman.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: All right, let's talk about the Watergate case. One of the interesting things about this is that in May of '73, when the special counsel's office is organized and you begin this criminal investigation into Nixon and his associates, the U.S. Senate forms a committee and is beginning to hold public hearings on this. And a lot had come out on this because the Watergate burglars - one of them, James McCord - had begun talking about the cover-up, in effect. What effect did it have to U.S. prosecutors to have these Senate hearings going on at the same time? Did it reinforce what you were doing? Did you learn things from it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: It mostly complicated things, I would say. We had to be very careful to pay attention to what the Senate was doing because we didn't want them giving immunity to anyone we felt should be prosecuted. We had to make sure that no one told us one story and the Senate something else.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It did make a big difference, though, in terms of acceptance of what we were doing because you had a public disclosure of information so that the American public could hear John Dean testify. And I have to say at the time when he testified, he had no notes because he had been escorted out of the White House and had left without his diaries and messages. So he testified from memory.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: And let's just explain for people who aren't Watergate buffs. Remind us who John Dean was - yeah.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: John Dean was the White House counsel to President Nixon. And he ended up being one of the ringleaders of the cover-up and had a very major role in doing it, although he did not know how much President Nixon knew before he started telling President Nixon.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But he testified from memory for days, and his memory was really incredibly accurate, as he testified about hush money payments and about perjury and the White House suborning perjury and about the approval of the break-in to begin with, which was done by members of the White House staff and the Committee to Reelect the President. So it was quite remarkable testimony.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And basically, if you had polled America, people believed the denials. So he said, for example, that the chief of staff had done certain things. And the chief of staff, Bob Haldeman, testified that he hadn't. And people believed Haldeman rather than Dean.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: While Dean was telling this story to the Senate and on television to the world - I mean, I remember this very clearly - he was also talking to you in the prosecutor's office and giving you...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: ...And was prepared to testify in court about what he knew, which was a lot and had a lot of detail. In July, a couple of months into this investigation, you discover something that practically no one knew - that Nixon had been taping his conversations. This did not come from your own investigators, right? Where did this come from?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: No, that came from the testimony at the Senate. And we heard it the same way that all Americans heard it, which was on television. Alexander Butterfield was an aide to Richard Nixon who had been instrumental in installing the taping system. And a sort of happenstance question by one of the Senate staffers on a Friday revealed this, and it remained confidential and secret until Monday, when it was publicly revealed in Senate hearings.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And Butterfield had debated with himself what he would do if he was asked, and he had said if he was asked a direct question, he would give an honest answer. He wasn't going to volunteer the information, but he was asked a direct question. And it was based on a document that had been found that sounded like it could have been a transcription of a conversation. It was not, but it led to the question of whether there was a taping system, and Butterfield said, yes, there was.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: So, you know, you're in the position in the prosecutor's office where you've been gathering all this information. And how are you going to prove whose version is right? You hear there are tapes. And it's interesting how that impacted you. You're - the guy who was head of your team, Jim Neal, was suspicious of this, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: Yes. He thought that it was a trap. And I am much less skeptical. Maybe I was more naive, but I believed that it was a make or break for us. I knew that it either was going to confirm what John Dean said and make our case, or if it deviated from what he said, we would have been in serious jeopardy of not being able to prove the case because then there would have been serious doubt about his credibility. And so the only question we had was not if we would subpoena tapes, but which ones. And we foresaw executive privilege claims being raised.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You said that lead of your team in the special prosecutor's office thought that this revelation of a recording system might have been a trap, meaning what? What was he suspicious of?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: He, Jim Neal, thought that possibly they were either fake tapes that would exonerate the president or - I'm not really sure exactly what he had in mind, but he really thought it was a trap. He agreed we had no choice but to subpoena them because that was just how it was, and we were going to have to fight it. But I never doubted that it was legitimate. The confirmation that we got from John Dean was he was thrilled to know there was tapes because he believed he had been accurate in recounting all of the conversations he had, and he was relieved that he might be able to be proved correct. So his reaction to it led me to believe that this was good news for us.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Now, what's interesting, you initially request - I think - nine tapes, and you had to ask for specific dates. And this is an interesting fact that occurred to me as I read this. It helped in asking for specific dates to have White House logs, which you had been provided by whom?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: We got them from the White House. It was something that helped enormously. We had all sorts of call logs and meeting logs. And it is something that is very important in developing our case to have had that kind of information. So, for example, on one of the conversations that we subpoenaed in that first nine, we at first thought that it was from, like, 10:30 to noon. But when we checked the logs, we sent an addendum by letter to the White House saying this conversation actually took place from this time to this time. And we were very precise because we had the call logs. And we knew who came into the meeting and when they left and who entered the meeting after that person left. And it made it much easier to identify the exact times of conversations.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Right. And it's interesting when you compare that to the recent investigations into the Trump administration, when special counsel Mueller was looking into looking into, you know, the deeds that he was looking into it. And initially the White House did cooperate and provide a lot of documents. Once the impeachment inquiry began, they refused to honor subpoenas. It really makes a difference whether some of this basic information is provided, doesn't it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: It does, and it's something that needs to be brought back to the Supreme Court to get a final ruling because there's no question that these are public records that should be turned over. There's no privilege and no reason not to have the witnesses and the documents. And it's very important if the American people are going to be able to know the truth and the facts. I'm very fact-based. And I can see information. People can evaluate and judge what it means to them, but at least they have the facts. And if the facts are withheld, you have nothing.", "label": 5}

She was an assistant special prosecutor in the Watergate investigation in the early '70s. She has a new memoir called Watergate Girl: My Fight For Truth And Justice Against A Criminal President.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "You know, it's interesting. So you requested those nine tapes. The Nixon administration said, no, these are private conversations of the president's, that they're subject to executive privilege. And one of the things you write is that as this unfolded in public, his refusal to supply the tapes hurt his support even with his base of supporters. That's again, a difference from what we're seeing today, isn't it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: Yes, although in the Watergate case, there were a lot more complications. At first, he said, this is a hoax in a witch hunt, which sounds dramatically familiar to listeners today. He also simply refused. He just said, I'm not turning them over. Eventually we went public. Archibald Cox, who was the special prosecutor, had a press conference and, in a very moving and dramatic and - full of integrity, said why we needed the tapes and why we had a legal right to have them, which led to the president ordering the attorney general to fire Archibald Cox.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The attorney general said I promised Congress I would not do it without cause, and there is no cause. I will not do it. So he was fired. And the deputy attorney general became attorney general and was ordered to fire Cox. And he also refused, and he was gone. The third person in charge was the solicitor general, who became the acting attorney general, and he carried out the order.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Three days later, public protest was so dramatic, our office and the White House were inundated with bags of mail. This is in the era before email. There were telexes, but other than telexes, there was actual postal mail that we received and the White House received that led Nixon to do a U-turn and say, OK, I'll hire a new special prosecutor. And I'll give you the tapes.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Right. Now, this was the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: In October of 1973. As it happens, you were away on a wedding then, so you weren't in the office. But you did go back. And I want to just focus on that few days when, you know, two people - ranking people had been fired. The president was determined to shut down this investigation. You had an office with files and statements and all kinds of evidence. And you didn't know what was going to happen. Were you - what kinds of conversations did you have among each other, and what did you do to protect yourselves?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: Well, before this happened, in anticipation that it might, we had copied some of the most significant documents. And each of us had taken briefcases of documents to our homes and stored them there just in case. We hoped we would never have to use it because it would have been illegal because they were grand jury materials. And we didn't want to violate any of our ethics and any of the rules. But we felt that there might come a time when our morals required us to do something to protect the country and to protect democracy. Luckily, it never came to that, but we did have that at home.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "After it actually happened, the discussion was, first of all, were we fired or was only Archibald Cox fired? And it appears that the office had been abolished, but we weren't actually fired. And so the discussion was, shall we quit in protest? And we basically decided, and Archibald Cox advised us, do not quit. That would give the president exactly what he wants. You know this case. You should never leave it unless you are forced out. As long as you can do your job, do it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: So after the Saturday Night Massacre, after Nixon fired people attempting to shut down the investigation, it wasn't successful. Leon Jaworski was appointed to - the new special prosecutor, and the case went on. You were tangling with Nixon over the tapes, whether he would supply the nine tapes. Turned out two of them, they said, were missing. And you had to have court hearings over who exactly had custody of these things and what happened to them. You end up in a couple of confrontations with probably the only woman among the Nixon insiders, Rose Mary Woods. Tell us about her.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: Rose Mary Woods was eventually called his executive assistant. At the time, she was his secretary. But she had been with him from the time he was elected to the Senate. She had met him when he was in the House of Representatives and had been very impressed with how he turned in his reimbursement forms. He thought - she thought he was extremely neat and accurate. And he was impressed with her as well and was one of the first people he hired when he became a senator and one of the first people he brought into the White House after he was elected. And she was much more than an assistant to him. She really was an adviser.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And listening to the tapes that aren't relevant to the criminal prosecution, you can hear a lot of conversations between them that show their close personal relationship. Her brother, by the way, was the sheriff of Cook County. And he - Joe Woods - exchanged suits with Richard Nixon, and she exchanged clothes with Pat Nixon. She was known as Aunt Rose by both of the Nixon girls, Tricia and Julie. And she was really a part of the family.", "label": 5}

She's a legal analyst for MSNBC, and she has a new memoir about her days in the 1970s as an assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate investigation. It's called The Watergate Girl. When we left off, she was talking about President Nixon's longtime secretary and executive assistant, Rose Mary Woods, who was close to the first family and an integral part of the administration.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Now, she ends up being a very important figure in this case. People would know her name because it turned out that one of the critical conversations just a few weeks - a short time after the break-in - conversations in the Oval Office had an 18 1/2-minute gap where only a hum appears on the tape, very suspicious. A lot of people in the White House had access, but she ends up on the stand having to explain this. And you were the one cross-examining her. Tell us about that.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: Rose Mary Woods was basically thrown under the bus by the White House counsel. They said we have now discovered as part of the drip, drip, drip of bad news - after the hearing on the first two missing tapes, they came back on the day before Thanksgiving and said, whoops (ph), there is a problem in a third tape. There's an 18 1/2-minute gap, and only Rose Mary Woods can explain it. And we can find no innocent explanation for it, which was really a dramatic announcement. And I had cross-examined her when she first testified about the two missing tapes as basically just a chain of custody witness because she had handled them.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: And she was tough, wasn't she?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: She was feisty for sure. We definitely had a situation where I knew that nothing that I got from her would be easily obtained, that I was going to have to be very precise and careful in my questioning to get information. But at the first time, she wasn't suspected of having done anything. I, by some amazing coincidence, asked her questions that turned out to be devastating once we found out that she had possibly erased 18 1/2 minutes of a tape because she had told me about working on it for 29 hours at Camp David - that very tape - without ever mentioning that, oh, by the way, there was an 18-minute gap in that tape.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And she also - I had asked her about precautions that she had taken to avoid erasing. And she basically screamed at me, well, I used my head. It's the only thing I had to use. And it turned out that wasn't very effective, obviously, because the mistake was made. And when she finally was called the second time to testify, I had to give her her Miranda warnings, which is something that lawyers seldom ever do. But she was now a suspect in a criminal investigation, and so I had to do it before I could ask her any questions.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Right. So she ends up giving this explanation of - and people who remember Watergate will remember this - that it seems the only way she could have erased this, she said the phone rang and she went to pick up the phone but somehow kept her foot on a pedal that was connected to the recording. And then that's what caused the erasure. But what's remarkable about this is that she says, well, it was different in my - when you made a comment about that's awkward, and she says, well, it's different in my office.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: And then you did what?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: I said, well, then let's go to your office and continue the questioning. And for some reason, the court agreed. The White House lawyers agreed. And her lawyers agreed. And so we went to the White House. It was my first time ever in the White House. And she demonstrated they would not - they, the White House - would not let us bring in a photographer.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So I had to rely on Ollie Atkins, who was the president's White House photographer. And the pictures are dramatic proof that her story didn't hold up. She also, just to make it clear, she said she had to make two mistakes. She had to push the wrong button and keep her foot on the pedal, which was a physical impossibility, certainly for 18 minutes. You might have been able to do it for one second but not for any prolonged period of time. So it just wasn't possible.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The pictures made her basically a laughingstock. There were a lot of cartoons about the Rose Mary Twist or the Rose Mary Stretch that were really hard on her, I am sure. It must have been a very devastating thing for her. I got a lot of mail from secretaries around the country saying, I've used that same equipment and it's not possible. No one could do that. It wouldn't work that way.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And then to make it even worse, when the court ordered that we have the tape investigated, we hired a group of professionals in this field, first of all, hoping that we could recover the erased material. But we couldn't. But also what they discovered was that it was not one erasure. There were multiple erasures.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Now, this photo, ironically taken by White House photographers, kind of made Rose Mary Woods a laughingstock because it showed her in this incredibly contorted position where she's stretching, holding her foot on a pedal and reaching for a phone. It just seems kind of ridiculous. Did you have sympathy for her?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: Probably at that moment I didn't. I have an ability to sort of compartmentalize. And I was really compartmentalized on, what questions do I have to ask while listening to her answers so that I can follow up and make sure she's not evading my questions? In retrospect, I definitely have sympathy for her because I know that she may actually believe that she did that, but she certainly didn't.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And I feel badly that the president let her believe that she did it, that the White House blamed her. They withdrew. She was represented initially by White House counsel. They withdrew that and made her hire a private attorney and - which is probably the right thing because if they actually were blaming her, ethically, they shouldn't represent her.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But I'm sure that was an expense and an embarrassment to her. She was certainly more deflated in the second hearing than when she had been called in the first time to testify about how she had handled the tapes.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: And the 18 1/2-minute gap was never officially explained. There was a lot of speculation about it. You write in the book that you have a theory that places Richard Nixon himself as the prime suspect. Why?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: There's a lot of reasons why. He has the motive to erase it because it was the very first tape on our subpoena. Likely, in preparation for whether he was going to give them to us or not, he listened to the tapes. And logically, he would have listened to that one first. My theory is he listened to them and went, oh, this is bad. It shows that I know everything just a few days after the break-in. I can't let people hear that. So he erases it. Then he goes to the second tape and goes, oh, my gosh, they're all bad...", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: Even to this day I remember how devastated and disappointed I was listening because imagining can never be as bad as actually hearing the president committing crimes. And it's not just the expletives, deleted language that was disturbing, but it was the fact that in the Oval Office, these conversations were taking place about paying hush money to make sure that the Watergate burglars never said that they were hired by the White House and the Committee to Reelect, that they were told to commit perjury. One of them was told to leave the country.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And as they planned all this and used unaccounted campaign money, which led to legislation that's been undone by Citizens United, the Supreme Court case, they had so much money that they could spend it. And it's just very disturbing because I was raised to respect the president and the presidency, even if it wasn't someone that I agreed with politically. And so that was a - what I now see as a childhood vision that was just destroyed listening to the president committing crimes.", "label": 5}

And it's available to anyone who wants to listen through the National Archives. You can listen to these tapes. And it's proof beyond doubt of the president's culpability.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You know, one of the things that occurred to me as I read this was the power of being the first to set a narrative in a controversy like this. And in particular, there's this tape on March 21 of 1973 where, in Nixon's office, they're talking about raising a million dollars to ensure the loyalty and silence of the Watergate burglars.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And Nixon says, yeah, we could get a million dollars. And the version that we first heard of this came from one of the president's, you know, inner circle, Bob Haldeman, at the Senate hearings in which he said, yeah, the president said, yes, we could get a million dollars, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Now, I paid a lot of attention to this. And I remembered that as being what he actually said - yes, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong. When you actually got the tape, it didn't say that, did it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: It didn't, and John Dean had told us it didn't. So we knew that it didn't say that. But again, when you listen to it and you're waiting for those words and they don't come, you not only know that Bob Haldeman committed perjury, but you also know that the president was part of a conspiracy to pay hush money. And it proves your case in a way that almost nothing else could have done.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: But the interesting thing to me is that millions of Americans, me among them, believed that the president said it would be wrong, and that's because that was the first narrative we heard. It really matters who gets out in front of a story, doesn't it? (Laughter).", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: It does. And I hate to draw parallels to today, but how can you not when you look at what Attorney General William Barr did in terms of the Mueller report and so many other things? He misled the public and withheld the actual facts until the narrative had been set and people accepted it. And then when the truth came out, people were - well, he said, and I believe that, even though that was completely untrue.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Just for the record, the actual quote from the tapes. The president says, you could get a million dollars, you could get it in cash. I know where it could be gotten. It is not easy, but it could be done. But the question is, who the hell would handle it? Any ideas on that? Nothing about it being wrong.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You have a poignant description of Rose Mary Woods after Nixon resigns.

Tell us a bit about what she does.", "label": 5}

And she wasn't allowed to send mail to the president or communicate with him and eventually became - she said it was like being a B-list celebrity instead of an A-list. It's ironic, but she lived in the Watergate complex and had a nice lifestyle, eventually moving back to her hometown in Ohio and basically being out of the limelight.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I very much would have loved to have interviewed her. I would have loved to have interviewed friends of hers because I really wanted to portray her not just as the stereotypical way she's portrayed. I wanted to portray her as her friends knew her, but none of them would talk to me. They felt that I was the enemy, and I felt I just was doing my job and now would like to portray her fully. I did as much research as I could, tried so many people. Bob Woodward advised me to stop calling people and to actually knock on their door because it would be harder to slam the door in my face. And guess what? I went to interview someone who knew her quite well, and they slammed the door in my face.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You said that she had - when she was at the Executive Office Building in the days following Nixon's departure that she maintained a little shrine to Nixon. What was it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: She kept all of his personal belongings exactly as they were, including an ashtray with a half-smoked cigar.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: I wanted to just ask about the current president. I mean, it's clear that you believe from the facts and the law that impeachment and removal for office was warranted. As it turned out, you know, the refusal of the Senate to consider additional testimony and evidence and the swift acquittal of President Trump has left him in a perhaps stronger position than he might have been without it. Certainly, that's the view of Mitch McConnell, who said that this was a political blunder for the Democrats. You know, your area is law, not politics. But I'm just wondering, was it wise, do you think, for House Democrats to pursue the course they did?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "WINE-BANKS: I think it was. And it's easier to say that as a nonpolitician, but I don't think that leaving a president who does the things that President Trump has done unaccountable is acceptable. And yes, his acquittal means that he is now with no guardrails and may do even worse things in the next few months before the election. And if he happens to be reelected, his second term will be even more horrible in terms of violations of the law. So I think it was the right thing to do. I don't think it leaves him any stronger. Over 80% of the country believes that there should have been witnesses, that there should have been documents, that this was a sham trial. And I think that what we're going to find is that Americans are going to hold their senators responsible for cutting this off. To me, one of the most painful things was listening to the not guilties after senators had said, well, yes, he's guilty, he's done these things. Yes, the evidence is overwhelming. They weren't just saying unimpeachable. They had to say the words not guilty, and that was just not correct.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Below are some of the most revealing pieces we read.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Here at Code Switch, my teammate Gene Demby wrote about about how white nationalists are edging their movement out of the shadows:", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader and University of Virginia alum who coined the term 'alt-right,' would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. 'If you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs,' Spencer told The Atlantic last year, not long after the election. 'By 2015, gay marriage is popular. What is possible has shifted. That's what the alt-right is doing. It's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.' ", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Code Switch alum Matt Thompson, now executive editor at The Atlantic, riffed on the brazenness of the white supremacists who marched this weekend, compared with Klan members of decades past who hid under white hoods. The shameless return of white supremacy into America's public spaces seems to be happening by degrees, and quickly, Thompson wrote.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Dara Lind, a reporter at Vox who wrote an explainer of the rally and its origins, described it as a coming-out party for resurgent white nationalism in America.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Nathan Guttman, a reporter with Forward, an online news site aimed at Jewish Americans, penned a vivid piece about covering the march. He recounted watching as Spencer launched into a rant about the mayor of Charlottesville, Michael Signer.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": " '[L]ittle Mayor Signer — SEE-NER — how do you pronounce this little creep's name?' asked Richard Spencer, a right-wing leader who dreams of a 'white ethnostate,' as he stood on a bench under a tree to rally his troops, deprived of their protest. The crowd knew exactly how to pronounce his name: 'Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew' some shouted out. The rest burst out in laughter. And that was one of the only moments of levity the alt-right audience gathered under the tree enjoyed.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And Jia Tolentino, a writer for The New Yorker and a graduate of the University of Virginia, meditated on Charlottesville's progressive guise and ability to hide its dark racial past. While I was at U.V.A., the fact that slaves had built the school was hardly discussed, and the most prominent acknowledgment that Jefferson was a slave owner came on Valentine's Day, when signs went up all over campus that said 'TJ ♥s Sally.' ", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Many writers also took on the response from President Trump, whose initial reaction to the violence in Charlottesville criticized equally both sides of the protest. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, Trump said, in remarks that brought condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Writing for The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb parsed Trump's initial response further:", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "We have seen a great number of false equivalencies in the past two years, and the most recent Presidential election was defined by them. Yet it remains striking to hear Trump imply that Nazis and the interracial group of demonstrators who gathered to oppose them were, in essence, equally wrong. It would have been naïve to expect the President to unambiguously condemn neo-Confederates (Heritage, not hate, etc.), but Nazis? For reasons that are not hard to discern, the swastika, at least in the United States, has always been more clearly legible as a symbol of racial bigotry than the Confederate flag.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, lambasted Trump in a Washington Post piece, writing that the current president was incapable of speaking for the nation in the face of tragedy:", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If great words can heal and inspire, base words can corrupt. Trump has been delivering the poison of prejudice in small but increasing doses. In Charlottesville, the effect became fully evident. And the president had no intention of decisively repudiating his work. What do we do with a president who is incapable or unwilling to perform his basic duties? What do we do when he is incapable of outrage at outrageous things? What do we do with a president who provides barely veiled cover for the darkest instincts of the human heart? These questions lead to the dead end of political realism — a hopeless recognition of limited options. But the questions intensify.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "On Monday, Trump responded to the increasing pressure to react more forcefully, and gave a stronger rebuke. Racism is evil, Trump said. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.", "label": 5}

When he acted in that way, he was operating according to his instinct. And his instinct said: Do not attack the white supremacists.", "label": 5}

The second is what the source - what was the source of money? And I think what's interesting about the last 48 hours is that there's been - the waters have been muddied considerably. So there was an existing narrative about why the payments were made, about the source of the money. And now...", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "SANDERSON: ...That it was not related to the election - that it was purely to help him personally and to save his marriage, et cetera. But now with the entrance of Rudy Giuliani and his appearances in media, I think that that narrative is now much less clear than it was previously.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SIMON: Well, let me ask you about precedents. And a lot of people have referred to the John Edwards defense. This, of course, former Democratic presidential candidate who was acquitted by a jury and convinced them that he had made payments. Gosh, I'm trying to remember. It involved the birth of a child to a campaign aide who decided that he would identify himself as the father. And he said, look, that wasn't to save my campaign. It was to save my marriage and the mortal embarrassment of my wife, Elizabeth Edwards, who was, then, mortally ill.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SANDERSON: Yeah. So there have been a number of commentators that have drawn comparisons with that case. I think the differences are that this - the circumstantial evidence - the timing of the payment, most notably - seems to be much more related to the election. Michael Cohen had an opportunity. When Stormy Daniels was originally making noise about their affair several years ago, he could've made a payment back then. He chose not to. They sent just a letter. But shortly before the election, Michael Cohen did make that payment, apparently.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so the - just the circumstances are much different than the Edwards case. They couldn't ever tie it directly to the election. And there was really no smoking gun. We have - it remains to be seen now in this case whether there is a smoking gun.

{"sentence": "SIMON: In the under a minute we have left, ethics and morality aside, if I might make that a parenthetical, how big a legal problem would this be for President Trump?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "SANDERSON: Well, it is a - fundamentally, a reporting problem. And the whole reason we have these reporting obligations for candidates is that voters are supposed to be able to look at the finance reports and base their votes on information. That's a potential problem for him, that the report - this payment was never reported.

{"sentence": "DAVID EDELSTEIN, BYLINE: Have you ever thought about the idea that in American space-alien-invasion movies, extraterrestrials have no problem mastering the King's English? Well, Arrival is different. Communication between earthlings and aliens doesn't happen at the start. It's the source of the suspense, what the movie builds to, because you can't know what ETs want if you can't ask and they can't answer. Are they here to exterminate us? To save us? Who can interpret their weird burbles? A linguist maybe. Her name is Dr. Louise Banks, played by Amy Adams. The aliens have arrived in vessels that look like titanic, mile-high wedges, which hover in seemingly random spots all over the planet. No one knows their intentions. Out of nowhere, Forest Whitaker as a military colonel descends on Louisa's very nice lake house in a very loud chopper and plays her a recording.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "WHITAKER: (As Colonel Weber) And now you heard it. What do you make of it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "AMY ADAMS: (As Dr. Louise Banks) Is that...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "EDELSTEIN: Louise's intrigued. Who wouldn't be? And what follows is a tantalizing puzzle. She goes to the alien ship. Her body is sucked into a long, vertical entryway where she has to adapt to changes in pressure and gravity. Then she moves into a dark chamber where the aliens - they're dubbed heptapods - melt out of a mist behind a transparent partition. The strangeness is intoxicating. The director, Denis Villeneuve, has a gift for making that kind of strangeness seem like the human condition, the real reality. As in his films Incendies, Prisoners and Sicario, he mixes penetrating closeups with chill, blurred backgrounds. It's as if his characters live in a void where they're forced to rethink everything they thought they knew. What Louise senses is that her job won't be to learn a new vocabulary. Mastering the heptapod syntax might require a change in our brains, which might even end up challenging the concept of linear time. Arrival is based on The Story Of Your Life, a short story by the brainy sci-fi cult author Ted Chiang, and the part of the movie that's closest to its source is great stuff. Chiang's story isn't really about an invasion. The invasion is a device for exploring what happens as we move from a universe of Newtonian cause-and-effect into the realm of quantum physics. That idea is in the film, and it's riveting. But there's another equally insistent plot straight from the '50s sci-fi B-movie playbook.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Before Louise even figures out how to talk to the heptapods, she must square off against a hawkish military. For some reason, the fate of the entire world comes to rest on a stereotypical warmongering Chinese general named Shang who wants to start blasting before he even knows the aliens' intentions, let alone capabilities. It's so clunky. Thank heaven for Amy Adams who makes even the silliest parts of the movie work. She's a grounded actress, direct, plain-spoken, but there's also something brittle about her, mysteriously brittle, as if there's been some trauma in her past and she can't quite breakthrough into the moment. That quality is perfect for Louise, who seems to be searching for self as well as scientific knowledge. When the aliens arrive, she's in mourning for a lost daughter who's seen in dislocating flashes. Somehow the heptapods hold the key to her past. Her eyes come alive when she first beholds their writing, which looks like exquisite ink paintings on air currents that seem like water, as if squids were doing Japanese calligraphy. When the revelations come, they're shocking and very moving. You just have to put that other part of Arrival with the B-movie general out of your mind. The film is an inadvertent demonstration that Hollywood studios and visionary science fiction writers inhabit a different time-space continuum.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "1. The state contains significant numbers of both evangelicals and moderates", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Iowa was tailored for a Christian-conservative candidate, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and New Hampshire gave a jolt to centrist, establishment figures like Kasich, the Ohio governor, and it solidified Trump's dominance across the board. In South Carolina, all of those elements combine.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In 2012, two-thirds (65 percent) of GOP primary voters described themselves as born-again, evangelical Christians. But almost one-third also described themselves as moderate. In Iowa this year, a similar 64 percent of caucus-goers were evangelical, but only 14 percent were self-described moderates. In New Hampshire, just 23 percent of voters were white evangelicals, while a lower 24 percent were moderates.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "-- The Upstate: The most socially conservative, religious voters are clustered in the Upstate, anchored by Greenville and Spartanburg and home to fundamentalist Bob Jones University. On Friday, most GOP candidates were at the famed college for a Faith and Family Presidential Forum, talking up their socially conservative values on abortion and same-sex marriage. Only Trump, who's come under fire for his obscenities and previous support of same-sex marriage, didn't attend.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "-- Lowcountry: The more moderate, heavily military and veteran Lowcountry is where Bush, the former Florida governor, is focusing most of his attention. It's where strategists in the state say he could be surprisingly strong.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "-- Midlands: In 2008, conservative candidates split support in the Upstate, and Arizona Sen. John McCain ran strong in the establishment-minded Midlands and Lowcountry for a win. In 2000, McCain was also strong in the Lowcountry, which includes Charleston and Hilton Head, but George W. Bush beat him out in the rest of the state to claim victory.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "3. Debates could sway the race", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "South Carolina prides itself on being the decider in GOP politics. Before 2012, it had correctly picked every eventual since 1980. But struggling former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had a breakout debate performance just days before the primary there in 2012. He defended against questions about his personal life and wound up breaking the streak. That helped sway much of the support statewide toward him and helped him earn a decisive victory. (Gingrich looked like he had momentum coming out of South Carolina, but a flush-with-cash superPAC supporting Romney, tore down Gingrich as the contest moved to Florida.)", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Rubio's poor performance last Saturday hurt him in New Hampshire, where he finished a disappointing fifth. He needs a strong performance tonight to assuage concerns he's too scripted and too inexperienced. But if another candidate has a breakout performance, they could grab the momentum in South Carolina. Trump, for example, is already being attacked over his own personal life, much like Gingrich was, but good parrying of those attacks could give him a lock in a state where he's already leading in polls.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "4. Black voters will be decisive on the Democratic side", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The South Carolina primary for Democrats will be the first significant measure of African-American voters in a state. Eight years ago, black voters made up 55 percent of the Democratic electorate in the state. Polls have shown that's a demographic Sanders, the Vermont independent, has struggled with compared to Clinton. But coming off strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, and closing the gap with Clinton nationally, Sanders could well be competitive.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "His campaign believes the more non-white voters hear his message, the more they'll be open to voting for him. There's at least some evidence that Sanders is benefiting from a generational divide even among non-white voters, NPR's Sam Sanders reports. There hasn't been any South Carolina polling on the Democratic side yet after Iowa and New Hampshire, though.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Clinton has been emphasizing her support in the African-American community, touting the endorsement of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC this week. Civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis was dismissive of Sanders, saying he had seen evidence of the Clintons' work to gain equal rights but not Sanders's.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Clinton also led in South Carolina in 2008, but those leads evaporated once Barack Obama proved he could win in lily-white Iowa. He not only carried the black vote 78 percent to 19 percent over Clinton, but he also won with women (also a majority) and young voters. Sanders has been beating Clinton by huge margins with young voters, and even won women in New Hampshire.", "label": 5}

Shanghai's Fudan University also deleted principles like freedom of thought, and did so publicly, as if expecting praise.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "Fudan is one of at least three universities that have revised their charters since 2018, emphasizing unswerving loyalty to the Communist Party, an NPR analysis found. They have downgraded or erased language about academic freedom from their charters, while adding a new clause: The university Communist Party committee is the core leadership of the school.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The move is part of a broader trend that has been growing since 2013, the year Xi Jinping became China's president. From 2013 to 2017, at least 109 universities unveiled their first-ever charters, affirming party leadership, according to NPR's analysis.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "A 'Home Baked' Childhood: When The Family Business Is Marijuana Brownies", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Growing up in San Francisco in the '70s, Alia Volz's family ran a booming weed-laced brownie business. I had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning, she says.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. Our guest, Alia Volz, writes that before she could spell her own name, she knew she was from an outlaw family. In the late '70s when she was a baby and a toddler, her parents had a roaring business baking and selling marijuana-laced brownies. Thousands a month to hippies, artists, office workers and activists in San Francisco. Volz often made the rounds with her mom, selling their wares to grateful customers every Friday. As colorful as that sounds - and it was - it's no less interesting than another story told in her new memoir, the tale of her parents' relationship.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Two free-spirited psychics who made their way in a city of enormous cultural and social change - the explosion of the counterculture, the growth of the Gay Liberation Movement, the horror of the AIDS epidemic, as well as the assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk and the suicides in Guyana of the followers of Jim Jones, whose Peoples Temple was an influential presence in the city for years. Alia Volz's writing has appeared in The Best American Essays 2017, The New York Times and other publications. Her new book is Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco. Like many of you, I'm working from home these days. I spoke to Alia Volz, who was at her office in San Francisco.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Alia Volz, welcome to FRESH AIR. This book is, in part, about the city of San Francisco. And your mom was there, I guess, in the mid and late '70s. It was a city undergoing remarkable change. Just paint a little bit of a picture. What was going on at the scene at Fisherman's Wharf, the performances? Give us a sense of it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "ALIA VOLZ: Of course. Well, San Francisco in the 1970s was coming out of the Summer of Love, this huge influx of young people who'd come out to experiment with new lifestyles. That was very much over. But all kinds of new subcultures were flourishing. The way that I think about it sometimes is if the '60s were a sketchpad, the '70s would be the box of crayons. There was just wonderful and crazy experimentation. Some of it went horribly awry. And some of it was spectacular.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So the scene down at Fisherman's Wharf was one of the spectacular emergences. There were, actually, at the time, thousands of artists and crafts people who sold to tourists on the street all kinds of things they made themselves. And there was a busking scene of people like Robin Williams and Penn and Teller and magicians and tap dancers and musicians and whole dance troupes - this really elaborate scene that was called the New Vaudeville.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Right. And then, through all this, there was your mom with Sticky Fingers Brownies, the marijuana-laced brownies, which, at its height, was, you know, moving something like 2,800 brownies a week - your mom and an interesting crew of others that distributed these. What's interesting is that this wasn't the kind of operation where you'd knock on the door and get a password. Explain how this enterprise connected with its customers.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: My mom came up with this really innovative business plan where she sold exclusively to people on the job. So she would go around to boutiques and restaurants and real estate offices and even medical offices and only sell to the people who were working. They would buy at large volume and then redistribute the brownies through their own social circles.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And in this way, the brownies were really all over town. By late 1977, I think, is when they were doing 10,000 brownies a month. It was smart in that there was no fixed location for police to find. The brownies seemed to come from everywhere. And at the same time, it enabled them to reach all of the little culture pockets that were flourishing in the late '70s.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You were born while the business was going. And after your mom recovered from the birth, she started bringing you along on her deliveries. What was that like? What did you learn about how she carried you, kind of how you fit into this whole thing?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: My mom, from the beginning, she just sort of took me everywhere. And so in the early days of Sticky Fingers, this meant that I went on brownie runs with her. First, she had me in a front carrier, then on a Gerry carrier and, eventually, in the stroller. And she would hang duffel bags of brownies from the back bars of the stroller because they were very heavy.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So she would use the stroller to transport the brownies. And we'd go from business to business. And her customers just absolutely adored me and fawned over me. So I was very little. Obviously, I don't remember much clearly from this period. But I do have these flashes of memory. And there's a certain feeling that comes to me when I think of it. It was a very exuberant period in the city and especially in the Castro, where my mom was mostly working. And there was, I think, a lot of cheek-pinching and fawning and a lot of joy around it is the feeling that I get, anyway.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: The business was still going when you were a toddler and, I guess, into kindergarten, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Yes. Well, in some form or another, it continued until I was an adult. But this original iteration carried on until about second or third grade.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Which meant that you as a kid had to keep a really big, important secret, a family secret. Do you remember being told what the stakes were or how you knew?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: No. And I know that seems strange. But it was something that I learned so young that I don't have a specific memory about it. It was always who we are. So I had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: And did you know that that could mean prison and, you know, foster care for you? Or...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: To an extent. My parents weren't trying to scare me with it. But from a practical standpoint, they needed me to understand that what we were doing was illegal and that if I told anyone, including other children - who might tell an adult - it could have very serious consequences for our family. So I did know from the very beginning that if I told anyone what my parents really did that they could go to prison.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: And do you remember ever finding that hard, you know, as you got a little older and had friends?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Not in a very conscious way. Although, I think it did affect me. I was a child who always enjoyed hanging out with adults and was awkward around other children. And I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. As an adult, I look back at it and wonder how much of that might have come out of the idea of carrying a big secret and how that makes you build walls around it and how that makes you shut down, in some ways. At the time, I wasn't very conscious of it. I just - I had a pat answer for when people asked what my parents did. And I knew very clearly that there were huge parts of our home life that I couldn't talk about.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: What was the pat answer when kids asked what your parents did?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Which is also true. So it wasn't an outright lie. It was a withholding of information.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: And so while you had this secret and you knew that you were an outlaw family, it was illegal, did it ever seem wrong to you?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: No. My parents, I think, like a lot of hippies, a lot of people from their generation, saw marijuana as wholesome and harmless. And I was taught that the legislation around it and the government's view of it was wrong and that what they were doing was right. So I grew up with that idea that we were outlaws, but good outlaws - kind of like Robin Hood outlaws. And I didn't question that for a long time.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Well, it came from the people you loved and trusted, right?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: It did. And I think that by the time I was maybe old enough to really question those ideas myself, the role of marijuana had changed so much culturally that I had a whole different answer.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You know, you write in the book that brownie crumbs blanketed the floor where you played. Between secondhand smoke, secret finger swipes of batter and stolen crumbs, you - the tots probably consumed a significant amount of cannabis. And there was some drug use among your parents and your friends beyond marijuana, you know, a lot of cocaine. You know, there are people who would be appalled reading this. What's your take on this? Did you ever feel like any of this seemed irresponsible in retrospect?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: In retrospect, sure, of course. I feel in general that marijuana is relatively harmless. It's certainly not something that should be consumed by children. And I want to be clear that I don't think I was tottering around stoned during my childhood. I was certainly discouraged from consuming marijuana as a kid. It was grown-up stuff. That was something that I understood.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But it was around. It was so much a part of the environment that it would be unreasonable to assume that I didn't inhale it as secondhand smoke. And of course, the brownies taste like chocolate, so I'm sure I snuck some. But it's not like I was - you know, it's not like my parents were feeding me pot brownies. I want to be really clear about that. Where I think it might be more damaging is with the harder drugs. Cocaine is a substance that alters one's personality in a fairly significant way. So there's that. But I also want to say that all of the kids growing up in the Sticky Fingers warehouse came out just fine. We're all responsible adults and contributors to society. So...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: I don't want to be an apologist, either. So, you know, clearly, this was not an ideal situation.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: On the other hand, I mean, it sounds like you felt very much loved and accepted, which probably has a lot more to do with how a kid grows up than what they necessarily inhale or eat.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Absolutely. I - you know, I want to say that I was so well cared for and surrounded by love and affection. I was not left to run wild. I was looked after - basically, at my mom's hip through my entire childhood. So there's no neglect in that.", "label": 5}

She believed him, and it turned out that he was right. She began to show. It became obvious. So that is a kind of a story, kind of a myth that I grew up with. I don't know how many people have these really high and magical myths about their births (laughter), but I sure had one.

He just had to get it off his chest. And I think that she told my mom. And then he, later on, during a big fight, he told her in an angry way. So my mom found out fairly shortly thereafter.

And when you went to ask him, is this true that you went to a gay bathhouse after your child was born, what was his reaction?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: He didn't remember, which seems convenient and perhaps was. But I should say about my dad and his epilepsy that the grand mal seizures would wipe out huge chunks of his memory, and there are many things that he wishes he remembers that he can't. He's a good custodian of the memories that he has, and they check out with my research and with the stories that other people I interviewed told. But there are huge episodes, huge swaths that are simply not there, and this was part of what wasn't there.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So I talk about my father and I reconciling, and confronting him about this moment was very difficult. It was difficult for me, and it was difficult for him. It upset him. And one of the things that I think really helped us come back together is that when this happened, he got very quiet, and he asked who was saying it. And when I said that it was both Cheryl and my mom who had told me this, he accepted it and took some ownership for the action. It made him very sad, you know, to think of having done that, right? I thought it was very brave of him to allow that to be the story.", "label": 5}

Her new memoir describes her mother's successful business serving marijuana-laced brownies in the 1970s in San Francisco and her parents' relationship at a time of cultural and social change in the city. Volz's book is Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "This operation got pretty big. Your mom was moving something like 2,800 brownies a week at its height. How did she manage the risk? I mean, this was, after all, a Class 1 narcotic. You know, these were felonies every day or every week. How did she manage the risk of it?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: OK. So this is kind of, I want to say, a ridiculous part of the story. Although, I think my parents would disagree. But my mom - both of my parents, actually, believed strongly in the occult and specifically the I Ching, which is a 4,000-year-old Chinese divination method rooted in Daoism and Confucianism. And you would consult it in the way that you might consult tarot cards. And my mom believed wholeheartedly in this practice.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so every week, she would throw the I Ching coins and ask about their safety and ask about the risk. And she always did what the I Ching said. I mean, the business opened following an I Ching hexagram. There was a point when the business closed following an I Ching hexagram. There was no question too big or too small to run past the I Ching.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You know, your dad had a habit of not taking his medication for epilepsy, which led to some really troubling and bizarre incidents at times. It was one point where he said he had to go off hitchhiking to meet the Dalai Lama. And other things like that happened. Do you have insight into why he chose not to take the medicine for the epilepsy?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: I've done a lot of thinking about this. And I think it's pretty interesting. My dad has a spiritual relationship - or had a spiritual relationship with his epilepsy. He described that in the moments leading up to a seizure, his pre-seizure aura would appear in his peripheral vision as a multi-colored mandala with all colors of the spectrum, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He describes it as being like looking at God. And my dad is such a spiritually serious person that this really attracted him.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "And so I think he would kind of edge up to it. He didn't want to deny himself that connection with the Godhead that he felt was there. And so he would try to control his seizures internally. At a point, he had a method where he thought that if - when the mandala appeared, if he shifted his eyes hard in the opposite direction, he could stop himself from having a seizure. So he kept trying to control it.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But he would have these grand mal seizures. And sometimes they led to psychological instability, as well as memory loss. But I find it fascinating because the idea of a spiritually associated seizure is not new. Dostoyevsky wrote rapturously about seizures. And some pretty interesting historical figures have been posthumously diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. So I don't know if my dad might be in that category. In any case, it was a strong force in his life.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Yeah. Does he still have seizures today?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: He takes, not Dilantin, but another medication. I think it's Tegretol. And he says he hasn't had a seizure in 20 years.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You know, you mentioned that your mom would often make business decisions and life decisions often by consulting the I Ching, you know, this way of tossing these coins to get a reading on what should be done. I'm wondering, as a kid, did you ever feel like your life was being governed by these forces that couldn't be seen? That ever bother you?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: (Laughter) That question makes me laugh a little bit. So as a child, I was pretty accepting of especially my mom's worldview. I had a lot of trust in her. She was always cool in a crisis. And I believed that she knew what she was doing. My parents, I would say, did not use the I Ching to decide what I should or shouldn't be allowed to do. I didn't have a whole lot of rules as a child. I kind of felt like I was part of the decision-making process to a degree that, I think, is pretty unusual.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But my relationship with the I Ching as a kid was that I trusted it. And the fact that my mom felt confident using it made me feel confident as well. So I sometimes think about how, you know, the knowledge that my parents could have gone to prison at any time, how that should have been terrifying to me as a kid. And yet, it didn't keep me awake at night because I trusted my mom's decision-making abilities. And I trusted the I Ching then. It was later, more as a teenager, that I was like, oh, no. Wait. Science (laughter), you know? And I started to rebel more against the idea. But it's really only as an adult that I look back at the situation we were in and worry about the kid I was.", "label": 5}

It also deals with Volz's parents' relationship and some remarkable events in San Francisco at the time. Her book is called Home Baked.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "One of the things that you do in the book is you talk about kind of the history of San Francisco. And in the 1970s, there was all of this kind of explosion of creativity and art and experimentation. But there was also some really dark stuff. You know, the Peoples Temple, which was led by Jim Jones, was active in the city and very connected to a lot of the liberal politicians. And then there was the horrific assassinations of the mayor, Moscone, and then the supervisor, the councilman, Harvey Milk that, I guess, was not a customer of your mom, but somebody that she met on her rounds a lot. How did all of that affect her?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Well, first of all, so Harvey was not a customer. He had sworn off drugs. But his camera shop, which was also his campaign headquarters, was one of my mom's regular stops because other people around him and who were working on his campaign were customers. So that was how that connection happened. But he was very much out in the neighborhood walking around, talking to people. He was very personable and very connected to the community. And so my mom knew him.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "The Jonestown Massacre and the assassinations of Milk and Moscone happened within 10 days of each other. It was like a one-two punch. It just knocked San Francisco completely sideways. I mean, 918 people dead in one day. And then these two very important and beloved civic leaders ten days later. For my mom, it was a seismic shift, a feeling of everything is changing. She describes becoming aware, in an instant, that the wave that they had been riding was about to crash.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Right. And so not so long after, there was - finally, the business came to an end - or at least its first end. Do you want to describe the circumstances of that?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Sure. We were talking about the I Ching earlier. And suddenly, in mid-1979, my mom goes to throw her usual weekly hexagrams. And the passage is really dark. The results are bad. And the imagery in the passages has to do with imprisonment and punishment and things like that. And she became fairly convinced - well, very convinced very quickly that they were going to be busted. And the business was huge at this time. And, I mean, everybody knew about them. It was a little - maybe a little too high-profile. And she became sure that they were going to get busted. So my parents, taking this extremely seriously, packed up, closed up shop. And we moved out of San Francisco within two weeks.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You moved out of San Francisco. And there's an eight-year stretch of your childhood. And you described them as pretty tough. You know, your parents' relationship fell apart, in part, because, you know, your dad would not take the medicine for his epilepsy and had some pretty strange experiences. Your mom ends up reviving the business kind of with once-a-month trips into San Francisco from where they were living outside of town.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "As you moved into the '80s, the brownie business changed in a way, right? It wasn't just recreational because it became a way to ease the suffering of people afflicted with AIDS. And this was at a time when the epidemic was, you know, poorly understood scientifically. There was little treatment. And it was, you know, deeply associated with homophobia. As your mom made these trips to the city, how did the epidemic present itself to her?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: She remembers one day in December of 1981 walking down Castro Street, making her deliveries. And in the window of Star Pharmacy, there was a poster that said gay cancer. And it had photographs of a man's legs and feet with little purple spots on them, which turned out to be Kaposi's sarcoma. And my mom saw that poster and just thought, that's strange. I saw one of those spots on one of my friend's wrist today. It just was a little thing. And then, pretty quickly, people started to get sick.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "But the illnesses varied a lot. And there was a long time when nobody knew what it was. Some people got the Pneumocystis carinii. Some people had the wasting syndrome and terrible diarrhea. Some people had the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. The variety of presentations of the symptom made the onset very mysterious. And it didn't get a lot of press at first because it emerged first within the gay male population. And this was a community that broader society was maybe eager not to look at and not to acknowledge.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: As you and your mom made these deliveries, did you find people who you had known for years and years getting sicker and sicker?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Yeah. Of course. So as a kid, it was something that I was - of course I was aware of it. You would see - the presentation of AIDS was so dramatic physically. And it could happen very quickly. We'd be gone for a month and come back the next month. And somebody who had been a beautiful 30-year-old would look 70.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "It was really striking, you know, the weight loss and the way that it transformed how people carried themselves. Suddenly, a young man would be using a walker. It was terrible. And then people started to disappear. As a child, I only understood so much, you know? As the years passed, I came to understand what was going on. And people began to disappear from our lives.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: And part of the business was actually finding people who needed the relief that marijuana would bring. There was another woman named Mary Jane Rathbun, who had been making and distributing marijuana brownies. She became known as - what? - Brownie Mary, as supposed to your mom, who was the brownie lady. And they kind of got...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: ...Fused (laughter) in the civic consciousness. But...", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: ...In a way, they had a place in the sort of recognition of the medical benefits of marijuana, didn't they?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Oh, absolutely. So there had been, since maybe the mid-'70s, the beginnings of a medical marijuana movement. But it really had not made it into the press in a significant way. And it was very small. And marijuana was still, in the American consciousness, not considered a medicine. It was considered a party drug. Well, the situation with HIV/AIDS was that the first effective drug treatment didn't come out until 1996. It was 15 years. And this is a disease with an 80-plus percent fatality rate. Let that sink in for a moment.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So during that span of time when there was just nothing for people to do to take care of themselves, cannabis emerged really early on as helpful with some of the symptoms. Nobody thought weed was going to cure AIDS (laughter). But it helped with the wasting syndrome, which manifested with a total loss of appetite and crushing nausea. Cannabis was good for that. It helped with insomnia, depression, pain. So people began to turn to cannabis to help feel a little better while this horrible, horrible thing was going on. And in the case of the wasting syndrome, it helped them eat. It helped them hang on longer. It became very important.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: Was your mom ever recognized, officially, for any of this stuff?", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Not back then, and I'll tell you why - she never got busted. And so she certainly wasn't going to announce herself in the press. And one of the things that's interesting in the Brownie Mary and Mer the Brownie Lady confusion - so they were both part of the same zeitgeist. Well, poor Brownie Mary kept getting busted. And she had a wonderful way of handling the press. She was grandmotherly and funny, very, very witty and adorable. And the press just loved her. They just ate it up. And so she, possibly more than anyone, was responsible for bringing the concept of medical marijuana to broader society. And my mom, meanwhile, stayed underground. She didn't get busted. She didn't go to the press. But she worked throughout all of these years to get edibles to people who needed them.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVIES: You're in San Francisco today, when the rules are all so different. I don't know. Just reflect on that, how different it is, the attitude towards cannabis and its availability.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "VOLZ: Well, yeah, San Francisco has changed quite a bit. With respect to cannabis, it is now legal for adult use. And San Francisco and then California were first in denoting cannabis as an essential business during coronavirus, which was a watershed moment. Nothing like that has happened before. So cannabis is very accessible to people. I feel that, at least for adults, that it should be. I think this is a good thing. But the culture has changed so much around it in ways that I find very heartbreaking.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "So for - you know, my mom had the first really high-volume delivery service. Now you can use an app to summon a company like Eaze and a complete stranger will show up to your door with a lanyard. You don't exchange more than five words, and you pay for it with a debit card. The community aspect has completely run out of the process. The current canna-business (ph) laws are also extremely harmful to small farmers, who were the ones who kept this all going during the '70s and '80s. So some of the changes have really stripped the community-building feelings out of it. At the same time, I'm glad that people have access, especially those who use it for medicinal purposes.", "label": 5}

Film critic David Edelstein has this review of The Salesman.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "DAVID EDELSTEIN, BYLINE: A woman is brutally assaulted in the early part of Asghar Farhadi's gripping Iranian drama The Salesman. The woman, Rana, is washing up in the bathroom of her new apartment in an unfamiliar part of Tehran, just home from acting in Arthur Miller's Death Of A Salesman, where she plays Willy Loman's wife. She hears the buzzer from downstairs and thinks it's her husband, Emad, who plays Willy. So she unlocks the door and returns to what she was doing.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Later when Emad does get home, he sees blood everywhere. He finds Rana in the hospital where the wounds on her face are being stitched. She won't talk about what happened, not then, not a few days later. The nature of the assault, a description of the assailant, the motive, it's a blank to be filled by Emad's churning suspicions and fears. That blank is central to many of Farhadi's films. His Oscar-winning A Separation turns on a woman's unseen fall in a staircase.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Not knowing what happened makes us consider the destructive social forces that helped put that woman on that staircase at that time. In my favorite movie of Farhadi's, About Elly, a young female teacher disappears while visiting colleagues at their beach house. As they learn more about their absent guest, the focus subtly shifts to the trauma of her life and by implication, the lives of many working single women in modern Iran.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "As much as whodunits, Farhadi makes what-done-its and why-done-its. The director has a detached, rather clinical style, as if he's photographing specimens in a terrarium, the terrarium being a city in which artists have to watch their backs because of hovering sensors. His own social criticisms are oblique. The movie begins with the imminent collapse of Rana and Emad's lovely apartment, a literal collapse, the result of apparently careless citywide construction.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Their new shabbier apartment has items belonging to the evicted previous tenant and her small child, whose bike is still there. That tenant apparently had clients, meaning johns, and Emad suspects the person who assaulted his wife might have been one or else was sent by the woman to harass the new tenants. When he finds a set of keys dropped by the attacker and the van parked nearby they belong to, Emad wants vengeance. But Rana is impossible to pin down.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Her devastation lingers. She even insists on showering in her old, collapsing apartment. But she doesn't want to go to the police. The inaction in the middle section of The Salesman is excruciating. And there's a broader aspect to the film. Slowly, we begin to see the parallels between this event and Death Of A Salesman, in which Willy's son learns that his dad is seeing a prostitute, which helps drive the old man to suicide. More, I cannot say, except that I didn't draw too many breaths during the last half hour.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "I can't praise too highly the performances of Shahab Hosseini as the increasingly fevered Emad and longtime Farhadi collaborator Taraneh Alidoosti as Rana, whose wordless despair gives the movie's final section so much of its power. Farid Sajjadi Hosseini plays an older man who shows up late and all but owns the movie. The Salesman is nominated for this year's foreign language feature Academy Award, but it's unclear if Farhadi would be able to attend the ceremony given the presidential order banning citizens of certain countries from visiting the U.S. He has said, in any case, that he won't come.", "label": 5}

For people who are civil rights advocates, they've been clear for some time now that discrimination on the basis of who and what people are goes against our most basic and fundamental laws.

But I simply think that discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation and, in this instance, specifically transgender people, is simply wrong. It should be wrong. It's a matter of law.

{"sentence": "This is FRESH AIR. I'm TV critic David Bianculli, sitting in for Terry Gross. Today's show is dominated by song and dance. First up, we'll listen back to an archive interview with Gwen Verdon, the Broadway actress and dancer who electrified audiences in everything from Can-Can and Damn Yankees to Chicago. Along with one of her husbands, choreographer and film director Bob Fosse, she's the subject of a new FX miniseries called Fosse/Verdon, which premieres next Tuesday. Let's begin with my review of FX's Fosse/Verdon.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "If you're a musical theater fan, just the title Fosse/Verdon is enough to make this new FX miniseries one of the most exciting TV prospects of the year. Gwen Verdon, who originated the onstage characters of Lola in Damn Yankees and Roxie Hart in Chicago, was one of the best dancers on Broadway. Bob Fosse's particular style as both choreographer and movie director was dazzlingly different and, captured in such films as Cabaret, still crackles with energy. This eight-part drama sets out to tell how they met, collaborated, fell in love, got married and had a daughter. But that's only part of the story, which is about a relationship that keeps going long after the marriage has been dissolved.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Two of the executive producers of Fosse/Verdon should be noted at the start. One is Nicole Fosse, the real-life daughter of Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon. Another is Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose Broadway success with Hamilton has been nothing short of phenomenal. His presence alone suggests that the musical numbers recreated here will be done with precision and reverence, and they are. And while her presence dictates that this biography of her parents is authorized, it is not an entirely flattering portrayal of either of them. The portrayals, however, are so good, it's almost a relief.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "Gwen Verdon is played by Michelle Williams, who's come a long way from the WB's Dawson's Creek, and she was good even there. In Manchester By The Sea, Brokeback Mountain and My Week With Marilyn, she's shown her versatility and sensitivity. And when I saw her take a turn starring in the recent Broadway revival of Cabaret, she was one of the best Sallys (ph) I saw at the Roundabout Theatre, and I saw them all. And speaking of versatility, Bob Fosse is played by Sam Rockwell, who's done terrific work in everything from Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind and Galaxy Quest to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "In Fosse/Verdon, these two inhabit their roles completely and convincingly. The story isn't rolled out sequentially. It starts with the filming of Sweet Charity and keeps hopping backwards and forwards, revealing bits of their past a scene at a time. So I'm not doing any spoiling here by presenting a scene from when after the couple is separated but still seeking support and advice from each other. He visits her after a day working on the movie Cabaret, and she welcomes him warmly at first, but not for long. Any worries about this drama taking it too easy on the characters are instantly alleviated.", "label": 5}

I really like that it makes room for some of Fosse's famous friends, like Neil Simon and Paddy Chayefsky, played respectively by Nate Corddry and Norbert Leo Butz. And while I'm intrigued by others, like Margaret Qualley as Ann Reinking, I need to see more to see how this all plays out. That's because Fosse/Verdon, written and directed by a tag team of other producers and executive producers - including Thomas Kail, Steven Levenson, Joel Fields and Charlotte Stoudt - is all over the place, emotionally and artistically. It recreates scenes from classic stage shows and movies while framing them within a frenetic, sometimes fantasy narrative. That's exactly what Bob Fosse himself did while directing the 1979 movie All That Jazz, which was his barely fictionalized story of his own physical breakdown while juggling work on several simultaneous projects.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "This FX series isn't just an homage to All That Jazz. It plays almost like an expanded director's cut, with Verdon's half of the story given equal prominence. But the difference is Bob Fosse's All That Jazz was all Bob Fosse's vision and voice. And I know how he ended All That Jazz - boldly and brilliantly. With Fosse/Verdon, I still haven't seen anything from the Chicago musical or anything else from the later years, yet I'm very eager to see what Fosse/Verdon presents in its second half because the first handful of episodes, like the musical numbers they recreate, are surging with creativity and excitement. It's showtime.", "label": 5}

At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.

Many other phone calls were made: to a friend who would come over so I wouldn't be alone; to my parents, who would fly out the next day to be with me. The conversation with the deputies came around to informing Chris's mother. She was in Kentucky. One of them called to Lexington. The police there were busy with New Year's Eve festivities.

One comment I do remember was this: I'm a father, one of the deputies said. I would want to know now. I made the call.

His drive to pursue his passions outside of his first career gave me the resolve to do the same. Six months after he died, I left the Army, moved across the country and started medical school. Becoming a physician requires years of intensive practice and study, and in this early stage of my career, I know I should be more concerned with learning drug names or the proper quantity of fluid boluses. Yet it's the act of communicating bad news to patients and their families that I often ponder. I came to medical school having served around violence and trauma, and having already received and given a death notification. I've learned that the worst moments in someone's life can be a haze with few distinct memories. In these moments it matters less what you say than how you say it. People in pain remember compassion, like the compassion I received from the deputies who sat on the couch with me and didn't leave until I was no longer alone.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "At its most fundamental, a dinner party is an act of generosity: Come to my place; share my bounty. Of course, it's rarely that simple. Historically, the powerful have used these gatherings to flaunt their resources; social and political intimidation in the guise of hospitality. In the potlatch — a ritual practiced during precolonial times by indigenous tribes of the Northwest Coast, including the Tlingit and the Kwakiutl — the high-ranking host plied guests with enormous amounts of food (like fish oil served via quart-size spoons), often until they threw up. Then he extravagantly gave away his most prized possessions — or destroyed them in a bonfire, just to show that he could. To save face, a guest from a rival village might counter with an even bigger feast.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "In the hermetic kingdom of the dining room, the host is at once benefactor and dictator. Alfred Hitchcock planted whoopee cushions on seats, dyed food blue and reversed the order in which courses were served, beginning with dessert, all to toy with guests. Less whimsically, during the Renaissance, the aristocratic Borgias were rumored to poison them. Even without the threat of assassination, a dinner party can feel like a series of psychological tests: the table set with tiny implements of inscrutable purpose, the small talk like needles through the eyes. The Oxford Dictionary of Psychology by Andrew M. Colman includes a listing for deipnophobia, fear of dinner parties — defined as irrational, although I'd argue it's a defensive response to our divided modern times.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "For if, as some have argued, dinner parties heralded the dawn of civilization, in this brawling era they might soon hasten its end. Anxiety over forced commingling may explain why the trope of the nightmare feast has taken hold in the imaginations of contemporary artists. In the filmmaker Sally Potter's recent farce The Party, guests are at each other's throats before they down a single hors d'oeuvre. Shattering revelations bring a whiff of hell: I smell burning, a guest says. The vol-au-vents, the hostess sighs, momentarily distracted from her disemboweled marriage. Thomas Adès's opera The Exterminating Angel, which had its American premiere this fall, revisits the surrealist Luis Buñuel's 1962 film of the same title, in which socialites at a posh soiree can't muster the will to leave. They stay, trapped by their own ennui, until food and drink run out, until the mask — of who they strive to be in the presence of others — slips, and they wind up slaughtering a sheep and roasting it over a burning cello. (In uncanny synergy, Buñuel's vision has likewise infiltrated both a musical-in-progress by Stephen Sondheim and David Ives, and Darren Aronofsky's vexed 2017 horror movie, Mother!, which ends in cannibalism and an ugly subversion of the Last Supper.)", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Why, then, does it seem as if everybody is throwing dinner parties again? We could glibly dismiss it as an offshoot of the current obsession with food; amateur chefs looking to unleash their inner Yotam Ottolenghi on a captive audience. But these days, when our greatest intimacy is with our iPhones and the spectral kinship of social media has supplanted the immediacy of analog conversation, the true hunger is for earnest connection. And so a new strain of dinner party dispenses with formality in favor of sincerity. Gone are the napkins tortured into swans and the postprandial triage that shunted women to the drawing room while men dealt business. Instead, tables might be strewn with tea lights bought by the hundred at Ikea and dessert might be Klondikes from the corner bodega. In a communal, nigh utopian spirit, guests share in the labor and often bring dishes of their own, rehabilitating the idea of the potluck — which has nothing to do, etymologically, with potlatch: It derives from the 16th-century English pot-lucke, in which unexpected guests made do with whatever was already in the pot. For every dinner party that leaves family bonds and lifelong friendships in smoldering ruins, there is another that unites and reaffirms: Yes, we really like each other.", "label": 6}

The astrologer, a friend of Che's mother, did her calculations again to find a mistake, but the results she came up with were the same.

There were only two possibilities: Either she was right about Che, or she was worthless as an astrologer.", "label": 6}

Immediately after their wedding, the couple had left Buenos Aires for the remote jungle backwater of Misiones. There, as her husband set himself up as an enterprising yerba mate planter, she went through her pregnancy away from the prying eyes of Buenos Aires society.

One ancestor had been the Spanish royal viceroy of colonial Peru; another a famous Argentine military general. Her paternal grandfather had been a wealthy landowner, and Celia's own father had been a renowned law professor, congressman, and ambassador. Both he and his wife died while Celia was still a child, leaving her and her six brothers and sisters to be raised by a religious guardian aunt.

{"sentence": "At twenty-seven, Ernesto Guevara Lynch was both moderately tall and handsome, with a strong chin and jaw. The glasses he wore for astigmatism gave him a deceptively clerkish appearance, for he had an ebullient, gregarious personality, a hot temper, and an outsized imagination. He also possessed Argentine surnames of good vintage: He was the great-grandson of one of South America's richest men, and his ancestors included both Spanish and Irish nobility. But over the years, his family had lost most of its fortune.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "During the nineteenth century Rosas tyranny, the male heirs of the wealthy Guevara and Lynch clans had fled Argentina to join the California gold rush. After returning from exile, their American-born offspring, Roberto Guevara Castro and Ana Isabel Lynch, had married. Ernesto was the sixth of their eleven children. They lived well, but they were no longer landed gentry. While her husband worked as a geographical surveyor, Ana Isabel raised the children in Buenos Aires. They summered at a rustic country house on her inherited slice of the old family seat. To prepare his son for a working life, Roberto Guevara had sent him to a state-run school, telling him: The only aristocracy I believe in is the aristocracy of talent.", "label": 6}

He had grown up on his mother's stories of California frontier life, and listening to his father's own terrifying tales of Indian attacks and sudden death in the high Andes. His family's illustrious and adventurous past was a legacy too powerful to overcome. He was nineteen when his father died, and although he went to college, studying architecture and engineering, he dropped out before graduation.

Originally settled by Jesuit missionaries and their Guarani Indian converts in the sixteenth century, annexed only fifty years earlier by Argentina, Misiones was just then opening up to settlement. Land speculators, well-heeled adventurers, and poor European migrants were flocking in. Guevara Lynch went to see it for himself, and caught yerba mate fever. His own money was tied up in the astillero, but, with Celia's inheritance, they would be able to buy enough land for a yerba mate plantation, and, he hoped, become rich from the lucrative green gold.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Unsurprisingly, Celia's family closed ranks in opposition to her dilettante suitor. Celia was not yet twenty-one, and under Argentine law she needed her family's approval to marry or receive her inheritance. She asked for it, but they refused. Desperate, for by now she was pregnant, she and Ernesto staged an elopement to force her family's consent. She ran away to an older sister's house. The show of force worked. The marriage was approved, but Celia still had to go to court to win her inheritance. By order of the judge, she was granted a portion of her inheritance, including title to a cattle and grain-producing estancia in central Cordoba province, and some cash bonds from her trust fund--enough to buy a mate plantation in Misiones.", "label": 6}

La Prensa of Buenos Aires gave the news in its Dia Social column. Immediately afterward, they fled Buenos Aires for the wilderness of Misiones bearing their mutual secret.

Sarmiento's 1845 book, Facundo (Civilization and Barbarity), had been a clarion call to his compatriots to choose the path of civilized man over the brutality of the archetypal Argentine frontiersman, the gaucho.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Yet even Sarmiento had wielded a dictator's authority to lead the country, and with his death the Argentine cult of the strongman, or caudillo, had not disappeared. Caudillismo would remain a feature of politics well into the next century as government swung back and forth between caudillos and democrats in a bewildering, cyclical dance. Indeed, as if reflecting the sharp contrasts of the great land they had conquered, there was an unreconciled duality in the Argentine temperament, seemingly balanced in a state of perpetual tension between savagery and enlightenment. At once passionate, volatile, and racist, Argentines were also expansive, humorous, and hospitable.

Electric streetcars rattled and zinged along cobbled streets past elegant, bronzed-doored confiterias and wiskerias with gold lettering on etched glass windows.

In the north, despotic provincial caudillos held sway over vast expanses of cotton- and sugar-growing lands. Among their workers, diseases such as leprosy, malaria, and even bubonic plague were still common. In the Andean provinces, the indigenous Quechua- and Aymara-speaking Indians known as coyas lived in conditions of extreme poverty.

The current Radical president, Hipolito Yrigoyen, was aging and eccentric, a sphinxlike figure who rarely spoke or appeared in public. Workers had few rights, and strikes were often suppressed by gunfire and police batons. Criminals were transported by ship to serve terms of imprisonment in the cold southern wastes of Patagonia. But, with immigration and the twentieth century, new political ideas had also arrived. Feminists, socialists, anarchists, and now Fascists began making their voices heard.

On a bluff overlooking the coffee-colored water and the dense green forest of the Paraguayan shore, they erected a roomy wooden house on stilts, with an outdoor kitchen and outhouse. They were a long way from the comforts of Buenos Aires, but Guevara Lynch was enraptured. With an entrepreneur's eager eye, he looked into the jungle around him, and he saw the future.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Perhaps he believed he could, as his grandfathers had done before him, restore the family fortunes by intrepidly striking out into new and unexplored lands. Whether or not he was consciously emulating his forefathers' experiences, it is clear that for Guevara Lynch, Misiones was his own Wild West adventure.

Caraguatai was reached by a two-day river journey up from the old trading port of Posadas on the Ibera, a venerable Victorian paddle-wheel steamer that had done prior service carrying British colonials up the Nile. The nearest outpost was the small German settlers' community of Montecarlo, five miles away, but the Guevaras found they had a friendly neighbor who lived a few minutes' walk through the forest. Charles Benson was a retired English railway engineer and an avid angler, and just above the river he had built himself a white, rambling bungalow with its own internal water closet imported from England.", "label": 6}

At 5:30 P.M. on Tuesday, May 13, 1928, a twenty-eight-year-old stevedore named Ramon Romero, alias Diente de Oro, was shot in the head during a fracas at the Puerto San Martin.

He hired a Paraguayan foreman, or capataz, named Curtido, to oversee the clearing of his land and the planting of his first crop of yerba mate.

Paid low wages according to how much they produced, mensu received not cash but private bonds, valid only to purchase basic essentials at the overpriced plantation stores. The system virtually ensured that they could never redeem their original debts. Armed plantation guards called capangas kept vigilant watch over the work crews to prevent escapes, and violent deaths by gunshot and machete were frequent occurrences. Fugitive mensu who escaped the capangas but fell into the hands of police were inevitably returned to their patrones. Guevara Lynch hired mensu himself, but he was no yerba baron, and, horrified at the stories he heard, he paid his workers in cash. It made him a popular patron, and many years later, he was still remembered by local workers as a good man.", "label": 6}

To help train him, his father used to send him to the kitchen with a little pot of yerba mate to give the cook for boiling. Invariably stumbling along the way, Ernestito would angrily pick himself up and carry on. Another routine developed as a consequence of the pernicious insects that infested Caraguatai. Every night, while his son lay sleeping in his crib, Guevara Lynch and Curtido crept quietly into his room. While his patron trained a flashlight on his son, Curtido carefully used the burning tip of his cigarette to dislodge the day's harvest of chiggers burrowed into the baby's flesh.", "label": 6}

Carmen Arias proved to be a welcome new addition to the family; she would live with the Guevaras until her own marriage eight years later, and remain a lifelong family friend. Freed from child-minding, Celia began taking daily swims in the Parana. She was a good swimmer, but one day when she was six month's pregnant, the river's current caught her. She would probably have drowned if two of her husband's axmen clearing the forest nearby hadn't seen her and thrown out liana vines to pull her to safety.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Guevara Lynch reprovingly recalled many such near-drowning episodes involving Celia in the early years of their marriage. Already, Celia and Ernesto's very different personalities had begun to collide. She was aloof, a loner, and seemingly immune to fear, while he was an emotionally needy man who liked having people around him, a chronic worrier whose vivid imagination magnified the risks he saw lurking everywhere.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "But while the early signs of their future marital discord were already in evidence, they had not yet pulled apart. The Guevaras took family excursions together, either horse rides on the forest trails, with Ernestito riding on the saddle mount in front of his father, or river excursions aboard the Kid, a wooden launch with a four-berth cabin that Guevara Lynch had built at the Astillero San Isidro.

Their land was cleared and their yerbatal had just been planted, but Celia was about to give birth to their second child, and Guevara Lynch's presence was urgently needed at the Astillero San Isidro. During his absence, business had gone badly, and now one of its investors had withdrawn. They planned to be away only a few months, but they would never return as a family to Puerto Caraguatai.

No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. He had his quirks. He hated the word stance. He was a stickler for accuracy.

What did Iran want? How could its people be brought closer to the world? How might their yearning for liberty be satisfied? Bob probed. He was always ready to learn, even if he always seemed to know more than you. He was the generalist rebuking the specialist. He prodded me, most recently, to write — and then rewrite — a review of Elena Ferrante's work. He liked writers in new territory.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "At a memorial service for him this week at the New York Public Library, the immensity of Bob's loss was palpable. Justice Stephen Breyer sent a note, read by the Review's publisher, Rea Hederman. It extolled the importance of Bob's forum for distinguishing sense from nonsense. Ian Buruma captured Bob's particularly Jewish identification with the oppressed and his decency – that word dear to Camus, who observed in his novel The Plague that, It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency. Mark Danner evoked the love of Bob's life, Grace Dudley, and his sense of not knowing who I am after her death late last year. Still, Bob kept working. There were always things to do.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "A partisan narrator but probably not an unreliable one, Melinda is somehow able to present flashbacks to moments that she didn't see. That's just one of several ways in which Mr. Perry's screenplay feels structurally shaky.

She was distracted by other projects — in those years, she produced Ethan Frome (1911) and The Reef (1912) as well as short stories — but most significantly, Wharton and her husband, Teddy, themselves divorced, after twenty-eight years of marriage, in part because Teddy had stolen significant sums of money from his wife. Although born into an eminent Yankee family with a great deal of wealth, and consequently in a considerably better position than most divorcées (then or now), she nevertheless found herself, as Martin-Wagner puts it, something of a social outcast, and left the United States for France, where she would live until her death in 1937.

It's perhaps not totally surprising, then, that, as Lewis notes, Undine shares a number of key traits with her creator, including their childhood nickname, Puss. Wharton understood well the personal costs of marriage for women, and the limits society placed upon them. She surely put something of herself into Undine. At the same time, she knew intimately the suffering of poor Ralph Marvell, scion of old New York, who, upon reading about his divorce in the newspapers, felt that the coarse fingering of public curiosity had touched the secret places of his soul, and nothing that had gone before seemed as humiliating as this trivial comment on his tragedy.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Wharton's genius lies in her novelistic ability to allow her characters their perspectives while seeing the situation from all sides. Both in her lifetime and since, she has been maligned for being born rich (Franzen complains that privilege like hers isn't easy to like; it puts her at a moral disadvantage); and Janet Flanner accused her, in a waspish 1929 New Yorker profile, of lacking sensuality and sympathy, of formally proving that the wages of social sin were social death. But in fact Wharton — who could well have sat around in her fancy houses eating bonbons with her feet up rather than writing wonderfully entertaining, humanly true novels that have stood the test of time — turned her critical eye equally upon transgressors and upholders of convention alike. That's not to excuse her snobbery or to overlook the limitations of accounts of high society; but now, as then, we're fascinated by the lives of the wealthy, and shouldn't project our own secret shame about it onto Wharton. Her sharp wit is hard on all her characters, and crucially, she captures also their redeeming qualities, their humanity. She sees and understands Undine's laser-focused ambition, her parents' trembling and self-sacrificing indulgence, Ralph's highly cultured but weak romanticism, Elmer's robust desire for material success.

{"sentence": "The remarkable journey of Ida Wells began during the Civil War in the northern Mississippi town of Holly Springs. It was not the most auspicious place for an African American to be born, for Mississippi has been the site of horrific incidents of white racism and violence. In the antebellum period, slaves from other states feared being sold down to Mississippi; later, some of the bloodiest chapters of the civil rights movement would be written there. Nevertheless, Ida B. Wells was born at a time and place in Mississippi that offered African Americans cause for hope as well as discouragement. Her parents also emerged from slavery with more opportunity than many.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Although slavery was hardly a benevolent institution, as white southerners sought to paint it, some slaves were more privileged than others. Sources of privilege included kinship with the master, acquisition of valuable skills, and the opportunity to be hired out in cities. Ida's father, James Wells, apparently benefited from all three. His master/father owned a plantation in Tippah County and had no children by his white wife, Miss Polly. Like many slave owners, he had a black family with a slave--Peggy. Born in 1840, James Wells was their first child and was cherished by his father, who was relatively old when James was born. Such liaisons were deeply resented by most slave owners' white wives, who felt the bitterness of betrayal and the humiliation of seeing tangible, public proof of their husbands' infidelity in the skin color of the children. These wives' wrath was sometimes unleashed on the slave women who shared their husband's attention, whether or not the bondswomen were willing participants in the relationships. James Wells recalled how Miss Polly had gotten someone to strip and whip Peggy the day after her husband died.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Before his death, James's father had taken him to Holly Springs, in northern Mississippi, to be apprenticed to a carpenter. Thus at age eighteen, James Wells gained a valuable skill and a measure of independence as a hired-out slave living in town. Masters hired out their slaves to other people for a variety of reasons--usually for compensation or for their slaves to acquire certain skills. Hired-out slaves enjoyed a wide range of freedom, and some received very little. Life in cities and towns, however, gave many hired-out slaves some freedom from supervision, and most found more autonomy than the slaves on their masters' plantations.", "label": 6}

He fell in love with Elizabeth Warrenton, the cook in the Bolling household. As slaves they could not legally marry, but they lived as man and wife and legalized their vows after emancipation--as many slaves did. Unlike James, Elizabeth (born in 1844) had not been sheltered from bondage's worst abuses. One of ten children born to slaves in Virginia, she vividly recalled receiving beatings from her masters. She also suffered one of the worst abuses of slavery: She and two of her sisters were sold and separated from their family. Such separations were painful reminders of slaves' vulnerability and cut them off from the very people who provided comfort and support to cope with the harsh realities of slavery. Like so many others, Elizabeth sent inquiries back to Virginia after emancipation in a vain attempt to find her lost family.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Ida Bell Wells was the first child born to the couple. Her birth on 16 July 1862 was in the midst of the Civil War. At first the Union and the Confederacy carefully tried to separate the issue of slavery from their war aims, but the process of the war ultimately destroyed the system of human bondage. When Union troops arrived nearby, many slaves sought to liberate themselves by fleeing behind Union lines. After a period of confusion over the status of these fugitives (at first, slaves were often returned to their Confederate masters), the U.S. Congress directed that escaped slaves of rebel masters could be considered contraband of war and proclaimed free. Nevertheless, when Union troops moved out of a region, some of the newly freed slaves found themselves recaptured in the web of slavery. For many southerners of all shades, the transition from slavery to freedom was chaotic and confusing. Ida Wells's birthplace was the scene of more-than-average confusion.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Holly Springs was captured and recaptured by the two armies, changing hands at least fifty-nine times during the war. Its geography and its history made the city's experiences of the war and Reconstruction both typical and atypical of most of the state. When Ida was born, Holly Springs had existed for only a few decades. In 1832 the Chickasaw ceded the region, known as the Chickasaw Cession, to the federal government. Four years later the territory was divided into counties--the largest of which was Marshall County with Holly Springs as its seat. While still carving the city from the wilderness, its settlers sought to make it a cultural center. Even before the town was incorporated, residents voted in a town meeting to establish the Holly Springs Female Institute, the first of a number of educational institutions. By 1850 the county was spending more on higher education than all the rest of the state, excluding the budget of the University of Mississippi. A history of the state noted that in 1891 Holly Springs, called the City of Flowers, was widely known for the hospitality and culture of its people.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "One reason for the culture and prosperity in Holly Springs was the arrival of successful cotton planters, who had moved west for more fertile soil, as well as many others who grew cotton on a smaller scale. King Cotton demanded slaves; the 1840 county population of 17,536 included 8,260 slaves and 8 free blacks. As a new town with many land claim cases, the city also was the home to numerous lawyers. Both lawyers and planters tended to join the Whig party, which dominated the town's early politics--until the rise of the slavery issue in national debate. The controversy destroyed the party there as elsewhere and no compromise Democrats rose in power.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "By 1860 the county's population had grown to almost 29,000, including 1,295 slave owners and 17,439 slaves; the free black population remained at 8. Now a minority, whites became even more determined to retain slavery as a source of control and power, and Marshall County played an integral role in Mississippi's march toward secession. One of its residents was coauthor of the state's ordinance of secession, and when it was signed on 9 January 1861, the county provided five signatories--more than any other county. Thus a year and a half before Ida Wells's birthday, her parents and the rest of Holly Springs probably waited anxiously for the outcome of the bold move toward disunion.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Because whites were outnumbered, a constant fear of racial revolt lingered in many minds. Such fear was intensified by the uncertainties of war. Early in the hostilities planters summoned home some of their hired-out slaves. The state legislature also moved to control slaves by penalizing masters who granted their bondsmen and bondswomen too much freedom. Even so, rumors spread like epidemics, fanning the fever of fear with lurid descriptions of insurrection plots. Hysteria required no tangible evidence. The month Ida was born, the provost marshal of Natchez reported the hanging of forty African Americans during the preceding year, foreshadowing the postwar terror and murder of black men to retain white control. By the end of the century only the dominant excuse had changed--from insurrection to rape.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "At first Holly Springs seemed to have been spared the worst of the hysteria and war. Not until about two weeks before Ida's birth in July 1862 did the first significant Civil War skirmish occur near Holly Springs. A considerable number of Confederate troops remained in the area until later that fall when Union General Ulysses S. Grant began moving troops into northern Mississippi in preparation for the Vicksburg campaign. Before his army reached Holly Springs, Confederate forces partially dismantled the local foundry and retreated to a more defensible position. Grant proceeded to establish a large supply depot in the city. Weapons, ammunition, food, and other materials filled every public building as well as churches, the Masonic Temple, and even a few private homes. While he briefly made his headquarters there, the city's black population celebrated a rare degree of freedom.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "As Grant's army moved deeper into slave territory, slaves began coming in larger numbers to the Union camps. To handle the hordes, Grant asked Chaplain John Eaton to establish a camp for the contrabands. Eaton chose Grand Junction, Tennessee, as the camp's location--just across the state line from Holly Springs. Eaton later described the scene of slaves coming garbed in rags or silks, with feet shod or bleeding, individually or in families and larger groups,--an army of slaves and fugitives, pushing its way irresistibly toward an army of fighting men. Although the Wells family and many other slaves chose to remain in Holly Springs, the camp's nearby location had an ameliorating impact on slavery in that city.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Late in the fall of 1862, Grant's army moved south, leaving only twenty-five hundred troops in Holly Springs. Until that time Holly Springs had suffered little damage, although the town and the surrounding countryside had changed hands frequently. On a plantation near Holly Springs, eighteen-year-old Cordelia Scales wrote letters describing the changing parade of Union and Confederate troops that camped in her yard. Both seem to have foraged--but not unduly. Some outlying plantations suffered more than others, but major destruction of the town began with the raid by Confederate General Earl Van Dorn on 20 December 1862. Van Dorn's men quickly routed the outnumbered and unsuspecting federal troops in Holly Springs. Knowing they had little time, Confederate soldiers rapidly looted the easily transportable federal supplies. Then, from early morning until 4:00 P.M., they set fire to the many buildings housing the remaining stores. Exploding ammunition caused further destruction and some deaths. J. G. Deupree, a participant, described the scene as", "label": 6}

One Iowa soldier watched sadly as every portion of the fated city seemed given over to pillage and destruction and no hand was raised to save anything from the general sack and ruin. He was especially disturbed by the sacrileges committed in a church and the women and children standing in their homes wailing with the most piteous cries. Before Confederate forces in Mississippi surrendered on 4 May 1865, Holly Springs had witnessed more than a dozen major skirmishes. After so much chaos and confusion, the county's slaves must have wondered if freedom had actually come to stay, while whites worried about what would replace slavery. Former masters and former slaves warily sought to redefine their new relationships.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "After the war was over, James Wells accepted Bolling's invitation to continue working for him. Like most freed people, Wells sought to test and taste the varied fruits of freedom. He first exercised those rights that white southerners had grudgingly conceded--legalizing his marriage and seeking education for his family. The Wells family continued to grow in the years following the war, and eventually Ida had four brothers and three sisters. Both parents were eager for their children to go to school. Former slaves realized that education had been forbidden because it was a key to freedom and a source of white power. Most slave children had worked at an early age; their freed fathers wanted them to have childhoods more like those of their former masters' children. Ida Wells later recalled, Our job was to go to school and learn all we could.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "She began school at such an early age that she could not remember when or where she started. Her earliest recollections were of reading the newspaper to her father and his friends and of her mother going to school with the children until she was able to read the Bible. Students of all ages clustering around a limited number of books in small schools was a common sight to the newly freed slaves during Reconstruction. Whether Ida's father learned to read is unclear. Her reading the newspaper to him and his friends could have represented a father's desire to show off the accomplishments of his offspring or his inability to read for himself. Like many freed heads of households, James Wells was undoubtedly busy and apparently did not attend school with his family. However, he may have learned to read and write from his father or as an apprentice. Regardless, Wells was deeply involved in education because he was one of the trustees of Shaw University, the school Ida attended in Holly Springs.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "In addition to exercising their rights to marriage and education, freedmen eagerly embraced the right to vote. For the entire Republican Reconstruction period in Mississippi (1867-1875), African Americans comprised a majority of the county's population and overwhelmingly supported Republicans despite white Democrats' efforts to win their votes. The Democrats used both carrots and sticks to woo black voters. Many used economic intimidation to persuade African Americans to vote for Democrats. James Wells was one victim of such tactics. When Bolling found out that Wells had not voted Democratic, he locked Wells out of his shop. Wells, however, was not easily intimidated. Without saying a word to anyone, he bought his own tools, rented a house, and moved his family out of the dwelling owned by Bolling.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Some African Americans followed the path of James Wells, but black voters responded in a variety of ways. Like Wells, a number openly demonstrated their independence--a few attended Democratic barbecues and picnics adorned in caps with the Republican insignia. Others dissembled. One man, threatened with eviction by his white landlord if he voted Republican, won a reprieve with the explanation that he had been forced to vote for Republicans by black threats to run him out of town. Many accepted Democratic gifts and then voted Republican anyway. A few did become Democrats either out of loyalty to former masters or employers or because of economic threats and incentives. The leader of a black Democratic club was rewarded with the gift of a small house by his white fellow Democrats.", "label": 6}

Tactics included counterfeiting Republican ballots, attempting to confuse voters by using African Americans to distribute Democratic tickets, hiding in the building to stuff ballot boxes while the election clerks were eating supper, and requiring black voters to present written proof of their age. As a result of reported electoral fraud, the state legislature refused to seat two Marshall County Democrats elected in 1871. In the next election, the Republicans swept all the county's offices. One African American served as state senator and three as representatives. However, two years later in 1875, the Democrats returned to power--permanently. Black Mississippi politician John Roy Lynch later noted, The new order of things was then set aside and the abandoned methods of a few years back were reviewed, reinaugurated, and readopted.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Ida recalled that her father was interested in politics and remembered the anxious way my mother walked the floor at night when my father was out to a political meeting. Her mother had good reason to be concerned. Whites resented all black political participation but especially loathed the Loyal League, a black political organization founded and often controlled by white Republicans across the South. The Holly Springs branch of the League was established by A. C. McDonald of Shaw University and Nelson Gill of the Freedmen's Bureau. It usually met in Gill's home or in the black Baptist church. During one meeting, members of the local Ku Klux Klan hid under Gill's house listening to the proceedings and waiting for J. L. Holland, who had been chosen among them by lot, to shoot Gill. When Holland finally decided it was time and aimed his pistol, another Klansman had second thoughts and knocked the gun out of Holland's hand just as he fired it. No one was hurt, but all were scared. Afterward, pickets were posted outside during Loyal League meetings.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Heated campaigns led to physical assaults and fights--apparently instigated by Democrats. Republican speakers were pelted with sticks and brickbats, had their coattails ripped, were buggy-whipped, and had their legs broken. The most serious incident of violence was the fatal shooting of Tyler Williamson, an African American who was called a very turbulent leader and exceedingly impudent to the white people. Despite that incident, Holly Springs remained more peaceful than many towns and cities during Reconstruction. Ida Wells noted in her autobiography that she could not remember any riots in the city, although there were plenty in other parts of the state.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Political violence and Klan activities frightened Elizabeth Wells and others, but Reconstruction also brought new hope and opportunity to Mississippi's black population. Although brief, the period of Republican ascendancy in Holly Springs had to be a source of great pride to the Wells's and other black families. Most whites, although they resented black political power, agreed that the city had been blessed with extraordinarily capable and honest black officeholders. Two were singled out for praise: James Hill, who rose from the state legislature to become Mississippi's secretary of state from 1874 to 1878, and Hiram Rhodes Revels, who moved to Holly Springs in the mid-1870s, and became the first African American U.S. senator. Both won white respect by their conciliatory attitudes. But whites also noted that although State Senator George Allbright was a willing and eager tool in the hands of Gill, he was a negro who was above average in intelligence. At the height of black political power in Holly Springs, Ida Wells was a child of about ten. The events she witnessed may have whetted her interest in politics, which remained strong her entire life.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Although James Wells was known as a race man who was intensely interested in politics, he apparently never held office but stayed busy running a business and taking care of his growing family. As in many households, however, Ida's mother played the biggest role in the day-to-day affairs of the children. A very religious woman, Elizabeth Wells made sure that her children attended church regularly. The Wells family likely belonged to Asbury Methodist Church, where Shaw University classes were first held. Ida was baptized in that faith at the age of twelve. Ida recalled that her mother won the prize for regular attendance at Sunday school, taking the whole brood of six to nine o'clock Sunday school the year before she died. Elizabeth Wells was a strict disciplinarian who kept close watch over her children. She regularly went to their school to check on their progress, taught them how to do household chores, and assigned each tasks around the home. Ida proudly asserted that her mother brought us up with a strict discipline that many mothers who have had educational advantages have not exceeded.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Like many African American families, the Wells family was part of a network of kinship. Although Elizabeth Wells had been unable to locate her parents and other siblings, her sister Belle, who had also been sold to Mississippi owners, lived out in the country near Holly Springs. James Wells's mother, Peggy, married a black man (probably named Buffer) after emancipation and also lived nearby. They apparently lived as man and wife during slavery and had a daughter named Margaret and at least one other son. The Butlers tilled a number of acres and brought their corn and cotton to sell in Holly Springs each fall. Utilizing that trip for a family visit, they usually brought gifts, some of which Ida called souvenirs from hog-killing time. On one such visit, Ida recalled her father angrily refusing his mother's request to go see his father's widow, Miss Polly, reminding his mother of how Miss Polly had her whipped and saying, I am never going to see her. I guess it is all right for you to take care of her and forgive her for what she did to you, but she could have starved to death if I'd had my say-so. She certainly would have, if it hadn't been for you. In addition to those visits, Ida sometimes went to stay with her grandmother and aunt and uncle, who helped Peggy and her husband on the farm. Apparently, another uncle and his wife, Fannie Butler, had three children and lived in Memphis, Tennessee.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "When Ida reached her teens, she enrolled at Shaw University (informally called Rust College until 1890, when the name change became official), where she was greatly influenced by the missionary spirit of the school. Under the jurisdiction of the Methodist Episcopal Church, North, Rust was strongly tinged with evangelical Christianity. Students were required to attend daily chapel, weekly prayer meetings, and church on Sunday. W. W. Hooper, who became president of Rust while Ida was a student, was remembered as a religious man who prayed in chapel with his eyes open and would call your name when he got through if you didn't behave. Such an environment reinforced the religious training Ida received at home.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Rust's curriculum spanned from elementary education to normal school training for teachers--a four-year high school level program. A. C. McDonald founded the school to make former slaves and their children useful, independent citizens. In 1875 he wrote the following:", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "As in many schools for African Americans of that era, Rust's faculty was predominately white. Most of the teachers were northerners who saw themselves as missionaries. The white women teachers influenced Ida's concept of ideal womanhood and her acceptance of Victorian codes of propriety. At the same time, she may have been inspired by the example of black faculty member Ophelia Smith who wrote, I love my race.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "While a student at Rust, Ida encountered the joys and sorrows of puberty. She experienced her first love and its painful demise. James B. Combs was a Rust student from Georgia, who boarded with a local family. Described in the 1880 U.S. census as mulatto, Combs was about five years older than Wells and apparently was the one to end the relationship. He married someone else and remained in Holly Springs for at least ten years--his presence reminding Wells of the impermanence of love. Throughout her twenties Ida remained skittish of committing herself to just one man.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Other relationships caused difficulties for Wells at Rust. In late 1885, she referred to her tenure at Rust as my darkest days. Ida's fiery temper often got her in trouble, and a confrontation with President Hooper apparently led to her dismissal sometime in 1880 or 1881. For years she resented him tremendously for her expulsion, but in June 1886 she admitted to herself that her own tempestuous, rebellious, hard headed wilfulness was to blame. She rued her disposition to question his authority and asserted, I no longer cherish feelings of resentment, nor blame him that my scholastic career was cut short.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "In 1878 Ida B. Wells encountered the next painful chapter of her life while on a visit to her grandmother. That year witnessed a devastating yellow fever epidemic in the Mississippi Valley. The region had undergone previous epidemics of yellow fever, but none was as extensive or deadly as the 1878 outbreak. An unusually mild winter, an early spring, and a blistering hot summer had allowed the mosquitoes, which served as the fever's agent of transmission, to breed prolifically and over a wide range of territory. Thus the fever spread to areas that had never experienced an epidemic; therefore, most residents of those regions had no acquired immunities to yellow fever. Compounding these factors, the strain of virus that year was particularly deadly, which caused higher mortality rates even in areas previously infected. In some regions the mortality rates exceeded 50 percent.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Lacking a good understanding of how the fever was spread, most Holly Springs residents believed their town to be immune, so the city opened its doors to people from other infested cities. The first refugees were housed in a small brick building that had served as the original land office. Within a week one of the refugees had died, which was only the beginning of the terrible toll the fever would exact in Holly Springs. On 4 September 1878, the New Orleans Picayune reported fifty cases of yellow fever in Holly Springs and two deaths; an epidemic was declared and panic began, causing a frenzied effort at flight from the unseen terror so that streets were jammed with every conceivable type of vehicle loaded with baggage and human beings. By the next day a different scene was described: The hurry and confusion of panic is gone. No hurried footsteps sound along the forsaken streets unless they seek help or a doctor. Hollow echoes mock their passing. The mass exodus reduced the town's population from about thirty-five hundred to fifteen hundred, comprised of three hundred whites and twelve hundred African Americans. One who remained telegraphed on 5 September, The stores are all closed.... Physicians are broken down.... Many cases will die today.... Gloom, despair, and death rule the hour, and the situation is simply appalling. Only a few dozen of those who stayed escaped the fever; by the end of the epidemic, 215 whites and 89 African Americans had died.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "While Holly Springs was reeling from yellow fever, Ida was safe at her grandmother's house and presumed that the rest of the family had evacuated the city and gone to stay with her mother's sister Belle. When no word came from them, she assumed delivery of the mail had been disrupted. Then three men from Holly Springs brought her a letter, which she scanned until, as she later recalled, four sentences caught her eye: Jim and Lizzie Wells have both died of the fever. They died within twenty-four hours of each other. The children are all at home and the Howard Association has put a woman there to take care of them. Send word to Ida. She immediately fainted and came to in a house of mourning surrounded by her grandmother, aunt, and uncle. Her father had died on 26 September and her mother the next day.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Wells was concerned about her younger siblings in Holly Springs. Two years earlier the next oldest child, Eugenia, had developed severe scoliosis that had bent her spinal column until she became paralyzed below the waist. Next in order of birth were her brothers James, age eleven, and George, age nine. Her two youngest sisters were five-year-old Annie, and Lily, about two. The youngest sibling was a nine-month-old baby named Stanley. Another brother, Eddie, had died a number of years earlier of spinal meningitis. Wells wanted to go to the children immediately, but her relatives would not allow her to leave until they received a letter from a doctor saying that she should come.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "When Ida arrived at the house, she found out that all the children except Eugenia had been stricken with the fever. Although most had slight cases, the baby had died on 3 October, and two still remained in bed. Eugenia told her what had happened since the fever struck, recounting their father's contribution to the emergency. To protect his family while he built coffins and comforted the sick, James Wells left home but came daily as far as the gate to bring food and to check on them. Elizabeth, however, was the first of the family to be stricken. An Irish woman was sent to nurse her, and James came home to help--only to come down with the fever himself.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "James Wells had been a master Mason, which in the black community often operated as a safety net for its members and their families. Thus once the epidemic had passed, a group of Masons gathered at the Wells home to discuss what was to become of the children. After many hours of discussion, they had come to an agreement on the arrangements. They decided that Ida was old enough to take care of herself, but the others would have to be parceled out. Two of the Masons' wives each agreed to take one of the younger girls, Annie and Lily. The two boys were to be apprenticed to two different men--one of whom was a local white who was familiar with their father's work and hoped his son shared Wells's carpentry skills. The big problem was Eugenia. Because of her paralysis, no one wanted the responsibility of caring for her, so she was to be sent to a poorhouse.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "While the men were divvying up the children, Ida had sat quietly. When they finished, however, she calmly announced that her parents would turn over in their graves to know their children had been scattered like that and she did not intend to let it happen. She would care for them if the Masons would help her find work. Although they initially scoffed at the idea, Ida was adamant and they relented--probably relieved to be rid of the responsibility. Wells later subtly altered the past and her experiences at Rust University by recollecting, After being a happy, light-hearted schoolgirl I suddenly found myself at the head of a family. Actually, her days there were less than idyllic, and she continued to attend Rust between school terms until her expulsion some two years later.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "At age sixteen, Ida B. Wells was able to keep her family together because her father had been industrious and frugal. He had left them a house free of debt and accumulated savings of at least three hundred dollars. That met their needs for awhile, but Ida needed to find work. On the suggestion of the Masons, she sought a teaching job in a country school. She successfully passed the examination and was assigned to a school six miles outside of Holly Springs with a salary of twenty-five dollars a month. While she waited for school to open, Wells lengthened all her skirts for the transition from schoolgirl to schoolmarm.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Until that time, Wells had been sheltered by her parents, who were very protective. She had not been allowed to be in the presence of men unchaperoned, and her contacts with boys had been limited to what she called children's parties. She was naive and society was suspicious of women living without the protection of a father, husband, or male relative. The result was a pattern of rumors that would plague her until she married. After she insisted on staying in the family home with her siblings, the word spread that Wells wanted the house for illicit assignations with a white man. She was dimly aware that such arrangements existed, but she was deeply shocked and hurt that people believed her capable of such action.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Although Wells was listed as the head of the household in the 1880 U.S. census, she received help in meeting her responsibilities from her extended family and friends. Mr. and Mrs. James Hall, family friends who were in their early thirties, served as guardians. After fallacious rumors that Wells was having an affair with a white doctor, her grandmother, Peggy, came from the country to stay with them. Although she was in her seventies, she tried to help out by working during the day. However, one night Peggy collapsed with a paralytic stroke, and her daughter took her back to the country to care for her until she died?", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "Once Wells started to work at the country school, she needed someone to watch the children during the week. An old friend of her mother's (probably Rachel Rather) agreed to do so. Rather was from Virginia, twenty-four years older than Elizabeth, and may have served as a surrogate mother to her. She took care of the children until Ida would come home every Friday, riding the six miles on the back of a big mule. Before she returned on Sunday afternoon, Wells did all the laundry and housecleaning for the week. She also cooked for the children, often using eggs and butter that people near her school had given her. Fortunately, she did not have to keep up this frantic pace for too long. Gradually, she was relieved of the responsibility for some of the children. By 1880, her brother James, who the family called Jim, had left home and had become apprenticed to a carpenter. Although he was no longer under her direct supervision, Wells still worried about Jim. She later called him her problem child because he was constantly getting into minor difficulties, especially with women. He would then go to Ida, who would help him out of the trouble. George was quieter and also became a carpenter's apprentice, eventually moving to Kansas.", "label": 6}

In 1881 Wells accepted the invitation of her aunt, Fannie Wells, to come to Memphis. Fannie lived there with her three small children, having been widowed by the yellow fever epidemic. Wells brought her two youngest sisters with her to Memphis, while Eugenia went to live with their Aunt Belle on her farm. After she arrived in the city at the age of nineteen, Wells continued to teach--first in the nearby town of Woodstock, and after 1884 in the city schools of Memphis.", "label": 6}

In the unsent letters she writes to James during this embargo, Maggie struggles to find a theological framework for her longing and her pain. In one such letter, she admires the Buddhist notion of death as the ultimate lack of attachment, noting, What relief there would be in no longer longing to feel, again, your whiskers on my inner thighs.

The mores of the Ellmanns' lives are exceedingly conventional, as are many of the novel's touchstones — weddings, baptisms, the death of pets.

Lyrical lists of domestic detritus contain the sweetness of child rearing, as well as a mysterious sense of loss: Parent meetings, medical forms, class photos, permission slips. Organelles. Passive versus active transport. Quatro cuts gorgeous topiaries into the domestic landscape. Maggie's little daughter mispronounces nail polish as pale nolish; her son fashions a makeshift loincloth from his father's old T-shirt, with a wrapping-paper tube for a spear. But over the years, invasive plants encroach, privet and wisteria, thistle and honeysuckle. The backyard steadily shrinks. Even before she meets James, Maggie is aware of a lack of feeling, an inattentiveness to self — this nothing. This nothing can partly be traced back to two difficult childbirths, and the habitual surrendering of her own body to others, most especially during sex, into which her usually benign husband manipulates and bullies her. Middle age looms. The children grow into complicated teenagers, then leave for college. In other words, Maggie has been in a personal stasis for a long time. Enter James.

{"sentence": "The volume encompassing Feb. 14 contains the stories of a handful of Valentini, including the earliest three of whom died in the third century.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "The earliest Valentinus is said to have died in Africa, along with 24 soldiers. Unfortunately, even the Bollandists could not find any more information about him. As the monks knew, sometimes all that the saints left behind was a name and day of death.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "We know only a little more about the other two Valentines.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "According to a late medieval legend reprinted in the Acta, which was accompanied by Bollandist critique about its historical value, a Roman priest named Valentinus was arrested during the reign of Emperor Gothicus and put into the custody of an aristocrat named Asterius.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "As the story goes, Asterius made the mistake of letting the preacher talk. Father Valentinus went on and on about Christ leading pagansout of the shadow of darkness and into the light of truth and salvation. Asterius made a bargain with Valentinus: If the Christian could cure Asterius's foster-daughter of blindness, he would convert. Valentinus put his hands over the girl's eyes and chanted:", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Lord Jesus Christ, en-lighten your handmaid, because you are God, the True Light.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Easy as that. The child could see, according to the medieval legend. Asterius and his whole family were baptized. Unfortunately, when Emperor Gothicus heard the news, he ordered them all to be executed. But Valentinus was the only one to be beheaded. A pious widow, though, made off with his body and had it buried at the site of his martyrdom on the Via Flaminia, the ancient highway stretching from Rome to present-day Rimini. Later, a chapel was built over the saint's remains.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "According to his equally dodgy legend, Terni's bishop got into a situation like the other Valentinus by debating a potential convert and afterward healing his son. The rest of story is quite similar as well: He too was beheaded on the orders of Emperor Gothicus and his body buried along the Via Flaminia.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "It is likely, as the Bollandists suggested, that there weren't actually two decapitated Valentines, but that two different versions of one saint's legend appeared in both Rome and Terni.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Nonetheless, African, Roman or Umbrian, none of the Valentines seems to have been a romantic.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Indeed, medieval legends, repeated in modern media, had St. Valentine performing Christian marriage rituals or passing notes between Christian lovers jailed by Gothicus. Still other stories romantically involved him with the blind girl whom he allegedly healed. Yet none of these medieval tales had any basis in third-century history, as the Bollandists pointed out.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "In any case, historical veracity did not count for much with medieval Christians. What they cared about were stories of miracles and martyrdoms and the physical remains or relics of the saint. To be sure, many different churches and monasteries around medieval Europe claimed to have bits of a St. Valentinus' skull in their treasuries.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, for example, still displays a whole skull. According to the Bollandists, other churches across Europe also claim to own slivers and bits of one or the other St. Valentinus' body: For example, San Anton Church in Madrid, Whitefriar Street Church in Dublin, the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Prague, Saint Mary's Assumption in Chelmno, Poland, as well as churches in Malta, Birmingham, Glasgow, and on the Greek isle of Lesbos, among others.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "For believers, relics of the martyrs signified the saints' continuing their invisible presence among communities of pious Christians. In 11th-century Brittany, for instance, one bishop used what was purported to be Valentine's head to halt fires, prevent epidemics and cure all sorts of illnesses, including demonic possession.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "As far as we know, though, the saint's bones did nothing special for lovers.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Many scholars have deconstructed Valentine and his day in books, articles and blog postings. Some suggest that the modern holiday is a Christian cover-up of the more ancient Roman celebration of Lupercalia in mid-February.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Lupercalia originated as a ritual in a rural masculine cult involving the sacrifice of goats and dogs and evolved later into an urban carnival. During the festivities half-naked young men ran through the streets of Rome, streaking people with thongs cut from the skins of newly killed goats. Pregnant women thought it brought them healthy babies. In 496 A.D., however, Pope Gelasius supposedly denounced the rowdy festival.", "label": 7}

{"sentence": "For this was on seynt Volantynys day. Whan euery bryd comyth there to chese his make.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "It seems that, in Chaucer's day, English birds paired off to produce eggs in February. Soon, nature-minded European nobility began sending love notes during bird-mating season. For example, the French Duke of Orléans, who spent some years as a prisoner in the Tower of London, wrote to his wife in February 1415 that he was already sick of love — by which he meant lovesick. And he called her his very gentle Valentine.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "English audiences embraced the idea of February mating. Shakespeare's lovestruck Ophelia spoke of herself as Hamlet's Valentine.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "In the following centuries, Englishmen and women began using Feb. 14 as an excuse to pen verses to their love objects. Industrialization made it easier with mass-produced illustrated cards adorned with smarmy poetry. Then along came Cadbury, Hershey's, and other chocolate manufacturers marketing sweets for one's sweetheart on Valentine's Day.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "Today, shops everywhere in England and the US decorate their windows with hearts and banners proclaiming the annual Day of Love. Merchants stock their shelves with candy, jewelry and Cupid-related trinkets begging Be My Valentine. For most lovers, this request does not require beheading.", "label": 7}
{"sentence": "It seems that the erstwhile saint behind the holiday of love remains as elusive as love itself. Still, as St. Augustine, the great fifth-century theologian and philosopher argued in his treatise on Faith in Invisible Things, someone does not have to be standing before our eyes for us to love them.", "label": 7}

Both women — still girls at the time — became pregnant.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "Hundreds of Boko Haram wives have been shunned by their families and neighbors, who worry that they are loyal to the group and may be violent. They are forced to live in hastily constructed camps often guarded by armed men. Though they are free, the indignities have continued. Hauwa said she has been mocked while begging for food. A store owner, she said, would yell, Don't come into my store because she was a Boko Haram wife. School and other educational opportunities are nonexistent. Most of the Boko Haram survivors are traumatized and have struggled to recover from the abuse. Today, Hauwa and Ya Kaka's former home of Bama is a ghost town.

Structured around this conventional talking-head footage — which covers, in easily digestible if inertly chronological fashion, Thomas's Georgia childhood, education, first marriage and career — the film reveals much, while at the same time leaving us to wonder much. A lot of this ground has been covered before, in Thomas's 2007 memoir My Grandfather's Son, from which Thomas occasionally reads aloud.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "One throughline is Thomas's political evolution, beginning with an abortive stint as a Catholic seminarian — the lone black student — that ended when he withdrew after hearing a racist remark. That was followed by his self-described leftward radicalization, subsequently abandoned, along with his anger, when he became what he calls a lazy libertarian at Yale Law School, then a left-leaning registered Democrat and, years later, a reliable member of the conservative wing of the Supreme Court. As common as such transitions may be in the life of any 71-year-old, Created Equal doesn't offer many insights, at least not in a deeply satisfying way, as to how and why he has changed.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "This part of the film is the most interesting — and, depending on your predisposition, potentially poignant — segment. But Created Equal is, by design, a lopsided affair, with Pack — a conservative filmmaker and former president of the right-leaning think tank the Claremont Institute — clearly sympathetic to Thomas's self-characterizations. Pack makes no attempt, for example, to present arguments that might counterbalance the claim of a lynching, however metaphorical. The comparison is drawn, somewhat absurdly, between Thomas's treatment and the treatment of Tom Robinson, the character falsely accused — and convicted — of rape in To Kill a Mockingbird.", "label": 9}

At one point, he talks about how he prefers to vacation in RV parks instead of, say, resorts.

Biden's healthcare plans will make healthcare more affordable by offering a public option for families and reigning in drug companies to make medicine affordable. He will fight to make it easier for workers who choose to unionize to do so and has adopted plans to reform bankruptcy laws for struggling families.

And he loved learning about the characters of the war and the multitudes they led, scores of poor White men who stood little to gain from the abolishment or continuation of slavery, yet for varying reasons were willing to die for their side's cause.

During World War II she made her way from Ukraine to Berlin as a refugee, and when the war ended, she worked in a military hospital operated by the Allies. There she met an officer from the American Midwest and conceived my father, who was born in Heidelberg after his father shipped home. Five years later, my grandfather sponsored her and their son's emigration to the United States on the condition that they never contact him. She settled in Virginia, married, had another son, divorced and kept dating. Antonia was prone to fits of anger and verbal abuse.

{"sentence": "Antonia was the daughter of a respected man in Poltava, Ukraine, who navigated through a devastating famine in 1933 only to see his family and community torn apart with the Nazi invasion in 1941. Her arrival in the United States must have been an instant blow to her pride: She worked as a maid, cleaning the homes of rich, White families while living with them. She relied on government assistance in a foreign country.

It's a strange thing for a Black son to ask his White father: Why aren't you a racist?

She told him she pitied my brothers and me for being Black but didn't blame us. For the rest of her life, Alex visited her on Sundays, a secret he kept from me until I was a teenager. He didn't bother trying to reconcile his mother and brother and his wife, who tolerated his loyalty to blood.

I hugged her that day out of a sense of obligation. She was a small, blonde woman, hunched over and shuffling in a threadbare navy-blue robe. Makeup covered the blemishes and liver spots on her face, though not the ones on her neck and chest. She was 83. Antonia stared at me with blue eyes, smiled and touched my cheeks with wonder. I had been a grinning picture on the wall for 17 years, and now I was sitting in her living room.", "label": 9}

She called my mother the n-word, in writing, and I still couldn't hate her. There was some hate there, sure, but the overwhelming emotions were pity and heartbreak. She had done something extraordinary in rescuing my father from postwar Europe, instilled in him a tremendous work ethic and — even if it was by accident — a sense of fairness. Yet as a consequence of her hate, she didn't get to be a part of the world she helped create for him, and for me.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "My mom thought she had the answer to that sort of bigotry. When my grandmother died in 2017, a dozen of her friends and family members came to her funeral: her two sons, women who knew her from the hair salon and other forays into town, her caretakers and neighbors — all White. My two brothers were there too, and my mom's brother and his new bride, all Black. I chose not to attend.", "label": 9}

He would want them and those who inspired and organized the riot to be held responsible, just as my grandmother lost precious years with her grandchildren.

She said the reason she fell in love with me was because I would make a good father, but since kids aren't immediately on the horizon, she feels I don't give her enough energy as a couple, and that, while she loves me, she has felt more in love with previous boyfriends.

It sounds like a brilliant way to do an end-run around endless predate conversing, but OkCupid got a lot of backlash over the app. Why? Well, one of the reasons people often don't want to go on dates immediately with strangers from the Internet is that they want to make sure they'll be safe — and often picking a public place isn't enough to ensure that.

The Yankees may have made their move later Friday, when they reportedly agreed to a one-year contract with right-hander Corey Kluber, a two-time AL Cy Young winner.

He resembled an avatar of old Key West, a shrimper or deep-sea fisherman, a hell raiser temporarily ashore squandering his pay and his health. But he didn't behave like an island brawler. His bruises and scars came from falling down or stumbling into plate glass doors, not from fighting. He seldom raised his voice — which was surprisingly patrician — and rarely cut short his autodidactic monologues. Although a college dropout with a GED high school degree, he possessed arcane knowledge of religion, art, literature and history.

{"sentence": "Yet sympathetic as he is to his subject, Bell never softens his focus or smooths over Stone's less admirable traits. A great deal of the credit for this candor goes to Stone's partner, whom Michael Herr christened the patron saint of writers' wives. Janice Stone served as her husband's muse, first reader, typist, cook and caretaker, accountant, travel agent and life coach. Unlike so many literary marriages, theirs lasted 55 years, and after Stone's death Janice remained her husband's helpmate and his biographer's enabler. Where other widows might protect a great man's reputation (and perhaps their own financial interest) by destroying unflattering documents or restricting access to diaries and letters, Janice set nothing off the record. Along with accounts of Stone's medications (recreational and otherwise), his stretches in rehab and his suicide attempt, Janice provided information about Stone's sexual escapades and her own affairs, which he encouraged. They had married young, before the late 60s' sexual liberation, and the Stones allowed each other astonishing leeway. Stone fathered a child with another woman, and even that didn't alienate Janice.", "label": 9}

Paid $1,500 for his first novel, Stone finished his career with a million-dollar multi-book contract. As Bell reminisced in the New Yorker, Stone's life could be read as a fulfillment of the American dream of which his work was so critical.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "But he never escaped the damage he suffered during his Dickensian childhood. Raised by an unmarried schizophrenic mother in a series of squalid hotel rooms, Stone was never told anything more about his father than his mother's unreliable report that the man was a Greek, a Jew, or a Lebanese. (A DNA test contained no information to support his mother's claims.) When his mother became unfit to care for him, Stone was consigned for four years to a Catholic orphanage where the faith was literally pounded into him. By the time mother and son were reunited, Stone was essentially a street child, and by his early teens, a drunk and a drug user. A stint in the U.S. Navy introduced him to a life more abundant, although it also reinforced his appetite for intoxicants and women.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Not unreasonably, Bell maintains that Stone's accomplishments more than outweigh his transgressions. And who would argue otherwise when his wife forgave him everything? While I wish there had been more about Stone's early life, the daughter he fathered outside his marriage and the sexual partners who clearly influenced his fiction, Bell does a laudable job of explicating Stone's novels, including the dark ones like Outerbridge Reach, and the breezy autobiography Prime Green, which describes Stone's friendship with Ken Kesey. In the end, Child of Light leaves the reader with the urge to return to all of Robert Stone's work — surely the best sign of a fine biography.", "label": 9}

The name conjures many images and associations: the tumble of red curls and pert, blue-eyed face of the star as a young newcomer to the screen; the marriage to Tom Cruise and ensuing escape from Scientology; the lithe physique and dewy features that she wears easily to this day. But one phrase we often forget to attach to her is great actress.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Perhaps because of her demeanor of self-effacing, even demure, modesty, it's been easy to underestimate Kidman over the course of a career that now spans three decades. But this week has offered a reminder of why we should prize an actress who has fashioned one of the most fascinating careers in a business notorious for pigeonholing its starlets early, keeping them boxed in and discarding them when their physical attributes show signs of sagging, bagging or otherwise naturally evolving.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "Kidman has largely escaped that trap, as anyone who watched the recent HBO series Big Little Lies can attest. The stylish, compulsively engrossing thriller-slash-domestic-melodrama turned out to be a sleeper peak TV hit largely on the strength of its ensemble cast, which included Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz, Shailene Woodley and Kidman, who played the abused wife of a prosperous executive. Kidman — who co-produced with Witherspoon — was a standout in the series, her portrayal of a woman fighting for her own physical and psychic survival radiating shame, ambivalence, glazed confusion, determination and barely perceptible ripples of latent power. Never showy or gratuitous, it was a performance as delicate and fine-grained as the porcelain that her doll-like character, Celeste, sometimes seemed to be made of.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "No sooner had Kidman delivered a powerhouse with Big Little Lies than she whipsawed her audience into another direction entirely: In Queen of the Desert, out Friday, she portrays the storied explorer, writer and photographer Gertrude Bell, a contemporary of T.E. Lawrence who traveled the Arabian Peninsula in the early 20th century and helped redraw the region's national boundaries after World War I. Written and directed by Werner Herzog with an uncharacteristically blunt and stodgily sentimental hand, Queen of the Desert isn't a great film. In fact, it's often a very bad one, its strenuous efforts to be the female version of Lawrence of Arabia notwithstanding. But none of its faults lie with Kidman, who dominates the screen in nearly every shot with regal composure and restraint (and, apparently, a generous supply of SPF-50 sunscreen).", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "But even in her worst movies, Kidman is never the problem; her performances rise above whatever dreck they're in, as if her supreme self-possession as a performer inoculated her against the toxic material she was working with. And the bad movies are relatively thin on the ground compared with the myriad triumphs: She won an Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours (we're still arguing about that nose), but that was a full seven years after her astonishing portrayal of a fame-hungry TV journalist in To Die For, in which she permanently shut up the doubters in a triumphantly crafty, satirical turn.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "One need only consider Kidman's vanity-free supporting appearance in last year's Lion, alight quickly on Moulin Rouge! and The Others and go all the way back to her breakout roles in Dead Calm and Days of Thunder to appreciate the rigor and expressive range of an actress who can easily hold her own with the Meryl Streeps, Viola Davises and Cate Blanchetts of the world but is rarely mentioned in their company.", "label": 9}

The same, writ even larger, could be said for Kidman, whose shrewd auteurist eye is revealed not just in one movie but through the arc of her career. In an industry dedicated to escapism, shallow reassurance and dumbing down, she has single-mindedly pursued thoughtfulness, intelligence and risk, as an actor and a producer.

Her genius is just as strategic as it is technical, in how she's consistently leveraged stardom on behalf of growth, taste and sophistication.
