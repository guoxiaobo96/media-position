Mark Anthony Conditt died on Wednesday morning when he exploded a device in his car as police attempted to take him into custody. Less than 12 hours later, information about who the Austin Serial Bomber is beginning to emerge.
Then, Graham added, Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.
But Northam's spending plan seemed aimed at his Democratic base and will not pass muster with Republicans looking to cut taxes, Norment said. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Norment said he is committed to working with the governor and Democrats to overcome this impasse.

President Obama's statement on gun control Tuesday included an attempt to dismiss claims he ultimately wants to undermine the 2nd Amendment:
Kidman has largely escaped that trap, as anyone who watched the recent HBO series Big Little Lies can attest. The stylish, compulsively engrossing thriller-slash-domestic-melodrama turned out to be a sleeper peak TV hit largely on the strength of its ensemble cast, which included Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz, Shailene Woodley and Kidman, who played the abused wife of a prosperous executive. Kidman — who co-produced with Witherspoon — was a standout in the series, her portrayal of a woman fighting for her own physical and psychic survival radiating shame, ambivalence, glazed confusion, determination and barely perceptible ripples of latent power. Never showy or gratuitous, it was a performance as delicate and fine-grained as the porcelain that her doll-like character, Celeste, sometimes seemed to be made of.
KLEIN: Tell me more about your dead dad and your depression.
Just weeks after Carolyn Abel's murder, the investigation by John Boatwright was focusing on the two friends who had discovered her body: roommates Kathy Patrick and Sandra Ames.
The Mormon church said in a statement the new program that will start in 2020 will help all girls and boys, young women and young men discover their eternal identity, build character and resilience, develop life skills and fulfill their divine roles as daughters and sons of God.
Peter Van Sant: Now your roommate says just the opposite. That you confessed to her, and that the two of you then went back over to Carolyn's apartment and staged the scene as a burglary.
With Kathy Patrick back in Washington State, Carolyn Abel's family was fearful they could be targeted.
Vander Plaats is a controversial figure, who has been regarded as a kingmaker among white evangelicals in Iowa, where the conservative Christian vote is a vital voting bloc for Republicans. During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Vander Plaats sparked criticism — including from within the Republican Party — for asking candidates for the GOP nomination to sign a marriage vow promising fidelity to one's spouse, rejection of Sharia Islam and support for robust childbearing and reproduction, among other things.
In 2016, over 60 per cent of Bermudans rejected both same sex marriages and same sex civil unions in a plebiscite held on the same day as Britain's Brexit referendum. The votes were not binding as they did not pass the 50 per cent turnout threshold. Nevertheless the government sought to compromise on the matter, protecting LGBT rights and attempting to respect the will of the people vis a vis marriage as an institution.
Indiana state Rep. Dan Forestal, a Democrat, said he will intervene in the case by trying to block schools whose religious beliefs oppose same-sex marriage from receiving taxpayer voucher funds.
SAGAL: Comey's like, well, we have 41 openings - oh, 42.

Prior to his chat with Meyers, Buttigieg briefly alluded to his personal connection to O'Hare in December, while accepting the nomination to serve as transportation secretary under President Joe Biden.
Let me tell you right now, if you don't own hard copies of Manhattan (and probably all of Woody Allen's movies), Married with Children, Gone with the Wind, and pretty much every one of Normal Lear's 1970's sitcoms (All in the Family, Sanford & Son, etc.), you will eventually lose them.
The apologies Mr. McCormack made in the past are welcome but given the hatefulness of what he said, and the high office he has stepped in to, he needs to walk the talk, Croome said in a statement.
Prior to Biden's inauguration, he and Pelosi attended a mass held at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C. It's unclear whether they took communion but Archbishop Wilton Gregory said beforehand that he wouldn't deny Biden the sacrament.
WARREN: This is a point where we need to talk about race, though.
This was the day that some had doubted would ever come. And now, in the space of a few days, an offer by Chancellor Angela Merkel to allow lawmakers a free vote on the issue has become all but law.
Sandra Ames: Kathy … She went -- did a B-line right to the bedroom. … Kathy came out of the room and said, Carolyn's dead. We need to call an ambulance. No, we need to call the cops. And she didn't want me to go look at the body.
Wanda Abel [reading]: Please know that I loved Carolyn as a sister and a dear friend. … My roommate and are I the two people who found Carolyn in her apartment. Let me know if I can tell you anything.
And there are so many other issues like trans-rights and all other kinds of things that are not okay here and that we need to keep on fighting for.

And then, between gerrymandering and appointing judges, for the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to live with this catastrophe.
BURNETT: Jay, do you think it's fair to say that the biggest threat to the United States could be from our southern border, whether from drug wars or from other terrorist organizations? You know, I was in Laos a year ago and a Mexican drug dealer had been with someone I was with doing a deal for drugs coming from southeast Asia, so it's certainly more than Colombian cocaine now.
We are deeply committed to making sure everyone has access to care – including reproductive health care – regardless of income, race, zip code, health insurance status, or immigration status, Biden said in a joint statement with Vice President Kamala Harris last month recognizing the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that affirmed the right to an abortion.

Peter Van Sant: So, do you believe this sudden move from South Korea to the United States was in a way-- an expression of consciousness of guilt?
BUTTIGIEG: Fifty people, all right. In Charleston alone, just in Charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. That means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from Charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned. Grassroots contributions are the life blood of my campaign.
BUTTIGIEG: ... even goes beyond even what they do...
I talk to people in selfie lines every day who tell me about the importance of getting real help on health care. It's why I also have a way to pay for health care that doesn't raise taxes on middle-class families.
STEYER: Bernie Sanders' analysis is right.

The collision of two core American values — freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination — is prompting a showdown in legislatures and courts across the country.
Peter Van Sant: She's just staring at you?
I think being behind a screen when people don't see my face, it's way easier to talk to people, she explains. So I can just be this Westerner running around and no one cares — like that's just me now.
The Seattle Times has investigated this claim in depth, along with the stories of two other men who also say Murray abused them when they were young. According to the Times report, too much time has passed to file criminal charges, but the same is not true for a civil suit.

When you're talking about opening up restrooms and schools and in public places, it is just uncomfortable, unnatural and unwelcoming to many, many women and girls out there and I think that's what this really boils down to, said Banfield.

I'm curious just overall about your thoughts about lobbying dollars going from industries to committees that regulate those industries.
Trump's additional list, coming just days before the first debate, suggests he wants to add diversity to his earlier all-white list of eight men and three women.

But Carr is waiting to see what Biden will prioritize.
BURNETT: And let me ask you, Jay, about something else. I don't know if everyone remembers but obviously there was a plot that the United States government alleges was put forth by the Iranian government using an Iranian-American in Texas who was hiring a Mexican drug cartel to commit an assassination that would have killed civilians right here in Washington, D.C.
BUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about math, indeed. OK, so here's the math...
I think he needs to prove, other than say that 'it doesn't matter,' that he has the experience to lead, said Runal A. Patel, a 20-year-old college student who also volunteered for New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign. I really hate that whenever he gets asked that question, he sort of just deflects and says, 'Well, you know the last president didn't have any experience.' I always think well, look how that presidency is going. You know, I don't think that that's a good answer.

SAGAL: You know what? They were right. We have gay marriage, now everything's gone to hell.

Thursday's planned votes are a product of an agreement between [Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer]. But even as the leaders announced the deal, they traded barbs in speeches on the Senate floor. McConnell accused Democrats of rejecting a reasonable proposal from Trump because of political opposition to the president, and Schumer argued that Republicans and Trump were operating in bad faith by including new asylum curbs and failing to consult with Democrats.
DAVIES: ...But also for what happened during the night. Tell us about this.
But what to Biden is an advancing equity agenda grounded in his deep Catholic faith appears to some Christian conservatives as attacks on their own intensely held beliefs that will unravel the religious freedom protections championed by the Trump administration. Those protections treated religious beliefs as paramount, even if they conflicted with another person's rights – to an abortion, to marry a person of the same sex, or to be transgender.
The Founders envisioned a Nation in which religious voices and views were integral to a vibrant public square, and in which religious people and institutions were free to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or retaliation by the Federal Government, he said, noting that the fundamental right to religious liberty is Americans' first freedom.
KLOBUCHAR: It is not just who talks the best, who actually gets things done.

The report presents a sobering image for civil rights advocates of Trump's lasting impact on the federal judiciary – one they say threatens to roll back progress made in advancing the rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.
I am not that politically inclined. I view myself as a conservative, but I don't think I have enough information to defend my stance as well as it should be defended, the blog page's profile states. The reasons I am taking this class is because I want to understand the US government, and I hope that it will help me clarify my stance, and then defend it.
When you don't have equal rights, it trickles down to kids who think, 'My aunt's gay so she can't get married, or I'm weird because I feel the same way,' she said. So it's important to break down that barrier. I'm more interested in having a loving, healthy, long-term relationship with someone I might want to have kids with someday.
Merkel could have acted on the issue far sooner, Vetter said, but no matter how it happened it just happened. Now we got the chance and we have to use it.
The couple filed a complaint with the state's civil rights commission, which found Phillips was violating the state's anti-discrimination laws that prohibit businesses from discriminating against LGBTQ people.
BRENNAN: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, would you like to respond?
We can, in fact, find cures if we make the investment, and we can get that done. The American people support it. Even Republicans will support it. We have to focus on extending life, saving life, and making people -- put them in a position to be able to live longer and more securely.
Days later, Patrick led a memorial service for Carolyn.
Jaime A. Davidson – President Trump commuted the sentence of Jaime A. Davidson. This commutation is supported by Mr. Davidson's family and friends, Alice Johnson, and numerous others. In 1993, Mr. Davidson was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in relation to the murder of an undercover officer. Notably, witnesses who testified against Mr. Davidson later recanted their testimony in sworn affidavits and further attested that Mr. Davidson had no involvement. Although Mr. Davidson has been incarcerated for nearly 29 years, the admitted shooter has already been released from prison. Following the commutation of his sentence, Mr. Davidson will continue legal efforts to clear his name. In addition, while incarcerated, Mr. Davidson mentored and tutored over 1,000 prisoners to help them achieve their GED certificates. Mr. Davidson has earned praise from prison officials for his dedication to helping others.

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. Our guest, Alia Volz, writes that before she could spell her own name, she knew she was from an outlaw family. In the late '70s when she was a baby and a toddler, her parents had a roaring business baking and selling marijuana-laced brownies. Thousands a month to hippies, artists, office workers and activists in San Francisco. Volz often made the rounds with her mom, selling their wares to grateful customers every Friday. As colorful as that sounds - and it was - it's no less interesting than another story told in her new memoir, the tale of her parents' relationship.
Chalana McFarland – President Trump commuted the sentence of Chalana McFarland. Ms. McFarland has served 15 years of a 30-year sentence. Though she went to trial, Ms. McFarland actually cooperated with authorities by informing them of a potential attack on the United States Attorney. Her co-defendants who pled guilty, however, received lesser sentences ranging from 5 to 87 months. Ms. McFarland was a model inmate and is now under home confinement.

-- Lawmakers agreed … to more show votes that probably won't end the government shutdown. The Senate will vote tomorrow on competing measures from Trump and Democrats. Both are expected to fail. Erica Werner, John Wagner and Jeff Stein report: The result could be only to prove that some other solution is needed to end the partial shutdown, even as 800,000 federal workers face the loss of a second straight paycheck Friday. Trump's proposal, which the president announced in a weekend speech from the White House, would open the government through Sept. 30 while providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and giving temporary deportation protections to about 1 million unauthorized immigrants. But it also contains stringent changes to the nation's asylum rules, and Democrats who were already united against funding Trump's wall described these asylum provisions Tuesday as a new poison pill. The Democrats' plan is a stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8 without providing any new money for the wall. That would let both parties negotiate on border security while the government is reopened, a respite Democrats have been demanding. …
But he added that if a candidate like Buttigieg were to accept, it could open a door to important conversations.
SAGAL: But on Thursday of this week, we heard that the president had really fired Comey because he didn't like him, and he thought that he was making too much noise about the Russia investigation.

-- The Upstate: The most socially conservative, religious voters are clustered in the Upstate, anchored by Greenville and Spartanburg and home to fundamentalist Bob Jones University. On Friday, most GOP candidates were at the famed college for a Faith and Family Presidential Forum, talking up their socially conservative values on abortion and same-sex marriage. Only Trump, who's come under fire for his obscenities and previous support of same-sex marriage, didn't attend.

In the heat of a presidential campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of Republicans saying that they won't give your nominee a hearing? They clearly don't want to look rude, so they'll meet with him and tell him that they don't want to meet with him. [Laughter]
Firearms are not only necessary for self-defense and for you to honor your primary responsibility in life, which is to protect your family and property; they're an excellent deterrent. I own four firearms. Two are within reach of my bed. Peace of mind, baby.
NEJAME: Well everybody who's watching CNN has an opinion on the case but that doesn't necessarily mean that everybody is in fact watching it. It's interesting to find that those of us who follow matters such as this, it's water cooler talk, and we all follow this and are interested in it. But there's many people who in fact don't follow these matters, then the challenge becomes are those really people you want to have on a jury who really remains so utterly misinformed, but that's what happens.

BRENNAN: Thank you. Next topic. Gayle?
KLEIN: And it's not about winning or losing.
I am not the -- I'm the one choice that makes some sense. I have the experience. I have the resources. And I have the record. And all those sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that. When people hired me to run New York City three times, in an overwhelmingly Democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again.
Darrell Frazier – President Trump commuted the sentence of Darrell Frazier. Mr. Frazier is a 60 year-old who has served 29 years of a life sentence for non-violent conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Mr. Frazier has had an exemplary disciplinary record in prison and has spent his time creating the Joe Johnson Tennis Foundation, a 501(c)(3) that provides free tennis lessons to hundreds of children in underserved communities. Upon his release, Mr. Frazier will have a meaningful place of employment and housing with his mother.

The academy said it invited speakers with a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, and conference participants choose which talks to attend.
Nancy Bercaw: And from the minute she walked into the staff room, she was just a breath of fresh air. …She sort of looked a little bit like Farrah Fawcett.

As news came that the bill had passed — convincingly — they broke out into loud cheers, wept tears of joy and exchanged kisses. Some popped champagne corks in celebration despite the early hour.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said in a speech Sunday that the rights of the LGBT community would be protected during his presidency, according to the state-run Philippine News Agency (PNA).
But one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. And sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the American people actually matter more than your short-term politics. They actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. And there have been a number of times where, as president of the United States, I've had to do things that I knew were bad politics but I understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.

CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated with additional information to clarify that the Browns identify as Fundamentalist Mormons. That denomination is separate from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the mainstream Mormon church.
WARREN: I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will. And the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the Democratic Party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.
Nancy Bercaw: Why couldn't we see through Kathy and Sandra? It's just – unreal. You know, in one fell swoop, you learn that your friends are involved in this crime … And that the one who might have been the killer is free. … because of this loophole in American law.
Let me also say, because just -- since I have the floor for a second, that I really am surprised that all of these -- my fellow contestants up here, I guess, would be the right word for it...
VOLZ: She remembers one day in December of 1981 walking down Castro Street, making her deliveries. And in the window of Star Pharmacy, there was a poster that said gay cancer. And it had photographs of a man's legs and feet with little purple spots on them, which turned out to be Kaposi's sarcoma. And my mom saw that poster and just thought, that's strange. I saw one of those spots on one of my friend's wrist today. It just was a little thing. And then, pretty quickly, people started to get sick.
O'DONNELL: Well, Mayor Bloomberg, Senator Warren has raised...
The vice president expressed support for anti-government demonstrations in Venezuela:

Mr. Holtz has devoted extensive time and resources to supporting charitable causes in South Florida, including substantial donations to the City of Miami Beach.

Axelrod writes that he knew Obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as Obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. Axelrod also admits to counseling Obama to conceal that position for political reasons. Opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' Axelrod writes.
Biden's focus on the common good is a central concept of the centuries-old Catholic social tradition, Massimo Faggioli wrote in the new book Joe Biden and Catholicism in the United States.
His campaign believes the more non-white voters hear his message, the more they'll be open to voting for him. There's at least some evidence that Sanders is benefiting from a generational divide even among non-white voters, NPR's Sam Sanders reports. There hasn't been any South Carolina polling on the Democratic side yet after Iowa and New Hampshire, though.
Six years ago, almost to the day, I was roundly laughed at for warning people to hold on to their hard copies of Blazing Saddles and Gone with the Wind.
Duterte, a controversial leader and firebrand who has been accused of human rights abuses, was elected in 2016 largely because of his zero-tolerance stance toward drug use in the country.
So did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that Republicans really do like him?
Beyond that, Willing to Wait failed to address one issue that weighed heavily on Robinson: how gender dysphoria can make sex for a trans person really complicated — married or not.
Her letter cited a sense of responsibility for both law and justice:
Judge Nance's decision to recuse himself comes less than two years after Kim Davis, a county clerk in Kentucky, defied federal court orders to issue same-sex marriage licenses because it went against her Christian beliefs. She was jailed for her refusal and became a symbol of the resistance to same-sex marriage.

-- Washington will start to see rain tonight that will last into tomorrow. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: High pressure centered offshore and our next system approaching from the west combine for a slightly milder flow from the south. After a significantly less frigid start in the 20s to near 30, temperatures rise into the upper 30s to mid-40s this afternoon under partly to mostly cloudy skies, with winds from the south around 10 mph. Can't rule out a spotty afternoon shower or two, but most of the rain looks to hold off until late tonight.
His campaign exceeded expectations and won a number of major contests against eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Since the 2016 campaign, some of Sanders' more radical ideas have been embraced by many in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, such as his Medicare-for-All proposal. Issues Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, and his defining issue is economic inequality. Sanders spent much of his presidential campaign railing against millionaires and billionaires who continue to profit as the inequality gap increases. Sanders is a longtime supporter of a universal health care system, and introduced the Medicare-for-All bill with 15 other senators in 2017. He also supports raising the minimum wage and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Sanders is a longtime opponent of trade deals, claiming that they hurt they American worker. He opposed NAFTA and the Trans Pacific Partnership, trade deals which President Trump renegotiated or withdrew from. Sanders opposed the U.S. war in Iraq, and remains a critic of American military interventionism. Controversy More than two dozen of Sanders' 2016 campaign staffers wrote a letter to the senator at the end of December seeking a meeting to discuss problems of sexual harassment during the campaign. A New York Times story in early January reported several incidences of sexual misconduct by staffers during the campaign, for which Sanders apologized. Politico also reported in early January that his former Iowa campaign manager, Robert Becker, had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees.

Pete Buttigieg Pete Buttigieg explores presidential bid 06:09 Biography The youngest of the presidential contenders, Pete Buttigieg is also the only openly gay candidate who has jumped into the race. Buttigieg, 37, ran for mayor of South Bend, Indiana, his hometown, when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University. After becoming mayor in 2011, Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015, shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the South Bend Tribune, becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated, Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee. Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However, Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election, acknowledging his long-shot candidacy. Buttigieg married his husband, Chasten Glezman, in June 2018. Issues Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction, such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets. Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing.

To Jair Bolsonaro, the new president of Brazil , the U.S. president is … proof that incendiary comments about women or minorities and a history of trafficking in conspiracy theories don't need to stand in the way of taking power.
Whether or not the Browns would adhere to any of the mainstream Mormon church's stances on LGBTQ issues in any way is unclear. In a 2013 HuffPost Live interview, however, the family said they supported marriage equality. We have established our family the way we've chosen to, we've organized it the way we wanted to, Kody Brown said in that interview, which can be viewed below. We believe that all people should be allowed to have that right.

And he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared I think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that I might make. Because he thinks it's important.
Ever since becoming a star, she's made small, artistically risky films that may not have had an upside where finances or fame or fan service were concerned but pushed the medium in exhilarating and sometimes strange, even alienating ways. For every conventional Hollywood production such as Cold Mountain or The Interpreter, she's made a chilly, Brechtian experiment in actorly submission, such as Lars von Trier's Dogville, or supported a still-emerging filmmaker, as in Jonathan Glazer's superb spiritual thriller Birth.

I do my best, said Williams, who won her last major while pregnant at the 2017 Australian Open. I don't obviously win them all or I'd have, like, 80 Grand Slams. But I do my best to win the ones I can. Obviously if I don't win, I go home. I go back to the drawing board. I see what I can do better. I come back. That's all I can do.
Sandra Ames: The story began with being in bed, and having Kathy at the door of my room, and coming in and saying, I think I killed Carolyn. What with? I asked. And she said, A knife. Where is it? I asked. In the kitchen sink.

-- This Sunday's New York Times Magazine has a lengthy cover story on Mitch McConnell's legacy. The president whom the Senate Republican leader helped elect has turned out to be the one thing he can't control, Charles Homans writes. When I asked Elaine Chao, who is Trump's secretary of transportation and McConnell's wife of 26 years, if Trump and McConnell liked each other, she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, 'You'll have to ask the president that, and you'll have to ask the leader that.' When I did ask McConnell, all he said was, 'Yeah, we get along fine.' …

David Lamar Clanton – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Lamar Clanton. This pardon is supported by Senator Roger Wicker, Alton Shaw, Mark Galtelli, and Terri Rielley. Mr. Clanton was convicted of false statements and related charges.

Mr. Clanton has been active with 4-H Clubs and other organizations in his community.
While the general assumption is that younger Americans are more liberal, and therefore less likely to support Trump, we noted earlier this year that young white men are the only members of the millennial generation — generally but informally defined as those born between 1980 and 2000 — who lean more Republican than Democrat. Millennial men and millennial women tend to identify as Democrats more heavily, as do millennial whites and nonwhites.

Claire Schaefer, a 21-year-old college student whose first choice is Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, also seems dubious that he has the experience to lead — or at least remains unconvinced by the argument he sometimes makes that experience doesn't matter so much. On the debate stage, he has argued that the decades of experience of his competitors have led the country nowhere.

Trump is now spending his final days in office fomenting insurrection and giving medals to sports figures. But the Arizona GOP debacle, and the obsession with demonizing a revered, deceased leader, show the lasting damage Trump has done to the party. In place of McCain, the faces of the state party are now Gosar and Biggs, who along with Alabama's Rep. Mo Brooks allegedly organized last week's protest-turned-riot.
Federal law protects the freedom of Americans and their organizations to exercise religion and participate fully in civic life without undue interference by the Federal Government. The executive branch will honor and enforce those protections, he said.

SANDERS: OK. What the Health and Human Services have said in analyzing health care costs, what Yale -- recent Yale study has said is that your program would cost some $50 trillion over a 10-year period. We would continue to pay in some cases 10 times more for the same exact prescription drugs. What every study out there -- conservative or progressive -- says, Medicare for all will save money. Ours will cost about $45 billion, not $60 trillion.

And we're not going to win these critical, critical House and Senate races if people in those races have to explain why the nominee of the Democratic Party is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime. We've got to be a lot smarter about this and look to the future.
So, David, we know he's trying to build a case to get women's votes. But at best it split. CBS poll came out today, Mitt Romney is leading among women 46 to 44 percent. I want to emphasize that's within the margin of error, but still.
Bermuda's Supreme Court ruled in May 2017 that a registrar's decision to deny a marriage license to a same-sex couple was discriminatory, legalizing marriage equality in the socially conservative Atlantic territory.
1967: Bobbie Gentry Capitol Records Nominees: Lana Cantrell, The 5th Dimension, Harpers Bizarre and Jefferson Airplane After skipping a year, the Grammy's Best New Artist Award went to one of the first female country artists to write and produce her own material. Bobbie Gentry became a star with her ballad, Ode to Billie Joe (which had actually been the B-side of her debut single, Mississippi Delta). It spent four weeks at Number 1 on the Billboard charts in 1967. In addition to Best New Artist, Gentry won Grammys for Best Vocal Performance (Female) and Best Contemporary Group Performance (Vocal or Instrumental) for Ode to Billie Joe. Her follow-up recordings include the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song I'll Never Fall in Love Again, Let It Be Me and All I Have to Do Is Dream (both with Glen Campbell), Fancy, and But I Can't Get Back. In the '70s Gentry retired from performing.

Gabbard, who has spoken out against interventionist wars in the past, was heavily criticized for a 2017 meeting with Assad on what her office called a fact-finding mission. She said had not initially planned to speak with Assad but when the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so, because of the possibility of achieving peace, Gabbard told CNN's Jake Tapper in 2017.
SANDERS: No, no, no, no, no. Joe voted for the war in Iraq. My point was, not to be -- I have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes. That was a bad vote. I have today a D-minus voting record from the NRA. Thirty years ago, I likely lost a race for the one seat for Congress in Vermont because 30 years ago, I opposed -- I supported a ban on assault weapons. Thirty years ago.

The time has come for us to stop acting like the presidency is the only office that matters. Not only is this a way to get Donald Trump reelected.
Quinn Robinson is only 18 years old, but she has already learned some hard lessons about the world. It's scary being a trans person because I know there are people out there who just hate me for being myself, she says. There's been kids who have approached me and say, 'Hey, you should burn in hell.' 
I'm not doing anything special, she said. I'm just doing what I felt like working parents do, she said. They make it work. I'm just like literally everyone else. I'm making it work. It's not easy. But I have to do, as a mom and wife, what I have to do.
Each day next week will have a theme as Biden moves on actions to undo Trump's legacy, CNN reports.
BEYONCE: (Rapping) Twinning - Blue and Rumi, me and Solo, how fitting.
TOTENBERG: Actually, the opposite - the longer a decision is in place, the more weight it has. And in the case of abortion, that decision has been repeatedly reaffirmed over a period of 43 years - versus the same-sex marriage decision, which is just 17 months old. And, indeed, while the court has fleshed out how far states can go in regulating abortions, it's not fleshed out how far states go in discriminating against same-sex couples on religious grounds.
See, all of these things are connected, housing, wages, the ability to get anything meaningful done on criminal justice reform. All of these things are going to be harder to deal with as long as black voices are systematically excluded from political participation, which is happening on everything from the purging of voter rolls to the closing of voting locations. And that harms everyone.
SANDERS: That is untrue, categorically untrue.
You see, I've been around long enough to have learned one very important lesson about the left: no matter how outrageous the idea might sound at the time, the left — with the help of its media machine — will eventually mainstream that idea.
Robinson remembers taking Willing to Wait in eighth grade and believes the program is tone-deaf. She says it sent a message of, Don't have sex — or else. Even though it's called sex ed, she says, no one wanted to say the 'sex' word.

There had been a strain of McCain antipathy within the Arizona party well before Trump, who served in the First Bone Spurs Division during Vietnam and attacked McCain's heroism for years, even posthumously. Meanwhile, a younger, multiracial electorate has been gradually turning against Republicans in the state, as in Texas, Georgia and North Carolina.
But he also urged Jakarta to address past atrocities - like the 1965 massacre of nearly half a million suspected communists - and human rights abuses in the easternmost province of Papua, and the use of the death penalty.

1974: Marvin Hamlisch CBS News Nominees: Bad Company, Johnny Bristol, David Essex, Graham Central Station and Phoebe Snow Composer and arranger Marvin Hamlisch began his career as a rehearsal pianist for Barbra Streisand for the Broadway musical Funny Girl. In 1974 he won three Academy Awards, for The Way We Were (Best Original Song and Best Original Dramatic Score) and The Sting (Best Adaptation, for translating Scott Joplin's ragtime music).

1984: Cyndi Lauper Portrait Records; Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Nominees: Sheila E., Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Corey Hart, and The Judds Cyndi Lauper got her start performing in cover bands before branching out in 1983 with her debut solo effort, She's So Unusual, which featured the hits Girls Just Want to Have Fun, Time After Time, She Bop, and All Through the Night. The success catapulted the Queens, N.Y., native to fame and earned her the Best New Artist award at the 27th Grammys. She's since gone on to win a Tony and an Emmy -- now all Lauper needs is an Oscar to join the exclusive EGOT Club. Lauper has continued to experiment with her sound; her most recent studio set, 2010's Memphis Blues, was nominated for a Best Traditional Blues Album Grammy, and her 2012 Broadway musical, Kinky Boots, earned her a Best Musical Theater Album Grammy (left).

And in this way, the brownies were really all over town. By late 1977, I think, is when they were doing 10,000 brownies a month. It was smart in that there was no fixed location for police to find. The brownies seemed to come from everywhere. And at the same time, it enabled them to reach all of the little culture pockets that were flourishing in the late '70s.
I was the mayor of the largest, most populous city in the United States for 12 years, and people will tell you it's a lot better city today. It is safer for everybody. The school system is better.

The self-destructive madness can be traced to the 2019 election of Kelli Ward (R-Wackadoodle) as state GOP chairwoman. Under the leadership of Ward — a two-time loser of Republican Senate primaries, one against McCain — the party embraced election conspiracy theories: It called for the state legislature to DE-CERTIFY the false results, and when the state's Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, an erstwhile Trump ally, defended the count, Ward tweeted that Ducey should #sthu — shut the hell up.
Here's the problem we have, though: If in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a Democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, We've got another excuse for not confirming a Democratic president's nominee?

BURNETT: When you say everyone is on the same page about a deal, I was talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu a couple of weeks ago and he said he would allow no enrichment, none at all, not even the three percent that you would be using if you were using nuclear power for medical use or things like that. That doesn't really seem to be the same page as the United States, though, right? I mean would --

In the House, he was a member of the pro-business New Democrat Coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the Democratic Party to support more audacious efforts, like the Green New Deal, to mitigate climate change.

At a meeting of Anglican Primates in January of this year, it was decided that for a period of three years The Episcopal Church (TEC) should not be appointed or elected to an internal standing committee and will not take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or policy.

But, you know, I think the way he described it — and I'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself — the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. He has loved being a judge for a very long time. He occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. He's got a great job.
My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful. Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.
Such examinations run counter to our current desire for affirmative representation. But avoidance of uncomfortable truths is not the role of the artist. Healing is impossible if you don't understand the cause of the injury.
The randomness expanded when a package exploded at a FedEx processing facility in Schertz, Texas.

David Tamman – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Tamman. Mr. Tamman's pardon is supported by the Aleph Institute, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh, and former United States Attorney Kendall Coffey. Mr. Tamman was a partner at a major American law firm when he doctored financial documents that were the subject of a Federal investigation. These actions were done at the behest of a client who was perpetrating a Ponzi scheme upon unsuspecting investors. Mr. Tamman was convicted of his crimes following a bench trial and completed his seven-year sentence in 2019. Mr. Tamman accepts full responsibility for his actions and numerous friends and colleagues have attested that he is a decent man who experienced a terrible lapse in judgment for which he has already paid a significant price.

Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 202... 02:18 Biography Warren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma, where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up in a paycheck-to-paycheck family that lived on the ragged edge of the middle class. Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old, and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades, and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there. After the 2008 financial collapse, Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. She served as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. In those roles, she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead, she ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office.
After a nosey member of the community found out Shelly Fitzgerald was married and informed her employer, she was called into the office. Not because they wanted to congratulate her on her previously unknown marriage, but because they wanted to fire her. For 15 years, Shelly has worked as a guidance counselor at Roncalli High School (RHS), a Catholic High School in Indiana. And when the school found out she was married to a woman they were not pleased. They gave her a choice: she could either dissolve her marriage or resign from her job. Shelly isn't taking this lying down, she says she has no intention of leaving the woman she loves who she has been with for more than two decades. And she plans to hire a lawyer. But should she have to? The school says they have every right to force Shelly to choose since all employees know that they are expected to support the teachings of the Catholic Church both in and out of school. That includes the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.
VOLZ: I've done a lot of thinking about this. And I think it's pretty interesting. My dad has a spiritual relationship - or had a spiritual relationship with his epilepsy. He described that in the moments leading up to a seizure, his pre-seizure aura would appear in his peripheral vision as a multi-colored mandala with all colors of the spectrum, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He describes it as being like looking at God. And my dad is such a spiritually serious person that this really attracted him.
Ferrell Damon Scott – President Trump commuted the sentence of Ferrell Damon Scott. This commutation is supported by former Acting United States Attorney Sam Sheldon, who prosecuted his case and wrote that he … strongly does not believe that [Mr. Scott] deserves a mandatory life sentence. Ms. Alice Johnson, the CAN-DO Foundation, and numerous others also support clemency for Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott has served nearly 9 years of a life imprisonment sentence for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. Under today's sentencing guidelines, it is likely that Mr. Scott would not have received such a harsh sentence.

Controversy While Swalwell has not been embroiled in any major scandal or controversy during his tenure in Congress, the California Democrat will surely face criticism from Mr. Trump and Republicans on the campaign trail, especially if he secures the party's nomination, because of his staunch defense of the Mueller probe. What Trump says The president has yet to tweet about Swalwell, but his 2020 campaign has strongly criticized the congressman since the release of the Justice Department's summary of the Mueller report. In a memorandum, Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications of the president's campaign, urged television news outlets to challenge Swalwell and other prominent Democrats who said there was evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.

And I come to this with some humility because I'm conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice. None of us -- none of us have the experience, the lived experience of, for example, walking down the street, or in a mall, and feeling feeling eyes on us, regarding us as dangerous, without knowing the first thing about us just because the color of our skin.
Allendale Public Schools maintains that the sex education program it has used for a decade, called Willing to Wait, meets the requirements of Michigan law, emphasizing the benefits of abstaining from sex until marriage. The superintendent, Garth Cooper, believes that LGBTQ+ kids get the same thing from it as everybody else.
Although she began her career opposing LGBTQ rights, she is now a supporter of LGBTQ issues and has apologized for her previous views. Controversy Gabbard's father was an anti-gay activist whose views influenced his daughter during her early political career. When she ran for the Hawaii state legislature in 2002, Gabbard boasted about supporting her father in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. After her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions. To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii, Gabbard said at the time, according to CNN's KFile. As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. Gabbard apologized to LGBTQ activists in the state when running for Congress in 2012. She apologized again after launching her presidential campaign. Gabbard has invited controversy for her iconoclastic views on foreign policy. In January 2017, she visited Syria and met with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A few months later, the U.S. bombed the Syrian airfield thought to be the origin of a government-ordered deadly chemical attack. Gabbard called the U.S. bombing reckless and questioned whether Assad was behind the attack, garnering criticism from other Democratic politicians.
ALIA VOLZ: Of course. Well, San Francisco in the 1970s was coming out of the Summer of Love, this huge influx of young people who'd come out to experiment with new lifestyles. That was very much over. But all kinds of new subcultures were flourishing. The way that I think about it sometimes is if the '60s were a sketchpad, the '70s would be the box of crayons. There was just wonderful and crazy experimentation. Some of it went horribly awry. And some of it was spectacular.

Assad was accused by the United States and its allies of using chemical weapons to attack civilians during Syria's civil war. Gabbard, however, said she didn't think there was enough evidence to hold Assad responsible then and still doesn't now.

But, number three, you should listen to the scientists and the doctors. They say go very slowly. They haven't done enough research.

Iowa has a way of surprising America and leading it forward — 2008, Iowa made it possible for a candidate whose very name made his campaign extremely improbable to arrive on the scene as a front running presidential candidate and eventually president of the United States, Buttigieg said at a town hall in Mason City, of Barack Obama.
Traie Tavares Kelly – President Trump commuted the sentence of Traie Tavares Kelly. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Kelly was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and 5 kilograms or more of cocaine. He has served over 14 years in prison, but if he were sentenced today, he would likely be subject only to 10-year mandatory minimum. Moreover, Mr. Kelly has substantial work history while incarcerated and his notable accomplishments in education and programming demonstrate that he has used his time to maximize his chance at being a productive citizen upon release.
KEN TUCKER, BYLINE: You can listen to Everything Is Love as the completion of a trilogy. In 2016, Beyonce released her album, Lemonade, which, among many other things, discussed an extramarital affair committed by a husband commonly thought to be her own.

Now we get an album from The Carters, Jay-Z and Beyonce presenting themselves as a united front. Husband and wife, committed partners and musicians.

These parents formed a group called CAST — Conservatives of Allendale Stand Together. In a 29-page complaint to the school board, they accused liberals of trying to indoctrinate their kids with radical sexual ideology.

Republicans say the chances Trump will be convicted in his next impeachment trial are plummeting. A maximum of five or six GOP senators may vote for impeachment, the Hill reports. I thought if he pardoned people who had been part of this invasion of the Capitol, that would have pushed the number higher because that would have said, 'These are my guys,' said one Republican senator. Another said Trump's supporters would be very upset if the party moved to convict him, a base the GOP needs ahead of the 2022 midterms.

Nancy Bercaw [emotional]: And I think it was quite moving.
A whiter judiciary:Trump's 87 picks to be federal judges are 92% white with just one black and one Hispanic nominee
VOLZ: No. And I know that seems strange. But it was something that I learned so young that I don't have a specific memory about it. It was always who we are. So I had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning.

I'm not worried about my religious freedom, Curry said. I get up and go to church on Sunday morning, ain't nobody stopping me. My freedom to worship is protected in this country, and that's not going to get taken away. I have been in places where that's been infringed. That's not what we're talking about.
BUTTIGIEG: We are in the state where Strom Thurmond used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation repeatedly. No less a Senate traditional figure than Harry Reid has called for it to go. It has got to go, because otherwise Washington will not deliver. I was in high school when the Columbine shooting happened. And I remember everybody in Washington saying, never again, we'll never let this happen again.
BURNETT: And why would they come out in waves? Why would you wait -- just because literally they don't have it all together or is this standard procedure? I mean how much more do you think there is and when will we get it?
The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs, but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city. In the video announcing his exploratory committee, Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a fresh start in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation, saying: We're the generation that lived through school shootings, that served in the wars after 9/11, and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different. Controversy Buttigieg has very little controversy around him, other than his age and sexual orientation, which some consider to be automatic strikes against him. In his first term as mayor, he dealt with a scandal at the local police department, which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.

I rather obey the Lord's command than obeying the desires of the flesh. Im not condemning anyone, but I'm just telling the truth of what the Bible says. The truth from the Bible is what changed me from my old ways. 1 Corinthians 6:9 [9] Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men. God Bless everyone i love you all.

Gus Kenworthy leaves the Pyeongchang Olympics empty-handed, failing to land a run in the slopestyle final Sunday. But his heart is full, knowing what he did here is far bigger than sport. In the evolution of societal attitudes toward gays and lesbians, Kenworthy and Adam Rippon's participation here will be a watershed moment.
Activists have raised concerns that, if approved, the new rules could violate basic rights and be misused to target minorities.
Ensz, whose ministry at George Mason is ecumenical, said that because this was his first offense, he doesn't expect his credentials to be pulled.

And that's not the only right-wing senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded. In 2016, he dumped $12 million into the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator. And I just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. She lost by a single point.
Here are the seven candidates for the presidential nomination.
And so I — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just Democrats, but a sizable number of Republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government. And what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the Constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.
It's a much different political reality in Colorado where the state's new Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser will defend the state against Phillips.

Carolyn Abel put up a fight in her last minutes of life. She had a number of defensive wounds. And she took the brunt of it. More than 30 stab wounds including a cut -- from ear to ear on the-- on the throat. And there was blood everywhere in here. On the walls, on the bed. It was a mess.
As the scope of the destruction became apparent, I spoke to each of these gentlemen, and they each asked the same simple question: 'How can I help?' Obama said with his two predecessors at his side in the Rose Garden. In the days ahead, they'll be asking everyone what they can do — individuals, corporations, NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] and institutions.
AHERN: Sure it is. But, I think, Erin, let's put a couple of things in perspective. Certainly when you aggregate the amount of cartel deaths, again action 47,000 or 50,000, it's more than any other loss of life anywhere else on the globe so that poses a significant threat.
BUTTIGIEG: Yes, in effect, it was. Because it was about profiling people based on their race. And the mayor even said that they disproportionately stopped white people too often and minorities too little. And I'm not here to score points. I come at this with a great deal of humility, because we have had a lot of issues, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing in my own community.
1979: Rickie Lee Jones Warner Brothers Nominees: The Blues Brothers, Dire Straits, The Knack and Robin Williams Chuck E's In Love was just one of the songs on Rickie Lee Jones' debut album, a captivating blend of folk, R&B and jazz. The 21-year-old singer-songwriter, hailing from a long line of performers, was joined on her album by Dr. John, Michael McDonald and Randy Newman. An appearance on Saturday Night Live and an article in Time Magazine that labeled her The Duchess of Coolsville burnished her reputation. Nominated for five Grammys (including Record of the Year and Song of the Year), Jones won Best New Artist. Jones would record 20 more studio and live albums, her most recent being the 2012 folk rock album, The Devil You Know. In 1989 Jones shared a second Grammy with Dr. John for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group, for Makin' Whoopee. She has a new album due out in Spring 2015.
ThinkProgress has tried to smear Sullins for his religious faith and his priesthood. The author, Zack Ford, a columnist and not an expert in sociological research, called the study hugely flawed and ran a picture of Sullins in his priestly garb.

Wanda Abel: I was worried that Kathy would try to kill us, because Kathy wrote these letters to my parents that she was her great friend and that … she'd love to meet them. … and I was working through my mind, What would I do if I saw this person or if she showed up at my house?

LGBT advocates say the bill would make it harder for gays and lesbians to get counseling.
But what happened here is we went back 40 years and we could only find three cases where women said they were uncomfortable. Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two. And what the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. I did that two days later, and my company has said we will not use nondisclosure agreements ever again. The senator has got it. And I don't know what else she wants us to do.

But let me just say, when you're talking about affordable housing, we created 175,000 units of affordable housing in New York City. And I listened to them. They're in Congress and they say they can't get it done, can't get it done. But if you change something like the president, they would. No, you have to learn how to work with both sides of the aisle and then you can get stuff done.
BUTTIGIEG: Yes, so, when I was born, there was no difference in your life expectancy, if you were born in a rural area or a city.

And we're seeing them, in particular, in states where Medicaid was not expanded, something that is hurting black and poor white families and is largely the result of racial voters suppression.

Kirsten Gillibrand Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presid... 09:35 Biography Kirsten Gillibrand, born in 1966, is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother, Polly Noonan, was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand, the daughter of two attorneys, was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law. Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s, although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner, a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand, and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004, believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning. Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney, who represented a conservative district, in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities, and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state, Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her.

Touting his personal love of transportation, he said: Travel in my mind is synonymous with growth, with adventure, even love ― so much so that I proposed to my husband Chasten in an airport terminal.
KLOBUCHAR: You want to have someone in charge of this ticket who wants to put forward $60 trillion in spending, three times the American economy.
BUTTIGIEG: ... American credibility, the only way you can do this is to actually win the presidency. And I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump, with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s, and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.
But you just told me they were hatched. [Laughter]
1989: Milli Vanilli Arista Records Nominees: Neneh Cherry, Indigo Girls, Soul II Soul and Tone Lōc Milli Vanilli rose to fame in the late '80s and early '90s following the release of the hit album, Girl You Know It's True. Rob Morvan and Rob Pilatus served as the faces of the popular German duo, though the world would soon learn that they did not provide vocals on any of their recordings -- but not before Milli Vanilli swooped up the Best New Artist honor at the Grammys. The award was later revoked -- the only time a Grammy win has ever been vacated -- and several lawsuits followed. Morvan and Pilatus attempted to make music on their own, under a different group name, but it failed to gain any traction. Years later, in 1998, Milli Vanilli started prepping a comeback album, called Back and In Attack, but the set never saw the light of day. Pilatus died on April 2, 1998 at the age of 32 of a suspected alcohol and prescription pill overdose -- right before the launch of a promotional tour for the LP.
In addition to that, being progressive, he thought Barack Obama -- he wanted a primary-- he said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it. Look, folks, this is -- let's talk about progressive. Progressive is getting things done, and that's what we got done. We got a lot done

Senator Klobuchar, I'd like to change topics and ask you, rural areas have populations who are older, sicker, and poorer than non-rural communities. And they have to travel farther to get medical help when they need it. Expanding coverage is going to be useless if there are no providers to go to. So how would you ensure that there is available health care in rural areas?
VOLZ: Well, yeah, San Francisco has changed quite a bit. With respect to cannabis, it is now legal for adult use. And San Francisco and then California were first in denoting cannabis as an essential business during coronavirus, which was a watershed moment. Nothing like that has happened before. So cannabis is very accessible to people. I feel that, at least for adults, that it should be. I think this is a good thing. But the culture has changed so much around it in ways that I find very heartbreaking.

-- Here are the 10 biggest truth bombs from the 36-page Coats report. These are direct quotes:
It is a remarkable statement that sets a new bar for leadership in the House, said Brendan Buck, a former aide to House Speaker John A. Boehner. She is turning the page on Donald Trump. I think she is doing the right thing in her mind, and when you do the right thing for the right reasons you have to hope the politics work out for you.

Investing isn't all about the nuances of stocks and bonds and the twists and turns of the market — sometimes, it involves matters of the heart. On Monday, UBS announced it had raised $325 million for The Rise Fund, which was co-founded by Bono and hopes to combine financial returns and support a range of social and environmental causes. The fund's total size is $2 billion and is managed by Bill McGlashan, founder and managing partner of TPG Growth, Reuters reports. Its investments include EverFi, a provider of subscription-based digital learning to K-12 schools, universities, corporations, sports teams and NGOs, and Dodla, an Indian dairy business.

Buttigieg has been feuding with Vice President Mike Pence over his opposition to gay marriage and gay rights. If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade, Buttigieg said at an LGBTQ Victory Fund brunch earlier this month. And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand — that if you've got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.
Well, you know what? That's exactly what I've done. And so there's no contradiction between what I'm doing and what Joe Biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.
So the scene down at Fisherman's Wharf was one of the spectacular emergences. There were, actually, at the time, thousands of artists and crafts people who sold to tourists on the street all kinds of things they made themselves.

The Equality Act passed the House on a largely party-line vote, 224-206, with only three Republicans joining Democrats in favor.
KLOBUCHAR: People aren't always aware, I know you are in South Carolina, about how much poverty there is, particularly child poverty in rural areas. So the answer is one size doesn't fit all. And one of the ways you do this, right now we have something called critical access hospitals so they're designated for rural areas. And actually, I am leading -- the lead Democrat on a bill to extend that, to have other types of hospitals, like emergency rooms in rural areas be covered.
But even in her worst movies, Kidman is never the problem; her performances rise above whatever dreck they're in, as if her supreme self-possession as a performer inoculated her against the toxic material she was working with. And the bad movies are relatively thin on the ground compared with the myriad triumphs: She won an Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours (we're still arguing about that nose), but that was a full seven years after her astonishing portrayal of a fame-hungry TV journalist in To Die For, in which she permanently shut up the doubters in a triumphantly crafty, satirical turn.
KLOBUCHAR: I have passed the bill that allows doctors from other countries that study in our medical schools to stay and serve in rural areas. We need to expand that.
I would also recommend obtaining a conceal carry permit.
Last year, Judge Kyle Duncan, whom Trump also nominated to the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion rejecting a transgender federal prisoner's request to be referred to in court papers using female pronouns in accordance with the inmate's gender identity. Duncan wrote that doing so could raise delicate questions about judicial impartiality.
Bill K. Kapri – President Trump granted a commutation to Bill Kapri, more commonly known as Kodak Black. Kodak Black is a prominent artist and community leader. This commutation is supported by numerous religious leaders, including Pastor Darrell Scott and Rabbi Schneur Kaplan. Additional supporters include Bernie Kerik, Hunter Pollack, Gucci Mane, Lil Pump, Lil Yachty, Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens, Jack Brewer formerly of the National Football League, and numerous other notable community leaders. Kodak Black was sentenced to 46 months in prison for making a false statement on a Federal document. He has served nearly half of his sentence. Before his conviction and after reaching success as a recording artist, Kodak Black became deeply involved in numerous philanthropic efforts. In fact, he has committed to supporting a variety of charitable efforts, such as providing educational resources to students and families of fallen law enforcement officers and the underprivileged. In addition to these efforts, he has paid for the notebooks of school children, provided funding and supplies to daycare centers, provided food for the hungry, and annually provides for underprivileged children during Christmas. Most recently while still incarcerated, Kodak Black donated $50,000 to David Portnoy's Barstool Fund, which provides funds to small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Kodak Black's only request was that his donation go toward restaurants in his hometown.

Tom Leroy Whitehurst – President Trump commuted the sentence of Tom Leroy Whitehurst from life to 30 years. This clemency is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Whitehurst led a conspiracy to manufacture at least 16.7 kilograms of methamphetamine and possessed numerous firearms during the course of the conspiracy. The court sentenced him to life imprisonment under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. Mr. Whitehurst has served nearly 24 years in prison. While incarcerated, he has demonstrated exemplary prison conduct by incurring just a single disciplinary infraction over two decades ago and holding a UNICOR position for much of his incarceration.

Johnny D. Phillips, Jr. – President Trump granted a full pardon to Johnny D. Phillips, Jr. This pardon is supported by Senator Rand Paul, the former United States Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, and numerous members of his community. In 2016, Mr. Phillips was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud. Mr. Phillips is known as an upstanding citizen and is a valued member of his community. He dedicates his time to his three young children and is an advocate for Type 1 diabetes research.

But I think, you know, this is not even an economic ad. This is an attempt by the Obama camp to draw an early contrast to define the candidate further as a person. It is a personal attack, a personal characterization about values underlying the economy, rather than anything aiming to provide a prescription for how to solve this problem. BURNETT: Speaking of how the president wants to be seen. So, today, he gave the commencement address at Barnard College. And I watched it, and I watched the introduction to him. It's very laudatory.

From the beginning of the Trump administration, Democrats have continually criticized current Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos for not having worked as a regular public school teacher.

An Argument for the Death Penalty
AHERN: Well, I think one of the things that's important to recognize, these are criminal organizations and they certainly will diversify what their level of criminality is, whether drugs today, weapons tomorrow or a need to move high-valued targets across the border. Certainly, that was a great piece of work by the federal agencies specifically doing drug investigations and actually uncovered the individual who was contemplating an assassination attempt.
Justice Kennedy was confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and I'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of Democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's office. So we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that Democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the Supreme Court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the Supreme Court, but the integrity of the Senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.

Sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with Becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. What Trump says President Trump has alternated between praising Sanders and insulting him as crazy. As some of Mr. Trump and Sanders' populist ideas overlap, Mr. Trump often said during the 2016 campaign that Sanders voters would defect to him over Hillary Clinton in the general election. Mr. Trump also accused Clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from Sanders, and criticized Sanders for eventually endorsing Clinton. While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, Mr. Trump tweeted in July 2016. Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary, he wrote in another July tweet. In several subsequent tweets, Mr. Trump has called Sanders Crazy Bernie. He has often referred to the 2016 Democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.
During the 2016 presidential race, Donald Trump famously said I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters.
Conversion therapy, misgendering and wedding vendor disputes
-- The Supreme Court allowed Trump's transgender troop ban to go into effect as it works its way through lower courts. Robert Barnes and Dan Lamothe report: The justices lifted nationwide injunctions that had kept the administration's policy from being implemented. The Trump policy reverses an Obama administration rule that would have opened the military to transgender men and women and instead bars those who identify with a gender different from the one assigned at birth and are seeking to transition. The court's five conservatives — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh — allowed the restrictions to go into effect while the court decides whether eventually to consider the merits of the case. The liberal justices — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — would have kept the injunctions in place.

Nondiscrimination is a great American principle — it's a core American principle — as is religious freedom, Haynes says. When you have two important American principles coming into tension, into conflict with one another, our goal as Americans is to sit down and try to see if we can uphold both.
1998: Lauryn Hill Ruffhouse/Columbia; Vince Bucci/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: Backstreet Boys, Andrea Bocelli, Dixie Chicks and Natalie Imbruglia In 1998 the singer-rapper (who's previously won two Grammys as part of the band The Fugees) released her first solo album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Debuting at No. 1, it copped her honors for Album of the Year, as well as four other Grammys (including Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for Doo Wop (That Thing)). She was the first woman to receive 10 Grammy nominations in a single year, and the first to win five in one night. She won another as co-producer of the 1999 Album of the Year, Supernatural by Santana. She bowed out of public life following her last album, MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, in 2001, though she continued to record. Hill rejoined the Fugees for a tour in 2005, but split yet again. In 2013 Hill served three months in federal prison on tax evasion charges.
1995: Hootie & the Blowfish Atlantic Records Nominees: Brandy, Alanis Morissette, Joan Osborne and Shania Twain Formed in 1986 at the University of South Caroline, Hootie & the Blowfish came on the scene in 1994 with its debut album, Cracked Rear View -- still one of the Top 20 best-selling albums of all time. With radio hits Hold My Hand, Let Her Cry and Only Wanna Be with You, it was difficult to avoid this band in the mid-'90s. Hootie & the Blowfish (Mark Bryan, Dean Felber, Darius Rucker, Jim Soni Sonefeld) took home the Best New Artist 1995 Grammy and continued putting out music until 2005. Frontman Darius Rucker continued to tour with the band over the years, but more recently has found success as a country artist. His version of Wagon Wheel won Best Country Solo Performance at the 56th Grammy Awards.

We live in a time when the freedom of religion is under assault, then-Vice President Mike Pence told Liberty University graduates in 2019. During the Trump administration, Pence's strong faith-based views on abortion and homosexuality made him a target of Democratic criticism, including from those seeking the party's 2020 presidential nomination. Biden had to backtrack after being lambasted by progressives and LGBTQ activists for calling Pence a decent guy.

Kenneth Kurson – President Trump granted a full pardon to Kenneth Kurson. Prosecutors have charged Mr. Kurson with cyberstalking related to his divorce from his ex-wife in 2015. In a powerful letter to the prosecutors, Mr. Kurson's ex-wife wrote on his behalf that she never wanted this investigation or arrest and, repeatedly asked for the FBI to drop it… I hired a lawyer to protect me from being forced into yet another round of questioning. My disgust with this arrest and the subsequent articles is bottomless… This investigation only began because Mr. Kurson was nominated to a role within the Trump Administration. He has been a community leader in New York and New Jersey for decades. In addition, Mr. Kurson is a certified foster parent, a successful business owner, and is passionate about various charitable causes. Mr. Kurson is an upstanding citizen and father to five beautiful children.
And when you hear Judge Garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the Oklahoma City bombing — you get a sense of who that person is.

The president did not pardon Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, two whistleblowers who illegally shared America's intelligence and national security secrets. The two individuals enjoyed bipartisan support for a pardon as their supporters had hoped that the president would ignore the intelligence community elites and prominent members of Congress in Washington who were deeply opposed to a pardon.
The bravery and courage he has is amazing, Austin Parrish, a former swimmer who came out in high school before competing collegiately at Eastern Illinois, told USA TODAY Sports. I personally love that he is taking on Mike Pence. I'm from Indiana, where Pence was my governor while I was a college athlete.

In his discussion with Beck, Buttigieg took aim at Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, legislation that Pence, then governor of the state, signed into law in 2015.

On immigration, O'Rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. In 2014, he called President Obama's executive action creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed Congress. He also backed Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan's leadership challenge against then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2016. O'Rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust Cruz in 2018. His robust Senate bid in Texas -- along with his Obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. Although he failed to unseat Cruz, O'Rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in Texas -- including the state's large and growing Latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. No Democrat had come that close to winning a Senate race in Texas since 1988. Despite the loss, O'Rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. Although he told 60 Minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, O'Rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. Issues In his six years in Congress, O'Rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, LGBT rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights.

-- Federal judges chose a Virginia House of Delegates redistricting map considered highly favorable to Democrats. Gregory S. Schneider reports: Six Republicans would wind up in districts where a majority of voters chose Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election, according to an analysis of the maps by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. No current Democrats would see their voter majority change to Republican, based on those election results. The map could help Virginia Democrats flip the House of Delegates, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority.

Stephen Odzer – President Trump granted a conditional pardon to Stephen Odzer. This pardon is supported by former Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, Sigmund Sig Rogich, Jason Greenblatt, Michael Steinhardt, Wayne Allyn Root, Salvador Moran, the Aleph Institute, and numerous members of Mr. Odzer's religious community. Mr. Odzer pled guilty to conspiracy and bank fraud, for which he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Numerous individuals testify to his substantial philanthropic and volunteer activities. His philanthropic endeavors include providing personal protective equipment to front-line workers in New York City hospitals; visiting sick children in hospitals; and donating religious materials to prison inmates and U.S. Service Members around the world. He has also dedicated resources to support and build synagogues in memory of his late cousin who was kidnapped and killed by Muslim terrorists while in Israel. The pardon requires Mr. Odzer to pay the remainder of his restitution order.

Robert William Cawthon – President Trump granted a full pardon to Robert William Cawthon. His pardon is supported by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Cawthon was convicted in 1992 for making a false statement on a bank loan application and was sentenced to 3 years' probation, conditioned upon 180 days' home confinement. Mr. Cawthon has accepted responsibility for his offense, served his sentence without incident, and fulfilled his restitution obligation. His atonement has been exceptional, and since his conviction he has led an unblemished life while engaging in extensive, praiseworthy community service.

James Austin Hayes – President Trump granted a full pardon to James Austin Hayes. Mr. Hayes's pardon is supported by Paula White, Rick Hendrick of Hendrick Motorsports, and NASCAR legend Jeff Gordon.

Since his conviction, Mr. Hayes has been active in his church and his community.
Chris Young – President Trump commuted the remaining sentence of Chris Young. This commutation is supported by the Honorable Kevin H. Sharp, Mr. Young's sentencing judge, former law enforcement officials and Federal prosecutors, and multitudes of criminal justice reform advocates, including Alice Johnson, Kevin Ring, Jessica Jackson Sloan, Topeka Sam, Amy Povah, the Aleph Institute, Mark Holden, Doug Deason, and David Safavian, among others. Mr. Young, who is 32 years old, has served over 10 years of a 14 year sentence for his role in a drug conspiracy. Although initially sentenced to a mandatory life sentence that Judge Sharp called not appropriate in any way, shape, or form, Mr. Young has made productive use of his time in prison by taking courses and learning coding skills. He also has maintained a spotless disciplinary record. Mr. Young's many supporters describe him as an intelligent, positive person who takes full responsibility for his actions and who lacked a meaningful first chance in life due to what another Federal judge called an undeniably tragic childhood. With this commutation, President Trump provides Mr. Young with a second chance.

No sooner had Kidman delivered a powerhouse with Big Little Lies than she whipsawed her audience into another direction entirely: In Queen of the Desert, out Friday, she portrays the storied explorer, writer and photographer Gertrude Bell, a contemporary of T.E. Lawrence who traveled the Arabian Peninsula in the early 20th century and helped redraw the region's national boundaries after World War I. Written and directed by Werner Herzog with an uncharacteristically blunt and stodgily sentimental hand, Queen of the Desert isn't a great film. In fact, it's often a very bad one, its strenuous efforts to be the female version of Lawrence of Arabia notwithstanding. But none of its faults lie with Kidman, who dominates the screen in nearly every shot with regal composure and restraint (and, apparently, a generous supply of SPF-50 sunscreen).

Castro is also a supporter of the rights of women to have an abortion. He spoke at the annual luncheon for Planned Parenthood South Texas in May. Controversy In 2016, the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative body, found that Castro had violated the Hatch Act by commenting on the 2016 presidential campaign during an interview about local issues.

The decision marked an extraordinary denouement for Cheney and her potentially precarious perch in the party's leadership.

2004: Maroon 5 Octone/J Nominees: Los Lonely Boys, Joss Stone, Kanye West and Gretchen Wilson Before there was Maroon 5, there was Kara's Flowers. Singer Adam Levine and some of the original Maroon 5 members founded that group back in 1994 while still in high school. They released The Fourth World in 1997, but after a lukewarm response decided to revamp the band's sound, add guitarist James Valentine to the line-up, and call themselves Maroon 5. By 2002, the Levine-fronted Los Angeles-based band had Songs About Jane, the hit album featuring the massive hit Harder to Breathe. Soon, Maroon 5 walked away with the 2004 Grammy for Best New Artist. Four more studio albums (and plenty more radio hits) followed. In total, Maroon 5 has received three Grammys from 12 nominations. Levine, meanwhile, has gone on to become a huge success on his own. He has served as a mentor on The Voice, and was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 2013.
In 1981 an infectious disease researcher at the National institutes of Health started noticing reports that clusters of gay men were being diagnosed with infections that were highly unusual in younger people. It would take a few years before the medical community identified HIV which, left unchecked, can develop into the deadly syndrome known as AIDS.
GARRETT: OK. Mayor Bloomberg, please, we were going to ask you about this. I want to give you a chance to respond, because in addition to what Senator Warren just said on Twitter, she called you a liar and a borderline racist because of what you said about red-lining.
BIDEN: This man said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did.
I think a lot of what we also need to do is to make sure that when we do this that we have money for treatment. And it's not necessarily because of marijuana. It is because of things like opioids and the like. And that's why one of the first plans I put out was for treatment, because if you want to make the criminal justice system work, you don't want to have repeat customers, and you want to help people to get off of drugs.

No one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and I believe that is a good thing: It creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives — a thirst that has been evident in audiences for The Inheritance and a thirst that the theater, television and film industries have been too slow to satisfy.

Clarence Olin Freeman – President Trump granted a full pardon to Clarence Olin Freeman. This pardon is supported by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Freeman was convicted in 1965 for operating an illegal whiskey still. He received 9 months imprisonment and 5 years' probation. Since his conviction and release from prison, Mr. Freeman has led a law-abiding life. He has expressed sincere remorse for his illegal activity and remains mindful of the valuable lesson his conviction taught him. In the approximately 55 years since his conviction, he has built a stable marriage, founded a thriving business, and contributed positively to his community. He has earned a reputation for honesty, hard work, and generosity.
The Justice Department has sided with a baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. For the LGBT community, it's the latest disappointment from the Trump administration.
Salomon Melgen – President Trump commuted the sentence of Salomon Melgen.

It continues to be the case that Iowa is very important because it's our opportunity to demonstrate our strength for a lot of voters who I think are very pragmatic in places like South Carolina and Nevada, who above all, want to see a candidate who can win, Buttigieg told reporters at a campaign stop in Nevada on January 11.
Those conservative doctrinal positions went against prevailing cultural and social trends, at least in the United States, but they didn't split the church into rival conservative and progressive camps because church leaders rarely enforced them.

The other case involves two women, one from the U.S., and one from Italy, who met in New York, wed in London and each gave birth to a son. The State Department didn't recognize the couple's marriage, the lawsuit said, and only granted citizenship to the boy whose biological mother was born and raised in the U.S.
Gary Evan Hendler – President Trump granted a full pardon to Gary Evan Hendler. This pardon is supported by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. In 1984, Mr. Hendler was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and dispense controlled substances and served 3 years' probation for his crime. He is remorseful and has taken full responsibility for his criminal actions. In the 40 years since his conviction, Mr. Hendler has lived a law-abiding life and has positively contributed to his community. He is financially stable and owns a successful real estate business. Most notably, he has helped others recover from addiction. Since 1982, he has organized and led weekly AA meetings. He also has mentored many individuals on their journey to sobriety with his radio broadcasts. His former probation officer noted that Mr. Hendler had become integral in the lives of many members of the community who were dealing with substance abuse issues. Further, his efforts in addiction and recovery have been recognized by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, who recently appointed him to a state advisory council on drug and alcohol abuse.

Randall Duke Cunningham – President Trump granted a conditional pardon to Randall Duke Cunningham who was released from prison in 2013. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich strongly supports this pardon. Mr. Cunningham, a former California Congressman, was sentenced to over 8 years' imprisonment for accepting bribes while he held public office. During his time in prison, Mr. Cunningham tutored other inmates to help them achieve their GED. Mr. Cunningham is a combat veteran, an ace fighter pilot, and a member of the Military Order of Purple Hearts. Although combat-disabled, he continues to serve his community by volunteering with a local fire department and is active in Bible Study.
A campaign aide told CBS News that the former South Bend mayor will continue to emphasize his belief in the importance of building a broad coalition. He often mentions his campaign is reaching out to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, moderates and future former Republicans.
To see somebody celebrated when they're often used to being disenfranchised, it's a flip of the script.
One of his missions, he has said, is to improve the symbolism of the office. Because the presidency is also a moral office, Buttigieg tells Dickerson, co-host of CBS This Morning. It calls this nation to its highest values. And it sets the tone for the story that we tell ourselves. Narrative is a very powerful thing, and we need to make sure that everybody in America understands where they fit in this country's story.

Number two, with respect to my actions when I was a junior senator, you will recall that I never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. I never said that a nominee should not get a vote. And what I also said at the time was that I was concerned about some of Judge Alito's views that I considered more troubling. But in the case of Merrick Garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.
One need only consider Kidman's vanity-free supporting appearance in last year's Lion, alight quickly on Moulin Rouge! and The Others and go all the way back to her breakout roles in Dead Calm and Days of Thunder to appreciate the rigor and expressive range of an actress who can easily hold her own with the Meryl Streeps, Viola Davises and Cate Blanchetts of the world but is rarely mentioned in their company.

And the story that I had grown up with in my family - and I don't - I'm not even sure when I was told this - but was that he left the hospital and went to a gay bathhouse and spent the day there, which is a difficult moment to begin with. That was one of the more challenging conversations I had with my father in writing this book, I have to admit.
-- South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg entered the 2020 Democratic primary. Cathleen Decker reports: Buttigieg made his plans official in a video and email sent to supporters early Wednesday, before taking part in the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in Washington, D.C. He announced in December that he would not seek a third term as mayor of the Indiana city, a move widely seen as a precursor to a presidential run. He said Wednesday he was setting up an exploratory committee for president, the legal mechanism allowing him to raise and spend money on behalf of his campaign. Buttigieg suffused his announcement with references to his youth and the generational exception he represents compared to most of the Democratic field. He turned 37 on Saturday, making him the youngest entrant so far in the presidential race.
And at that point the process has broken down. Democrats have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which Democrats have left a seat open when a Republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.

Guatemala also voted with the United States on Jerusalem and announced it would move its own embassy to the city. Months later, in August, President Jimmy Morales declared he was abolishing the mandate of a U.N.-backed commission that had long been known as an effective watchdog in curbing corruption.

But there are still places in the world where daring to be yourself is dangerous, where being gay can get you killed. There are politicians in our own country, the president and vice president chief among them, who view members of the LGBTQ community as being somehow less, and promote policies that have no other objective than to marginalize them.
And I want to make clear, given South Carolina and the rural population, as well as urban, that this isn't just an urban problem. It's a big urban problem, but it's also a rural problem, where we have housing deserts and people want to have their businesses located there, but they're not able to get housing.

The suit was one of two filed last year by an LGBTQ immigrant rights group that said the State Department is discriminating against same-sex binational couples by denying their children citizenship at birth.

Only the Los Angeles case was decided Thursday.
Theresa May's Brexit strategy has been to make determined noises while championing a cause – leaving the EU – she campaigned and voted against, and she consistently makes zero productive headway with it. Her predecessor David Cameron's negotiation of the ultimately null EU reform deal in 2016 was far more Thatcheresque in its intention and execution (even if the referendum he called subsequently was not). Coverage of his doings, however, didn't call him Maggie – or indeed, refer to other male PMs who went before him. When he acted in his own name, he was treated as such.

If a football coach is not allowed to lead his team in a public prayer, or a high school valedictorian is not given permission to read a Bible passage for her graduation speech, or the owner of a private chapel is told he cannot refuse to accommodate a same-sex wedding, they might claim their religious freedom has been infringed. Others might argue that such claims go against the principle of church-state separation, or that they undermine the rights of LGBT people to be free from discrimination.

So during that span of time when there was just nothing for people to do to take care of themselves, cannabis emerged really early on as helpful with some of the symptoms. Nobody thought weed was going to cure AIDS (laughter). But it helped with the wasting syndrome, which manifested with a total loss of appetite and crushing nausea. Cannabis was good for that. It helped with insomnia, depression, pain. So people began to turn to cannabis to help feel a little better while this horrible, horrible thing was going on. And in the case of the wasting syndrome, it helped them eat. It helped them hang on longer. It became very important.

2007: Amy Winehouse Island Records Nominees: Feist, Ledisi, Paramore and Taylor Swift After her 2003 debut album, Frank, Winehouse's second album, Back to Black earned her five Grammys, including Album of the Year and Song of the Year (for Rehab). Her bluesy voice was hailed by such writers as The New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones, who said, She sounded like an original sixties soul star capable of utterly weird phrasings that no one could match. Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning on July 23, 2011, at her home in London. Her last recording -- a duet with Tony Bennett, Body and Soul -- was released posthumously, and won her a sixth Grammy.

VOLZ: Oh, absolutely. So there had been, since maybe the mid-'70s, the beginnings of a medical marijuana movement. But it really had not made it into the press in a significant way. And it was very small. And marijuana was still, in the American consciousness, not considered a medicine. It was considered a party drug.

At a point, he had a method where he thought that if - when the mandala appeared, if he shifted his eyes hard in the opposite direction, he could stop himself from having a seizure. So he kept trying to control it.
We're going to begin with you, Vice President Biden, for this part. Just across the street, as you mentioned at the top of the debate, is the theater (sic) where nine people were shot and killed inside the Mother Emanuel Church. We all remember that day back in 2015.

The only way to really change perceptions, break down homophobia, break down barriers is through representation, Kenworthy said Sunday afternoon.
'by emboldening the right wing through vitriolic rhetoric, the donald trump administration has become the uv light in sleazy motel rooms that illuminates these hidden stains on our democracy.' 
WARREN: Education is not free. We must invest in the future of our children.
The way we do this, we've got to help them create wealth, and that's why we double the amount of money that is available for young entrepreneurs and black entrepreneurs, are as successful as any other group of people in the country. We go from 1.5 billion to $3 billion, taking $30 billion off the sidelines. That's how you create wealth.
Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start — and I've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do — I believe in the Second Amendment. It's there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around — I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this — I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.
One of the ways that he's living out his faith is by centering the issues of equity at the heart of his administration, which I find super-exciting, she said. It's never happened before.

Kathy Patrick: No! This has to stop now, please. … You're really sidelining me here, and I am not prepared to answer questions here at my place of work. This happened 30 years ago, I have been available to investigators in Korea and in the U.S.
JAY AHERN, FORMER HEAD OF U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Yes, I think when you actually take a look, Erin, the numbers may be closer to 50,000 since December of 2006 when President Calderon really started to take the fight to the cartels. We've seen it start to level a little bit in the last few months. Leveling is really a statement of choice here, that about 1,000 killings per month. But the gravity and the heinousness of the killings this past few days really shows as far as how aggressive and how ruthless these individuals are. Beyond just the beheadings, the cutting off the arms and legs sends a strong signal.
Why do they fight for control of that border? Because the drug wars are continuing. Ninety percent of the cocaine that enters the American country and it comes through Mexico. It's also the main supplier of marijuana and meth in this country.
-- The high court announced it will consider a New York City gun law, marking the first time the justices have taken up a Second Amendment case in nearly a decade. Robert Barnes reports: The decision to hear the case in the term that begins in October may signal that the reinforced conservative majority on the court is ready to examine more laws that restrict gun rights. New York's law is not replicated elsewhere: It permits transporting handguns only to firing ranges within the city. Those who challenged the law have licenses to keep a handgun at their homes. Petitioners included those who want to take their guns to firing ranges or competitions outside the city, and one who wanted to take the gun to his second home upstate.
NPR reached out to several members of CAST multiple times over a period of months, but no one from the group agreed to be interviewed. They did send a statement, though.

And when members of the U.N. Security Council visited Myanmar 's commander in chief in late April to demand explanations for the expulsion of more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, he used the phrase 'fake news' — the only words he spoke in English — no less than a dozen times.
KING: Mr. Steyer, thank you. Your time is up.
Some might find it to be an appealing idea, but we don't have any research that supports it, she said. What we do know is that women who purchase a handgun are more likely, in the days, weeks, months and years afterwards, to be the victim of homicide and suicide.
SANDERS: ... grassroots movement of black and white and Latino, Native American and Asian, people who are standing up and fighting for justice.
BUTTIGIEG: Yes, because there's no comparing those two commentaries (ph).
It makes superficial sense. But it's also symptomatic of a lazy habit that infantilizes high-profile women in America and abroad, and skims over the personal details and unique circumstances that shaped them.
The world is consumed with problems, James Corden lamented on The Late Late Show Monday night.
SANDERS: I have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and I was really amazed at what Mayor Bloomberg just said a moment ago. He said that the Chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? Who elects the politburo? You have got a real dictatorship there. Of course you have a dictatorship in Cuba.
Wasn't expecting it at the moment it happened at all, she admitted. Didn't have any idea.
In response to this story, Willing to Wait sent a statement to NPR, which says that the program includes topics such as reproductive anatomy, STDs, healthy relationships, dating violence, consent laws, setting boundaries, refusal skills, goal setting, contraception methods including efficacy and limitations, and communicates the intrinsic value of every student without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity.
CORKER: Well I mean that is a whole different issue. And you know there was resolution language that I actually spent a lot of time on myself that you know you create the opportunity to wind -- you have the ability to wind down an institution that fails. But again, that's a whole separate issue --
In Religious Freedom Debate, 2 American Values Clash
In the Freemasons, Geiser said, each state's grand lodge has its own constitutions and bylaws, separate from others nationally and internationally. In the United States, most Masonic lodges are male only but have sister organizations such as the Order of the Eastern Star.

BIDEN: What did you tell them?
SANDERS: Thirty years ago, I supported a ban on assault weapons. Mike Bloomberg has started a very good organization, Moms Demand Actions. Congratulations.
And I would expect that the older ones and the younger ones will get knocked off. And the person will have a track record that attracted Trump and, therefore, will unattract a lot of Democrats and their constituencies.
What we need to do is to do what every other major country on Earth does: guarantee health care to all people, not have thousands of separate insurance plans, which are costing us some $500 billion a year to administer.
The move is the leading edge of pushback from within the IRS, and it signals the potential for civil servants to take actions that could slow or cripple government functions as the political stalemate continues in Washington. U.S. Department of Agriculture meat inspectors have begun to call in sick, Transportation Security Administration sickouts at airports have been rising, and federal law enforcement agencies say the shutdown is increasing stress among agents and affecting investigations. … Not receiving pay for more than a month has taken a toll on employees across the government, but especially on those who are not in high-salary jobs. The employees summoned back from furlough to process tax refunds are paid between $25,800 and $51,000 a year, depending on their seniority.
It's the first time The Family Leader has invited candidates actively seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to the event, a spokesman said. Vander Plaats acknowledged that the group – known for fighting same-sex marriage – is an unlikely venue for Democrats, but added, If you're going to cast a vision of unity, I think you need to be able to have the courage then to go to that venue ... and cast that vision.
In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, he said he is talking to a lot of folks to get some input on the bill and that he had boiled his thinking down to this central question: whether therapists could truly leave their values out of their work.

High-schoolers Siona Wilson and Everett Mabry met here, and they affectionately call each other besties. Wilson (whose pronouns are they/them) is a high school freshman with a shock of pink hair, who says sexuality-wise, they're questioning, and gender-wise, they're nonbinary. Mabry's a sophomore with a big smile, who is gay and cisgender. They both say that the sex ed they have gotten at the center has made them realize they used to be clueless about some of the most basic things.
BURNETT: So do you think, John that we'll be able to get reforms or what's your sense?
But because it didn't settle the looming question on whether the First Amendment guarantees of religious freedom are more important than a state or city's anti-discrimination laws, similar cases are again simmering in lower courts — including Arizona and Colorado.
SIEGEL: And what do you know about what Donald Trump really wants in the way of a Supreme Court justice?
BURNETT: All right. So those are pretty good things -- probably not good enough.
OLYMPIA, Wash. – The Washington Democratic Party says it will donate contributions from controversial spiritual leader JZ Knight to the Anti-Defamation League and the campaign to uphold gay marriage.

BLOOMBERG: I know -- wait a second. I know that if I were black, my success would have been a lot harder to achieve.

We need to assure our policymaking community, and the American people, that we can be trusted with this responsibility to use our information appropriately to protect the nation, Coats said in an afternoon speech to more than 150 members of his staff in McLean, Va. Through transparency, we will strengthen America's faith that the intelligence community seeks the truth – and speaks the truth.
But Cuomo already knows this. Fredo's watched Antifa assault police offers, assault journalists, terrorize Tucker Carlson's wife, assault everyday people simply enjoying their right to assemble, and like the Southern Democrats of old, he's watched Antifa bully a black woman out of a restaurant.
He wants half of that amount tofund tax breaks forVirginian households making less than $54,000 a year, the state's median income. He would use the other half to shore up the state's reserve funds and make historic investments in schools, the environment, rural broadband and other priorities.

For her part in the alleged crimes, Sandra Ames was sentenced to one year in prison. Meanwhile, Kathy Patrick was back at home in Washington state. The South Korean government made diplomatic requests to return her to Seoul from the U.S. to face a murder charge, but hit a wall.
SIEGEL: Meaning states could criminalize or legalize abortion. Another legal issue he was asked about - does he support same-sex marriage?
Trump also did not issue preemptive pardons for himself, members of his family, or even some of his staff for future crimes if they face persecution as a result of their connection to the Trump administration. He also did not issue a preemptive pardon for his personal lawyer and ally former Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
This is not a troll. This is not an attempt to be inflammatory. There's only one reason the left-wing terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter always-always-always focused their marauding in left-wing cities: they know the populace is defenseless.
BIDEN LAUNCHES ADS TOUTING HIS FAITH AFTER CARDINAL SAYS HE'S 'NOT A CATHOLIC IN GOOD STANDING'
In the fall, the Grand Lodge of Tennessee suspended two Memphis Freemasons, Dennis Clark and Mark Henderson, who had married in June after the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage, according to Hodapp's blog.

The term hate speech is notably broad and open to wide interpretation. It has been appropriated to cover anything from mild criticism of Islam, gay marriage and mass migration, to neo-Nazi and Islamist propaganda.
SAGAL: If you are a man - and I know some of you are - and you're finding it hard to understand why this is so offensive to women, just imagine going into the shaving cream aisle where they have those tubes of shaving cream. And imagine that in order to represent different kinds of men, all the cans are different lengths.
2003: Evanescence Frank Micelotta/Getty Images Nominees: 50 Cent, Fountains of Wayne, Heather Headley and Sean Paul Originally formed in 1995, the Little Rock, Ark., rock/metal band - comprised of David Hodges (left, keyboard), Amy Lee (right, vocals) and Ben R. Moody II (lead guitarist) - won two Grammys for their debut major label album, Fallen: Best New Artist, and Best Hard Rock Performance (for Bring Me to Life). Less than two months before the Grammy ceremony, however, Hodges left the band to record with Trading Yesterday (a.k.a. The Age of Information). He later released several solo albums. Moody left Evanescence in 2003 during the group's Fallen tour. After several solo records, he helped form the Gothic metal band, We Are the Fallen.

 Can Mitch McConnell stand against Donald Trump and still control the Kentucky GOP?  by the Lexington Herald Leader's Daniel Desrochers:  Tensions are high. The Nelson County Republican Party voted to censure McConnell over his statements on the Senate floor Tuesday, passing a resolution that called on McConnell to retract his comments.

KING: Mayor Buttigieg, mayor to mayor, mayor to mayor, you've certainly had your issues with the black community as well. Do you think the New York City's implementation of stop and frisk was racist?

Then, Bercaw took a phone call in the teachers' lounge that moved the investigation in a whole new direction.

Tulsi Gabbard Rep. Tulsi Gabbard launches 2020 campaign 05:28 Biography Tulsi Gabbard was born in American Samoa in 1981, and her family moved to Hawaii when she was 2 years old. Her mother, Carol, is a practicing Hindu, a religion Gabbard adopted. Her father, Mike, is a member of the Hawaii state Senate. After growing up in a politically active family, Gabbard became a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives when she was 21 years old in 2002, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature at the time. While serving in the state legislature in 2003, she enlisted in the Hawaii Army National Guard. She deployed in Iraq and returned in 2006.

He served 50 days in Los Angeles County jail and had to register as a sex offender before returning to his home state of New York. He died in 1987.
BIDEN: Well, first of all, the latest poll I saw, my numbers -- I'm still 15 points ahead, the latest poll.
When Democrats are releasing violent criminals, encouraging illegal immigration, and passing laws to disarm you while turning the police into eunuchs, it's over… Minneapolis is preparing to disband the police. Los Angeles just slashed police funding. New York is gearing up to slash police funding. I'm telling you, it's over…
I'm not surprised by the continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward . . . She's shown how attacking Republicans like me can impact elections — her involvement in both Senate elections to replace Jeff Flake and my husband John McCain, two regular targets of her personal attacks, resulted in Democrat wins, McCain said in a statement released to the Arizona Republic late Tuesday.
BLOOMBERG: I think she recognized me, thank you. I have a 6 million-person organization around this country. Moms Demand Action and Everytown.
He often called for improvements to the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. During and after his senate campaign, O'Rourke made immigration a central issue. He has routinely denounced the White House for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the U.S.-Mexico border. He also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as DREAMers, on a pathway to U.S. citizenship. During a fiery speech in El Paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with President Trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, O'Rourke condemned Mr. Turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. We know that walls do not save lives. Walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of Mr. Trump's nearby rallies. In the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. Controversy In addition to the scrutiny O'Rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a Senate race, the Texas Democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in Congress and personal life. Although he had a generally liberal voting record in Congress, O'Rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left.
The secretary of state virtually joined the World Economic Forum, per a CBS News reporter:
Luis Gonzalez – President Trump commuted the sentence of Luis Gonzalez. Mr. Gonzalez is a 78 year-old non-violent drug offender who has served more than 27 years of a life sentence. Under the First Step Act, Mr. Fragoso would not have been subject to a mandatory life sentence. Mr. Gonzalez has an upstanding prison record and has worked for UNICOR for over 20 years producing military uniforms.
BUTTIGIEG: Let's talk about this. Let's talk about what's radical about that plan.
JAY-Z: (Rapping) Y'all know how I met her. We broke up and got back together. To get her back, I had to sweat her. Y'all could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather. Move the whole family West, but it's whatever.
Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader and University of Virginia alum who coined the term 'alt-right,' would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. 'If you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs,' Spencer told The Atlantic last year, not long after the election. 'By 2015, gay marriage is popular. What is possible has shifted. That's what the alt-right is doing. It's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.' 
SAGAL: Bill, what is Andy's topic?
I haven't felt good about anything since 2013, Corden said. Barack Obama was the president. Same-sex marriage was legalized. Justin Bieber bought a monkey. I mean the list is endless.
Let me conclude by asking you sort of a devil's advocate question.
Later in February, Arquette also called on followers to boycott Bermuda.
It's not simply that they are the first openly gay athletes to represent the United States at the Winter Olympics. It's that they became two of the biggest American stars at these Games simply by being their authentic selves.
One more thing. My secretary of education will believe that it is time to get rid of high-stakes testing. We need to support our children. But, look, we want to build a future in this country? We build a future by investing in our children. I've got a plan to put $800 billion new federal dollars into our public schools.
KING: All right, Senator Sanders, thank you...
Well, tomorrow, I'm spending the day here in Washington at the 2012 fiscal summit. It's an issue that will define the power and greatness of our country. This year, the Bush cuts expire, the $1.2 trillion in super cut takes effect. The debt ceiling needs to be raised. These are just a few of the things that could send like lemmings off a clief.
Alex Adjmi – President Trump granted a full pardon to Alex Adjmi. This pardon is supported by Haim Chera on behalf of his late father Stanley, Robert Cayre, the Sitt family and numerous other community leaders.

Following his release, he has dedicated himself to his community and has supported numerous charitable causes, including support for children with special needs and substance recovery centers.

How Team Liquid is helping its fans get through the pandemic
Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate. Issues Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the Don't ask, don't tell policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013, legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed, it raised her profile as an advocate for women. Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control, saying in a 60 Minutes profile in 2018 that she was embarrassed and ashamed of her stances while serving in the House. Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, a popular cause on the left. Controversy Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk, including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate. The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct.
As you moved into the '80s, the brownie business changed in a way, right? It wasn't just recreational because it became a way to ease the suffering of people afflicted with AIDS. And this was at a time when the epidemic was, you know, poorly understood scientifically. There was little treatment. And it was, you know, deeply associated with homophobia. As your mom made these trips to the city, how did the epidemic present itself to her?
It's very rare to find a purely conservative or a purely liberal congregation, Tooley says. So if there is some sort of a division, or if there's the creation of a new liberal Methodist church, that almost inevitably will generate painful divisions in local congregations. Often the clergy are more liberal than the laity. So in many situations, you may have pastors who would like to join the new, more liberal denomination, but a majority of the lay people in their church may prefer to stay in the old denomination.
KING: Your time's up, sir. Bill Whitaker?
Sister Wives viewers will just have to wait until the show's Jan. 8 episode to see how the family comes to terms ― or doesn't ― with Mariah's sexuality. Of course, their devout faith could be an issue. As Fundamentalist Mormons, the family still practices polygamy, which has been explicitly rejected by the mainstream Mormon church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
SANDERS: No, it's not the problem. All right, let's talk about Medicare for all. I'm sure you're familiar with the new study that just came out of Yale University, published in Lancet magazine, one of the prestigious medical journals in the world. You know what it said? Medicare for all will lower health care costs in this country by $450 billion a year and save 68,000 lives of people who otherwise would have died.
BLOOMBERG: I never said it, period, end of story. Categorically never said it. When it was accused -- when I was accused of doing it, we couldn't figure out what she was talking about. But right now, I'm sorry if she heard what she thought she heard, or whatever happened. I didn't take any pleasure in that. And we've just got to go on. But I never said it. Come on.
A majority of U.S. delegates at the United Methodist General Conference opposed the conservative resolutions on sexuality and marriage, but the U.S. share of global Methodism is declining while the church is growing in the Global South, especially Africa.
Just months into their engagement, Stefani and Shelton have both opened up about their past and future, including details of the country star getting down on one knee to what they have in store for a future ceremony.
DAVIES: Right. And then, through all this, there was your mom with Sticky Fingers Brownies, the marijuana-laced brownies, which, at its height, was, you know, moving something like 2,800 brownies a week - your mom and an interesting crew of others that distributed these. What's interesting is that this wasn't the kind of operation where you'd knock on the door and get a password. Explain how this enterprise connected with its customers.
The Jonestown Massacre and the assassinations of Milk and Moscone happened within 10 days of each other. It was like a one-two punch. It just knocked San Francisco completely sideways. I mean, 918 people dead in one day. And then these two very important and beloved civic leaders ten days later. For my mom, it was a seismic shift, a feeling of everything is changing.

I want to be clear that I do not tolerate discrimination of any type and am respectful of all individuals. I personally have gay family members who I love and support just as I do any family member, Priefer said in his statement. The primary reason I entered coaching was to affect people in a positive way. As a coach, I have always created an accepting environment for my players, including Chris, and have looked to support them both on and off the field.
 '[L]ittle Mayor Signer — SEE-NER — how do you pronounce this little creep's name?' asked Richard Spencer, a right-wing leader who dreams of a 'white ethnostate,' as he stood on a bench under a tree to rally his troops, deprived of their protest. The crowd knew exactly how to pronounce his name: 'Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew' some shouted out. The rest burst out in laughter. And that was one of the only moments of levity the alt-right audience gathered under the tree enjoyed.
But the illnesses varied a lot. And there was a long time when nobody knew what it was. Some people got the Pneumocystis carinii. Some people had the wasting syndrome and terrible diarrhea. Some people had the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. The variety of presentations of the symptom made the onset very mysterious. And it didn't get a lot of press at first because it emerged first within the gay male population. And this was a community that broader society was maybe eager not to look at and not to acknowledge.
Issuing his own statement, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops warned that Biden has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.
KLOBUCHAR: Well, it is realistic to want to legalize marijuana, I want to do that, too. And I also think you need to look back and -- at people's records and you maybe can't do it on day one, as he said. I think you want to have a process that you go through, because there's too many people that have things on their records that have stopped them from getting jobs.
STEYER: Excuse me, Amy. This conversation shows a huge risk for the Democratic Party. We are looking at a party that has decided that we're either going to support someone who is a democratic socialist or somebody who has a long history of being a Republican.

These platforms seem more shocked by toplessness, which is promptly censored, than the incitement to hatred against persons or groups of persons. Our lawsuit against them is to enforce a right that they must now fully comply with.
He has also suggested that suffers from his own Christian failings in supporting Mr. Trump. How could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn star presidency? Is it that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump? he said at a CNN town hall in March.
Carlson-Thies is one of several conservatives who support a Fairness For All initiative to forge a compromise between advocates for LGBT rights and religious freedom, but the effort has had little success so far. The LGBT community and their allies have been cool to the notion of compromising their cause, while a group of more strident religious freedom advocates made clear their own opposition to the recognition of sexual orientation as a status worthy of civil rights protection.

In addition to, that I passed the Brady Bill with waiting periods. I led that fight. But my friend to my right and others have in fact also gave into the gone manufacturers, absolute immunity. Imagine if I stood here and said we'd give immunity to drug companies. We would give immunity to tobacco companies. That has caused carnage on our streets, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability. More than all the wars, including Vietnam, from that point on.

The Boy Scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. Last week, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to Scouts BSA to account for the inclusion of girls.
KLOBUCHAR: I would have better relations with our allies and I would support, because I know the vaccine is out there in the head of some kid right now in school, in Columbia, South Carolina, or Houston, Texas, and it's investing in education, so we are ready to lead, again, in the world.
8. Many adversaries continue to pursue capabilities to inflict catastrophic damage to U.S. interests through the acquisition and use of [weapons of mass destruction]. Their possession of these capabilities can have major impacts on U.S. national security, overseas interests, allies, and the global order. The intelligence challenges to countering the proliferation of WMD and advanced conventional weapons are increasing as actors become more sophisticated, WMD-related information becomes broadly available, proliferation mechanisms increase, and as political instability erodes the security of WMD stockpiles.

Graham, who heads the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and the Christian relief group Samaritan's Purse, faced a storm of criticism for the comment. Several expressed outrage over the judgment he pronounced on Buttigieg, in light of his support of Mr. Trump. MSNBC's Joe Scarborough exclaimed, Oh shut up.

If she does accomplish the feat of tying the record here, Court is not expected to be in the crowd to applaud the achievement.
Obama reportedly told Axelrod, after he stated his opposition to gay marriage at an event, I'm just not very good at bullshitting. Based on his utterly unconvincing statement regarding the 2nd Amendment this morning, the president still isn't very good at it.

A gay guidance counselor suspended from a Catholic high school is pushing to change the policy of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis that bans employees who are in same-sex marriages – even though she signed a contract stating she understood the expectations of employees of the Catholic archdiocese.
In early January, leaders in the United Methodist Church tentatively agreed to spin off a traditionalist Methodist denomination that would continue to oppose same-sex marriage and decline ordination to LGBT clergy — allowing the remaining portion of the United Methodist Church to permit same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy for the first time in its history. The plan will be voted on at the church's denomination-wide conference in May.

For most of these teens, the Pride Center is the only place they can ask these questions.
I finally realized that I could not write an honest book without spending as much time on his thoughts and feelings and motives as I had with my mom. And what surprised me so much is how ready he was to go there. We dug through boxes together. We talked about some of his actions from back in the day that were really hurtful to other people. And he was, I think, very brave about it, acknowledging his role in it and also having a certain curiosity himself about both how he had acted and what drove him to act that way.
Rustin was stripped of his leadership post at the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a pacifist organization involved in the civil rights movement, after U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina read Rustin's arrest file into the Congressional Record.

But most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. And they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.
And where possible commit to building awareness, advocating and taking meaningful action to ensure equality and inclusivity are paramount in the successful delivery of the Commonwealth Games.
The Trump administration left Black Americans behind. They want Biden to narrow the gaps.
At that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. And that damages people's faith in the judiciary — because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.
Vice President Biden, I want to start with you, why should anyone have faith that you're the one who can get this done now?
I believe that God made male and female and we don't get to choose that and we don't get to change that, he said. And it's wrong for the state to force me to create artistic products.

FEINSTEIN: -- have full transparency and 24/7/365 day-a-year access for the IAEA to all these sites. And then be willing to also talk about other things, which is what the Iranians have wanted to do. I am hopeful. In my view it's the best chance of a solution. Of course this is the P-5 (ph) plus one, so it's a unique bargaining agent, you might say.
The state party is apparently one-upping the Maricopa County GOP, which on Saturday censured Jeff Flake (Arizona's last elected Republican senator, who retired after denouncing Trump) but was prevented by parliamentary reasons from adding Cindy McCain to the resolution.

Scott Conor Crosby – President Trump granted a full pardon to Scott Conor Crosby. Mr. Crosby is supported by Senator Martha McSally, the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Mesa, Arizona, and the Bishop of his church, all of whom attest to Mr. Crosby's service to his community and upstanding character. In 1992, Mr. Crosby made a 'spur of the moment' poor decision to participate in a co-worker's plan to commit a bank robbery. Mr. Crosby was arrested the same day and cooperated with the authorities. Since his release from prison, he has spent significant time volunteering at his church, mentoring youth, and has earned a certification as an Emergency Medical Technician. Mr. Crosby's civil rights were restored by the State of Arizona in 2003, and this action restores his Federal civil rights.

CNN's association with, encouragement of, and affection for political violence has been well documented over the years, and as we get closer to the 2020 presidential election, it is only going to get worse… Much worse.
And to me that means sentencing reform, like the First Step Act, and extending that to the states with the Second Step Act. It means equal opportunity. Because if we don't pass Representative Clyburn's bill out of South Carolina here to invest in impoverished communities, we're never going to get to that single garment of destiny.

BLOOMBERG: We let it get out of control and when I realized that, I cut it back by 95 percent. And I've apologized and asked for forgiveness. I've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how I can better position myself and what I should have done and what I should do next time.
KLOBUCHAR: No, the math does not add up. In fact, just on 60 Minutes this weekend, he said he wasn't going to rattle through the nickels and the dimes. Well, let me tell you how many nickels and dimes we're talking about: nearly $60 trillion. Do you know how much that is, for all of his programs?

TED SHAW: That certainly is in question. And I guess that transgender people would say that they don't really choose their gender, that their gender is a matter of both biology but some other matters that go beyond genitalia. But that's - yeah, that's at the core of this confrontation.
SAGAL: This is terrible. Andy, it is nice to have you with us. You're going to play the game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction.
Cable news is poison. Hollywood's idea of entertainment today is either pushing sex on your children or straight-up propaganda. Why are you paying to pump this garbage into your home?

KURTIS: She interviewed comedian Neal Brennan, whose new special, 3 Mics, had just come out on Netflix.
VOLZ: No. My parents, I think, like a lot of hippies, a lot of people from their generation, saw marijuana as wholesome and harmless. And I was taught that the legislation around it and the government's view of it was wrong and that what they were doing was right. So I grew up with that idea that we were outlaws, but good outlaws - kind of like Robin Hood outlaws. And I didn't question that for a long time.
In 2012, Dan Cathy, CEO of Chick-fil-A, stated: We are very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit. We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that.

Four presidential contenders — Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet — will be off the trail for most days over at least the next two weeks because they're sitting senators who are required to be present for President Trump's Senate impeachment trial. Though the trial has not yet begun, their obligations in Washington have already meant that Buttigieg has had Iowa to himself for a couple of days after the presidential debate last week.
The health crisis is still surging around the globe, meaning the date of the duo's future ceremony is unknown. Earlier this month, Stefani admitted to Fallon that they have no plans because of the pandemic.

To those among you who repeatedly used the label 'the bathroom bill,' who incorporated this into every headline and story lead and failed to tell the whole and complete truth of this legislation, I say you are not journalists.

Justice Scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. But if you think about when the Supreme Court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. And Judge Garland, if you look at his work on the D.C. Circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. And I think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by Republicans.
He compared the idea of special status to the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, where total union is impossible, but some degree of cooperation is deemed useful.

Target is doing the right thing to what it has been as a brand, Arnoff said. I'm sure they are looking at the data and sales. As a smart company they will pay more attention to that kind of data than the number of names on a petition.
-- Barnes, our SCOTUS beat reporter, notes the decision to grand cert on the gun case may provide the most insight yet about where the conservative majority will take the court: The speculation had been that neither conservatives nor liberals knew whether they could count on the vote of the court's median justice, Anthony M. Kennedy. The court turned aside numerous challenges to restrictions on the kinds of guns that could be purchased, and whether they could be carried outside the home. After one such decision in 2018, a frustrated Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that 'as evidenced by our continued inaction in this area, the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court.' But, [law professor Adam] Winkler said, 'there is no hesitancy in Justice Kavanaugh,' who replaced Kennedy and has an expansive view of gun rights.
In 2016, she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez, also a Democrat, in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill, Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration, known for her fierce questioning as a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. Harris announced her presidential candidacy on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 21, 2019. Key issues In her short tenure in the Senate, Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough, prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions, Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda. Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California, Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. In October, Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6,000 a year in refundable tax credits, which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail.

Daniel Hoffman-Zinnel, executive director of One Iowa, an LGBTQ rights group, expressed mixed feelings about the invitation to Democratic candidates.
There were efforts early on about some kind of compromise, he tells NPR in a recent interview. I think those are less and less plausible as time goes on and as sides get factionalized. It's hard to see in some of these cases how there would be an outcome that is amenable to everyone, and so I think we're seeing these cases with us for a long time.
Last May, President Trump issued an executive order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty, in which he stated that the executive branch would vigorously enforce Federal law's robust protections for religious freedom.
Adam Rippon isn't a hulking football player like Michael Sam. He's not a 7-foot basketball center like Jason Collins. He's dissimilar from Robbie Rogers, a soccer player whose recent retirement from MLS left zero openly gay men in major professional sports in the U.S.
BURNETT: And that leads me to Israel where you said the U.S. and Israel aren't necessarily on the same page in terms of what level of enrichment to allow. Prime Minister Netanyahu telling me nothing. You're saying the U.S. would allow up to five percent. How is the U.S. and Israel going to bridge that gap? Because if they say zero we say five and they strike, we're going to be involved.
Jay, let me just ask you, it seems like the violence is getting much, much worse. What I just described with the heads and the feet cut off, this is brutality at a level that I think is very hard to imagine, but it appears to be at this point, dare I say common?
BIDEN: There was a -- I thought...
WARREN: Look, a president's job, first job, is to keep America safe, and an important part of that is to have a strong military. All three of my brothers served in the military, and I understand how much the military sacrifices, how much their families sacrifice, and how much they are willing to put on the line.

The fact that he happens to have come out as gay and did so as an active athlete is about the only thing that links Rippon to some of the more masc sports figures who courageously came out over the years — and that's part of his appeal.
Anything can be on the agenda, from hairstyles to costumes to whatever happens to be passing through their minds at the time, and unless the viewership's tastes have dramatically changed they'll be lapping it up once more.

They recently invited us into their home on a cold night, to talk about what's been going on in town. The VanderHelms say for them, this conversation is shaped by their faith.

I definitely had that fantasy about being a figure skater when I was a young gay kid, said Darrow, who now works for the Cleveland Indians. I think most young gay boys did something of the sort.

1964: The Beatles Capitol Records The world knows what became of John, Paul, George and Ringo - probably the easiest choice for Best New Artist the Grammy membership ever had to make. So what happened to their fellow nominees? Petula Clark, whose hits included Downtown and Don't Sleep in the Subway, also starred in the musical films Goodbye, Mr. Chips and Finian's Rainbow, and on Broadway in Blood Brothers, with David and Shaun Cassidy. Brazilian Astrud Gilberto, best known for The Girl from Ipanema, has recorded 16 albums, and performed with such artists as João Gilberto, Stan Getz and George Michael. Bossa nova musician and composer Antonio Carlos Jobim won the 1995 Grammy for Best Latin Jazz Performance for Antonio Brasileiro. Jobim died in 1994.

We know that it might not be popular with everyone, but thank the Lord, we live in a country where we can share our values and operate on biblical principles, he said.
Sorry, decent people do not split hairs to excuse, champion, and encourage evil. Decent people remember that every one of history's monsters, from Hitler to Lenin to Castro to Pol Pot, believed they were fighting a good cause — some even believed they were fighting against bigotry and for social justice. So let's use this opportunity to examine Cuomo's definition of social justice.

We are very clear that we will stand by our LGBTQ students, staff, faculty, alums, and friends, says Jay Rundell, president of the Methodist Theological School in Ohio, one of 13 official United Methodist Church seminaries. We will resist what we see as a narrow misuse of scripture and tradition.
This kind of struggle is playing out in communities across the country. In a recent national survey by the nonprofit GLSEN, less than 1 in 10 LGBTQ+ students said they received sex ed that was inclusive of their identities. In some places, laws expressly prohibit teachers from discussing LGBTQ+ people or topics in a positive way — in other words, promoting homosexuality. Activists commonly refer to these as no promo homo laws.
BUTTIGIEG: And, meanwhile, folks at home, from South Carolina to South Bend, are trying to figure out what any of this means for us, because it's right that there is a progressive majority, an American majority that wants to see real change, wants to see wages go up, and go up faster than the cost of health and saving for retirement.

Joshua J. Smith – President Trump granted a full pardon to Joshua J. Smith. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, Representative Tim Burchett, Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Corrections Tony Parker, Director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation David Rausch, and numerous other community and faith leaders support the pardon of Mr. Smith. Since his release from prison in 2003 for conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute, Mr. Smith has dedicated his life to his faith and to his community. He is now a successful businessman and has used his financial success to establish Fourth Purpose, a non-profit organization devoted to making prison a place of transformation. He has mentored incarcerated individuals and taught business classes to those in prison—including at the prison where he was incarcerated. Mr. Smith has also been heavily involved in mission trips throughout Latin America.

But he explained that he was carrying a spirit child. This is a spirit that he felt was traveling with him and waiting to be born into the world. Ostensibly, this is me (laughter).
The Trump White House in a nutshell: Trump was impressed by [deputy press secretary Hogan] Gidley's television appearances during the previous government shutdown. Once, after watching Gidley on his screen in the residence, the President walked over to the communications office to tell the staff he thought they were handling the shutdown well. In the days afterward, Trump confused several officials when he directed them to, 'Get me Tidley.' 'Who?' puzzled staffers asked. 'Tidley,' Trump replied. 'I want to talk to Hogan Tidley.' They informed him that the deputy press secretary's last name was Gidley, not Tidley.
We got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world, Trump said in the speech, singling her out as he urged the mob to march to the Capitol.

-- Trump tweeted that he has directed Sanders not to bother with press briefings. From John Wagner: Sanders has not provided an on-camera briefing for more than a month, including the duration of the partial government shutdown.

FEINSTEIN: So I mean I think that's what's out there. There's one other thing. The sanctions are biting. They're biting deeply. Additional sanctions will go into play with the Central Bank. And so by June or July, the sanctions should be approximately full tilt.
Eric Swalwell Biography Although he was born in Iowa in 1980, Swalwell moved with his family to attend middle school and high school in California. He was recruited to play soccer for North Carolina's Campbell University. After suffering an injury, however, he transferred to the University of Maryland. After completing his undergraduate studies, Swalwell earned his J.D. from the University of Maryland and was a congressional intern for former California Rep. Ellen Tauscher. In 2012, while a council member in Dublin City, in California's Alameda County, Swalwell mounted a primary challenge against fellow Democrat and 20-term incumbent Pete Stark in the state's 15th Congressional District, located in the outer suburbs of San Francisco. Although Stark bested him in the primary election, Swalwell beat the incumbent in the general election, which he qualified for because of California's top two primary system. Swalwell says he's running for president 01:40 Since he was sworn-in in 2013, Swalwell has won reelection three times. Although he has been a rank-and-file member of the House Democratic caucus during his congressional tenure, he has raised his profile during the Trump administration as a member of the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, frequently rebuking the president in cable news appearances.

SANDERS: All right. But the point is -- the point is the way we are going to beat Trump, which is what everybody up here wants, is we need a campaign of energy and excitement.

We need to get young people voting in a way they have never done before. That is what our campaign is about.

And I was going to comment on Cuba policy because I actually lead the bill to lift the embargo. I went with Barack Obama when he went to Cuba. And I've seen firsthand how the Cuban are way in front of our -- their leaders.
BRENNAN: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
In the middle of the night, my mom wakes up and the bed is shaking like crazy. Here we are in San Francisco. She thinks it's an earthquake. She sits up, realizes that nothing else in the room is moving, that it's Doug shaking wildly in bed, and she thought he might be having a drug overdose. But then he stopped and was sleeping calmly. And it wasn't until weeks later that he told her he had grand mal epilepsy, and he'd had an epileptic seizure in the middle of the night.
STEYER: Something happened. We should have a formal commission on race to retell the story of the last 400-plus years in America of African-Americans, of systematic legal injustice, discrimination, and cruelty, but also of 400-plus years of contribution in terms of building the United States of America and leading the United States of America from a moral standpoint.

Dickerson visits South Bend with Buttigieg to see his home, and the city he runs. Dickerson also talks with Buttigieg's husband, Chasten Buttigieg, a junior-high schoolteacher.
Because the psychologists tell us 0 to 4 are the most important years of human development. We are going to triple funding for low-income Title I schools, because kids' education should not depend upon the ZIP Code in which they live. We're going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free through a tax on Wall Street speculation. And we're going to move to make certain that no teacher in America earns less than $60,000 a year.
And now some politicians, because they aren't willing to face the need for commonsense gun law, are expecting teachers to somehow transform themselves into highly trained armed guards when there's a threat to a classroom.

Legal analysts are divided in their assessment of the debate. A federal judge, ruling on a Mississippi religious freedom law, concluded that by protecting specific beliefs, the bill constitutes an official preference for certain religious tenets, and may therefore be unconstitutional. Other laws and proposals, however, are written in support of beliefs held by several different religions and thus may not run afoul of the First Amendment's bar on an establishment of religion.
And the way you do that is with drug courts. The way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the White House so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the Justice Department, and while getting their advice.
Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, lambasted Trump in a Washington Post piece, writing that the current president was incapable of speaking for the nation in the face of tragedy:
Your base, some of them quietly said, you know, everybody on that list, except Merrick Garland, was a minority or a woman; some of them were both. You picked the oldest person by far, the only white guy, and he's sort of a centrist liberal. He's not, you know, he's not going to — this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the Supreme Court.
KLEIN: Your dad's not really deaf. He's - it's even worse. Your dad's dead.

If great words can heal and inspire, base words can corrupt. Trump has been delivering the poison of prejudice in small but increasing doses. In Charlottesville, the effect became fully evident. And the president had no intention of decisively repudiating his work. What do we do with a president who is incapable or unwilling to perform his basic duties? What do we do when he is incapable of outrage at outrageous things? What do we do with a president who provides barely veiled cover for the darkest instincts of the human heart? These questions lead to the dead end of political realism — a hopeless recognition of limited options. But the questions intensify.
FEINSTEIN: Well, number one, I've never seen that picture. It could be from anywhere so I don't know where it's from, so a comment would be useless. I can say this. The decision as far as our intelligence is concerned is that Iran has not made the decision to enrich to military grade uranium. Now, having said that, there's no comment on whether they have speeded things up so they could get to that position --

She explained that she's always going to be vocal online about things like LGBTQ and animal rights, but knows she's another voice amongst other opinions.
The Fact Checker analyzed Trump's claims that asylum restrictions will aid Central American migrants:
It's very unusual for the Justice Department to refuse to defend a law or an executive order, though it isn't unprecedented. During the Obama administration, for example, top officials decided not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. The Supreme Court eventually ruled in favor of same-sex marriage.
SAGAL: Did you just say father of four cats?
STEYER: Donald Trump thinks -- he's incompetent as a steward of the American economy. We have to show that we can create a growing, prosperous economy that works for American working people.

The outcome may be overextended budgets or lack of cost-effective solutions to address intelligence issues. The [intelligence community] needs to develop methods to efficiently shift resources to mitigate programmatic (fiscal) risk and avoid loss of vital programs, capabilities, and resource investments.
Later that year, Judge David Stras, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' First Amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. The judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.

And when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the Senate saying, I won't meet with a nominee; I won't provide a nominee a hearing; I will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. That matters to people.
It took almost 30 years in Germany, we fought for it and today is the day. For me personally, because I'm from the former GDR, this is as important as the Berlin Wall falling, he said.
Bernie and I both wanted to help rein in Wall Street. In 2008, we both got our chance. But I dug in. I fought the big banks. I built the coalitions, and I won.
There will be no oppression and we will recognize your importance in society, he added.
CORKER: I mean and let's think about it. I mean human beings do bone-headed things. In a business like this, things like this are going to occur. We need to make sure we try to regulate properly. But the best antidote to this is to have capital requirements that are sufficient. And as we mentioned earlier, this is a very large institution.
Biden's inaugural committee felt both for small-d democratic purposes but also aligned with Joe Biden's values and message, we are going to restore confidence in government again, or at least build some of it back, the source continued. That posed a challenge given the absence of the outgoing president, who plays a pretty starring role in Inauguration Day — the greeting at the White House — the whole nine yards.
The pair are close enough now that they sit for interviews with their bodies touching, and finish each other's sentences. Weir, who is openly gay, was bridesman at Lipinski's wedding to television producer Todd Kapostasy last summer.
Actually, this is something I haven't even mentioned to anyone — if we can keep this between us three and you all, he said gesturing to the audience. I'm actually expecting a baby in July with my husband. The crowd erupted with cheers and Ferguson joked, Let's just keep it between us.
WARREN: Then let us -- let us have -- the women have an opportunity to speak. The Bloomberg corporations and Mayor Bloomberg himself have been accused of discrimination. They are bound by nondisclosures so that they cannot speak. If he says there is nothing to hide here, then sign a blanket release and let those women speak out...

Steven Samuel Grantham – President Trump granted a full pardon to Steven Samuel Grantham. This pardon is supported by Mr. Grantham's friends and family who praise his moral character, Acting Attorney Jeffrey Rosen, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Grantham was convicted in 1967 for stealing a vehicle. He received 18-months imprisonment, and 2 years' probation. Since his conviction and release from prison, he has demonstrated remorse and accepted responsibility for his crime, which he committed approximately 50 years ago when he was just 19 years old. Mr. Grantham has lived a law-abiding and stable life. Most notably, he stepped in and assumed custody of his grandchild when the child's parents were unable to care for him. He now seeks a pardon for forgiveness and to restore his gun rights.

For decades, the United Methodist Church has officially judged homosexual activity to be immoral, barred gays and lesbians from serving as clergy, and opposed same sex marriage.
And Jia Tolentino, a writer for The New Yorker and a graduate of the University of Virginia, meditated on Charlottesville's progressive guise and ability to hide its dark racial past. While I was at U.V.A., the fact that slaves had built the school was hardly discussed, and the most prominent acknowledgment that Jefferson was a slave owner came on Valentine's Day, when signs went up all over campus that said 'TJ ♥s Sally.' 
Not all faith leaders are convinced, however, that the push for LGBT rights is jeopardizing the religious freedom of people who hold conservative beliefs about sexuality and marriage.

The video, which has already attracted over three million views on Facebook alone, shows the thoughts of a middle-aged man imagining a Russia without Putin, where a man can be seen in his kitchen and suggestively eating a banana and filing his nails.
Things are about to change. Don't worry: it won't last forever. These things never do. It's a phase, and if you fly over it at 30,000 feet, what you will see is that all this social justice-systemic racism-defund the police nonsense comes down to one thing… The Democrat Party is returning to its soft-on-crime roots, and in the end, this will not end well for Democrats.
This week, the Trump administration weighed in on an important civil rights case heading to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Justice Department sided with a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. To advocates in the LGBT community, it is just the latest disappointment from the Trump administration. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here to tell us more. Carrie, thanks so much for joining us.

1986: Bruce Hornsby & the Range RCA Records Nominees: Glass Tiger, Nu Shooz, Simply Red and Timbuk3 Prior to launching his solo career, singer-pianist Bruce Hornsby played clubs and bars, served as a session musician, and toured with Sheena Easton's band. In 1986 he released The Way It Is, the debut album from Bruce Hornsby & the Range (the Range included David Mansfield, George Marinelli, John Molo, Joe Puerta). The album's title track, with its references to the civil rights movement, hit the top of the charts and has since been sampled by various hip-hop artists. The success of the album, which also featured singles Mandolin Rain and Every Little Kiss, landed them the Best New Artist Grammy. Since then, Hornsby has put out albums with and without the Range; toured with the Grateful Dead; and formed the band, the Noisemakers. The Virginia native received another Grammy in 1990 for his reworking of The Valley Road with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and his track (Song H) was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental at the 2007 Grammy Awards.
DAVIES: Well, and what's fascinating is that, you know, your dad - I mean, you write about this in the book - because he would sometimes not take his medication, he's had some really difficult mental episodes, and his memory is not reliable. And when you went to ask him, is this true that you went to a gay bathhouse after your child was born, what was his reaction?
BLOOMBERG: Look, the first thing you do is we should not make this a criminal thing if you have a small amount. For dealers, yes, but for the average person, no, and you should expunge the records of those that got caught up in this before.
The parliamentary commission drawing up recommendations has still to finalize its proposals, but a draft seen by Reuters includes measures to criminalize extramarital sex, same-sex relations and co-habitation, all of which were previously unregulated.
O'DONNELL: Now, here are the rules for the next two hours.
Mary Roberts – President Trump commuted the sentence of Mary Roberts. Ms. Roberts has served 10 years of a 19-year sentence for a non-violent drug offense.

KING: All right, Senator Sanders, please.
Corden's band leader, Reggie Watts, responded: 2013 was pretty cool. It's just a shame that the Jonas Brothers split up.
VOLZ: Sure. We were talking about the I Ching earlier. And suddenly, in mid-1979, my mom goes to throw her usual weekly hexagrams. And the passage is really dark. The results are bad. And the imagery in the passages has to do with imprisonment and punishment and things like that. And she became fairly convinced - well, very convinced very quickly that they were going to be busted. And the business was huge at this time. And, I mean, everybody knew about them. It was a little - maybe a little too high-profile. And she became sure that they were going to get busted. So my parents, taking this extremely seriously, packed up, closed up shop. And we moved out of San Francisco within two weeks.
WARREN: I'll tell you exactly what I want you to do.
ROCCA: You already won the game.
As Fox59 reported, Fitzgerald has hired an attorney, David Page, who refused to give details about his client's signed contract due to the possibility of future litigation.

The packages appeared to have been shipped from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley, Texas, near the location of the fourth bombing.
VOLZ: How awkward is that, writing about your parents having sex? (Laughter). I tried to skip it, and my writing group - that's wonderful - kept saying, look; you can't cop out on this (laughter). But what's - so my father is a grand mal epileptic, and my mom didn't know he was an epileptic. They had slept together for the first time.
Code Switch alum Matt Thompson, now executive editor at The Atlantic, riffed on the brazenness of the white supremacists who marched this weekend, compared with Klan members of decades past who hid under white hoods. The shameless return of white supremacy into America's public spaces seems to be happening by degrees, and quickly, Thompson wrote.

BRENNAN: Well, you're out of time. Senator.
Kwame Kilpatrick – President Trump commuted the sentence of the former Mayor of Detroit, Kwame Malik Kilpatrick. This commutation is strongly supported by prominent members of the Detroit community, Alveda King, Alice Johnson, Diamond and Silk, Pastor Paula White, Peter Karmanos, Representative Sherry Gay-Dagnogo of the Michigan House of Representatives, Representative Karen Whitsett of the Michigan House of Representatives, and more than 30 faith leaders.

Nancy Bercaw: And very quickly thereafter John Boatwright walked in.
Matthew Antoine Canady – President Trump commuted the sentence of Matthew Antoine Canady. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Canady had an unstable childhood and all of his prior drug-related convictions occurred during his teenage years. Mr. Canady worked hard to move beyond his challenging circumstances and has demonstrated extraordinary rehabilitation while in custody. He has maintained clear conduct while incarcerated and has notably taken advantage of significant vocational programs, including an electrical apprenticeship. He receives outstanding work reports and is described as hardworking and respectful by the Bureau of Prisons staff. Mr. Canady takes full responsibility for his criminal actions and would like to find gainful employment to help support his children.

Secondly, I provide for the opportunity for first-time home buyers to be able to have a $15,000 tax credit so they can get the mortgage at the front end and be able to keep it. Thirdly, I go after those people who are involved gentrification, because what's happening is we're moving people out of their neighborhoods in ways that in fact make no sense. They're being bought out. You cannot find a place to live.
Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network, praised the Trump lists as unprecedented steps that should please conservatives if Trump is elected and delivers on the type of nominee he is promising. The Network says it has spent millions of dollars on ads opposing President Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.
The reason I recommend Rural America is because Democrats hate Rural America. They want their foofoo theaters and their foofoo cafes and their foofoo nightclubs. Rural America is Red America… I love it out here. Calm, peaceful, serene… Not a single drop of this social justice madness has touched my community.
Michael Pelletier – President Trump commuted the sentence of Michael Pelletier. Mr. Pelletier is a 64 year-old who has served 12 years of a 30 year sentence for conspiracy to distribute marijuana.

The commission report sparked a protest letter signed by 17 faith leaders, arguing that the report stigmatizes tens of millions of religious Americans, their communities and their faith-based institutions, and threatens the religious freedom of all our citizens.
We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work, and actually get it done. Progressives have got one shot. And we need to spend it with a leader who will get something done.
Wanda Abel: Yes. … Kathy knew she did it, so she had to suspect that sooner or later somebody was going to put it together or that Sandra was going to crack and tell on her. … So she spends as little time in South Korea as possible after she killed Carolyn.
If you keep on going, we will elect Bernie. Bernie will lose to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump and the House and the Senate and some of the statehouses will all go red.
Amir Khan – President Trump granted a full pardon to Amir Khan. This pardon is supported by his adult children and members of the community. Mr. Khan pled guilty to wire fraud. Notably, he immediately paid back the victim more than in full and has demonstrated remorse for his conduct. Prior to the pandemic, Mr. Khan volunteered at the organization 3 Square Meals, and has regularly donated to charities including St. Jude Children's Hospital, Boys Town, Covenant House, Tunnel to Towers Foundation, and the Salvation Army.
We're all God's children, Biden said. We should treat each other as we would like to be treated ourselves.
As a graduate of Oral Roberts University myself, I don't recall exactly which book of the Bible mentions the mulligan (Proverbs, maybe? It has a Solomonic sound). But the need for forgiveness is certainly a Biblical principle, and the willingness of Christians to forgive human failings is nothing new. Nor is it a symptom of hypocrisy.
BLOOMBERG: I never said that. And for the record, if she was a teacher in New York City, she would never have had that problem. We treated our teachers the right way, and the unions will tell you exactly that.
I appreciated very much the tone that he started out with, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City) said in the Capitol rotunda after the speech.
Democratic candidates oftentimes talk about Jefferson, and Madison, and founding ideals – but we need candidates that can talk about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Hale said, referring to the first four books of the Christian New Testament. A Democrat's not going to win a majority of the evangelical vote, but you can't win 10 or 15% and expect to win this election.
And ahead, Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, joins me to talk about evidence of a possible weapons test, explosive test for a nuclear weapon in Iran.
The State Department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling. Previously the department pointed to guidance on its website that said there must be a biological connection to a U.S. citizen to become a citizen at birth.
Adriana Shayota – President Trump commuted the sentence of Adriana Shayota. Ms. Shayota has served more than half of her 24 month sentence. The Deputy Mayor of Chula Vista, California, John McCann, supports this commutation, among other community leaders. Ms. Shayota is a mother and a deeply religious woman who had no prior convictions. She was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in counterfeit goods, commit copyright infringement, and introduce misbranded food into interstate commerce. During her time in prison, Ms. Shayota mentored those who wanted to improve their lives and demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to rehabilitation.
And it appears he doesn't need to. After a short-lived 14-point dip in net approval among social conservatives after the Stormy Daniels story broke, President Trump's support among these voters is back around 80 percent, according to Morning Consult. Evangelicals are so willing to support President Trump, they've abandoned their principles on character and morality in order to make room for him.
I think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. I think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in Washington. I think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.

TUCKER: There's been a lot of pop music made about marriage. I'm thinking about Richard and Linda Thompson's corrosive breakup album Shoot Out The Lights, Marvin Gaye's alimony concept album Here, My Dear, and the ups and downs charted in the many songs written separately by split spouses Loudon Wainwright and Kate McGarrigle. This Carters album is very much in that tradition with a significant difference - the classics I just listed were about marriages that fail. This one is about a marriage that prevails years on.

We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. We should -- and our president today -- and he's wiped all that out. We did it. We stopped it.
The two are very different political beings. Obama, with some liberal moves such as reduced sentences for drug offenses aside, did not make prison reform a priority, and was against mass incarceration. But the prison system is a subject close to Harris' heart.
PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The time has come to turn the page and open up a new chapter in the American story.
-- The shutdown has forced Trump to sideline the rest of his agenda. The New York Times's Peter Baker reports: The standoff has already forced Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Europe to meet with global business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown. The president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax-cutting plan he promised last year. He has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy.

And if I could, you had indicated earlier that all this was information they were planning on using. Not necessarily, in Florida we have very open discovery laws. And if in fact there's something that's favorable or unfavorable, it still needs to be turned over to the defense and then a determination will be made if one side or the other plans on using it and if it's even admissible in court. So there's a very open discovery --
After five years of dating, Blake Shelton stunned Gwen Stefani with a marriage proposal near the end of 2020, leaving their fan bases equally excited for what's to come.
1959: Bobby Darin CBS News Nominees: Edd Byrnes, Mark Murphy, Johnny Restivo and Mavis Rivers In 1958-59 pop singer/crooner Bobby Darin had six singles on the U.S. charts, including Splish Splash, Early in the Morning, Dream Lover and Mack the Knife. Over the next decade-and-a-half, Darin recorded 32 albums; started a label (Direction Records) to release folk music and protest songs; and acted in films such as State Fair, Captain Newman, M.D., and Hell Is for Heroes. Darin died in 1973 at the age of 37, after surgery to correct a heart problem failed.
And President Obama slamming Mitt Romney for his time at Bain Capital, calling the Republican a job-killing vampire on the same day he well had lunch with a private equity titan to raise money. Tonight Romney fires back.
Ann Butler – President Trump commuted the sentence of Ann Butler. Ms. Butler has served more than 10 years of a nearly 20-year sentence for a non-violent offense. She has an exemplary prison record, with extensive programming and work history and has garnered outstanding evaluations. In addition, she is extraordinarily devoted to her faith. At the time of her arrest, Ms. Butler was caring for five children and held two minimum-wage jobs. Upon her release, Ms. Butler wishes to reunite with her family and seek employment.
TUCKER: It's very impressive the way the music here shifts easily between hip-hop rapping and R&B vocalizing, between Beyonce's deep-voice croon and Jay-Z's high-pitched exclamations. On LOVEHAPPY, the duo swaps lines back and forth, the lyrics playfully pointed. The first words of the song are happily in love, and they seem to have reached a point in their relationship where they can joke - very ruefully - about Jay-Z's infidelity.
But you know what's interesting? I asked Steve Coll about whether Apple and Exxon had anything in common. He said absolutely. And let me list to you what he said. They're both closed systems. Neither of them like to be written about. They don't have an open door policy for the press. And they have a culture that's strong but set directly from the top.
Hard to be more clear than that. Obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. And then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. Finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. But had he really? According to chief strategist David Axelrod, Obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:
Vice President Biden, I want to make -- I want to bring us to another topic. We're in South Carolina. It's the first primary with a significant black voting population. Your numbers appear to be slipping with black voters. And I'm wondering if you could respond about why that is happening to you at this particular time.
THE CARTERS: (Singing) Let's make love in the summertime. Yeah. On the sands, beach sands, make plans to be in each other's arms. Let it breathe. Let it breathe.

I want to you come inside right now so you know just how I feel, how I feel.
And we also need to do something about child care, about making sure we increase the minimum wage. And then, finally, voting. While we are all sitting here debating, Wisconsin has kicked hundreds of thousands of people off of their voting rolls. Georgia kicked 100,000 off. As president, I will get voting rights to be a reality for everyone.
Kyle Kimoto – President Trump commuted the sentence of Kyle Kimoto. Mr. Kimoto is a father of six who has served 12 years of his 29 year sentence for a non-violent telemarketing fraud scheme.

1965: Tom Jones CBS News Nominees: The Byrds, Herman's Hermits, Horst Jankowski, Marilyn Maye, Sonny & Cher and Glenn Yarbrough The son of a Welsh coal miner, Tom Jones avoided a life destined in the mines thanks to a case of tuberculosis when he was 12. Instead, he trained his voice, played the pubs, and cut a demo record that launched an international career singing blues, pop, country and gospel music. His first album, Along Came Jones (a.k.a. It's Not Unusual), hit No. 11 on the U.S. charts. More records followed, with such hits as What's New Pussycat, Delilah, Green, Green Grass of Home, She's a Lady, Kiss and Sex Bomb, as well as a TV series (This Is Tom Jones), and even a self-parodying film appearance (Mars Attacks!).

The section in my book about Mike Pence begins with that quote from Lincoln where he says, Both sides in great contests invoke God, think and hope that God's on their side. Both may be, and one must be, wrong, Buttigieg told Father Edward Beck in a wide-ranging interview on faith and public service for CNN. The idea that God wants somebody like Mike Pence to be the cheerleader for a President largely known for his association with hush money to adult film actresses seems to me to give God very little credit.

There are many misconceptions about investing based on your values, namely that you won't see much of a return. But that's largely a myth, experts say. It is not as much a choice of do good or do well, said Greg Vigrass, president and chief executive of Folio Institutional, which builds robo-adviser technology for financial advisers. It is very possible these days to invest along the lines of your beliefs and value system and not give up anything in investment returns. Folio allows investors to invest in their beliefs by, for example, excluding securities of companies that participate in factory farming or alcohol. Performance depends on funds, though some asset managers believe these types of funds do better than the S&P 500 and others do not.

If you believe marriage has to do with love, if also, by the way, at the risk of sounding a bit conservative, you believe that sex has to do with love, or ought to, then I think it takes you to a pretty specific place, he added. I've learned that it's an expression of love, at least it can be. And I guess I believe it ought to be.

GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP/Getty Images Esperanza Spalding poses with her award for Best New Artist at the 53nd annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Over the past half-century many of the performers honored in the Best New Artist category have gone on to stellar careers.

7. Despite growing awareness of cyber threats and improving cyber defenses, nearly all information, communication networks, and systems will be at risk for years to come. Our adversaries are becoming more adept at using cyberspace capabilities to threaten our interests and advance their own strategic and economic objectives. Cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to public health, safety, and prosperity as information technologies are integrated into critical infrastructure, vital national networks, and consumer devices.
VanderPlaats also has been, at times, a critic of Trump's character and rhetoric — though he has largely supported Trump's policies on issues like restricting abortion.
VOLZ: He didn't remember, which seems convenient and perhaps was. But I should say about my dad and his epilepsy that the grand mal seizures would wipe out huge chunks of his memory, and there are many things that he wishes he remembers that he can't. He's a good custodian of the memories that he has, and they check out with my research and with the stories that other people I interviewed told. But there are huge episodes, huge swaths that are simply not there, and this was part of what wasn't there.

Biden will have to take that into account as he tries to weave together the disparate groups that make up his coalition and fulfill a central campaign promise – one that's also rooted in his faith – of bringing the country together.
There's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the Supreme Court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. George Washington nominated a couple of Supreme Court justices in his last year. And obviously George Washington had better poll numbers, I'm sure, than I did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, I think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.

Unfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in Congress and the media were as disciplined. A number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. Some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. The president tried to fool the American people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. He almost got away with it.

I think it's huge that he does not project the way other professional athletes have when it comes to masculinity, Anthony Nicodemo, a high school basketball coach in New York and LGBTQ activist, told USA TODAY Sports. He marches to the beat of his own drum the way somebody like Michael (Sam) and Jason (Collins) didn't. They fit that piece of masculinity we have come to expect in sports being big and strong. Adam doesn't fit into that box.

1993: Toni Braxton LaFace Nominees: Belly, Blind Melon, Digable Planets and SWV Toni Braxton and her sisters (Tamar, Towanda, Traci and Trina) were signed to Arista in the late 1980s as The Braxtons. That led to Toni recording two songs for the soundtrack of the Eddie Murphy comedy Boomerang, including a duet with Kenneth Babyface Edmonds, Give U My Heart. Toni Braxton, the R&B singer-songwriter's first album (which included the hits Another Sad Love Song and Breathe Again), hit Number 1 on the Billboard chart, and sold 10 million copies worldwide. Seven more albums followed, including Secrets (15 million copies sold). Her Number 1 hit singles include You're Making Me High, Let It Flow and Un-Break My Heart. In addition to her two 1993 Grammys, Braxton would win four more awards in the category of Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (Breathe Again, You're Makin' Me High,  Un-Break My Heart and He Wasn't Man Enough), and one for Best R&B Album, for Love, Marriage & Divorce (with Babyface). Financial difficulties led to her declaring bankruptcy in 1996, but she rebounded. Outside of recording, Braxton appeared on Broadway in Beauty and the Beast, competed in season seven of Dancing With the Stars, and starred in the reality TV series, Braxton Family Values. Her memoir, Unbreak My Heart, was published in 2014. Braxton earned three more Grammy nominations in 2018, for Long As I Live and the album, Sex & Cigarettes.
It's an awesome time, Mason Darrow, who came out in 2015 while a member of Princeton's football team, told USA TODAY Sports. For the lack of a better word, it's a gay Olympics. I think it's (a) really nice change of pace.
The consular official told them she had discretion to require a DNA test to show who the biological father was of each boy and without those tests neither son would get citizenship.

At least hundreds of National Guard troops were forced to sleep in parking garages after being booted Thursday from the U.S. Capitol complex following their job to secure Biden's inauguration in the wake of the Jan. 6 riots. I've never in my entire career felt like I've been booted onto the curb and told, 'Figure it out on your own,'  said one of the soldiers, who said he served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some troops are headed home, while others have apparently been returned to the Capitol complex, after an uproar on social media.

We went to Mitch McConnell and said join us and point out what is happening here. He said, no, we want no part of it. And if we had moved -- we didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over. And, so, the idea the bipartisan committee said we could have done more, theoretically that's true, but the fact of the matter is we didn't have the information until the end. And so, look, we, in fact, should be imposing sanctions on Russia now for their interference.

Then, one stormy night, while sipping a glass of Malbec, as Ling and Chan were enjoying their catnip, Ling jumped up on Jonas and rolled over on her back, paws up. Taking advantage of the situation, Jonas grabbed a Q-tip and some Wet Ones and figured out a way to give Ling a waterless pedicure. He was elated, but felt that something was missing. What his cats needed was a nice color of nail polish to complete the look.
In his speech, Northam pitched tax and budget plans that hinge on using $1.2 billion in new revenue that the state expects to collect as a result of last year's federal tax overhaul.

North Carolina and Mississippi have both approved such laws amid widespread criticism.

During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committee, Warren pushed for more accountability in the economy and pledged to go after drug companies. The problem is Washington works great for those with influence. Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns, she told reporters. We make our campaigns work through the people. Controversy Warren's claims of Native American ancestry, which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead, have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely, President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid, Warren released the results of a DNA test in 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage, along with a campaign-like video about her family history. The move backfired, inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump. What Trump says The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as Pocahontas, and while campaigning over the summer, he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video. She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage.

Cory Booker Cory Booker launches 2020 campaign 02:57 Biography Cory Booker was born in Washington in 1964 and raised in the affluent suburbs of northern New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in sociology from Stanford University, where he also played tight end for the football team. After graduation, Booker was awarded a Rhodes scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, earning a master's degree in modern history. He returned to the U.S. for a law degree at Yale. After working as a public-interest attorney and housing advocate in Newark, Booker decided to run for the city's municipal council in 1998. He managed to topple a long-time incumbent and, at age 29, become the youngest-ever member of the council, where he gained notoriety for fasting outside a housing project to denounce the intensifying crime and drug use in some of Newark's neighborhoods. After launching an unsuccessful bid in 2002 against incumbent mayor Sharpe James, Booker ran again in 2006 and defeated deputy mayor Ronald Rice. During his seven-year tenure as mayor, Booker was praised for attracting large companies to Newark and revamping the city's downtown. But he was also criticized by local residents and officials for appearing out-of-touch and focusing on his national image. The only way you can see the mayor is if you turn on 'Meet the Press,' Newark's current mayor, Ras Baraka, said when he was a councilman during Booker's mayoral administration.

JOHN AVLON, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well look the growth of lobbying over the past decade in particular has been a real problem. Many people point to it as a cause for not just the increased spending we've seen but things like the lobbying that has watered down the Volcker Rule. Much of it was pursued by JPMorgan Chase. So lobbyists do have their thumb on the scale and it's a growing problem in Washington. And it's contributed to a lot of the frustration that people feel at home, the sense that Washington isn't working. Lobbyists are an important reason -- part of the reason why.

Todd Farha, Thaddeus Bereday, William Kale, Paul Behrens, Peter Clay – President Trump granted full pardons to Todd Farha, Thaddeus Bereday, William Kale, Paul Behrens, and Peter Clay, former executives of a healthcare maintenance organization. Widely cited as a case study in overcriminalization, these men have attracted a broad range of support, including from the CATO Institute, the Reason Foundation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and various scholars and law professors. In 2008, Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay were criminally prosecuted for a state regulatory matter involving the reporting of expenditures to a state health agency. The expenditures reported were based on actual monies spent, and the reporting methodology was reviewed and endorsed by those with expertise in the state regulatory scheme. Notably, there was no evidence that any of the individuals were motivated by greed. And in fact, the sentencing judge called the likelihood that there was any personal financial motivation infinitesimal. The judge imposed a range of sentences from probation to 3 years' imprisonment, reflecting the conduct as an aberration from these individuals' otherwise law-abiding lives. Messrs. Farha, Bereday, Kale, Behrens, and Clay are described as devoted to their family and their communities, and have weathered their convictions without complaint.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), secured seats on the House Oversight Committee, giving them a platform to grill Trump administration officials in a wide variety of investigations. Politico's Andrew Desiderio and Heather Caygle report: [Ocasio-Cortez], Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) won spots on the high-profile committee on Tuesday … Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the Oversight Committee, dismissed concerns about the outspoken freshman lawmakers. 'If I based the choices going on the committee based on what people said or their reputations or whatever, I probably wouldn't have a committee,' Cummings said.
This is something that should have been done a long time ago, he said.

BURNETT: Well it's small relative to their assets.
While Buttigieg held five events last Thursday, Brock spent nearly two hours training over 250 people in Polk County, the largest in the state. It's part of a broader effort to teach volunteers and caucus goers the delegate math and persuasion methods in order to convince undecided caucus goers.
The state House eventually passed the bill by a single vote, but the tide was turning and a month later the state Senate voted unanimously to kill the bill.
Same-sex couples have until the end of May to wed there before the new measure goes into effect. The self-governing British territory became the first to reverse its stance on the issue, according to GLAAD, as countries increasingly move to legalize marriage between people of any gender.
However, some of his decisions as governor, including his backing of a controversial union legislation, have garnered opposition in Washington. What Trump says Mr. Trump has yet to tweet about Inslee or his presidential aspirations. In February 2018, however, the Washington governor confronted the president in the White House about his idea to arm teachers in the wake of multiple deadly school shootings. I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let's just take that off the table and move forward, Inslee told the president during a meeting with other governors in the East Room. Although he initially pushed back by saying he supported arming certain teachers, Mr. Trump listened with his arms crossed while Inslee pleaded for him to drop the idea and embrace other gun control measure
KLOBUCHAR: What I think we should do is make things more affordable, nonprofit public option, make sure we're paying for long-term care better, take on the pharmaceuticals, like you and I have done together...

You can talk about Antifa, I've watched them in streets protesting in different situations, OK? Cuomo argued. There are certainly aspects of them that are true to a cause, that is a good cause, they want social justice, they want whatever they want in that context.

In November, she said in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. What Trump says Mr. Trump has not publicly criticized Gabbard. The two met briefly shortly after Mr. Trump was elected.

Still, in November 2015, the Mormon Church adopted new, rigid guidelines on same-sex couples. Under those guidelines, any Mormon in a same-sex marriage would be deemed an apostate, or having abandoned the religion, and subjected to disciplinary hearings that could lead to excommunication.
KLEIN: Well, Neal, it's time to play a game that we're calling...
PAT MCCRORY: We believe a court, rather than a federal agency, should tell our state, our nation and employers across the country what the law requires.
Okoh's impression was that the Anglican authorities thought they were exercising patience in order to gradually persuade the scripture-believers to embrace homosexual doctrine, something he says they will never do.
Chick-fil-A has a questionable history on civil rights and human rights, Martini said. I think it's imperative the university chooses to do business with organizations that coincide with the [university's] mission and expectations they give students regarding diversity and inclusion.
I think, Cox said, that's really going to be challenge.
Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy said Kane assumed an off with your heads mentality as she ran the state's top law enforcement agency. The judge called Kane a political neophyte who failed to make the transition from campaigner to public servant after she took office.

Wayne Messam Screenshot from Wayne Messam's 2020 campaign video Wayne for America Biography Born in Pahokee, Florida and raised in South Bay, Mayor Wayne Messam became the first African American mayor of the city of Miramar after unseating a 16-year incumbent in 2015. Messam's parents immigrated to South Florida from Jamaica. His father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the Florida Glades after coming to the United States, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. Messam earned a full football scholarship to Florida State University, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 National Championship Team under legendary coach Bobby Bowden. He would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. Wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, Angela, more than 20 years ago. They have three children, Wayne II, and twin daughters, Kayla and Kyla. Issues While lacking name recognition outside Florida, Messam told CNN that under his leadership, the city of Miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from Hurricane Irma. He has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities. These are issues that have national implications and I'm looking forward to be that agent of change for the American people and I'm so excited to launch my candidacy to be the president of the United States, he said.
Michael Liberty – President Trump granted a full pardon to Michael Liberty. Mr. Liberty's request for clemency is supported by Representative Susan Austin, Matthew E. Sturgis, and Anthony Fratianne. In 2016 Mr. Liberty was convicted for campaign finance violations and later was indicted for related offenses. Mr. Liberty is the father of 7 children and has been involved in numerous philanthropic efforts.
KLOBUCHAR: So, my argument here is that we need to get back to what's happening right now.
STEYER: ... completely. And that is an absolute unfair statement.
Strong says the Party will donate a total of $70,000. Washington Senate Democrats will also donate their contribution from Knight to the campaign to uphold gay marriage. In a statement, the Ramtha School says the release of the videos may violate copyright law and it may sue.
She supported transitioning to 100% renewable energy. She wanted to get rid of tuition and fees at four-year public universities, and she supported free community college for everyone. She also advocated for raising the federal minimum wage to $15.
Gabbard took a progressive stance on most other issues.
Secondly, you create incentives for affordable housing to be built and, third, to help people pay for it.
The internal institutional failures involved must be addressed, and I look forward to contributing to all efforts to that end, so that, inspired by the Gospel, we can build up the unity of the Church, and together take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis, Cupich said.

Trump speaking in tongues....but it isn't God speaking — Vickie Adams (@VickieA30482652) February 8, 2019
And now some questions about the incoming Trump administration - some potentially big issues before the Supreme Court and Trump's progress toward nominating a ninth Supreme Court justice. For this, I'm joined by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Hi, Nina.
Through a pattern of systemic firings and Nixonian espionage, she created a terror zone in this office, said Erik Olsen, a career prosecutor who is now the chief deputy attorney general.
-- Pelosi remains adamant that Democrats will not vote to fund the wall, but several more moderate members want to compromise. Politico's Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report: A group of centrist House Democrats, sick of political posturing, is pressing [Pelosi] to counter Trump's immigration proposal with her own potential compromise. The group, led by freshman Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, is asking the California Democrat to offer Trump a vote on his border wall or some sort of negotiated security package in February if he first signs a bill reopening the federal government … 'Give Trump the money,' Rep. Collin Peterson, a centrist Democrat from a red Minnesota district, told a local radio station Tuesday. 'I'd give him the whole thing…and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this? We're going to build that wall anyway, at some time.'
VOLZ: Sure. And I want to say that my mom also confirms and describes that my dad identified the moment of conception and didn't even bother getting a pregnancy test. She believed him, and it turned out that he was right. She began to show. It became obvious. So that is a kind of a story, kind of a myth that I grew up with. I don't know how many people have these really high and magical myths about their births (laughter), but I sure had one. My dad, however, was convinced that I was going to be a boy - absolutely certain. And because he'd been right about everything else, my mom went along with it, too.

Listen to NPR's interview with Haslam above.
KING: All right, all right, Mayor Buttigieg.
Already, and even though he is innocent of the allegation, Woody Allen — one of our greatest living filmmakers — had his latest film blacklisted, along with his career. The Walt Disney Company has blacklisted its own Song of the South. The creator of The Simpsons has blacklisted an episode of his own show. The Library Journal published an article calling for a ban on books guilty of whiteness, whatever the hell that is. The Little House books are being burned.
When Ames returned to the United States, she was recruited by the FBI to go undercover and secretly record a reunion with Kathy Patrick in hopes of eliciting a confession.
WARREN: What I asked the mayor to do is to do a release of all people who have discrimination claims...
It's possible the impact will be short-lived, especially if no other incidents occur that mirror the racial bias of the Philadelphia arrest. However, another alleged incident of racial bias emerged in Los Angeles, when a black man claimed he was denied access to a bathroom at a Los Angeles store in January, even though a white man was given the entry code. Neither were paying customers.
ERIN BURNETT, HOST: We start the second half of our show with stories we care about, where we focus on our own reporting from the front lines.
At the same time, he said, the decision will prompt Republicans who disagree with her decision to consider whether there should be political consequences for her internally.
No matter, because some gleeful Twitter users enjoyed another opportunity to chortle at an apparent Trump gaffe. Amid the religious right's efforts to limit such rights as abortion access and same-sex marriage, others concluded that the president may have seen the light.
A couple of years ago, I decided to move my movie collection to digital. But after The Simpsons self-blacklister announced that digital copies would be scrubbed of the problematic episode, that even if you purchased the episode digitally, they were going to go in and remove it, I've gotten smarter. Even if I already have a digital copy, I went back and purchased hard copies of movies and TV shows that are wonderfully problematic.
A father of three, McCormack was elevated to the post after he was elected leader of The National Party ― a move which automatically makes him deputy prime minister thanks to a long-standing agreement with conservative coalition partner, The Liberal Party.
Here's some truth: CNN thrills over the petty ultra-violence Antifa unleashes against the political right. In the sick and sinister minds that run that Hate Network, Trump supporters got it coming, which is why — and this is important…
with Black earnings for low-income households predicted to fall by at least 35 percent compared with 2018, reversing gains since the last economic recovery. Black Americans want Biden, the candidate they bolstered to the presidency, to narrow systemic racial inequalities that have left them trailing White Americans on every economic measure, Tracy Jan reports . These gaps are worsening amid the coronavirus recession,, reversing gains since the last economic recovery.
South Carolina is famous for its rough-and-tumble politics — in 2000, for example, there was a whisper campaign that John McCain had fathered a black child. He wound up losing to eventual President George W. Bush. It derailed his candidacy. With as wide a field as this one, and the stakes being so high, watch out for more dirty tricks. The primary will likely further winnow the GOP side. Donald Trump has a big lead in the polls; Ted Cruz is hoping to win over socially conservative voters in the northwestern part of the state; Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and John Kasich are contending for the significant portion of establishment Republicans.
BIDEN: Here's the deal. Here's the deal.
DAVIES: Was your mom ever recognized, officially, for any of this stuff?
VOLZ: In retrospect, sure, of course. I feel in general that marijuana is relatively harmless. It's certainly not something that should be consumed by children. And I want to be clear that I don't think I was tottering around stoned during my childhood. I was certainly discouraged from consuming marijuana as a kid. It was grown-up stuff. That was something that I understood.
SANDERS: Can I respond? I was mentioned...
Instead, they sacked the Capitol, and five died — the latest and surest sign that the party ennobled by John McCain's patriotism has become the refuge of scoundrels.
The video appears to have been shot last year at Knight's School of Enlightenment near Olympia. Knight claims to channel an ancient spirit named Ramtha. Earlier this year she started giving generously to the state Democratic Party and Democratic candidates. For several days, Democrats have resisted Republican calls to return the contributions. But Benton Strong, a spokesman for the state Democratic party, says after the most recent videos came out.
My faith animates all that I do, Warren told reporters at the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's annual convention in Chicago. I truly do believe in the worth of every single human being.

Wanda Abel: No one should have to go through what my family went through. How … do we live in a world … where a U.S. citizen and go and murder a U.S. citizen, and then come back and live like nothing happened? That's the outrage of this.
Paxton on Monday voiced support for North Carolina in its legal fight with the U.S. Department of Justice, saying in a statement that he backs the principle that persons should use restrooms and other intimate facilities that correspond with their biological sex.
Toni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, said that when she reviewed Goessling's background, she was overcome with a sense of fear.

The other flourish was the reimagining of the traditional wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery, usually a more low-key affair, to compensate for the absence of the parade that usually stretches from the Capitol to the White House after the president's swearing-in. The 2021 version, rather than just featuring the outgoing president and vice president, included Biden, Vice President Harris, Bill and Hillary Clinton, George W. and Laura Bush, and Barack and Michelle Obama.
We had a lot of conversations this weekend with the examiner in charge at the OCC that oversees JPMorgan. And we got one piece of input that's evolved, that sort of walked back away from that and I guess at the end of the day this is very complex. This is certainly no threat whatsoever to JPMorgan as far as it being --
Even liberal advocates admit that children do best when raised by their own mom and dad. Secular sociologist Sara McLanahan of Princeton University and other secular experts have reported for decades that children do best within normal families.
The Inheritance was not my attempt at a grand summation of the past quarter century of queer history. What I was attempting was an examination of class, economic inequality, and poverty within the gay community — issues I have rarely seen depicted in theater. I have painted on a broad canvas. It is simply not the canvas others might have chosen.
Since the founding of our nation, many of our greatest strides — from gaining our independence to abolition of civil rights to extending the vote for women — have been led by people of faith, Trump declared in his speech Thursday.
But we all know, unchecked capitalism has failed. The answer is not for the government to take over the private sector, though. The answer is for us to break the corporate stranglehold on our government and have the government work for the people again.
In a forceful statement, the Nigerian Anglican primate, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh, said that the Anglican communion seems to be tilting toward a non-biblical understanding of homosexuality, marginalizing those with an orthodox, biblical view of human sexuality.
Debate sparked by the confrontation, swirling around a series of issues from religious liberty to gay rights to a proper academic environment, have now reached a national level, according to the Duquesne Duke, the university's campus newspaper.
McCaul told reporters that he hoped the bomber's biggest mistake was going through FedEx.
The president also commuted the sentence of former Mayor of Detroit Kwame Malik Kilpatrick, a Democrat, citing strong support by members of the Detroit Community as well as Alveda King, Alice Johnson, and Diamond and Silk. Kilpatrick served seven years of a 28-year sentence for his role in a major corruption scandal, convicted of racketeering, mail fraud, wire fraud, and other charges.
On the weekend of Dec. 17, 1988, just three days before the murder, Ames, Patrick, Carolyn and some Korean students took a trip into the mountains. Carolyn took pictures.
Tooley, who personally identifies with the evangelical tendency in the United Methodist tradition, says the long-standing church positions on matters of sexuality and marriage in the past reflected the influence of conservative Methodists in the United States.
WARREN: So this is one thing where a president can make a big difference all by herself. And I'm going to start with my secretary of education. My secretary of education will be someone who has taught in public school.
The principal wished me luck and gave my job to someone else. Pregnancy discrimination, you bet. But I was 21 years old. I didn't have a union to protect me. And I didn't have any federal law on my side. So I packed up my stuff, and I went home. At least I didn't have a boss who said to me, Kill it, the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said...
It's nothing new for actresses to search out envelopes to push, edges to explore or boundaries to transgress in the name of publicity, stretching or simply staying relevant. In Kidman's case, her finest performance may be a cumulative one, far outstripping the workaday job of taking a character from the page to the stage. Her genius is just as strategic as it is technical, in how she's consistently leveraged stardom on behalf of growth, taste and sophistication. With her preternatural technical and physical gifts, she easily could have been sleepwalking through the past 30 years. Instead, she's chosen to keep her eyes wide open.
A senior apostle is then determined based on who has the highest ranking seniority from the date when they were ordained to the Twelve. The longest-tenured member of the governing body is 93-year-old Russell M. Nelson. His appointment will not be officially named until after Monson's funeral services, out of respect.
The Vikings hired a pair of attorneys to investigate Kluwe's allegations about Priefer's comments and the reasons for the punter's release. In a July 2014 report they noted that the team's long snapper at the time, Cullen Loeffler, told them he also heard Priefer talk about putting all the gays on an island and nuking it. For the attorneys, that provided an important piece of corroboration, although they wrote that no other witnesses they interviewed recalled hearing any remarks of that nature by Priefer.
Do you feel your marriage is campaigning as well, because you're doing something that is new in American politics? Dickerson asks Chasten Buttigieg.
I can't speak for all the [United Methodist] schools, but one thing we've learned is that we have students who are struggling right now with their church, says Rundell of the Methodist Theology School in Ohio. For our younger students in particular, [LGBTQ equality] is a matter that, in most of their lives, is no longer debated.
Nancy Bercaw: And a lot of us … missed work on occasion for various reasons.
NINA TOTENBERG: Mr. President, Judge Garland was runner-up twice before. So why now and not twice before?
ROCCA: And Melania. So - OK.
JOHNSON: Sure. The owner of a Colorado shop called Masterpiece Cakeshop refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple several years ago. Colorado, like a lot of states, has public accommodation laws that are designed for businesses that interact with the public to prevent discrimination. And this baker, Jack Phillips, said no. He violated the statute on the books in Colorado, saying he didn't want to be compelled to violate his First Amendment rights, his deeply held religious beliefs, by celebrating this gay couple's marriage. But the same-sex couple said the baker was violating their rights.
Polly, how -- is this really about controlling -- who's controlling the drugs going into the United States? I mean, this is still a question of U.S. demand and supply that is not necessarily from Mexico but transiting through Mexico?
Along with anti-animal cruelty, there are a myriad of other ways people can invest with their core values. Religion-based investing has grown in popularity, and a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) recently joined the market, and is based on the bible — it excludes companies that support abortion or support same-sex marriage. Environment, social and governance (known as ESG) investing looks at climate change, equal pay and executive compensation. There are also Islamic-inspired funds that exclude anything to do with alcohol, tobacco and gambling, said David Kathman, a mutual fund analyst at Chicago-based investment research and management firm Morningstar.
About a decade ago, Iowa led the way in making it possible for a marriage like mine to exist, he noted. Iowa has recognized same-sex marriages since 2009.
Corvain Cooper – President Trump commuted the sentence of Mr. Corvain Cooper. Mr. Cooper is a 41 year-old father of two girls who has served more than 7 years of a life sentence for his non-violent participation in a conspiracy to distribute marijuana.
BLOOMBERG: They're doing a good job.
A source close to Stefani told People magazine that Shelton reached out to her children before getting down on one knee and proposing to his longtime love.
Antony Blinken's nomination for secretary of state, Republican and Democratic lawmakers struck a handshake agreement last night to expeditenomination for secretary of state, Demirjian reports . That all but sets up Blinken's confirmation, though any one senator can block an expedited confirmation.
VOLZ: (Laughter) That question makes me laugh a little bit. So as a child, I was pretty accepting of especially my mom's worldview. I had a lot of trust in her. She was always cool in a crisis. And I believed that she knew what she was doing. My parents, I would say, did not use the I Ching to decide what I should or shouldn't be allowed to do. I didn't have a whole lot of rules as a child. I kind of felt like I was part of the decision-making process to a degree that, I think, is pretty unusual.
DAVIES: You were born while the business was going. And after your mom recovered from the birth, she started bringing you along on her deliveries. What was that like? What did you learn about how she carried you, kind of how you fit into this whole thing?
Though no one from CAST agreed to be interviewed, one family who sympathizes with the group's views did agree to share its perspective. Kim and Steve VanderHelm have lived in Allendale for 21 years; they have two kids who graduated from Allendale Public Schools a few years ago. The VanderHelms still care a lot about what the district is teaching.
As many people know, Liz and I have definitely had our differences, but I am incredibly proud of how she handled herself during the fight over the Electoral College, Mary Cheney wrote on her Facebook page last week. She stood up to President Trump. . . . He even denounced her by name from the stage at yesterday's rally — something that should definitely be considered a badge of honor. Good job Big Sister.
According to a statement previously released by the church, the appointment of a new president is viewed by members as a divinely revealed process free of internal lobbying.
Steven Schroeder: The examiner concluded that she was deceptive.

At the urging of gay bloggers, in 2012, Regnerus of the University of Texas at Austin was investigated by his university and attempts were made to bring him up on charges and get him fired for reaching much the same conclusions as Sullins has reached. Though the University of Texas backed him up and the journal that published his paper has not withdrawn it, he still comes under bitter criticism from gay advocates.
Austin Interim Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters that investigators believe the use of a tripwire in the fourth bomb shows a higher level of sophistication than already been demonstrated. He said it also indicates a shift in the serial bomber's strategy of targeting specific people to a more random style.
He issued an executive order creating what he called a new clemency initiative to identify those who might be eligible for pardons and swiftly consider those applications. He encouraged Californians to apply for clemency for people they believe meet that criteria.
DAVIES: You write about the first night they had sex, which is interesting both because you know about it...
BUTTIGIEG: Well, the first time I ever set foot in South Carolina, it was stepping off the bus that brought me to combat training near Fort Jackson. And that was to get ready to go to Afghanistan, where I saw that one of the things that kept me safe, just as sure as my body armor, was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country that was known to keep its word. Our allies and our adversaries knew it.
House Speaker David Ralston, the chamber's top Republican, supports the Pastor Protection Act.
Cuomo and his far-left confederates regularly encourage these terrorists.
He needs to heal the wounds caused by the kind of prejudices he publicly expressed in the past.
ROCCA: You're going to get ripped off if you get the Kate Moss one.
But I want to take this out of politics right now and talk to the American people because this is so serious. I'm not going to give my website right now. I'm going to give the CDC's website, which is cdc.gov, so that people keep checking in and they follow the rules and they realize what they have to do if they feel sick and they call their health care provider. Because many doctors are saying it's just a matter of time before we're going to start seeing this here.
And to a lot of people the way he says it sounds a little smug. I think there's a real unease that people have apart from the specifics of Bain, let alone the ad, an unease with the kind of the financialization of the economy that leads to manufacturing firms being hollowed out and that sort of thing.
With the killer still out there, Carolyn's friends wondered … could they be next?
This is where, for the past year, parents have been fighting over sex education. Specifically: any mention of LGBTQ+ identities in the school district's curriculum.
One of the things that you do in the book is you talk about kind of the history of San Francisco. And in the 1970s, there was all of this kind of explosion of creativity and art and experimentation. But there was also some really dark stuff. You know, the Peoples Temple, which was led by Jim Jones, was active in the city and very connected to a lot of the liberal politicians. And then there was the horrific assassinations of the mayor, Moscone, and then the supervisor, the councilman, Harvey Milk that, I guess, was not a customer of your mom, but somebody that she met on her rounds a lot. How did all of that affect her?
Well, first of all what I would say is take a look at the appointments I've made since I've been president of the United States. I've appointed as many African-Americans to the Circuit Court as any president ever; more African-American women on the federal courts than any other president; more Hispanics, more Asian-Americans, more LGBT judges than any president in history.
Peter Van Sant: Who do you believe held the knife and murdered Carolyn Abel?
Thank you, Bill. Thank you, everybody. It is great to be back in Salt Lack City. Salt Lake, of course, is a beautiful city surrounded by mountains. Later on, we're going to be talking to somebody who specializes in descending those mountains rather quickly, Olympic gold medalist Hannah Kearney. But first, we want to congratulate our friend Terry Gross and her staff on this week's 30th anniversary of the show Fresh Air. It is an awesome thing.
BUTTIGIEG: You've got people believing something that is false. This needs to be cleared up.
After cutting his teeth as a graduate assistant with Navy, Priefer's first coaching jobs were at the college level, including a brief stint at Virginia Military Institute, before he was hired in 2002 by the Jacksonville Jaguars to assist with their special teams. He held the same role with the New York Giants the following three years, then oversaw special teams for the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos.
Nancy Bercaw: We were all certain that … perhaps a Korean … had probably killed her. … if a Korean hated an American this much, was he coming after the rest of us?
I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president, so it was really something that you didn't feel that you can actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions about it. The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence — what the science is and know that's it, let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling, Fauci said at his first press conference of the Biden administration.
BUTTIGIEG: I will tell you what the Russians want. They don't have a political party. They want chaos.
-- The narrative: Democratic presidential candidates across the board are embracing liberal and populist policies, demonstrating how much the party has transformed in recent years. David Weigel and Jenna Johnson report: For years, Democratic presidential candidates have been skittish about taking positions that were considered too liberal, for fear of scaring off moderates and independent voters. That caution seems to be gone, along with soul-searching about making explicit appeals to conservative voters. … The party's swift shift has left vulnerable several Democratic candidates or likely ones who have voting records and previous stances that are out-of-line with current Democratic thinking. Those who defend their earlier stances risk seeming stuck in time to party that's quickly transforming, while those who have changed their positions risk being labeled as flip-floppers and opportunists.
The revisions have broad support in parliament, where few politicians have stood up for LGBT rights for fear of alienating a largely conservative voter base ahead of legislative and presidential elections next year.
Donald Trump Unveils New, More Diverse Supreme Court Short List
Six days earlier, Cheney was in the House chamber, urging that Republicans reject efforts pushed by Trump and many others in her party to challenge the electoral college results that determined Trump had lost his reelection bid. She did not know she was being attacked by Trump, who was delivering the speech that would incite a mob to storm the Capitol, until her father reached her by phone in the House cloakroom.

-- Yahoo News, Operation Cobra: The untold story of how a CIA officer trained a network of agents who found the Soviet missiles in Cuba, by Sean D. Naylor: A 10-year veteran of the CIA, [Tom] Hewitt had spent the previous six months teaching the principal agent everything he knew about how to run an effective espionage network, doing all he could to mitigate the substantial risks that the agent would have to take in Fidel Castro's Cuba. The team's mission was to establish a network that could be used to gather intelligence and, if necessary, to foment counterrevolution against the Castro regime. Getting rid of Castro was a high priority for the administration of President John F. Kennedy and for the CIA. Hewitt knew this was an important mission, but he could not have imagined that his team would soon play a vital role in preventing nuclear Armageddon.

I would explain to them how gender identity is your internal sense of what it is to be male or female.

Like it made sense to them.
Bernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how we're going to pay for it.

I'm running for president because we need dreamers in Washington but we also need to get things done, Hickenlooper says in the video. I've proven again and again I can bring people together to produce the progressive change Washington has failed to deliver. As governor, Hickenlooper also signed an expansion of Medicaid in 2013. He has not expressed support for a single-payer health system. Hickenlooper has opposed a number of Trump administration policies, including plans to scale back on federal coal emission restrictions, and has been generally critical of the president's approach to business. Over the summer, he called for an investigation into the separation of thousands of children from their families at the border, and he opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. What Trump says President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Hickenlooper so far.

And one of the things that's interesting in the Brownie Mary and Mer the Brownie Lady confusion - so they were both part of the same zeitgeist. Well, poor Brownie Mary kept getting busted. And she had a wonderful way of handling the press. She was grandmotherly and funny, very, very witty and adorable. And the press just loved her. They just ate it up. And so she, possibly more than anyone, was responsible for bringing the concept of medical marijuana to broader society. And my mom, meanwhile, stayed underground. She didn't get busted. She didn't go to the press. But she worked throughout all of these years to get edibles to people who needed them.

The major limitation of of the study is that the database contained information on kids raised by only twenty same-sex couples. But there are very few children raised by gays at all, let alone over a long period.

But Ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like Medicare for all.

Robert Bowker – President Trump granted a full pardon to Robert Bowker. Mr. Bowker's pardon is supported by Ann Marie Pallan, Sherriff Butch Anderson, and the late Robert Trump. Nearly 30 years ago, Mr. Bowker pled guilty to a violation the Lacey Act, which prohibits trafficking in wildlife, when he arranged for 22 snakes owned by Rudy Cobra King Komarek to be transported to the Miami Serpentarium. Although he did not ask for any animals in return, he was offered 22 American alligators. After pleading guilty, Mr. Bowker was sentenced to probation. Mr. Bowker has dedicated resources to animal conservation efforts in the intervening decades, including as a member of the Humane Society of the United States, World Wildlife Fund, and Wildlife Conservation Society.
John Nystrom – President Trump granted a full pardon to John Nystrom, who, other than this conviction, was described by his sentencing judge as a model citizen. His clemency is supported by Governor Kristi Noem and Senator Michael Rounds. Over 10 years ago, while working as a contractor on a school reconstruction project, Mr. Nystrom failed to alert the proper authorities when he learned that a subcontractor was receiving double payments for work performed. Mr. Nystrom took full responsibility for this oversight and even tried to pay the Crowe Creek Tribe, who was paying for the work, restitution before he pled guilty. Mr. Nystrom has since paid his restitution in full. Mr. Nystrom teaches Sunday school and volunteers for the Knights of Columbus and Habitat for Humanity, among other organizations, and has previously served as County Commissioner.

Biden's presidency could contribute to the difficult realignment of American Catholicism with Pope Francis's vision – a process resisted by `culture war' bishops since the time of Francis's election, but also interrupted by Trump, Faggioli wrote in his book on Biden and Catholicism.

Javier Gonzales – President Trump commuted the sentence of Javier Gonzales. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Gonzales was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and distribution of methamphetamine in 2005. He has served over 14 years in prison, which is 4 years longer than the 10-year sentence he would likely receive today. He has a demonstrated record of rehabilitation during his incarceration, including steady employment, with substantial UNCIOR experience, and participation in vocational programming and training to facilitate his successful reintegration into the workforce upon release. He also has no history of violent conduct. Mr. Gonzales has actively addressed his admitted substance abuse issues with nonresidential drug treatment and participation in the residential program.
James Brian Cruz – President Trump commuted the remaining sentence of James Brian Cruz. Mr. Cruz's many supporters include Alice Johnson, Dr. Robert Jeffress, Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, Kelly Shackelford of the First Liberty Institute, several former inmates who Mr. Cruz mentored or ministered, Mr. Cruz's work supervisor, and several business owners and managers. Mr. Cruz, who has served approximately half of a 40-year sentence for a drug crime, has truly reformed and has worked to better his life and the lives of other inmates while in prison. Several former inmates credit Mr. Cruz, whom they met while incarcerated, as someone who helped changed their life, as a great source of comfort for many, and one who helps others without looking for anything in return. Mr. Cruz's work supervisor describes him as a dependable and hard-working employee, who has gained the respect of many staff workers and inmates alike and who helps arguing inmates make peace. Mr. Cruz writes that he recognizes the effect drugs have on people, families, and the community, and desires a second chance to live life as one who upholds the law, and lives to help others.
Although he is backing those same bills again, including measures that call for universal background checks and an assault-weapons ban, Northam chose to highlight just a single bill in his speech — one that he said Republican legislatures in other states have adopted.

The feeling of both loss and victimization is reflected in Pew Research Center surveys. In a 2019 poll, a majority of adults who identify with or lean toward the GOP said that religion is losing influence in American life and that this is a bad thing.

3. No longer a solely U.S. domain, the democratization of space poses significant challenges for the United States. Adversaries are increasing their presence in this domain with plans to reach or exceed parity in some areas. For example, Russia and China will continue to pursue a full range of anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce U.S. military effectiveness and overall security. Increasing commercialization of space now provides capabilities that were once limited to global powers to anyone that can afford to buy them. Many aspects of modern society—to include our ability to conduct military operations—rely on our access to and equipment in space.

SOME ROMAN CATHOLICS SOUNDING ALARM ABOUT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, CONFLICTS WITH MORAL TEACHING
VOLZ: My mom came up with this really innovative business plan where she sold exclusively to people on the job. So she would go around to boutiques and restaurants and real estate offices and even medical offices and only sell to the people who were working. They would buy at large volume and then redistribute the brownies through their own social circles.
NASHVILLE — Tennessee Freemasons overwhelmingly voted Thursday to uphold a ban on gay members, according to Freemasons who witnessed the vote at a members-only meeting here.
WARREN: We -- we have to be able to trust our president, because there are a lot of decisions a president makes that you just can't follow every part of that. And that's one of the reasons that we need to see any candidate's taxes.
We have a clear choice of who's going to lead this party. And I am the only one in the New Hampshire debate, when asked, if we had a problem with a socialist leading the ticket, that raised my hand.
It was to me a trashing not just of our sense of freedom and our sense of rights, but also, in some way, a trashing of religion, he said. Like is this really the biggest thing we should be doing to accommodate religion right now? Making it easier to harm people in its name?
VOLZ: Well, first of all, so Harvey was not a customer. He had sworn off drugs. But his camera shop, which was also his campaign headquarters, was one of my mom's regular stops because other people around him and who were working on his campaign were customers. So that was how that connection happened. But he was very much out in the neighborhood walking around, talking to people. He was very personable and very connected to the community. And so my mom knew him.

-- Michael Bloomberg, who is weighing a presidential bid leaning on his centrist image, emphasized the importance of compromise in an Annapolis speech. Rachel Chason reports: He gave the keynote speech Tuesday at a leadership conference at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, praising the late senator John McCain — an academy alumnus — for his independence and willingness to work across the aisle. … Following meetings with Maryland lawmakers and state Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D), Bloomberg spoke at a news conference about the importance of 'balancing' different priorities. He called the partial federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, a 'disgrace.' 'You can't be an absolutist . . . life is much more complex than that,' he said. … Asked about the timing of an announcement about 2020, Bloomberg said: 'Well, I said I'd take a look at it in January, February. We're still in January.'

Forty percent of Americans say they definitely will get inoculated when they can, and another 23 percent say they probably will, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. But just one quarter of Republicans say they definitely will get vaccinated.
DeWayne Phelps – President Trump commuted the sentence of DeWayne Phelps. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Phelps has served 11 years in prison for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. He has served over a decade in prison with clear conduct, has trained as a dental apprentice, participated in UNICOR, and is noted as being a reliable inmate capable of being assigned additional responsibilities. Most notably, Mr. Phelps's sentence would unquestionably be lower today under the First Step Act.

Writing for The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb parsed Trump's initial response further:

And so although I've always believed that he would make an outstanding Supreme Court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the Supreme Court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring — or at least increasing — the American people's confidence in our justice system.
His comments came amid a broader debate about U.S. politicians, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who identify as Catholic but pursue policies that conflict with Church teaching. Biden, during the campaign, reversed his decades-old position on the Hyde Amendment, which blocks most taxpayer funding for abortions. He's also pledged to codify Roe v. Wade, a move that conservatives say would allow abortion up till the moment of birth.
1969: Crosby, Stills & Nash Atlantic Records Nominees: Chicago, Led Zeppelin, The Neon Philharmonic and Oliver Call it one of the first super groups. David Crosby (The Byrds), Stephen Stills (Buffalo Springfield) and Graham Nash (The Hollies) were all part of popular bands before teaming to create the harmonies that make up CS&N. The trio's self-titled debut album, released in 1969, featured the songs Suite: Judy Blue Eyes and Marrakesh Express. A spot at Woodstock that year helped cement their place in history -- leading to the subsequent Best New Artist Grammy win. The trio would go on to perform with Neil Young as CSN&Y, and each member ended up pursuing solo careers over the years. Crosby, Stills & Nash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. You can still catch these guys on the road, as they tour fairly regularly.
SAGAL: This is very strange. In some way, Emmanuel Macron is President Trump's mere image. Trump is 70, the oldest American president ever. Macron is 39, the youngest French president ever. Macron, like Trump, is in a May-December marriage. Well, in Trump's case, it's more like May of the following year marriage. But in his case, Macron is the young one. Did you know this? When he was 16, he fell in love with his 40-year-old drama teacher.

Hillel Nahmad – President Trump granted a full pardon to Hillel Nahmad. This pardon is supported by members of his community. Mr. Nahmad was convicted of a sports gambling offense. Since his conviction, he has lived an exemplary life and has been dedicated to the well-being of his community.
Douglas Jemal – President Trump granted a full pardon to Douglas Jemal. Mr. Jemal is an American businessman and philanthropist credited with rebuilding many urban inner cities in the United States. In 2008, Mr. Jemal was convicted of fraud. In addition, Mr. Jemal was instrumental to various other charitable causes, including the rebuilding of churches prior to his conviction. Notably, at his trial the presiding judge told prosecutors that he thought it inconceivable to send Mr. Jemal to prison.

Jay Inslee Jay Inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 Biography Born and raised in Seattle, Inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Washington in 1973 and a J.D. from Willamette University College of Law in Oregon three years later. After working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the Washington House of Representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for Congress in 1992. Inslee represented the state's 4th Congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called Republican Revolution of 1994. During the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) director under President Clinton. Inslee ran for Congress again in 1998 and defeated a Republican incumbent in Washington's 1st Congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. During his congressional tenure, the Washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in Iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the American economy's reliance on fossil fuels. Inslee left Congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in Washington, defeating the state's Republican attorney general in the general election. After winning reelection in November 2016 -- the same time Mr. Trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- Inslee declared that Washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values.
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN: I think all of us pretty much know what the parameters of an agreement are.

O'DONNELL: Thank you. Thank you. We have a number of issues to discuss tonight, but I want to give the mayor an opportunity to respond, because she has raised concerns about women in your workplace.

He went to work for the city and advocated for a Phoenix law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The ordinance would apply to housing, employment and other public accommodations — just as the law already did for categories like race, sex, marital status and religion.
One of the thorniest cases involves Catholic Charities, whose agencies long have provided adoption and foster care services to children in need, including orphans. Under Catholic doctrine, the sacrament of marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman, and Catholic adoption agencies therefore have declined to place children with same-sex couples.

People often say that activists are cut off from the people. In Russia, there are millions of homosexuals, and almost none of them participate in [anti-Putin] demonstrations. Therefore, homosexuals support President Putin's towards LGBT people. Putin signs laws that serve the strengthen the moral and spiritual foundations of Russian society. Notable homosexuals are awarded with orders and medals. Many gay people in our country say, Putin is our President. Gays are for Putin!
There are similarities between Harris and Obama, to be sure. Both are Democrats, both have a background in law, both have a mixed-race background. There is an obvious convenience to the comparison. It neatly captures the public imagination at a time when Harris is yet to be world famous, but is charismatic, on the rise and prepared to challenge President Donald Trump, while Obama's name continues to conjure a nostalgic, anti-Trump emotion.
SHAW: Well, I think these conversations are good to have. I think they're important to have as we deepen our understanding of what our national values and principles are. The question to me isn't whether we have these conversations. It's how we have these conversations. And I guess what disturbs me - I know what disturbs me - is when some people are treated as if they are not legitimate members of our society. That troubles me and its tone and its tenor. So that's part of a larger problem that we're having as a nation in this strange time in which we find ourselves.

John Hickenlooper John Hickenlooper joins crowded 2020 race 04:09 Biography Former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper grew up outside of Philadelphia, the youngest of four children. He attended Wesleyan University and received a bachelor's in English and a master's degree in Geology. Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery with 15 brewpubs and restaurants, was a success, and it made him a millionaire. In 2003, Hickenlooper ran for Mayor of Denver, in his first ever campaign. Considered a bit of a dark horse candidate who never ran a negative ad, he shocked many and won in a landslide. In 2010, Hickenlooper became the first Denver Mayor elected Governor in 120 years. He was re-elected in 2014, running on another entirely positive campaign Hickenlooper is the second governor or former governor to announce a Democratic presidential bid this cycle, following Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Issues Finishing his second term in the statehouse, Hickenlooper was a popular, pro-business governor. He left Colorado with a strong economy and his tenure was marked by an emphasis on consensus-building. It's that record that he touted in h is campaign video.

For years, Biden supported the Hyde Amendment with the rationale that religious Americans shouldn't have to pay for procedures they fundamentally oppose. He similarly argued that Americans shouldn't be forced to embrace his faith's view of abortion. He appeared to personally flout church teaching, however, when he officiated a same-sex wedding ceremony in 2016. He also picked a Health and Human Services secretary who previously sued nuns for opposing Obamacare's contraception mandate.

GROVE: Thank you very much for having me.
KLOBUCHAR: Yes, and I think that what we need to do instead of just reviewing everything from the past is talk about where we're going to go forward. Martin Luther King once said that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that what affects one of us directly affects all of us indirectly. So when there is racism in the criminal justice system, then we need to fix it.

We had a very candid conversation. He's chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, so I assume that he either reads The Washington Post or listens to NPR, and I think had a pretty good sense of the posture that Majority Leader McConnell took immediately after Justice Scalia's passing — the notion that the Republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.
Cheney criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus, seeming to scorn the president's resistance to wearing a mask by tweeting a picture of her father wearing a face covering with the hashtag #realmenwearmasks. After Trump said I appreciate support from QAnon, the conspiracy theory group, Cheney called it a dangerous lunacy.
April Coots – President Trump commuted the sentence of April Coots. Ms. Coots has served more than 10 years of her 20-year sentence for a non-violent drug offense. Throughout her incarceration, she has been an exemplary inmate, obtained an HVAC license, and completed the PAWS apprenticeship program. During the 18 months before the trial, Ms. Coots started a business, completed her GED, and took two semesters of community college classes. Importantly, Ms. Coots has a supportive family and church community that will help her transition and create a stable network for her post-incarceration.
Not many people saw Kidman's mesmerizing portrayal of the photographer Diane Arbus in the boundary-breaking film Fur, or her turn as a grieving mother in Rabbit Hole, or as the traumatized grown-up daughter of self-involved artists in The Family Fang. But she has become one of the industry's most valuable and adventurous side players, a headliner who — Q Scores and likability be damned — leverages her gifts and box-office pull in service to pushing the art form forward. It should surprise no one that her upcoming projects include the edgy, feminist TV mystery series Top of the Lake and films with Sofia Coppola and the Greek provocateur Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster).

After longtime New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, Booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known Republican mayor in a special election. In 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the Senate. During his years in the Senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. Booker announced he was running for president on Feb. 1, 2019, the first day of Black History Month. Issues He has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the Senate. Pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the Marijuana Justice Act in the summer of 2017. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. The junior senator from New Jersey is one of the chief architects of the First Step Act, a landmark bill that President Trump signed into law in December after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in Congress, Booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.

Generations of LGBT people — including countless gay men — were branded criminals and sex offenders simply because they had consensual sex, Wiener said in a statement praising Newsom's actions. This was often life-ruining, and many languished on the sex offender registry for decades.
Like other conservative faiths, the Mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin.

Syrita Steib-Martin – President Trump granted a full pardon to Syrita Steib-Martin. This clemency is supported by Ben Watson formerly of the National Football League, Judge Sandra Jenkins of the Louisiana state courts, and Sister Marjorie Herbert, who serves as President and CEO of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans, among many others. Ms. Steib-Martin was convicted at the age of 19 and sentenced to 10 years in prison and nearly $2 million in restitution for the use of fire to commit a felony. After her release from prison, she became an advocate for criminal justice reform and founded Operation Restoration, which helps transition women prisoners after incarceration by providing education opportunities and job placement. With today's pardon, Ms. Steib-Martin is relieved of the crushing restitution she incurred at such a young age.
1992: Arrested Development Chrysalis Records/EMI Nominees: Billy Ray Cyrus, Sophie B. Hawkins, Kris Kross and Jon Secada Before Arrested Development became the name of a cult TV show, it was actually the name of an alternative hip-hop group formed in Atlanta in 1988. Arrested Development won two Grammy Awards in 1993 for Best New Artist and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. Rolling Stone also named Arrested Development Band of the Year in 1993, thanks to the group's debut album, 3 Years, 5 Months & 2 Days in the Life Of..., which spawned the catchy singles Tennessee, People Everyday and Mr. Wendel. The band is still together and has consistently released albums over the years, but none as successful as that first one.
Peter Van Sant: Is that frustrating?
During his second term, Inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, has challenged some of the Trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. In a campaign video focused on climate change, Inslee announced his White House bid on March 1. Issues Inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a Chinese hoax. He has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in Congress. With most 2020 Democrats throwing their support for the audacious Green New Deal proposal introduced by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among Democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. Inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. Controversy Inslee's tenures in Congress and as Washington's governor have largely been scandal-free.

Graham -- the son of preacher Billy Graham -- has called Islam evil, attacked laws increasing rights for transgender people, and told his followers that the legalization of same-sex marriage was orchestrated by Satan
Thanks to the Abel family's lobbying efforts, in 1994 Congress passed a law that allows for the U.S. prosecution of U.S. nationals who kill other Americans in foreign countries.
Well in fact, the American people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the United States with sufficient electoral votes. And they also decided that the Republicans would be in the majority. They didn't say, We're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. They said, No, you're the president for four years, and Mr. McConnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the Senate.
Following the death of the president, the First Presidency is automatically dissolved and the two counselors in the First Presidency return to positions of seniority in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In this situation, that would be President Henry B. Eyring and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, who served as Monson's two counselors since he assumed the Prophet role in 2008.
David Rowland – President Trump granted a full pardon to David Rowland. This pardon is supported by Senator Lindsey Graham. Mr. Rowland's asbestos removal license had lapsed when he agreed to remove asbestos found in an elementary school. He completed the work in compliance with all other regulations, but received 2 years' probation for a violation of the Clean Air Act. Mr. Rowland accepts responsibility and is remorseful. In addition, he has given back to his community by continuing to work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation after the completion of his mandatory community service.
Casey Urlacher – President Trump granted a full pardon to Casey Urlacher. This pardon is supported by his friends and family, and countless members of his community. Mr. Urlacher has been charged with conspiracy to engage in illegal gambling. Throughout his life, Mr. Urlacher has been committed to public service and has consistently given back to his community. Currently, Mr. Urlacher serves as the unpaid Mayor of Mettawa, Illinois. He is a devoted husband to his wife and a loving father to his 17-month old daughter.
I'm the last person in the world who's going to help the parties resolve their doctrinal differences, said Mr. Feinberg, who assisted in the church's mediation on a pro bono basis.
WARREN: I was mentioned in this.
Patrick turned down 48 Hours' request for an interview, saying Carolyn's murder was too painful to talk about. But on this day, her past was fast approaching.
CORKER: Well I mean this is an interesting point in time. Rules are being promulgated right now that affect all of these things. And the question is under current laws that have been passed, if they're fully in place, was this in fact a proprietary trade or not, which is something we don't want to see happening in these institutions, or was this really a legitimate hedge that would take place within an institution. We've been getting a lot of, you know, this has evolved.
We just had this chemistry that came instantly and for the last four years we have been building on that, Lipinski added. America has accepted us as the voices of figure skating.
If you can afford private school, great. If the public schools in your area are not yet polluted with social justice propaganda, great. But you must be prepared to home school because with the left emboldened and almost entirely in charge of academia, the last thing public schools will be teaching is reading, writing, and arithmetic.
Controversy Although he has a liberal voting record in the Senate and has been a staunch critic of the Trump administration, Booker has faced criticism from some progressives for receiving large donations from pharmaceutical corporations and banks. In what he touted as his Spartacus moment, Booker claimed to have released confidential committee documents during the contentious Senate confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His Republican colleagues accused him of grandstanding and said the documents had already been cleared. What Trump says In an exclusive interview with CBS News Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan the same day Booker announced his candidacy, President Trump said he thinks Booker has no chance in the 2020 election. When asked why, Mr. Trump replied: Because I know him. He has no chance. In a November interview with the New York Post, the president said Booker ran Newark into the ground and falsely accused him of not living in the city when he was mayor. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump claimed to know more about Booker than the New Jersey senator knew about himself. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself, Mr. Trump tweeted in July of that year.
I need to be busy because, like, I have so much energy, she said. I always thought the older I get, the more calm I'll get. I feel like it's kind of going opposite. I keep getting more energy. It's crazy.
The attention paid to Kramp-Karrenbauer's likeness to Merkel distracts from the future implications of her attitudes for the country, and indeed, Europe at large. Kramp-Karrenbauer is extremely conservative on same-sex marriage, and has likened it to incest in the past. Her stance on migration is also vastly stricter than Merkel's, and she has made it clear she is keen to dial down the more liberal attitude exhibited by the party in the last decade.
But in the opinion, Judge Britt Grant wrote that the ban on the controversial treatment infringes on therapists' First Amendment rights and that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. Judge Barbara Lagoa agreed with Grant, resulting in a split 2-1 decision.
It is a historical day and yes let's celebrate the whole weekend, said Sebastian Vetter.
So we go to this bakery a week ago to sign up for tasting and choose our wedding cake. The owner met with us today to set up the process, Del Rio wrote. Well this rude ass person says I will make your order but I don't condone same sex marriages and will have no part in this process. Oh but you want to take my order and give it another bakery so that bakery can do it.
O'DONNELL: ... and is promising to expunge the record of anyone who has been arrested for possession. As a former prosecutor, is that a a realistic promise?
According to CNN Philippines, in March he told Filipinos in Myanmar he was against same-sex marriage, and that recognizing marriages other than those between a man and a woman wouldn't be acceptable in Philippines, which is predominantly Catholic.

Experts say a chamber like this is what you use to test a nuclear weapon. And we talked to them. They confirmed that. Important to say, though, that this picture is not a picture that we have confirmed the authenticity of. There are, though, new signs that the economic sanctions against Iran are working. Take this story on the front page of today's Washington Post. Quote Iran unable to sell oil stores it on tankers. Literally they're storing it on tankers, turning off the GPS on the tankers so that -- because it's against maritime law to do so because they don't want anyone to know where the tankers are (INAUDIBLE) they're trying to sail into ports and just find anyone to buy their oil. So earlier today I spoke to Senator Dianne Feinstein. She is a key leader in the Senate on national security issues, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and I began by asking her what it will take to reach an agreement with Iran.
He plans to release them after Super Tuesday. It is not enough to be able to say, just trust me on this. We have a president who said he was going to release his taxes after the election and has refused to do this.

The measure did ultimately prevail. More than five years later, Mahoney said the law has made a huge difference in the lives of LGBTQ people.
Carr, of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, said he backed Biden, in spite of Biden's going along with the extremism of the Democratic Party on abortion.
Legislation either to uphold LGBT rights or to limit them in the name of protecting religious freedom has advanced in several states, and further court battles are likely.
SANDERS: I have condemned authoritarianism, whether it is the people in Saudi Arabia that the United States government...
BUTTIGIEG: All right, let's clear this up once and for all.
President Trump is said to be considering an executive order to bar the federal government from punishing people or institutions that support marriage exclusively as the union of one man and one woman. The language is similar to a bill expected to be reintroduced by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah called the First Amendment Defense Act.
I want to say something about foreign policy, which is this, we keep acting as if we're in the 20th Century or the 19th Century. If you look at the biggest threats to the United States, we're talking right now about coronavirus that cannot be solved within the borders of the United States. We're talking about climate change which is a global problem where we need U.S. leadership for countries around the world.
The government shouldn't be telling artists what they can and can't say, Breanna Koski, a co-owner of Brush & Nib, said. We're challenging this law not just for us, but for all artists to be able to create freely.

Bernie voted five times against the Brady Bill and wanted a waiting period...
-- Trump's assistant secretary of state in charge of European affairs, who has overseen U.S. relations with NATO and the European Union for the past 16 months, announced his resignation. He cited personal and professional reasons. Carol Morello reports: In September 2017, [A. Wess] Mitchell became one of the first assistant secretaries of state in the Trump administration confirmed by the Senate, and his departure creates another vacancy in the ranks of senior officials. Currently, six of the 24 spots have nominees awaiting Senate confirmation. … In an interview, Mitchell said his resignation is not a protest of the administration's policies or the direction of foreign policy, and he praised [Mike] Pompeo's leadership and vision.
MARTIN: You know, on the campaign trail last, year some might remember that President Trump - oh, then-candidate Trump - made certain statements that at least some gay and lesbian supporters took as assurances of his support for them. So how is his record now bearing out that point of view?
Desiree Perez – President Trump granted a full pardon to Desiree Perez. Ms. Perez was involved in a conspiracy to distribute narcotics. Since her conviction, Ms. Perez has taken full accountability for her actions and has turned her life around. She has been gainfully employed and has been an advocate for criminal justice reform in her community.
You never know entirely -- it's true. This could play out in a bad way for him or in a good way. Remember during the 1960 campaign -- we all read about, I should stress, wasn't actually playing attention then. We read about John F. Kennedy's outreach to Martin Luther King's family and the kind of surprising impact that that had. These social issues are not as straight and linear and easy to predict as sometimes the economic indicators are. So this will have ripples. But we don't know in which direction the ripples will go.
But I do think it's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives. The -- we are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that. But just a look what happened with smoking.
-- The D.C. Council voted to override Mayor Muriel Bowser's veto of a bill to decriminalize Metro fare evasion. Faiz Siddiqui reports: The 11-to-2 vote to override the veto — Bowser's second in office — means the legislation now heads to Congress for final review. … Bowser expressed concern about the impact the legislation could have on Metro's bottom line, arguing it could exacerbate the agency's revenue problems and create potential safety issues. … But the council overruled the mayor's objections and rejected her argument that lessening the penalties for fare-jumping would encourage potential lawlessness and make Metro less safe.
Last year, writing about actress Isabelle Huppert in the New Republic, the critic Miriam Bale noted that in the movie Elle, Huppert herself became an auteur, her craft and potent persona transcending the material and taking a hand in creating the movie that was every bit as crucial as the director's. The same, writ even larger, could be said for Kidman, whose shrewd auteurist eye is revealed not just in one movie but through the arc of her career. In an industry dedicated to escapism, shallow reassurance and dumbing down, she has single-mindedly pursued thoughtfulness, intelligence and risk, as an actor and a producer. (Check out the flawed, weird but wonderfully woman-centric erotic thriller In the Cut for an early example of the latter.)
We also, of course action heard from Air Force General Douglas Fraser, who testified on whether there was other terrorist activities going on in Mexico to get into the United States, and here's what he said.

Target's policy is consistent with the message and core values that it's been projecting for years, Melissa Arnoff, senior vice president at Levick, a communications firm specializing in crisis and issues management, said, noting the company's past support of same-sex marriage and parenting, and its decision last year to stop labeling toy aisles by gender.
BIDEN: Because I'm the only one that ever got it done nationally. I beat the NRA twice. I got assault weapons banned. I got magazines that could not hold more than 10 rounds in them. I got them eliminated. Except we had a thing called an election with hanging chads in Florida and it was not reauthorized.
WHITAKER: Thank you. Thank you, Senator.
With the surge has come scrutiny of keeping money off shore to avoid U.S. taxes, of offshoring too many jobs, of using materials like, which is sometimes mind by children. Apple said it's working to address some of these things. And it is a company seen as the best of America to children around the world.
1970: The Carpenters A&M Records Nominees: Elton John, Melba Moore, Anne Murray and The Partridge Family After a disappointing debut with the 1969 album Ticket to Ride, keyboardist Richard Carpenter and his sister, drummer Karen Carpenter, hit the big time with their second album, Close to You. Karen's mellow voice and Richard's arrangements produced such hits as the Burt Bacharach/Hal David song (They Long to Be) Close to You, We've Only Just Begun, and I'll Never Fall in Love Again. The Carpenters were nominated for eight Grammys in 1970 and won two (for Best New Artist and Best Contemporary Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus). Eight more albums followed, before Karen's tragic death in 1983, from complications arising from anorexia nervosa. Richard Carpenter continued as a solo artist, with the 1987 album, Time, and 1998's Pianist - Arranger - Composer - Conductor.
Women's rights groups are sounding the alarm about President Donald Trump's nominee to head a key federal agency charged with reducing violence against women.

The party just rolled out a censure resolution against Cindy McCain. Childish and bizarre, it attacks the wife of Arizona's beloved late (Republican) senator for having a past riddled with drug abuse. (She admitted three decades ago to a previous pain-medication addiction.)
There have been 16 presidents, including Monson, since the founding of the LDS Church by Joseph Smith in 1830.
I felt I was in a different role as his colleague, that I'm someone that has worked with him for a long time, there's a lot of trust there, and I felt it was best to handle it in that way, Klobuchar told CNN at the time about why she did not call on him to resign. Klobuchar has also faced scrutiny over several news reports detailing a pattern of abusive treatment towards her staff, which has reportedly hindered her efforts to recruit campaign personnel. What Trump says A few hours after her announcement, President Trump mocked Klobuchar for discussing efforts to mitigate climate change during a Midwestern snowstorm. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)! the president tweeted.
Even though lie detector tests are inadmissible in federal court, they are a tool used by investigators to confirm deception. Kathy Patrick willingly agreed to take one and answer questions about Carolyn's murder.
You get points just for showing up, Vander Plaats said. And so I think our audience would embrace them.
And let's turn to that confrontation between the Department of Justice and the state of North Carolina. Each filed lawsuits against the other yesterday over a law known as House Bill Two. That state law says government buildings plus public schools and universities must restrict bathrooms and locker rooms according to one's sex on a birth certificate. Yesterday, North Carolina's Republican Gov. Patrick McCrory announced his lawsuit, saying the Justice Department lacks the authority to intervene.
BUTTIGIEG: I'm proposing an education access...
Steven Benjamin Floyd – President Trump granted a full pardon to Steven Benjamin Floyd. This pardon is supported by Representative Mark Green. Mr. Floyd joined the United States Marines Corps at age 17 and earned a combat action ribbon in Iraq. He pled guilty to one count of bank robbery by extortion. Since his release from prison in 2009, Mr. Floyd has exemplified the power of second chances, and is raising a family and owns a successful car repair business. Mr. Floyd's dedication to service includes helping extinguish fires set during the recent unrest and repairing widows and disabled veterans' cars free of charge. President Trump thanks Mr. Floyd for his past military service and for his commitment to his community.
Trump was a hero to the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns running homes for the elderly, which challenged the federal requirement that insurance plans cover birth control. At Trump's renominating convention, a nun from the Little Workers of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary questioned Biden's religion and called Trump the most pro-life president.
Sorenson said she is unaware of any current research that supports the idea that a woman who resists with a weapon is less likely to be sexually assaulted.

Other parents agreed, insisting that the idea of gender fluidity didn't match the values of the vast majority of the town. They said discussing LGBTQ+ issues with kids could put ideas in their heads and argued that families — not schools — should be responsible for these conversations.
I have seen how teachers are expected to dip into their own pockets to furnish their classrooms. Teachers are being expected to handle the mental health challenges that their students are facing because we don't have an adequate mental health system to support kids.
Bercaw told the South Korean police, who brought in detectives from the U.S. Army.
People of faith were looking for a politician who would champion their religious faith, not change it.And while an exceptionally profane, likely unfaithful, thrice-married braggart who once publicly supported abortion (as Mark Hemingway calls him in the conservative Weekly Standard magazine this week) doesn't seem like the obvious candidate, Trump got the job.
Nicole Kidman. The name conjures many images and associations: the tumble of red curls and pert, blue-eyed face of the star as a young newcomer to the screen; the marriage to Tom Cruise and ensuing escape from Scientology; the lithe physique and dewy features that she wears easily to this day. But one phrase we often forget to attach to her is great actress.

The event has loomed large in past Republican caucus campaigns, drawing about 3,000 voters in 2015, when then-candidate Donald Trump famously criticized the late Republican Sen. John McCain's military service at the event.

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're listening to my interview with writer Alia Volz. Her new memoir describes her mother's successful business serving marijuana-laced brownies in the 1970s in San Francisco and her parents' relationship at a time of cultural and social change in the city. Volz's book is Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco.
VOLZ: OK. So this is kind of, I want to say, a ridiculous part of the story. Although, I think my parents would disagree. But my mom - both of my parents, actually, believed strongly in the occult and specifically the I Ching, which is a 4,000-year-old Chinese divination method rooted in Daoism and Confucianism. And you would consult it in the way that you might consult tarot cards. And my mom believed wholeheartedly in this practice.

Dr. Faustino Bernadett – President Trump granted a full pardon to Dr. Faustino Bernadett. In approximately early 2008, Dr. Bernadett failed to report a hospital kickback scheme of which he became aware. Notably, he was not part of the underlying scheme itself, and unaffiliated himself with the hospital shortly thereafter. This conviction is the only major blemish on Dr. Bernadett's record. Although now retired, Dr. Bernadett has spent the past year devoted to helping protect his community from COVID-19, including by: procuring PPE and medical supplies for nurses; advising hospitals on expanding patient capacity and continuing prenatal services; identifying care facilities for first responders and the homeless; providing meals and books to underprivileged students; funding online educational resources for a distressed Catholic elementary school in Dr. Bernadett's neighborhood; and helping to ensure that senior citizens maintain social connections by training volunteer callers to speak with nursing home residents. In addition, Dr. Bernadett has been deeply involved in philanthropic efforts in his community and he has supported numerous non-profits that provide help to underprivileged communities, support medical research, and promote youth education programs. President Trump determined that it is in the interests of justice and Dr. Bernadett's community that he may continue his volunteer and charitable work.
SHAW: Well, the state makes an argument, and how strong that argument is is up for grabs. The state cites federal court decisions that say that gender does not include sexual orientation or transgender and that transgender people are not a protected classification of people under federal civil rights laws. So - and it's part of the culture wars that have been going on. For people who are civil rights advocates, they've been clear for some time now that discrimination on the basis of who and what people are goes against our most basic and fundamental laws. And even the Supreme Court, which has been a conservative Supreme Court, has, of course, moved with respect to sexual orientation to ban discrimination in the context of marriage.
Speaking at the White House in July 2019, Trump said, Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly and Liz was right in the forefront of that one and I said, 'What do you think, Liz,' and you said, 'Absolutely, he deserves it,' and it's been a very popular pardon. At another event, Trump said that Liz Cheney was so dedicated — and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it. He called Cheney a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future.
It certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. And I said at the outset I would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base. I said I would play it straight — that my goal was to actually confirm a justice who I thought could do an outstanding job. And Merrick Garland fits that bill.
A good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a Supreme Court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the Republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.

ANDERSON COOPER, HOST, A.C. 360: Yes, Erin, we're in one of many refugee camps along the Turkish/Syrian border, now home to 23,000 Syrians -- men, women and children. The reason we came here is because for 14 months, the regime of Bashir al Assad has lied about what's happening in Syria. We came here because for 14 months, the regime of Bashir al Assad has tried to silence the voices of the people who are living in these camps and the people who have had to flee Syria.

Issues Klobuchar is a very active senator who is often willing to work on a bipartisan basis. As of December, Klobuchar has sponsored 111 pieces of legislation which have been signed into law. However, Klobuchar is also ideologically liberal on several issues. As a member of the Senate in 2009, Klobuchar voted to pass the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. She is pro-choice and supports LGBT rights. She also has an F rating from the National Rifle Association. Klobuchar is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and made a name for herself in 2018 for her calm yet incisive questioning of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearings investigating claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh in September. At one point, when asking if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he retorted: Have you? The moment quickly went viral, and Kavanaugh later apologized. Controversy Klobuchar was the sole senator from Minnesota during the resolution of the contested Senate election from January to July 2009, which Al Franken eventually won. When Franken was accused of sexual harassment in December 2017, Klobuchar did not call for Franken to step down, unlike many other senators. Franken resigned shortly after the allegations came to light.
My message is: toughen up. there are no safe spaces in the real world, he said. If you're going to be successful in this life after you leave college you've got to learn to embrace adversity and open yourself up to a litany of different opinions.

For all the bipartisan niceties of opening day, political reality settled in quickly. The House Appropriations Committee wasted no time brushing off the governor's proposed amendments to the state's $117 billion biennial budget.
According to a 2010 story in The Wall Street Journal, Judaism never took a stronghold in the New York mayor's own life, his advisers and other observers say. He believes in God, but is more likely to be found at church for a political event than temple for worship. He grew up among very few Jews in Medford, Massachusetts, but his family maintained some traditions, such as a kosher kitchen and Hebrew school.
You can choose to have whatever opinion you have on the president's statement today condemning white supremacists, but it's hard to believe he would have read it out if he'd had his druthers. No, the real Donald Trump was the one we saw on Saturday when he decided to condemn violence 'on many sides' in response to the deliberately provocative and intentionally violent neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia; when he decided to refer to the events as 'sad' in tweets; when he wished 'best regards' to those injured by the car that was deliberately smashed into them, killing 1 and injuring 20. When he acted in that way, he was operating according to his instinct. And his instinct said: Do not attack the white supremacists.
Pence, a conservative Christian, has opposed same-sex marriage throughout his career, as well as the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy.

On the Intelligence Committee, Swalwell has also strongly defended special counsel Robert Mueller's now-concluded investigation and voiced his concerns about the Trump campaign's contacts with people affiliated with the Russian government, including the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton during the summer of 2016. Issues Swalwell will look to make gun safety reform an integral part of his presidential campaign. He has been strongly critical of the National Rifle Association's (NRA) sway in Congress and has repeatedly lambasted Republicans for not supporting gun control measures. He is hosting a town hall on gun control in Florida Tuesday alongside survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre, in which 17 students and staff members were killed by a gunman. Last week, the California Democrat shared a voicemail his office received in which an individual is heard making a death threat against him because of his stance on gun rights. We're going to war. And you're going to be the first motherf***ing casualty, the person in the voicemail posted by Swalwell on Twitter is heard saying. In his post, Swalwell wrote, I'm not afraid of this guy.

-- The House overwhelmingly passed a bill aimed at preventing Trump from trying to pull out of NATO. Karoun Demirjian reports: The vast majority of House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the bill by a vote of 357 to 22, after members of both parties gave impassioned speeches for why the alliance was so vital to preserve and protect. 'Time and again the alliance has proven that the free peoples of the world are strongest when they stand together,' said Rep. Michael McCaul (Tex.), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He called the alliance 'a bulwark against international terror' and 'critical to our national security, and to the preservation of our military prowess around the world.'

Well, first of all, if you look at what Joe Biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a Supreme Court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.
Not a very convincing performance. Is there any other Amendment to the Constitution the president would downplay in this way? Saying, It's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th Amendment.
The committee then went on to consider a proposal from Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria) to remove the state's defunct gay-marriage ban from the state Constitution. The ban has been unconstitutional since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a right to marry nationwide. The plan from Ebbin, who in 2003 became the state's first openly gay legislator, would have put the matter to a referendum.

1963: The Swingle Singers CBS News Nominees: Vikki Carr, John Gary, The J's with Jamie, and Trini Lopez Formed by Ward Swingle in Paris, the Swingle Singers was comprised of French session artists who joined to perform jazz vocals. Their renditions of J.S. Bach fugues and The Well-Tempered Clavier as vocals, Jazz Sébastien Bach (released in the U.S. as Bach's Greatest Hits), won a Grammy for Best Performance by a Chorus, and also won the group Best New Artist. In the early 1970s the singers disbanded, but Ward Swingle re-formed the group in England with a new cast. Over the past half-century the Swingles' various iterations have released more than 50 recordings, won five Grammys, and had their music used in such disparate programs as Wedding Crashers and Sex and the City.

Trump has used the same playbook during confrontations with Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, South Korea, North Korea and the European Union in the past two years with mixed success. … It is a well-worn tactic from Trump's business career, but this is the first time the livelihoods of so many U.S. workers and households have hung in the balance as a result of it.

The left-wing Antifa and Black Lives Matter terrorists will probably try to attack the suburbs and Rural America in an indirect way — going after power stations and the like. And if things get bad enough in the cities, we might see supply chains interrupted, so be prepared.

A Democratic senator and Iraq War veteran reacted to the Supreme Court's decision on transgender troops:

-- Hundreds of IRS workers have gotten permission to skip work because of financial hardship, just as the tax season gets busy. Danielle Paquette, Lisa Rein, Jeff Stein and Kimberly Kindy report: The Trump administration last week ordered at least 30,000 IRS workers back to their offices, where they have been working to process refunds without pay. … But IRS employees across the country — some in coordinated protest, others out of financial necessity — won't be clocking in, according to Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, and several local union officials. The work action is widespread and includes employees from a processing center in Ogden, Utah, to the Brookhaven campus on New York's Long Island.
That passage appeared to refer to comments by Trump about the plight of Christians in the Middle East, and to remarks by Rudy Giuliani, who told Fox News that Trump had wanted to impose a Muslim ban but wanted advisers to find a way to do it legally. Immigrants rights advocates said Giuliani's words could offer them evidence to prove the administration had a discriminatory purpose.

2011: Bon Iver FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images Nominees: The Band Perry, J. Cole, Nicki Minaj and Skrillex Folk band Bon Iver, led by singer-songwriter Justin Vernon (left), had released two albums prior to its 2011 Best New Artist win. For Emma, Forever Ago, the band's debut, surfaced in 2007 -- four years before Bon Iver's sophomore effort, Bon Iver, Bon Iver. At the 2012 Grammy ceremony Bon Iver not only scooped up Best New Artist, but Bon Iver, Bon Iver also won Best Alternative Music Album. The track Holecene received nominations for both Song and Record of the Year. By the end of 2012, though, during a Bon Iver concert in Dublin, Ireland, Vernon announced it would be their last performance as a band ... at least for a while. It wasn't until 2016 that the band released a new album, 22, A Million, which would receive a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Music Album. Their next album, i,i, would be nominated for three Grammys, including Album of the Year.

AVLON: Well, look, follow the money. That's one of the tougher things to do, but certainly in this specific case calling for a hearing is a step in the right direction. The question is, is it not just about asking regulators what went wrong but bringing members of JPMorgan Chase and of course this is all complicated by the fact that JPMorgan Chase has been the responsible bank and they've been powerfully arguing against regulation, against the Volcker Rule. Well, that argument is going to be a lot tougher to make going forward as we find out this loss isn't two billion as they said last week, but now four billion perhaps or higher. This is a complicated position they find themselves in of their own making.

Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. – President Trump granted a full pardon to Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., also known as Lil Wayne. Mr. Carter pled guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, owing to a conviction over 10 years ago. Brett Berish of Sovereign Brands, who supports a pardon for Mr. Carter, describes him as trustworthy, kind-hearted and generous. Mr. Carter has exhibited this generosity through commitment to a variety of charities, including donations to research hospitals and a host of foodbanks. Deion Sanders, who also wrote in support of this pardon, calls Mr. Wayne a provider for his family, a friend to many, a man of faith, a natural giver to the less fortunate, a waymaker, [and] a game changer.

-- Trump is preparing two versions of his State of the Union address, even if Nancy Pelosi declines to invite him to the House chamber and he is forced to give the speech somewhere else. Seung Min Kim reports: The administration is trying to conduct advance work to prepare for an address in the House chamber, originally scheduled for Jan. 29, even though Pelosi has the power to determine whether Trump can do so. … It's unclear what options for venues the White House is exploring aside from the House chamber, where State of the Union addresses have been delivered since President Woodrow Wilson's speech in 1913. On Tuesday, the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said Trump called him to thank him for offering the Raleigh legislature as a venue. Trump told Moore in the phone call Monday evening, which lasted for about 10 minutes, that his staff was still determining where the address would be delivered. Trump also called Lee Chatfield, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, who similarly offered up the chambers in Lansing.

Jessica Frease – President Trump granted a full pardon to Jessica Frease. This pardon is supported by Governor Kristi Noem, South Dakota State Senator Lynne Hix-DiSanto, the United States Probation Officer responsible for Ms. Frease's supervision, and many in her community.

Upon her arrest, however, she immediately relinquished the stolen funds to the authorities. After serving her two year sentence, she was granted early termination of her supervised release due to her commendable conduct. Currently, Ms. Frease is studying to become an Emergency Medical Technician and devotes her time and energy to raising funds for cancer patients.

Isaac Nelson – President Trump commuted the sentence of Isaac Nelson. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Nelson is serving a mandatory 20 year sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of 5 kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. Following the First Step Act's changes to the definition of serious drug felony, Mr. Nelson would no longer receive a mandatory minimum term of 20 years' imprisonment. Instead, he would likely face a 10-year sentence. He has already served more than 11 years in prison. Throughout his incarceration, he appears to have demonstrated commendable adjustment to custody.
Your children are the ultimate … collateral damages. They are casualties of your actions, the judge said. But you did that, not this court.

So the question you have to ask yourself is, how do we change the Senate of the United States in a material way? And there are two things. That's why I am for term limits of 12 years for every congressperson and senator, to change who's in charge, to get rid of Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz.
The Supreme Court's decision to decline the Trump administration's request for an expedited review of DACA weakened the president's hand: If the court sticks to its normal procedures, even accepting the case at a later date would probably mean the justices would not hear arguments until the court's new term starts in October. That would probably keep the program in place until at least next year. With the court seemingly keeping the program safe for at least a year, Trump's offer to suspend his efforts to end it became less appealing to lawmakers who were already skeptical.
But can you blame the Republicans who look at this nomination and say, There's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court. So can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win the presidential nomination [sic]. And if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the Democrats do the same? They called — they're all already calling it the Biden rule.

Drew Brownstein – President Trump granted a full pardon to Drew Brownstein, who, other than this conviction, was described by his sentencing judge as someone who goes out of his way to help people that are less fortunate. This pardon is supported by the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, and several of Mr. Brownstein's friends and family. Mr. Brownstein was convicted of insider trading and has since paid his fines and forfeitures in full. Both before and after his conviction, Mr. Brownstein has volunteered extensively as a youth coach with the Boys & Girls club in Denver and the Jewish Family Services of Colorado.

-- The Trump administration asked the court to accelerate the review of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Barnes reports: Last week, U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman of New York ordered the administration to stop its plans to add the question to the survey. Furman said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross broke a 'veritable smorgasbord' of federal rules by overriding the advice of career officials who said including the citizenship question was likely to cut down the response rate and make the census less accurate. Normally, the Justice Department's next stop would be the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. But Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said that would not leave enough time for a final ruling from the Supreme Court. 'The government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of June 2019 to enable it to be printed on time,' he told the court.
Other judges have faced consequences for similar stances on L.G.B.T. issues. A judge in Wyoming was censured in March for refusing to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies, and an Alabama judge was suspended in September for ordering probate judges to defy federal orders to issue marriage licenses.

'The Stop STUPIDITY Act takes the aggressive but necessary step of forcing the president and Congress to do the jobs they were elected to do,' Warner said in a statement. ... The full name of Warner's measure is the 'Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act.'

The strongman style of leadership is not new, of course, and it is not always obvious who is inspiring whom. But in interviews on four continents, diplomats, rights activists and foreign officials said that after two years of Trump using the world's most powerful megaphone to cheer authoritarians, bully democratic allies and denigrate traditional American values, the impact on how others govern is becoming clear.

New Oregon legislation would put a moratorium on building mega-dairies. What happens next?  by The Counter's H. Claire Brown: Advocates worry that Biden's selection of former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to lead the Department of Agriculture may signal a reticence to take bold action to regulate factory farms because the agency under Obama ultimately did little to curb emissions or blunt the power of the biggest meatpacking companies.
VOLZ: To an extent. My parents weren't trying to scare me with it. But from a practical standpoint, they needed me to understand that what we were doing was illegal and that if I told anyone, including other children - who might tell an adult - it could have very serious consequences for our family. So I did know from the very beginning that if I told anyone what my parents really did that they could go to prison.

By hitching itself to a progressive image, Starbucks may cause consumers to be more critical of it because they're likely to expect actions that match its rhetoric. There's some sense of betrayal, Marzilli said.
DICKINSON: Contractors at Los Alamos made the big switch recently from clay-based litter to the organic green kind. And like so many well-intentioned ideas, this one blew up, literally, in a mini mushroom cloud of blame.
But with few exceptions, Republicans sat stone-faced as Northam called for dialogue about gun safety and ending the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court costs. His call to allow early voting seemed to fall especially flat on that side of the aisle, particularly as he tied prohibitive barriers to voting to the state's history of slavery. So did his call to add language to the state code declaring that a woman has the fundamental right to make her own health-care decisions.

His stump speech revolves largely around faith, freedom and democracy. He's also consistent about stressing that his campaign aims to build a sense of belonging, and he has a collection of anecdotes about how his campaign has emphasized that idea to its supporters.
Monstsho Eugene Vernon – President Trump commuted the sentence of Monstsho Eugene Vernon. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Vernon has served over 19 years in prison for committing a string of armed bank robberies in Greenville, South Carolina. Evidence showed that numerous of these offenses involved him carrying BB guns rather than genuine firearms. While incarcerated, Mr. Vernon has worked steadily, programmed well, and recovered from a bout of cancer.

If she does, the comparisons between the two are likely to reignite. As with May and Kramp-Karrenbauer, those watching would do better to pay attention to the political landscape Harris is working within now, rather than any nostalgic connotations. The president whose footsteps are most pertinent to Harris, the president who she will be measured against should she prevail against her fellow Democratic candidates, is Donald Trump.

1977: Debby Boone Warner Brothers Nominees: Stephen Bishop, Shaun Cassidy, Foreigner and Andy Gibb Debby Boone's pop single You Light Up My Life, was perched at Number 1 on the Billboard charts for 10 weeks in 1977. Having won Best New Artist, her recording career would encompass country and inspirational, winning Grammys for With My Song and Keep The Flame Burning (with Phil Driscoll). After bowing out of recording to raise her family, Boone returned with 2005's Reflections if Rosemary, a tribute album dedicated to her mother-in-law, singer Rosemary Clooney, who'd died in 2002. In 2011 Boone recorded an album of standards, Swing This!

By objecting to electoral slates, members are unavoidably asserting that Congress has the authority to overturn elections and overrule state and federal courts, she wrote in the memo, which she released last week. Such objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the President and bestowing it instead on Congress. This is directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans.
Less than two weeks after his inauguration, and only hours after Yates sent a message to department lawyers announcing that she would not defend Trump's order restricting travel and immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the new president removed the nation's top law enforcement officer in a move not seen since the Nixon era.
Tonight, we want you to hear their voices. We want you to see their faces and hear their stories and hear what they have had to live through for the last 14 months. The children that they have seen arrested by the regime, tortured by the regime, parents who got the mangled bodies of their children return to them in the dead of night. Children who have seen their parents shot to death on the streets of Syria simply for asking for reforms, asking for basic freedom that we all take for granted.

-- Former White House communications aide Cliff Sims recounts in his new tell-all that the president offered NASA all the money you could ever need to get an astronaut to Mars during his first term. New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi reports: The day of [Trump's televised call to the International Space Station in 2017], Sims conducted a final briefing in the Private Dining Room with Trump, [Betsy] DeVos, [astronaut Kate] Rubins, and Robert Lightfoot Jr., the acting NASA administrator. … Lightfoot explained to the president — who, again, had recently signed a bill containing a plan for Mars — that NASA planned to send a rover to Mars in 2020 and, by the 2030s, would attempt a manned spaceflight. … Sims wrote that [Trump] leaned in toward Lightfoot and made him an offer. 'But what if I gave you all the money you could ever need to do it?' Trump asked. 'What if we sent NASA's budget through the roof, but focused entirely on that instead of whatever else you're doing now. Could it work then?'
The president has torn that to shreds. And so the first thing we've got to do is restore the credibility of the United States.
Gabbard also clashed with Hillary Clinton shortly before a Democratic primary debate in November. The former secretary of state suggested the congresswoman was being groomed by Russia.

Anthony Levandowski – President Trump granted a full pardon to Anthony Levandowski. This pardon is strongly supported by James Ramsey, Peter Thiel, Miles Ehrlich, Amy Craig, Michael Ovitz, Palmer Luckey, Ryan Petersen, Ken Goldberg, Mike Jensen, Nate Schimmel, Trae Stephens, Blake Masters, and James Proud, among others. Mr. Levandowski is an American entrepreneur who led Google's efforts to create self-driving technology. Mr. Levandowski pled guilty to a single criminal count arising from civil litigation. Notably, his sentencing judge called him a brilliant, groundbreaking engineer that our country needs. Mr. Levandowski has paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to advance the public good.

Gabbard's announcement comes as the coronavirus pandemic drastically changes the presidential race and other 2020 campaigns. The leading Democratic candidates — Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — have been forced to suspend typical campaign fixtures such as rallies and door-to-door campaigning as cases of the disease have been reported in all 50 states.
The bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. The real argument is the one that you made, Nina, which is that they don't want a Democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a Democrat to fill the seat.

The onus is on Starbucks to follow through with things its CEO talked about, Marzilli said. The store closing is a manifestation of that, but the downside is the end of May is a long way away. That's a lot of time for people to fill out that space with another narrative before Starbucks can implement that day of training.
Paul Erickson – President Trump has issued a full pardon to Paul Erikson. This pardon is supported by Kellyanne Conway. Mr. Erickson's conviction was based off the Russian collusion hoax. After finding no grounds to charge him with any crimes with respect to connections with Russia, he was charged with a minor financial crime. Although the Department of Justice sought a lesser sentence, Mr. Erickson was sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment—nearly double the Department of Justice's recommended maximum sentence. This pardon helps right the wrongs of what has been revealed to be perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American History.

BRENNAN: Yeah. Yeah. I was doing - I didn't - someone came to my show in Chicago and a woman didn't know what the premise of the show was, so she went on my Instagram, my Facebook and my Twitter during the show and was basically like, dude, you got to stop doing this emotional stuff, thinking that I would somehow, like, get a note on stage and be like, you know what?

I can't think of a single civil rights law that doesn't have some people who are unhappy about it, says Karen Narasaki, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.

On Tuesday, Arizona Central reported the text of the draft resolution to censure and dissolve any connections between the Republican Party and McCain:
Now what is true, Nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice Scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. And so I understand the politics that Republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.
Greg Reyes – President Trump granted a full pardon to Greg Reyes. This pardon is supported by Shon Hopwood, former United States Attorney Brett Tolman, and numerous others. Mr. Reyes was the former CEO of Brocade Communications. Mr. Reyes was convicted of securities fraud. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, threw out his convictions, finding prosecutorial misconduct. He was later retried, convicted, and sentenced to 18 months in Federal prison. Mr. Reyes has accepted full responsibility for his actions and has been out of prison for more than 8 years.
Controversy Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail, Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a progressive prosecutor. If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past, wrote law professor Lara Bazelon in an opinion piece for The New York Times. What Trump says Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris, the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018, the White House Twitter account wrote, @SenKamalaHarris, why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does. Harris has said that lawmakers need to reexamine the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

-- In a divorce filing, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) alleges that her husband mentally and emotionally abused her — and even once physically assaulted her. The Des Moines Register's Luke Nozicka and Linh Ta report: 'We went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage,' Ernst wrote [in her affidavit]. 'I very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical.' Joni Ernst said she fled to her mother's house with her daughter in the middle of the night. Gail Ernst followed soon after, crying and apologizing, according to her affidavit. The next day, a victim's advocate at the courthouse performed an examination of Ernst's throat and head, she said; the advocate wanted to take Ernst to the hospital, according to the court filing. Ernst declined, writing that she was 'embarrassed and humiliated' and did not want people to know about what she described as an assault.

Despite personal reservations, she promised to defend the death penalty in California as attorney general, and proved herself an often harsh prosecutor, favoring long periods of imprisonment.

Still, while consumers' perception of Target fell to an eight-month low after the retailer found itself in the headlines, it's doubtful the company will remain a focus of the story, Marzilli said. Any negative impact is likely to pale in comparison to the retailer's effort to regain consumers' trust after a security breach compromised customer information in late 2013. That was a much, much bigger deal, he said.

Adrianne Miller – President Trump commuted the remaining sentence of Adrianne Miller. This commutation is supported by former U.S. Attorney Brett Tolman and the Clemency for All Non-Violent Drug Offenders (CAN-DO) Foundation. Ms. Miller has served 6 years of a 15-year sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and possession of a list I chemical. Ms. Miller, who has struggled with drug addiction, has fully committed to rehabilitation while in prison. In addition, she has taken numerous courses including drug education, life management, and has participated in the Life Connections Program, an intensive, multi-phase re-entry program offered by the Bureau of Prisons. She is extremely remorseful, regrets her destructive choices and has taken full responsibility for her actions.

Consider the question of whether respondents think racial and ethnic diversity is good, bad or makes no difference. Nearly 6 in 10 white males who are in Generation Z hold the view that racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing, vs. fewer than 4 in 10 white males born before 1946 (the Silent Generation, per Pew's labels). The drop-off is similar across Gen Z groups, but only among white men are the oldest members more likely to say diversity makes little difference than that it's a good thing.

Los Angeles -- A federal judge in California ruled Thursday that a twin son of a gay married couple has been an American citizen since birth, handing a defeat to the U.S. government, which had only granted the status to his brother. The State Department was wrong to deny citizenship to 2-year-old Ethan Dvash-Banks because U.S. law does not require a child to show a biological relationship with their parents if their parents were married at the time of their birth, District Judge John F. Walter found.

'Congressman, do you think it's appropriate to fly first class while 57 TSA agents aren't being paid?' the person says to Rep.

Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders on 2020: We're going to win 04:49 Biography Although he has spent most of his adult life in Vermont, Bernie Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, in 1941, as part of a religiously observant Jewish family. He attended one year at Brooklyn College before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating in 1964. At the University of Chicago, Sanders began his long career of political activism as a member of the university's chapters of the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He was also an active member of the antiwar movement, and applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. He moved to Vermont in 1968. Sanders ran for governor of Vermont unsuccessfully in 1972 and 1976, and for senator in 1972 and 1974, as part of the independent Liberty Union Party. He was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont, in 1980 as an independent, and served as mayor until 1989. He was elected to the House of Representatives as an independent in 1990, where he served until he was elected to the Senate in 2006. Although technically still an independent, he caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and is seen as a leader of the party's resurgent left wing. Sanders unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2016. However, he inspired a grassroots movement with his focus on economic inequality and use of primarily small-dollar donations to fund his campaign.

In 2011, just 30 percent of evangelical voters believed that an elected official who committed an immoral act in their personal life had the ethical character to hold public office. By October 2016—on the eve of their massive turnout on behalf of p***y-grabbing Donald Trump, that number was up to 72 percent, according to a survey conducted by PRRI and the Brookings Institution.

-- The South Carolina primary is taking on outsize significance in the 2020 Democratic nominating fight. The New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Astead W. Herndon report: The primary here may still be 405 days away and only fourth on the calendar of early-nominating states, behind Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. But at a time when [Trump] has stoked racial divisions and black voters have become an increasingly crucial Democratic constituency, South Carolina is already looming larger at the outset of this race than in any recent Democratic nominating contest. … The winner here will enter the March 3 Super Tuesday contests with a burst of momentum.

Wanda Abel: The U.S. attorney in Washington state said, No, you can't arrest her because she hasn't committed a crime in the United States. …there was no jurisdiction to arrest her for murder … And that's what pushed my family to say, Wait a minute. This isn't right.
Less than 24 hours later, law enforcement officials tracked down Conditt through a variety of techniques and identified the young man from Pflugerville as the suspect.

BLOOMBERG: Yes, she's -- I'm sorry, but, unfortunately, she's misinformed on red-lighting. You can go back and look at the record. I fought against it before '08, the crisis, during '08, and after that. Red-lining is not the problem with the mortgage market, but it was a problem for the communities where it was done, and we stopped that.
5. Increasing migration and urbanization of populations are further straining the capacities of governments around the world and are likely to result in further fracturing of societies, potentially creating breeding grounds for radicalization. Pressure points include growing influxes of migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons fleeing conflict zones; areas of intense economic or other resource scarcity; and areas threatened by climate changes, infectious disease outbreaks, or transnational criminal organizations. All of these issues will continue to drive global change on an unprecedented scale.

Making public colleges and universities tuition-free.

-- A group representing FBI agents issued a report saying the shutdown is affecting investigations on child trafficking, terrorism and more. The New York Times's Katie Benner reports: Because of the shutdown, the F.B.I. has been unable to issue grand jury subpoenas and indictments in several cases cited in the report. An agent working on an MS-13 investigation that has gone on for more than three years and resulted in 23 gang indictments for racketeering, murder and money laundering has been hamstrung by his inability to pay for an interpreter who can communicate with his Spanish-speaking informants, the report said. The bureau has also not been able to pay its informants, an important source of intelligence in terrorism, narcotics, gang, illegal firearm and other national security cases. The F.B.I. could lose those informants. (Read the full 72-page report here.)

Rodney Nakia Gibson – President Trump commuted the sentence of Rodney Nakia Gibson. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. In 2009, Mr. Gibson was convicted of trafficking drugs. Mr. Gibson is a first time, non-violent offender who has been a model inmate for more than 11 years in custody. In addition, he has maintained clear conduct and works with other inmates to help them obtain the important benefits of a GED. He has an impressive list of programming accomplishments, including apprenticeships and professional certifications which will readily translate into employable skills upon release. Mr. Gibson accepts responsibility for his actions.

And so, you're right, Nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following Supreme Court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. But people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. And this becomes I think a symbol of a process that, if Republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're Democrats or Republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the Senate.
-- Ocasio-Cortez Builds a National Platform, but a District Office? Not Open Yet, by the New York Times's J. David Goodman: In three short weeks in office, [Ocasio-Cortez] has shaped a national conversation on taxation, emerged as the face of a green jobs plan in Washington and elevated her initials into a worldwide brand. But she has not yet opened an office in her own New York City district — a delay that may give a sense of her priorities early in her tenure. During an appearance on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' on Monday, she blamed the government shutdown. … But the shutdown has not had a similar effect on other first-term Congress members from New York State.

-- BuzzFeed obtained documents outlining detailed plans for Trump Tower Moscow, contradicting comments from Trump and his allies that the proposal fizzled in its earliest stages. BuzzFeed News's Azeen Ghorayshi reports: The plan was dazzling: a glass skyscraper that would stretch higher than any other building in Europe, offering ultra-luxury residences and hotel rooms and bearing a famous name. Trump Tower Moscow, conceived as a partnership between [Trump's] company and a Russian real estate developer, looked likely to yield profits in excess of $300 million. … On Monday, Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said 'the proposal was in the earliest stage,' and he went on to tell the New Yorker that 'no plans were ever made. There were no drafts. Nothing in the file.' However, hundreds of pages of business documents, emails, text messages, and architectural plans, obtained by BuzzFeed News over a year of reporting, tell a very different story. Trump Tower Moscow was a richly imagined vision of upscale splendor on the banks of the Moscow River. …

Tim Ryan Biography Ryan was born and raised in northeastern Ohio in 1973. He played football in high school and was recruited to play for Youngstown State University. Because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to Bowling Green State University, near Toledo. After graduating from college, Ryan earned a J.D. from the University of New Hampshire and worked in the office of longtime Ohio Congressman James Traficant, who was expelled from the House after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. At age 26, Ryan was elected to Ohio's state senate. When his old boss Tradicant became embroiled in scandal, Ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. At 29, he was the youngest member of Congress when he was sworn in 2003. Although he has served eight terms in the House, Ryan gained notoriety following Mr. Trump's unexpected election in November 2016. Citing Democrats' loss of Midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- Ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy Pelosi, then House Minority Leader. After Democrats retook control of the House during the 2018 November midterm elections, the Ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace Pelosi. Ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel. Rep.

BURNETT: And one thing that could make you very nervous, Michael Waldman, is what came out of this same poll in terms of independents. Mitt Romney now leads independents, according to the CBS poll, by 43 percent to 36 percent. That's well -- that's no margin of error.

SANDERS: In the White House today -- in the White House today, we have a self-described great genius -- self-described -- and this great genius has told us that this Coronavirus is going to end in two months. April is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined -- I wish I was kidding; that is what he said.

NPR spoke with other LGBTQ+ students who agree with Robinson. Most wanted to remain anonymous because they aren't out to their parents, but they described Willing to Wait as having religious undertones and being shame-based. One student said it left her feeling dirty. Another said, The only thing we learned about gay sex was it gives you STDs and you shouldn't do it.
And I think he is convinced that he can do a really good job, partly because he has relationships with the judges that are already on the court, and he's shown himself to be a consensus builder. And he believes, rightly, that we're at a time where the more consensus we can forge, the better off we're going to be.
BLOOMBERG: I got into this race only 10 or 12 weeks ago, we have been working on our tax returns, I've said they will be out. We probably have another couple of weeks left to go. We're doing it as fast we can. We've complied with every single requirement for disclosure. And when I was mayor of New York, we had our tax returns out twelve years in a row and we will do that in the White House.
Peter Van Sant: And do you get a chance to question each of them?

I think character matters, competence matters and treating people with respect matters, Carr said. Lifting up the poor and vulnerable matters, and Trump failed those tests for me.
It admonishes her for supporting leftist causes such as gay marriage. It scolds her for endorsing Biden, in direct opposition to … the Constitution. It upbraids her for objecting to Trump's criticism of her husband — and then it repeats such slander, saying the late senator, a war hero and POW, committed serious wrongdoing during his military service.

Varadkar — one of only a handful of openly gay world leaders — spoke about the changes he's seen in his country on LGBTQ issues and his desire for other places around the world to follow Ireland's lead.

It doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is, says Cooper. The bottom line is that abstinence is the best and only proven way to keep yourself from getting a sexually transmitted infection or from getting pregnant. And so whether you're straight or trans or bi, the message is the same.

In a piece for Commentary Magazine, John Podhoretz, a former speechwriter for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, cast a skeptical eye toward Trump's remarks on Monday:
Rippon became the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics and the first out figure skater overall to medal as he aided Team USA's bronze medal finish at the free skate competition Monday. Eric Radford then became the first openly gay figure skater to win an Olympic gold medal as he and Meagan Duhamel helped Canada win the team figure skating event.
GREENE: Well, professor, if I might just ask you about an opinion piece that you wrote for the Charlotte Observer, you said your vision for civil rights has shifted over time and that there was a time when you would've watched from the sidelines discrimination against LGBT people and thought that it wasn't your battle. What's changed now?
If elected, Senator Sanders, you would be America's first Jewish president. You recently called a very prominent, well-known American Israel lobby a platform for, quote, bigotry. What would you say to American Jews who might be concerned you're not, from their perspective, supportive enough of Israel? And specifically, sir, would you move the U.S. embassy back to Tel Aviv?
BURNETT: Jay, how big of a risk is this, the Hezbollah or other terrorist activities could be working with drug cartels to get into the United States?
-- Behind the scenes, Trump's communications team is struggling to convey a consistent message on the shutdown amid an ongoing power struggle. CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak report: The lack of a cohesive strategy emanating from the White House communications team has frustrated people throughout the West Wing who have deemed the press shop 'irrelevant' ... according to interviews with several current and former White House officials. No one has emerged as the clear leader among Sarah Sanders, Bill Shine, Kellyanne Conway or Mercedes Schlapp, leading to deep divisions among one of the administration's most fractious departments and causing a void for a coverage-obsessed president. The communications team has also drawn the ire of dozens of senior staffers, including Trump at times, who have blamed them for failing to blunt PR missteps and allowing them to turn into full-blown disasters.
The successes in this past year have come about not because I, or you legislators, did something individually — but because we worked together, he said. When we work together and help provide a strong foundation for Virginians, our families and businesses thrive.
SAGAL: Emmanuel Macron, the new president, he's a rich businessman who has never held office before. And he ran for the presidency saying that politicians have failed the people, and it was time to return when France was great. All true. He's just like Donald Trump, except Macron can speak better English.
And I have confidence that — without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case — he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the Constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.
The president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence, Cheney said in the statement. He did not.

Amy Klobuchar Klobuchar announces 2020 presidential bid 25:20 Biography Amy Klobuchar was born in Plymouth, Minnesota, in 1960. Klobuchar has written about her troubled family life as a child in her book, The Senator Next Door: A Memoir from the Heartland. Her father, Jim, was an alcoholic who frequently spent time away from family and was arrested for drunk driving. He and Klobuchar's mother, Rose, divorced when Klobuchar was 15. The divorce took a toll on her family, causing her younger sister, Beth, to drop out of high school. Although Klobuchar's parents reconciled a few years later, she has written that her relationship with her father was not repaired until he quit drinking in the 1990s. Klobuchar attended Yale University and University of Chicago Law School. She returned to Minnesota after graduating and worked for a private law firm. Her experience of being forced to return to work one day after giving birth inspired her to become politically active and advocate for a maternity leave bill in the state legislature. Klobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998. She was first elected to the Senate in 2006, and won re-election in 2012 and 2018. Klobuchar and her husband, John Bessler, have one daughter. Bessler is a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. The three-term Minnesota senator launched her presidential campaign on Feb. 10 under frigid temperatures and relentless snowfall in Minneapolis.

Pacquiao had responded to an inquiry from the TV5 network in which they asked celebrities about same-sex marriage, which he opposes. He asserted, It's just common sense. Have you seen any animal having male-to-male or female-to-female relations? Adding that even animals understand gender differences, he opined, if you have male-to-male or female-to-female [relationships], then people are worse than animals.
The denomination uses an internal judicial system with judges and trials led by clergy. In 2019, the church adopted new penalties, effective Jan. 1: The mandatory penalty for officiating a same-sex marriage would be a year's suspension without pay, and a second conviction would mean a pastor would be defrocked.
SIEGEL: Now, if President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland had been confirmed, that would've made an immediate difference in the ideological makeup of the court. But that's not going to be so with this nomination, now that Trump is going to be president, whoever it ends up being, right?
That's why he should have been impeached. They covered it up. And I was years before these people. There's something wrong here. We're under attack, and they're not doing a darn thing about it.

Good evening, everyone and OUTFRONT tonight we have breaking news. The market today dropped about 125 points, thanks to Greece and JPMorgan. Deepening trading losses at the bank today. The total losses for America's biggest bank, at this moment we can tell you could now be $4 billion. Just on Friday we were telling you it was only three billion and you may have seen reports the day before that it was two billion. And JPMorgan is about to face a firing squad here in Washington. At the bank today heads started to roll.

ACOSTA: Well, you know, but let's understand one thing. The guns were going into Mexico way before Fast and Furious occurred, whether we would have had Fast and Furious or not. I think that the -- frankly, the Mexican government needs to stand up and stop blaming the United States for arming them.
Mr. President, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.
I worked in the projects, I came along, and the first thing I did as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, extended the Voting Rights Act eventually for 25 years. And I have been deeply involved. And my first effort I had as a councilman was doing away with red-lining in the county.

SAGAL: That was scary good. On Tuesday afternoon, the president fired James Comey, the head of the FBI. He did this, the White House said, because Mr. Comey had treated Hillary Clinton so unfairly. And if there's one thing we know about Donald Trump, when there's a woman being mistreated, he won't be far away.
-- Ocasio-Cortez a popular choice for president — even though she's too young to serve, by John Wagner: A new poll finds that 74 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults would consider voting for [Ocasio-Cortez] for president if they could. For now, they can't. Ocasio-Cortez, who last year became the youngest woman elected to Congress, is 29. Under the Constitution, you must be at least 35 to be president. The Axios-SurveyMonkey poll highlights the splash that Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, has made since her arrival this month on Capitol Hill. The 74 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults who say they would vote for her for president includes 17 percent who say they would 'definitely' do so.
CORKER: So I think what we need to do is understand you know how this -- how this occurred. It was all on the banking side, not on the investment bank side. And do we have policies that appropriately deal with this? So this is, again, very unique, very specific, very complex.
When I asked McConnell how he felt about his legacy and Trump's being so closely linked, he rejected the premise. 'I don't think so,' he said.

'I think that's the most consequential thing I've ever done.'

MARTIN: So in this country, laws saying you can't discriminate against people and offering public services were very hard won, as I think many people will remember. But they've been on the books for decades, so I think some people might ask, why is this any different from someone who is refusing to serve black people at a lunch counter, for example, or at a restaurant? What's the difference?
The difference is already clear in policy.

The ramifications of the General Conference action are not yet fully evident, but fractures are likely — between progressive clergy and conservative laity, between young and old church members, and between Methodists in the United States and those in Africa, Asia and other parts of what's known as the Global South, mostly less-developed countries where conservative social views and a more strict interpretation of the Bible are prevalent.

Cassandra Ann Kasowski – President Trump commuted the sentence of Cassandra Ann Kasowski. Notably, her warden recommended her for home confinement under the CARES Act. Ms. Kasowski has served more than7 years of a 17 year sentence for a non-violent drug offense. She has been an exemplary inmate and has worked extensively, including as a part of the PAWS program and in UNICOR. Upon her release, she plans to spend time with her son and seek employment.

So there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing.
Values-based investing is growing in popularity, where investment strategies are tied to investors' core beliefs. This can be broken down in a variety of ways: sustainable, responsible and impact investing (SRI) excludes companies from an investment portfolio that do not align with core values, such as the environment or corporate governance practices. Impacting investing is similar, but tracks the progress of these goals. More than half of millennials (51%) find impact investing appealing, and 54% believe investments' effects on society are important, according to a recent survey by Kansas City, Mo.-based investment management firm American Century Investments.

As it turns out, that was not true. In fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. When the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. In November 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. As you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.

Richard Cheney, meanwhile, said in February 2016 that Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat and that he would not endorse him. But two months later, CNN reported that Cheney was breaking with the two former Bush presidents, who did not support Trump, and endorsed him at a time when the candidate had all but wrapped up the nomination.

And while I examine race in The Inheritance, it is not one of its central themes.

Thirty percent of adults from gay households fanaticized about suicide as an adult, compared to 7 percent from normal households. A whopping 71.9 percent of adults raised in gay homes reported obesity, compared to 37 percent from opposite-sex homes.
BURNETT: When you talk about access, I want to ask you about Israel in a second, Israel issue, but access. I have this picture which I know is -- it looks a little strange. The Associated Press obtained this from a government that is skeptical of Iran's honesty in its nuclear program and they say this is a chamber used for testing explosives for nuclear weapons. We did make some calls today and experts said indeed this would be consistent with that, but we haven't independently verified the source government. Supposedly it's at the Parshan (ph) site though, which is the site the IAEA has not been able to --
After being informed of the president's tirade by her father, Cheney walked out on the House floor, still hoping to stop the effort backed by Trump to overturn the electoral college votes. Then she heard a mob banging on the chamber's doors and a shot fired, and realized that an attempted insurrection was underway. She hustled to a secure location and later called Fox News.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump expanded his list of potential Supreme Court nominees Friday.
TOTENBERG: Well, people around Trump acknowledged that he's no Supreme Court expert. But he knows what he doesn't want. And he doesn't want surprises. And by that, he means somebody like Justice David Souter, who was appointed by the first President George Bush, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who is anathema to many conservatives because he voted to uphold the ACA.
1960: Bob Newhart Warner Records Nominees: The Brothers Four, Miriam Makeba, Leontyne Price and Joanie Sommers With The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart - the first comedy album to hit Number 1 on the Billboard chart - the comedian became the first artist to win Grammys in both the Album of the Year and Best New Artist categories. [Only three others have achieved that feat: Christopher Cross, Lauryn Hill and Norah Jones.] Newhart would release several more albums, and would star in a variety show and three sit-coms (including the classics The Bob Newhart Show and Newhart). He also made appearances in films such as Catch-22, Cold Turkey, In & Out and Elf.

In fact, Mr. Trump's policy of us going it alone, of America first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. The biggest threat to America right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. And it's time for us to deal with it that way. Every single foreign policy issue is about American leadership and coalition.

Peter Van Sant: Did you ask Kathy Patrick flat-out, Did you murder Carolyn Abel?
-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) used a visit to the early primary state of South Carolina to pitch himself to black voters in a stark difference from his 2016 campaign. Annie Linskey and David Weigel report: 'Racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality,' Sanders said, in a speech that used the refrain 'racism is alive' to walk through a litany of problems faced by minorities. The changes from Sanders's last campaign were hard to miss. In 2016, he said that 'identity politics' distracted from what he considered real issues, like economic inequality and the decline of organized labor. This week, on his first trip to an early-primary state since the midterm elections, Sanders called [Trump] a 'racist,' pushed for an end to private prisons, endorsed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote and advocated for an end to the cash bail system. He spoke at two black churches, mingled with supporters at a barbecue joint and met with the state's legislative black caucus, which had largely rejected him in 2016.

Julián Castro Julián Castro launches 2020 campaign 08:32 Biography Julián Castro was born one minute before his identical twin brother, Joaquin, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1974. His mother, Maria, was a Chicana political activist whom Castro has credited for motivating him and his brother to choose careers in public service. Joaquin Castro is currently a congressman. Castro attended Stanford University and Harvard Law School, along with his brother. He was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001 at the age of 26, making him the youngest council member in San Antonio history. He unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 2005, but won when he ran again in 2009. He was re-elected twice, in 2011 and 2013. Castro's profile rose when he was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first Hispanic person to do so. In 2014, President Obama named Castro Housing and Urban Development secretary. During the 2016 election, he was among those considered a possible vice presidential nominee for Hillary Clinton, although Clinton eventually chose Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Castro laid the groundwork for a 2020 presidential bid throughout 2018, visiting New Hampshire and publishing a memoir, An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up from My American Dream, in October. He announced the creation of an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 12 and officially announced his candidacy for president Jan. 12. Castro and his wife, Erica, have two children. Castro's tenure at HUD was marked by a focus on fair housing issues.
Peter Van Sant [walking outside]: We're gonna make our move now to Kathy Patrick's office.
Though Ames' story was bizarre to say the least, investigators believed the core details, which never changed: that Patrick woke her up and confessed to killing Carolyn, and the two of them staged it to look like a robbery. And the evidence they collected, appeared to back that up.
It's interesting and ironic this is happening at Starbucks, because it's been at the forefront of progressive causes, Marzilli noted. It was very same-sex-marriage friendly, and its customers tend to say they believe society is much better when people of different races live in the same neighborhood or community.
John Lomperis, a United Methodist who advocates with the traditionalist Protestant group Institute on Religion and Democracy, said that the bishop and Ensz might agree to a just resolution, which is like an out-of-court settlement.
This topic is not going away, added Ted Marzilli, chief executive officer at YouGov BrandIndex, which conducts daily surveys to monitor public views of 1,500 brands.

4. The ability of individuals and groups to have a larger impact than ever before—politically, militarily, economically, and ideologically—is undermining traditional institutions. This empowerment of groups and individuals is increasing the influence of ethnic, religious, and other sources of identity, changing the nature of conflict, and challenging the ability of traditional governments to satisfy the increasing demands of their populations, increasing the potential for greater instability. Some violent extremist groups will continue to take advantage of these sources and drivers of instability to hold territory, further insurgencies, plan external attacks, and inspire followers to launch attacks wherever they are around the world.
And thirdly, I make sure that with regard to housing, we allow people -- look, right now if you live in a black neighborhood and you have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white, the same exact house. We've got to deal with the institutional racism.
Noah Kleinman – President Trump commuted the sentence of Noah Kleinman. Mr. Kleinman is a 45-year old father of two children. The mother of his children unfortunately passed away during Mr. Kleinman's incarceration. Mr. Kleinman has served 6 years of a nearly 20 year sentence for a non-violent crime to distribute marijuana. Mr. Kleinman has had an exemplary prison history and has worked to remain close to his children and his father. Upon release, he looks forward to living with his father, working for the family business, and caring for his children.

Kerry James Marshall's trademark style has catapulted him into the stratosphere of the art world. A 35-year retrospective featuring 72 of his works is now at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. His figures aren't just black; they are jet black -- bold, proud, undeniably black. And while his work may deal with grief, injustice and loss, for the most part Marshall focuses on everyday life: picnics and street scenes, daily rituals, and quiet moments -- a window into a world rarely represented in fine art.

But, clearly, these are criminals, and they're going to do anything they can for a profit going forward. BURNETT: Polly, one thing I find hard to understand here, and especially with all the coverage in this country on the whole Fast and Furious controversy, there are 6,600 licensed gun dealers in the United States within 100 miles of the Mexican border, 70 percent of the guns recovered from Mexican drug activity had originated here in the United States.
KLEIN: Now, at what point in your stand-up did you start thinking, I got to start adding mics? One mic can't hold everything Neal Brennan has to offer.
Those sanctions proved to be hollow, Okoh said, and disapproval shifted toward those still embracing traditional beliefs regarding sexuality. Okoh said that during the Canterbury meeting, those who hold the orthodox view of human sexuality and marriage were denounced as 'homophobic,' underscoring that we were in the wrong place, he said.
The influential Christian law firm also has offices in Washington, D.C. and has become nationally known for challenging nondiscrimination protections. The Alliance has logged nine high court wins in just seven years.

Rubio's poor performance last Saturday hurt him in New Hampshire, where he finished a disappointing fifth. He needs a strong performance tonight to assuage concerns he's too scripted and too inexperienced. But if another candidate has a breakout performance, they could grab the momentum in South Carolina. Trump, for example, is already being attacked over his own personal life, much like Gingrich was, but good parrying of those attacks could give him a lock in a state where he's already leading in polls.
TRUMP: It's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it's done.

But ruin accelerated with the takeover of the party by pro-Trump extremists. (Ward famously suggested in 2018 that the McCain family disclosed his imminent death because the narrative would be negative to me.) Republican operatives in 2019 were so concerned about Ward's competence — justifiably so, given the 2020 results — that they tried to circumvent the state party.
Warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run Dec. 31. Warren and her second husband, Bruce Mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts with their golden retriever, Bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. Key issues Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance, she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015. Fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, Warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.

DAVIES: You moved out of San Francisco. And there's an eight-year stretch of your childhood. And you described them as pretty tough. You know, your parents' relationship fell apart, in part, because, you know, your dad would not take the medicine for his epilepsy and had some pretty strange experiences. Your mom ends up reviving the business kind of with once-a-month trips into San Francisco from where they were living outside of town.
VOLZ: My mom, from the beginning, she just sort of took me everywhere. And so in the early days of Sticky Fingers, this meant that I went on brownie runs with her. First, she had me in a front carrier, then on a Gerry carrier and, eventually, in the stroller. And she would hang duffel bags of brownies from the back bars of the stroller because they were very heavy.
We need a strong economy and to work worldwide on that economy, and we need strong alliances. We need to know the difference between our friends and between dictators who would do us harm. And we need to be nicer to our friends than to dictators. We need not to cut and run on our allies.

Newsom first gained national prominence in 2004 when, as San Francisco's mayor, he ordered officials to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The practice was overturned then but eventually became the law nationwide.

The Guardian's Ben Jacobs reports: The Iowa Republican met with Trump in New Jersey at his Bedminister golf course on [July 4, 2016] and gave a positive statement about the meeting. However, within two days, Ernst told Politico: 'I made that very clear to him that I'm focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is.'

The 90s were great, it was such a boom time, and on television in general everything was very airbrushed, very beautiful and packaged, Weir said.

As a skater, Weir often found more popularity with the sport's occasional fans than he did from the traditionalists. He feels the same is true of his commentary.
The idea of having sex as a trans person is weird because your brain is disconnected from your physical body, she explains. So when you look at your body, you don't want this, you know?

Carolyn and Ayagaki began a relationship that very quickly became serious.
As the news was breaking of the directive from Yates, Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told MSNBC's Greta Van Susteren that Yates' decision was a further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become.
And, in fact, since then, I have worked to end the use of private prisons in my home state, and we have ended it. I have started a bank to support black ownership of businesses, women ownership of businesses, and Latino owners of businesses, because this financial service industry is prejudiced.
That didn't work out too well, Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her. Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign, and often takes to the president's favorite outlet, Twitter, to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win, the president said, Well, that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.
Butler's legislation quickly became dubbed the bathroom bill by socially conservative opponents such as Ann Marie Banfield, who characterized the backlash in terms of privacy.
Other opposition leaders, such as anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, claim that the election will be rigged in Putin's favor after being barred from running, meaning that he is extremely likely to win another six-year term.

He said Merkel had delayed on the issue until her hand was finally forced by pressure from rival political parties ahead of September's elections. I believe that it was a tactical maneuver because she knew, if she didn't do it now, it would be an ever-lasting thing for the next coalition negotiations.
We can and should be able to expect fair and impartial justice from judges regardless of whether they were appointed by Republicans or Democrats. We did not oppose every single Trump nominee. We did not paint them with the same brush, McGowan said. But, she added, There should be a baseline below which we would never fall.
And I learned a lot from it, he continued. What I learned is that you can't say hurtful things about people, period. No matter where you are or who you are talking to.
Peter Van Sant: What did the South Koreans want you to do?
In the days after the historic vote, former Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie urged Gabbard to resign her congressional seat. Abercrombie, a Democrat who served nine terms in the House from 1993 to 2010, expressed concerns that Gabbard had been unable to juggle her responsibilities as a member of Congress and her presidential campaigning.
SAGAL: I know. There's hardly anything in it. Yes, there are some that are tall and thin. There's narrow. There's shapely. There's short and round, pear-shaped, you know. The idea is that it's soap for all types of women, but no woman basically wants to be stopped at the checkout counter and be told, you sure you don't want that fat bottle?
So when you actually take a look at the fence being built, the deployment of additional agents, personnel and technology, there's a higher degree of control on the border today. That's not to say that 300,000 is an adequate number to apprehend, we need to do better. But I think the key to continue to make sure we protect the country is to continue the strategy of not only controlling our own border, but Mexico needs to control the borders coming into their country from Central and South America where all of those drugs originate.
The South Carolina primary for Democrats will be the first significant measure of African-American voters in a state. Eight years ago, black voters made up 55 percent of the Democratic electorate in the state. Polls have shown that's a demographic Sanders, the Vermont independent, has struggled with compared to Clinton. But coming off strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, and closing the gap with Clinton nationally, Sanders could well be competitive.
The new list consists of 10 more possible nominees, including a U.S. senator who has refused to endorse Trump.
Steven Schroeder: Well, why didn't you tell us that 29 years ago?
BRENNAN: You're out of time, sir.
The more the debate focused on bathrooms, the more contentious it got. During the debate on the floor of the New Hampshire House, then-state Rep. Nancy Elliot, a Republican, claimed child molesters would be able to choose their gender identity and and prey on small children in restrooms.
So she would use the stroller to transport the brownies. And we'd go from business to business. And her customers just absolutely adored me and fawned over me. So I was very little. Obviously, I don't remember much clearly from this period. But I do have these flashes of memory. And there's a certain feeling that comes to me when I think of it. It was a very exuberant period in the city and especially in the Castro, where my mom was mostly working. And there was, I think, a lot of cheek-pinching and fawning and a lot of joy around it is the feeling that I get, anyway.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg credits the friendly skies for uniting him and his husband, Chasten.

And now the blacklisting push is ramping up….
In 2012, two-thirds (65 percent) of GOP primary voters described themselves as born-again, evangelical Christians. But almost one-third also described themselves as moderate. In Iowa this year, a similar 64 percent of caucus-goers were evangelical, but only 14 percent were self-described moderates. In New Hampshire, just 23 percent of voters were white evangelicals, while a lower 24 percent were moderates.
Now Priefer has been tasked with leading the Browns to a victory on the road in their first postseason appearance in 18 years. The team hasn't won a playoff game since 1995, when then-head coach Bill Belichick defeated Bill Parcells and the New England Patriots.
And let's not forget that Cuomo's warped idea of social justice also includes a return to McCarthyism, to a dark era where we blacklist people who express inappropriate ideas.
CORKER: So look I just want to make us -- I want to make sure that we have good outcomes here. And what -- and senators are not basing judgments on this or things that they believe to be perceptions, but the reality of what's actually happened in this case and hopefully a hearing will help us do that.
There is nothing decent about being anti-LGBTQ rights, and that includes the Vice President, Biden tweeted.
STEYER: That was easy to do. But I want to say something about foreign policy...
The fascist mob is going to declare certain toys, books, movies, and television shows problematic, and these corporations, that are either cowardly or infested with social justice warriors, are going to disappear these things. Problematic books, movies, and TV shows will vanish off proverbial store shelves — physical and digital.
Bob Vander Plaats, president of The Family Leader, said he's sending invitations Friday to the top seven Democratic primary candidates in current polls.

In that time, he's been giving some thought to his closing argument, about why I'll be the right nominee to take on and defeat Donald Trump. He's leaning into moderation, presenting himself as an alternative to progressives Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are both polling strongly in Iowa. Where they focus on ideological purity, he's explaining why I'm focused on bringing together, not just our party but our country when the time comes.

And you voted to not end debate on the Alito nomination. And if I understood you correctly at your press conference, what I thought I heard you say was, You know, I knew that it was a meaningless vote. You got a pass from the leadership. You can do this.
Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences, wrote Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez.
It's clear from Friday's incident on the Mall that the young men who confronted the Native American protester had somehow internalized that their behavior was acceptable. It's hard to read from that one scenario how they look at issues of race more broadly. But if part of the incident on the Mall reflected opposition to diversity, those views would be in the minority.
My hope is that the Arizona Republican Party will not entertain it. This does nothing to grow our party or put us in a better position to win in 2022, McDaniel added.
-- Love a candidate but don't think she can win? You've been infected with Pundititis, by Ben Terris: Pundititis [is] a virus affecting the nervous system of Democratic voters that was born out of the 2016 elections. Those infected find themselves unable to fall in love with candidates, instead worrying about what theoretical swing voters may feel. Signs of Pundititis include excessive electoral mapmaking, poll testiness, and an anxious, queasy feeling that comes with picking winners and losers known as 'Cillizzasea.' If you experience any of these symptoms for three hours or more, please stop consulting your television. Although Pundititis afflicts voters, it can be deadly to politicians. And there is, perhaps, no potential presidential candidate more susceptible to its effects than [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren.
One thing I, I do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the Constitution might be ambiguous. What do they do to — to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? You know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.
Glen Moss – President Trump granted a full pardon to Glen Moss. After pleading guilty in 1998, Mr. Moss has been a vital member of his community.

Biden's own positions on gay marriage and abortion evolved over the years. After voting to block federal recognition of same-sex marriages 16 years earlier, he backed legalizing gay marriage in 2012 – jumping out ahead of President Barack Obama in his announcement.
Some LGBTQI rights activists have expressed concern over McCormack's elevation to the office of Deputy Prime Minister.
No matter where we're from, we're united by the same daily needs -- a good job, a good education for our kids, good health care, an affordable place to live. The need to be acknowledged for our contributions, not for our gender or who we love. We all hope our children have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. We all hope they can worry about their studies, not their safety, Castro said.

BURNETT: So -- but JPMorgan itself, I mean is it possible you could do something about the bank? I mean you talk about it being small for that bank, and it is. And some people say, oh, well that's a sign that the system is strong. But then you could look at it and say why is the bank so big. It's 45 percent bigger in terms of assets, 2.3 trillion in assets. That's 15 percent of the U.S. economy, JPMorgan and it's 45 percent bigger now than it was right before the financial crisis, just to be clear.

Conditt does not appear to have any kind of military or law enforcement service in his background. He worked for Crux Manufacturing for about four years, overlapping the time he spent at Austin Community College, the Austin ABC affiliate reported. His former boss said he hired the then-19-year-old because he seemed like a smart kid who showed a lot of promise. He reportedly worked in sales and purchasing and did a little bit of everything. However, after his performance slipped and he received several unheeded warnings, Crux Manufacturing let him go in August 2017.
Jon Harder – President Trump commuted the sentence of Jon Harder, former President and CEO of Sunwest Management Inc., who has served nearly 5 years of a 15-year prison sentence. Notable figures, including the Honorable Michael Hogan who served as the Federal judge overseeing Sunwest's bankruptcy and receivership, Ford Elsaesser who served as counsel to Sunwest's creditors in receivership, and multiple other individuals involved in the litigation support Mr. Harder's commutation. Mr. Harder was serving as president and CEO of Sunwest Management Inc., a large management company overseeing residential senior care facilities, when he misused investment funds during the real estate crisis. Mr. Harder fully accepted responsibility, pled guilty, and cooperated with the government's civil and criminal actions against him at great personal cost. According to former Chief Judge Hogan, Mr. Harder's full cooperation against his substantial financial and penal interests helped secure the sale of the company's assets, ensuring that Sunwest's investors recovered more of their investment, seniors could continue living in their facilities, and employees could retain their livelihoods. Mr. Elsaesser stated that of all the financial wrongdoers that [the court and the Government] dealt with during the real estate crash of 2008, Mr. Harder acted more responsibly than any of his 'peers.' President Trump commends Mr. Harder for choosing to put his employees, investors, and the senior citizens residing in Sunwest's homes above himself.
However, Gabbard reversed her public position on LGBTQ rights.
SIEGEL: Now, during the campaign, Trump actually released lists of people who would be the kind of people he would nominate to the Supreme Court - 21 names I believe. What - who are they?

Perhaps because of her demeanor of self-effacing, even demure, modesty, it's been easy to underestimate Kidman over the course of a career that now spans three decades. But this week has offered a reminder of why we should prize an actress who has fashioned one of the most fascinating careers in a business notorious for pigeonholing its starlets early, keeping them boxed in and discarding them when their physical attributes show signs of sagging, bagging or otherwise naturally evolving.

In 2012, the Los Angeles shopping center The Grove banned Pacquiao from its grounds after an interview in The National Examiner wrongly attributed remarks to Pacquiao. The 57-6-2 fighter later told The Los Angeles Times, What I said is a reporter asked me about gay marriage … I am against gay marriage, but I'm not condemning gays. I have family — a cousin — who's gay, and friends too. I'm just against gay marriage. I don't even want to talk about the issue, but I was asked about it, so I gave my opinion.

While Kenworthy and Rippon are proud of who they are and are willing standard bearers for the LGBTQ community, they look forward to the day when their sexual orientation is irrelevant. When they, or those who follow them, are known as athletes who happen to be gay rather than gay athletes.

So when America's leftists began to complain about classic films and television shows that are problematic, I knew it was only a matter of time… Well, the time has come.
And I would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on Earth.

GARRETT: As we all know, as we all know, the political conversation in our country is interactive, and because of our partner, Twitter, this debate is no different. So I want to put a question from Twitter to you, Senator Klobuchar. This is from Casey Pennington. How will your policies address and ensure affordable housing and education equity for minimum wage workers?
SAGAL: You earned a point for Amy Dickinson. You've won our prize. Carl Kasell will record the greeting on your home answering device, whatever it may be. Congratulations, Andy.
SIEGEL: So how soon do you think it'll be before the incoming president announces his nominee to fill the current vacancy?
JOHNSON: Well, and the Justice Department briefing anticipated this argument. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall says race is different. There's a compelling government interest in eradicating discrimination based on race. Laws that target racial bias can survive very strict scrutiny, strict review under the First Amendment. But those same classifications aren't so clear, the Trump DOJ says, for sexual orientation. Colorado only began issuing same sex-marriage licenses in 2014. And a divided Supreme Court only ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. There's still a lot of litigation out there on how and if old civil rights laws that mention sex actually covers sexual orientation too.
Jodi Lynn Richter – President Trump commuted the sentence of Jodi Lynn Richter. Ms. Richter has served 10 years of a 15-year sentence for a non-violent drug offense. Ms. Richter has an exemplary prison record, and spends her time training service dogs in the PAWS program, tutoring other inmates in pursuit of their GED, and learning to operate a range of heavy machinery. Her parents have continued to support her and she has various employment opportunities available.
SIEGEL: Marriage equality was taken up a lot more recently than abortion. Is there any typical bias in favor of recent rulings, as opposed to old ones?
In general, everybody should admit the world is changing really fast and it's hard for the conversations to keep up. I mean, it's hard to remember now, but when Barack Obama ran for president he was against gay marriage, he said.
TOTENBERG: I don't expect the nomination until we have an official President Trump, until he's sworn in. He has a government that can vet candidates. He can officially give them to the FBI to do a thorough background check.
Wanda Abel: My dad … contacting every congressman, every senator … He wrote to news stations – 60 Minutes … 'cause he was hoping that if that happened, then there would be more publicity, more pressure.
As Breitbart News also reported in January, if elected, Warren has also vowed to fill at least half of her Cabinet with women and non-binary individuals – or those who claim they are neither male nor female.
Steve Brown, chancellor for the Virginia Conference, said that the names of the complainants are confidential. He said that there is no way to predict the speed of the process or whether anything will be decided before the denominational meeting in May.
What you have there is a CNN anchor justifying violence against bigotry in a world where his fake news network is defining Christians as bigots for opposing gay marriage, Republicans as bigots for not voting for Barack Obama, and 16-year-old boys as bigots for wearing Make America Great Again hats.

Both the Catholic Catechism and some clergy have indicated that politicians have an obligation to support anti-abortion legislation. The section of the Catechism discussing abortion says that the procedure and infanticide are abominable crimes.
KLOBUCHAR: Bernie, let me -- let me respond to this.
Dr. Mahmoud Reza Banki – President Trump granted a full pardon to Dr. Mahmoud Reza Banki. This pardon is supported by many elected officials of stature, including the late Representative John Lewis, Senator Diane Feinstein, and other Members of Congress. Dr. Banki is an Iranian American citizen who came to the United States when he was 18 years old. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, before obtaining a PhD from Princeton University and an MBA from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 2010 Dr. Banki was charged with monetary violations of Iranian sanctions and making false statements. The charges related to sanctions violations were subsequently overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. However, the felony charges for making false statements have prevented Dr. Banki from resuming a full life. In the years since his conviction, Dr. Banki has dedicated himself to his community and maintained a sincere love and respect for the United States.
Sandra Ames: To the best of my recollection, we sat in the living room at Carolyn's apartment, and … she convinced me, manipulated me, to help her make it look like a robbery.
Ginsburg and Breyer are among the court's liberals. The third, Justice Kennedy, is a generally conservative justice. But he's the author of the court's same-sex marriage decision. And he's been the deciding vote in upholding the right to abortion. So if any of those three goes, you will see dramatically more conservative rulings on these and other issues for a generation to come, at least.
DAVID FRUM, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: That is a pretty tough ad. But I wonder whether it really counts as a pivot to the economy. What exactly is President Obama proposing to do? I mean, if private equity really is bad, if it does more harm than good, it's free to operate in the Obama administration. President Obama isn't proposing to do anything to restrict private equity.
In her interviews with South Korean police, a deposition and a polygraph test with American investigators, Kathy Patrick did not point a finger at Sandra Ames. Steven Schroeder had a question about that for Patrick.
I did it in New York City. I got the Republican State Senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country. You can work across the aisle. You just have to know how to deal with people.
The Justice Department confirmed its Office of Legal Counsel had done a review of the order to determine whether it was on its face, lawful, and properly drafted.
The British government called Bermuda's decision disappointing but resisted getting involved despite the island's status as a British Overseas Territory. It's almost as if the Brits retain some knowledge about holding together an empire. If Bermuda were in the European Union, there'd have probably been some kind of sanctions, or perhaps a gay-migrant quota by now.
Mario Claiborne – President Trump commuted the sentence of Mario Claiborne. This commutation is supported by Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Mr. Claiborne is serving life imprisonment and has already served more than 28 years in prison. For more than 20 years, Mr. Claiborne has maintained clear conduct. Mr. Claiborne currently works for a UNICOR facility and has completed rehabilitative programming, including drug education.
This week, on Martin Luther King Day, Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris announced that she will run for president in 2020. Almost immediately, headlines appeared declaring her the female Barack Obama. Like many other prominent women, she is – wrongly and inaccurately to boot – best known as a derivative of a more-famous predecessor.
Democrats and Republicans alike cheered and rose at a few points during Northam's 50-minute speech, such as when he called for extending broadband access to rural areas and pledged to make the state the best for business.
Peter Van Sant: Back in Seoul. Where should be our first stop?
After those protests, The Family Leader said in a tweet, Shouting protests, namecalling are NOT how Christians are called to engage with our culture.
There's this whole myth of, 'Oh, if you're a lesbian, honestly, just, like, go for it 'cause you can't get pregnant LOL!'  jokes Wilson. But it's not true — there's, like, risks and stuff that go into that, and I know that from going here. And like, lesbians wear condoms when they're having sex. People should know that. Lesbians should know that!
BIDEN: You keep promising me that, but you haven't done it yet.
The old ladies in the villages, the old men in the villages, the young boys in the towns and villages, are all celebrating that the United Methodist Church has maintained its traditional view of the Bible, says Dr. Jerry Kulah of Liberia, general coordinator of the church's Africa Initiative. Other denominations all across Africa are celebrating the United Methodist Church. That is the kind of euphoria being expressed right now across Africa.
Supporters of the bill tried to push back against the rhetoric, noting that the bill permitted no such thing.
South Carolina prides itself on being the decider in GOP politics. Before 2012, it had correctly picked every eventual since 1980. But struggling former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had a breakout debate performance just days before the primary there in 2012. He defended against questions about his personal life and wound up breaking the streak. That helped sway much of the support statewide toward him and helped him earn a decisive victory. (Gingrich looked like he had momentum coming out of South Carolina, but a flush-with-cash superPAC supporting Romney, tore down Gingrich as the contest moved to Florida.)
Shannon Lee Goessling, a Republican, is under consideration to lead the Office on Violence Against Women, which administers grants to support victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Advocates say Goessling has limited experience working in the domestic violence field, and has a history of opposing rights for LGBTQ people and immigrants.
But my relationship with the I Ching as a kid was that I trusted it. And the fact that my mom felt confident using it made me feel confident as well. So I sometimes think about how, you know, the knowledge that my parents could have gone to prison at any time, how that should have been terrifying to me as a kid. And yet, it didn't keep me awake at night because I trusted my mom's decision-making abilities. And I trusted the I Ching then. It was later, more as a teenager, that I was like, oh, no. Wait. Science (laughter), you know? And I started to rebel more against the idea. But it's really only as an adult that I look back at the situation we were in and worry about the kid I was.
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — No disrespect to Olympic gold medal prospect Nathan Chen, but the biggest current stars in American figure skating won't be taking to the ice this month. They'll be behind a microphone.

After the election, with Liz Cheney winning a House seat at the same time Trump captured the presidency, Trump baldly tried to win the Cheney family's goodwill. He pardoned the elder Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis Scooter Libby, who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice. Trump said Liz Cheney had pushed for the pardon.
But some undecided voters who attended his events his past week still harbor misgivings about the 38-year-old candidate's experience.
Is it going to be overcoming COVID, bringing us together, caring for creation? Or is it going to be sort of a culture war? he asked. I think what Biden campaigned on, and who he is, is pursuing justice in unity – not a culture war agenda.
I'm big with an 'Irish exit.' I do not like long goodbyes, so maybe that's what I'll do. After my last scene I'll just leave the lot and just drive home, he said, receiving laughs from the audience. I think that's the only way I'll be able to manage this. It's really emotional.
BLOOMBERG: Let's just go on the record.
BIDEN: The only thing that the boyfriend loophole is was not covered. I couldn't get that covered. You, in fact, when you were -- as a senator tried to get it covered and Mitch McConnell is holding it up on his desk right now, and we're going to lose the Violence Against Women Act across the board.
BIDEN: I note how you cut me off all the time but I'm not going to be quiet anymore, OK?
When The Conversation Doesn't Include You: LGBTQ+ Sex Ed In A Small Town
The former senator was denied communion at a Catholic church in South Carolina for his support for abortion rights, which he refused to comment on saying it was his personal life. He also diverges from the church's official stance on LGBTQ rights, backing same-sex marriage.
But his ties to the UMC are deep, and it's the denomination he grew up in.
Cathy Miller, the owner of Tastries Bakery in Bakersfield, CA, explained that she was not refusing to serve a certain sort of customer, but rather to patronize a certain sort of event that goes against her religious convictions as a Christian.
The second thing we've got to do is make sure that we not only have the intelligence capabilities -- and I guess I disagree with the mayor; I don't think we need to have ground troops anywhere terrorists can gather, because terrorists can gather anywhere in the world. But we do need intelligence capabilities and specialists on the ground.

There's also some never-before-seen video and more than 50 recorded audio statements that the state plans to use at the trial. Coming OUTFRONT on this story, our legal analyst, Mark Nejame and Mark obviously I know you know a lot about this. Can you tell us who are some of the witnesses and obviously everyone is going to go what, a new video, I feel like we've all seen these videos so many times. What is this new video?
[S]he was heartbroken and stunned, Page said. Stunned is the word she uses most often.
And the second thing I'd point out to you is that what I would do immediately is restore the funding. He cut the funding for CDC. He tried to cut the funding for NIH. He cut the funding for the entire effort.
It tells bigots whose hate is rooted in fear and ignorance that gays and lesbians pose no threat. It tells children who are gay and worried about what that will mean for them that they're OK and their sexuality will not define or limit them.
FARSAD: But the thing about Marine Le Pen, she didn't ever scare me as much as Trump, I think, because she spoke in complete sentences. And her, like, white nationalism had a certain je ne sais quoi.

Tamara Doak: She made friends with everybody. She was very, very friendly.
So I talk about my father and I reconciling, and confronting him about this moment was very difficult. It was difficult for me, and it was difficult for him. It upset him. And one of the things that I think really helped us come back together is that when this happened, he got very quiet, and he asked who was saying it. And when I said that it was both Cheryl and my mom who had told me this, he accepted it and took some ownership for the action. It made him very sad, you know, to think of having done that, right? I thought it was very brave of him to allow that to be the story.
Former President Bill Clinton, Treasury Secretary, Alan Simpson, Congressman Paul Ryan, and speaker of the House, John Boehner, are all going to be together. You'll see Speaker Boehner tomorrow at 7:00 p.m., because I'll be with them. We've been looking very much forward to that.

It saddens me because when I think about the blessings of marriage, first of all it's one of the most conservative things about my life, very conventional, the 37-year-old said. It is morally one of the best things in my life. Being married to Chasten makes me a better person. I would even say it moves me closer to God.
What Trump's comments Monday mean for how, exactly, he will handle the resurgence of white supremacists, remains unclear.

Another split may occur between the United Methodist Church as a whole and some of the 13 official Methodist seminaries, many of which are institutionally committed to an LGBTQ-inclusive approach.
We have seen a great number of false equivalencies in the past two years, and the most recent Presidential election was defined by them. Yet it remains striking to hear Trump imply that Nazis and the interracial group of demonstrators who gathered to oppose them were, in essence, equally wrong. It would have been naïve to expect the President to unambiguously condemn neo-Confederates (Heritage, not hate, etc.), but Nazis? For reasons that are not hard to discern, the swastika, at least in the United States, has always been more clearly legible as a symbol of racial bigotry than the Confederate flag.
We know that Mayor Bloomberg has been doing business with China for a long time, and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes.
Very few would argue that they'd want a man in a girls' bathroom, right? So it becomes very hard to counter them, said Stone, who noted that some of the same language was used by opponents of gay rights in the 1970s.

6. Advances in nano- and bio-technologies have the potential to cure diseases and modify human performance, but without common ethical standards and shared interests to govern these developments, they have the potential to pose significant threats to U.S. interests and security. In addition, the development and spread of such technologies remain uneven, increasing the potential to drastically widen the divide between so-called 'haves' and 'have-nots.'
He didn't reveal if he and Mikita are having a boy or girl, just saying that they're having a human.
House Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) also praised Northam's tone and added that I do think there are some places we can work together. He mentioned K-12 education and teacher pay as examples.
Buttigieg, meanwhile, has not been shy about addressing his sexuality or his devout faith on the campaign trail. The mayor has called marriage equality a moral issue, and said his marriage of two years to his husband Chasten has made him a better human being and moved him closer to God.
The interview comes after Buttigieg announced his campaign had raised more than $7 million in the first quarter.
GREENE: When you say it's just growth, it makes me want to ask you if conversations around, you know, same-sex marriage that we've seen in recent years and the Supreme Court decision on that and the conversations around this law, I mean, are - as sensitive and infuriating as some of these conversations can be to some people on both sides, I mean, is there an argument that these conversations are just good for society to have as time evolves?
1. The state contains significant numbers of both evangelicals and moderates
BUTTIGIEG: I'm definitely on board with the part about sending up somebody from the middle of the country. But I want to come back to this question about the filibuster because this is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took, this is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds.

MARTIN: So what have you been hearing about reaction to the Justice Department's decision to weigh in on the baker's behalf?
SHAW: Well, when I wrote that, what I meant was that I was focused on the battles on behalf of African-Americans. Over time, as a civil rights lawyer, I came to realize that we have to be opposed to the subordination of people because of who and what they are, even if we're not part of that group. But I simply think that discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation and, in this instance, specifically transgender people, is simply wrong. It should be wrong. It's a matter of law. And I think as a country, we've been growing in our understanding of our values and principles with respect to discrimination and how we treat our fellow citizens and how we want to be treated ourselves, all of us, whether it's on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, age, our religion, on and on. It's just growth.

He remains a long shot to medal in the men's individual competition as the free skate takes place Friday night, although Nicodemo said much of LGBTQ community has taken in and appreciated all that Rippon has accomplished so far.
And my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. I'm not demanding that Republicans vote for Merrick Garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. And at some point, it's got to stop.
Mayor Bloomberg has a solid and strong and enthusiastic base of support. The problem is, they're all billionaires.
To be on the receiving end of such untrue allegations is very painful for me. It is painful for my husband and for those who are close to us, he told reporters. I understand the person making these accusations is troubled, and that makes me sad as well.

Mr. Weiss was convicted of racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice, for which he has already served over 18 years and paid substantial restitution. He is 66 years old and suffers from chronic health conditions.

Unlike Trump, Biden regularly attends church. His Catholicism has played as large a role in his life as his outsized family Bible did at his inauguration. Biden wears his son's rosary beads, made the sign of the cross when paying his respects to fallen Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick Tuesday, and quotes Bible passages.

The report continues that Fitzgerald, who had been employed at the school for 15 years, says she met with the school's administrator and principal and was given the options of resigning, dissolving her marriage, or wait it out and stay quiet and maybe I can make it the rest of the year, but they will not renew my contract next year.
MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Erin, the truth is we're in uncharted waters. One of the main effects immediately it's going to have to Greece is that the country will run out of money. It won't be able to pay its bills, its pensions, its state workers' wages -- none of these things that a country needs to survive will be need to be paid.

I'm not a foe of banking. What I want to see is that we have capital markets -- that we have capital markets in this country that function appropriately, that we have a financial system that meets the needs of an economy like we have in the U.S. and I just want to see it work in the appropriate way. One of the biggest setbacks we've had to our economy is the crisis in this financial system that sets us back years.

Martini did not explain how eliminating a food establishment committed to a biblical understanding of marriage would increase diversity on campus.
Amy Povah – President Trump granted a full pardon to Amy Povah, the founder of the CAN-DO (Clemency for All Non-violent Drug Offenders) Foundation. In the 1990s, Ms. Povah served 9 years of a 24 year sentence for a drug offense before President Clinton commuted her remaining prison sentence in 2000.

Kamala Harris Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 run 05:19 Biography Harris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was a scientist from India and her father, Donald Harris, an economics professor at Stanford University, was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada, where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California, Hastings. Upon graduation, Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003, she was elected San Francisco district attorney, a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer, Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010, Harris became California's first female attorney general, as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms, Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement, Harris launched a bid for her seat.
You can try moving to the suburbs, I guess… But as your nearest Democrat-run city descends into hell, your taxes will explode. Plus, you'll be funding rotting schools, potholes, corrupt Democrat political machines, and self-destructive social justice programs.

STEVE COLL, AUTHOR, PRIVATE EMPIRE: I do think they bring out the rule of law wherever they go. They want a world that is stable and safe for oil and gas drilling. One of the ways they promote that is by evangelizing about the importance of the rule of law. And they enforce a universal system of contract.

WHITAKER: Let's talk about education. South Carolina's schools score in the bottom half of the national assessment. Black students here consistently score worse than white students. Mayor Bloomberg, a key element of your response to failing schools in New York City was a dramatic increase in public charter schools. As president, would you pursue that same strategy and seek to expand charter schools nationwide?

Two complaints were filed against Ensz after he conducted the wedding, including from the Rev. Amanda Miller Garber, pastor of Rise Church in Harrisonburg, Va., who herself had conducted a same-sex ceremony in 2014 (she was suspended without pay for a month).

Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-R.I.), Biden's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, will testify before the Senate on Tuesday at 10 a.m.
Clinton has been emphasizing her support in the African-American community, touting the endorsement of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC this week. Civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis was dismissive of Sanders, saying he had seen evidence of the Clintons' work to gain equal rights but not Sanders's.
BIDEN: Well, it depends which -- look, I've earned the vote, I've worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African-American community, not just here but across the country. I've been coming here for years and years, creating jobs here, making sure that the port, for example, that employs one in 11 people, we put $500 million, in our administration, just into this county. We've created jobs for people.
The still to be developed program will likely include outdoor activities and character building similar to Boy Scouts, but it won't be modeled after Boy Scouts or use ranks. The 14-to-18-year-old boys that left the Boy Scouts already focus on church-related activities and community service.

Gregory Jorgensen, Deborah Jorgensen, Martin Jorgensen – President Trump granted full pardons to Gregory and Deborah Jorgensen, and a posthumous pardon to Martin Jorgensen. Governor Kristi Noem and Senator Mike Rounds support clemency for this family, which has an exemplary record of service to their community. In the 1980's, Gregory and his father, Martin, gathered a group of South Dakota cattle producers to market and sold processed beef. The Jorgensen's marketed their beef under the Dakota Lean brand and sold the premium product as heart-healthy and antibiotic- and hormone-free. When demand outstripped supply, Gregory, Deborah, and Martin mixed in inferior, commercial beef trim and knowingly sold misbranded beef. Since their convictions in 1996, the Jorgensen's have served their community devotedly. Gregory was elected twice to the Tripp County Board of Commissioners and spearheaded infrastructure projects to improve access for Native American communities. Deborah is a lifelong member of a non-profit dedicated to promoting educational opportunities for women. And Martin was named National Beef Cattleman's Association Businessman of the Year. The Jorgensens have shown remorse for their previous action, and in light of decades of exemplary public service, they are well deserving of these pardons.
President Barack Obama honored Rustin posthumously with a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013 for the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and King's famous I Have a Dream speech.

Colonialism is a real thing. But I also want to point out, having talked to several of my friends in Africa, that not all Africans agree with this decision, she says. I think it's unfair for Americans to blame Africa or South America or the Philippines for this decision.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was like watching an old friend bleed to death.
TUCKER: The music on Everything Is Love relies on a constant contrast between instrumental lushness and verbal starkness. This is mass-market hip-hop designed to reach the widest possible audience. And I mean that as a compliment. It's a big, complex goal, one that very few music stars even try to attempt anymore.
It will have to print its own currency, the drachma. That currency is like to drop through the floor when it comes to its valuations against the euro. So, Greece would set itself on a path to a great deal of poverty and economic hard ship.
Kamala Harris is the first Indian-American woman to have a seat in the US Senate. She was also the first woman, black, Indian-American or South Asian, to serve as district attorney of San Francisco, and as California's attorney general. The most famous instance of public sexism she faced before announcing her presidential bid occurred in 2013, when none other than Barack Obama called her the best-looking attorney general. Obama later apologized to Harris after the remark was widely criticized (rightly) as sexist.
She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors, including billionaire George Soros, have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken. She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017, she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public. What Trump says President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! Mr. Trump tweeted. Critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office, Gillibrand wrote on Twitter in response.
VOLZ: Not in a very conscious way. Although, I think it did affect me. I was a child who always enjoyed hanging out with adults and was awkward around other children. And I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. As an adult, I look back at it and wonder how much of that might have come out of the idea of carrying a big secret and how that makes you build walls around it and how that makes you shut down, in some ways. At the time, I wasn't very conscious of it. I just - I had a pat answer for when people asked what my parents did. And I knew very clearly that there were huge parts of our home life that I couldn't talk about.
This moment in our history — a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol — I think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.
Well, I'm not sure about that.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduces 2020 policy test with Green New Deal Some candidness may also follow the lead of O'Rourke previous political opponents and raise the issue of his arrest in the 1990s. In 1998, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charges were dismissed after he participated in a DWI program the following year. O'Rourke has apologized for the incident, but he was criticized last year for claiming he did not try to leave the scene after hitting a truck and the Houston Chronicle reporting that witnesses told police he had attempted to leave the scene. What Trump says Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked the speculation around an O'Rourke presidential campaign to challenge him in 2020, pointing to the Texas Democrat's unsuccessful Senate bid. I thought you were supposed to win before you run for president, Mr. Trump told reporters in December. When the two men held dueling rallies to tout completely different immigration agendas last month, the president bragged his event drew a larger crowd and ridiculed O'Rourke's great defeat in November.
The Democratic presidential primary here in South Carolina, the first primary in the South, is just four days away.
WALDMAN: Well, again, if the numbers for women or the numbers for independents on election day are on this poll, then it's president- elect Romney. But it is a bit of an outlier. The one bit of good news for President Obama in that poll, interestingly, was that independents and women and young people were more likely to be supportive of the president's stance on same-sex marriage than other voters.
Vander Plaats noted that in recent weeks, several candidates have woven their personal faith into their pitches to voters. Warren has made the case that her Christian faith helped shape her liberal political values. Harris opened her campaign by calling for unity and speaking of her faith in God during her announcement speech in January.
Hal Knudson Mergler – President Trump granted a full pardon to Hal Knudson Mergler. This pardon is supported by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the Office of the Pardon Attorney.

KLOBUCHAR: But the way we do it -- the way we do it is having someone leading the ticket from a part of the country that we actually needs the votes. So I have long supported the assault weapon ban.

In a statement, the Catholic school has said as role models for students, the personal conduct of every teacher, guidance counselor, administrator and staff member, both at school and away from school, must convey and be supportive of the teachings of the Catholic Church, the report continued.
The timeliest material charts a direct path from the racial backlash then into the heart of modern politics, detailing the importance of the Supreme Court in codifying (and later overturning) discrimination, the use of home-grown American terrorism against African-Americans and the extent to which violence was used to mount a political counter-revolution against Reconstruction, as historian David Blight explains.
BURNETT: Iran is going to ask for the sanctions to be rolled back. Don't put those really tough sanctions that Europe was going to be putting on this summer, don't do it, because we've made progress. That's what they're going to ask for. Is there any way you think that the United States at least would say, OK, we don't have to put that extra round of sanctions on, or is that something that must go forward to get the final deal done.
The advert is intended as a contrast to Putin's opponent Ksenia Sobchak, who has called for the legalization of same-sex marriage and seeks to move the country in a less socially conservative direction.

How did the same Americans who clamored for Bill Clinton to be impeached for lying about his affairs turn into voters who aren't even sure cheating is immoral at all? It's that magic word:

Thomas Kenton Ken Ford – President Trump granted a full pardon to Ken Ford, a 38-year veteran of the coal industry and currently the General Manager of a coal company. Mr. Ford's pardon is supported by members of the coal mining community, including those with extensive experience in mining operations, safety, and engineering, who describe Mr. Ford as a model manager who conducts himself with the utmost professionalism and integrity.

A new study shows there's much more depression, obesity and suicidal tendencies among adults raised by same-sex couples than among adults raised by a normal family of complementary male and female parents.
Take Theresa May. Coverage of the British Prime Minister is regularly peppered with references to Margaret Thatcher.

A month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. It was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.
Trump's announcement about Goessling's nomination noted that she previously worked as the director of the Crimes Against Women and Children Prosecution Unit in Atlanta after almost a decade as a state prosecutor. However, her LinkedIn page indicates she only held that position for nine months.
Jerry Donnell Walden – President Trump commuted the sentence of Jerry Donnell Walden. Mr. Walden has served 23 years of a 40-year prison sentence. He is known as a model inmate who completed his GED while incarcerated, as well as various other education classes.

BURNETT: All right. Thanks very much to both of you. This is going to be an issue we're going to cover a lot more of on this show.
These kids on the Mall, though, aren't millennials. They're members of a younger generation that doesn't have a broadly accepted name. The previous administration dubbed them the Homeland Generation, but a recent survey from Pew Research Center labeled them Generation Z — presumably following Generation X and Generation Y, an early name for millennials. (The groups are defined here.)

While Merkel's political career was catalyzed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification, Kramp-Karrenbauer's has been forged in the wake of Merkel's. That by definition gives her an adapted frame of reference, which merits its own scrutiny.
I love my wife very much, Fitzgerald said. I didn't have any intention to resign a job that I adore. For me to walk out was like saying I didn't want to be there anymore and that wasn't the case.
BIDEN: Where we come from, that's called Tommy come lately.
FARSAD: Eventually he'll read the entire Constitution, and then we'll really be screwed.
NEJAME: He'll have an uphill battle, that's for sure. We have very -- as I said, very open not only discovery, but sunshine laws in Florida. So he'll have to make an argument that the public's right to know is far outweighed by the public policy of protecting the safety of some of these witnesses because of the possibility of some death threats or injury or harm coming to some of these witnesses, to possibly being harassed and witness tampering. One would imagine that he would try to bring that out to show that some public safety outweighs the public's right to know. It will be an uphill battle.
Ten days after the Dec. 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Bush enlisted Clinton and George H.W. Bush to lead what became a successful a global campaign for private donations.

Ms. Locke was authorized to work outside the perimeter of the prison, and was granted home confinement under the CARES Act last summer. Today, she lives with her father, is building a relationship with her children, and works fulltime at a major retail store.

Twitter, YouTube and Facebook cannot continue to use soothing words to cover their inaction on moderation.
I find great solace in my faith, Biden told NPR in 2017. I happen to be a Roman Catholic, a practicing Catholic … I found that, for me, the externalities of my faith bring me a sense of peace. … My son died, and he had this set of rosaries on and I've been wearing it since and I will wear it till I die. … I'm not saying when I pray the rosary God's gonna help me — it's just solace.
SANDERS: Furthermore, furthermore, it is my view, the time is now, and Joe made this point, look, at the end of the day we need to rally the American people. Here is the good news. Because of all these disgusting and horrific mass shootings, the American people now understand that we must be aggressive on gun safety, not be dictated to by the NRA.
But we can do this. We have just got to stop talking about it.

And with no government to manage the economy and no one to pay the debt or pay anybody that works for the government, there is a real possibility that Greece leaves the euro. You may say so?
BLOOMBERG: No. You want to cut it back as much as you can, but I think, if we learned something from 9/11, people plan things overseas and execute them here. We have to be able to stop terrorism. And there's no guarantees that you're going to be able to do it, but we have to have some troops in places where terrorists congregate, and to not do so is just irresponsible.
Last year you and Karen said that my partner, Matthew, would be welcome to join us, and we're both really honored to accept the invitation this year, Varadkar said during the Friends of Ireland breakfast.
Beto O'Rourke Beto O'Rourke joins the 2020 presidential rac... 02:39 Biography O'Rourke was born and raised in the Texas border city of El Paso. Although his legal first name is Robert, he has been known as Beto, the nickname Spanish-speaking communities give names that end in berto, like Roberto and Alberto, since childhood. He was an avid musician as a teenager and was part of various rock bands, including the El Paso-based punk group Foss after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1995. O'Rouke's music career, however, was short-lived and he spent several years working in start-up companies and civic groups when he returned to El Paso from New York City. After working on several local political campaigns, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council in 2005 and defeated a two-term incumbent. He served two terms in the council and spearheaded a controversial effort to revamp the city's downtown. In 2012, O'Rourke, who speaks fluent Spanish, announced his candidacy for the Democratic primary in the race to represent Texas 16th Congressional District, a Latino-majority district encompassing El Paso and the surrounding communities. He managed to topple eight-term incumbent Silvestre Reyes in the primary and defeated his Republican challenger in a landslide general election victory. While in Congress, the Texas Democrat compiled a moderate voting record during his three terms, where he served on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committees.
That accusation was made by ex-punter Chris Kluwe in a January 2014 essay he wrote for Deadspin in which he claimed that his advocacy for same-sex marriage probably led to his release the previous year by Minnesota after eight seasons with the team. Kluwe wrote that, in addition to the nuke comment, Priefer's other remarks on the topic included: disgust at the thought of two men kissing; belittling any idea of acceptance or tolerance; and claiming more than once that the punter would wind up burning in hell with the gays.

Let's also focus on some of the facts that occurred the last few years as well. When you take a look at the apprehensions along the Mexican border coming into the United States, last fiscal year was 340,000.

In a statement to NPR, a spokesman for O'Rourke said the former congressman would not accept the invitation. Vander Plaats and the Family Leader have unapologetically provided a forum for dangerous anti-LGBTQ hate speech on numerous occasions, Chris Evans said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief on Wednesday criticized proposals in Indonesia's parliament to criminalize gay sex and extramarital sex, saying such laws could hurt the country's beleaguered LGBT community and other minorities.
The IAEA is in the middle of its first talks with Iran in three months. The latest report from the agency, of course you may recall, said there were quote strong indications of possible nuclear weapons development. Indications like this picture from The Associated Press in today's Washington Post. Now let me just explain exactly what you're looking at here because I looked at this and said what is this? Something that could be in my backyard. It's a drawing of what's believed to be a nuclear explosion containment chamber hidden at a secret Iranian military base perhaps near a site called Parshan (ph) that the government in Iran has refused weapons inspectors access to.
1983: Culture Club Virgin Records Nominees: Big Country, Eurythmics, Men Without Hats and Musical Youth This English act made a big impact in the early '80s with the international hit Do You Really Want to Hurt Me. Led by singer Boy George, Culture Club (also featuring Michael Craig, Roy Hay and Jon Moss) released its debut album, Kissing to Be Clever, in 1982, and didn't waste much time with the next effort: 1983's Colour By Numbers, which featured the single Karma Chameleon. It was all enough to snag Culture Club the Best New Artist win in 1983. The band went on to release three more albums throughout the '80s and '90s. During that time, though, George's drug addiction and relationship with Culture Club drummer Moss took a toll on the band. Throughout the years Culture Club has broken up, staged reunions and found themselves on hiatus once again. A 2014 reunion tour -- with the original lineup -- was scrapped after George came down with a serious throat condition.

Dr. Frederick Nahas – President Trump granted a full pardon to Frederick Nahas. This pardon is supported by Representative Jeff Van Drew. Dr. Nahas is a talented surgeon with a practice in New Jersey. In the 1990s, Dr. Nahas became aware of a Federal investigation into his billing practices.

Dr. Nahas spent 1 month in prison in 2003 and has spent the subsequent 18 years working tirelessly to regain the trust and admiration of his patients, colleagues, and community.
But this is a dangerous world. And if we haven't learnt that after 9/11, I don't know what's going to teach us what to. This -- we have to do something, and I think the budget that we -- the things that I've seen recently convinced me that the military today is better prepared than they have been in an awful long time, and that the monies they are spending on the war of weapons we need for the next war and not for the last, a common mistake that they're not making now.
Three sources close to the Justice Department confirmed that Yates, who had been planning to leave the department in a few days anyway after her successor won confirmation, knew her decision to speak out could lead to termination. But, the sources said, after agonizing over the situation, she felt strongly that the immigration order could represent a thinly veiled effort to target a particular religious group, and that was worth taking a stand.
BEYONCE: (Rapping) We keeping it real with these people, right? Lucky I ain't kill you when I met that...
If we cannot pull this party together, if we go to one of those extremes, we take a terrible risk of re-electing Donald Trump.
Trump's list also included many nonviolent drug offenders sentenced to prison.
It may very well might end up at the nation's highest court again, Campbell said.
JOHNSON: His record in office has not quite backed that up according to gay rights advocates. Early on in this administration, the Justice Department revoked guidelines for how schools should treat access to bathrooms and locker rooms for transgender people. In July. The president tweeted would ban transgender people from the military. And his Justice Department also went out of the way to file a brief in another case. That case said the Civil Rights Act, which provides protections against discrimination for people in the workplace, did not cover sexual orientation according to Trump's DOJ.
VOLZ: No, but she found out. So apparently, what happened is that my dad - who can't keep a secret - told Cheryl (ph), the other salesperson, at a point. He just had to get it off his chest. And I think that she told my mom. And then he, later on, during a big fight, he told her in an angry way. So my mom found out fairly shortly thereafter. This wasn't something I was told about as a kid. But I think as a teenager - was when I found out. And it is the kind of story that sticks in your craw.
By September 2015, a New York architect had completed plans for a bold glass obelisk 100 stories high, to be topped by a gleaming, cut-diamond–like shape emblazoned on multiple sides with the Trump logo. … The Trump team would also have the option to 'brand all or any portion of the spa or fitness facilities' as 'The Spa By Ivanka Trump,' according to the plans. … The top residence of the Moscow tower, enjoying a view without equal in all the continent, was to be a gleaming penthouse, the most luxurious property in a seriously luxurious building. A show-stopping apartment like that could have been marketed for $50 million. But as BuzzFeed News reported in November, Trump's fixers planned not to sell it — but to give it away for free, to none other than Vladimir Putin himself.

Pete Buttigieg likes to start off his stump speech by asking the crowd to envision the day when the sun comes up and Donald Trump is no longer president. The first potentially concrete development on this front takes place in two weeks, when Iowans go to caucus in the first Democratic voting contest on February 3.
Perhaps most astonishing, a recent YouGov poll found only half of Trump voters said Trump cheating on his wife with Stormy Daniels would be immoral, even if it did happen. After everything they've learned about him, 56 percent of Trump supporters believe the phrase moral leader describes the president either very well or extremely well.

Nancy Bercaw: The impact of seeing her body wheeled out in a body bag really made it quite real … it wasn't a dream. It became the nightmare that it really still is to this day.
Peter Van Sant: Even today after all these years, 30 years, this still gets to you, doesn't it?
O'DONNELL: And, Mr. Vice President, I have to allow -- yes, Mr. Mayor.
BURNETT: All right I didn't know that and we just found out that Zimmerman's lawyer got the discovery package, you know, late tonight, so presumably he's just going through it, presumably going to try to block all of this, the video for example, something that the American public would want to see. But to block it from going public. Will he succeed?
Raymond Hersman – President Trump commuted the sentence of Raymond Hersman. Mr. Hersman is a 55 year-old father of two who has served more than 9 years of a 20 year sentence. While incarcerated, Mr. Hersman has maintained a spotless disciplinary record, worked steadily, and participated in several programming and educational opportunities. Upon release, he looks forward to transitioning back into the community and leading a productive life with strong family support.
You couldn't say anything to them, charged Elliot. If you did say something to this person, you could be accused of a hate crime.
The other impact Greece crashing out of the euro may have is the impact of contagion. If Greece crashes out of the single currency, what's to stop other debt-laden economies like Ireland, like Spain, like Portugal, like Italy from doing exactly the same thing? Up until now, this big European project of getting all these countries together, these diverse countries together, diverse economies together and bringing them all under the umbrella of a single currency has been something that's really dominated European politics. If that ends, if Greece exits the euro, that whole project comes to an end and it potentially puts the European Union and the cohesion of the European Union under threat.
BURNETT: OK. Do you buy that spin, Michael?
Another possibility is that they will be mutilated by censors. Problematic scenes, moments, characters, and words will be removed.
This outpaced Trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. During the Obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. Previous administrations going back to President Ronald Reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.
I wanted to write about addiction and alcoholism — a disease I have struggled with, and an epidemic that plagues our community just as perniciously as H.I.V./AIDS did 30 years ago. I also wanted to write about sex: how it can be used as a vehicle for pleasure and intimacy, but how it is also used as a tool to cauterize pain.
As a result of his war on drugs, thousands of suspected drug users and dealers have been killed by both police and vigilantes. Duterte admitted last month to having killed someone when he was a teenager, and has said previously that he killed suspected criminals during his time as mayor of Davao City.
Obviously we are upset that a prominent Republican would support Joe Biden whose beliefs are the opposite of what our party stands for, but the language in this resolution is abhorrent, McDaniel said in the statement.
BILL KURTIS: Translated into cat, that would be (imitating cat meowing).
What would challenge us financially more is if enrollment is hurt, he says. If we have fewer students seeking ordination in the United Methodist Church, that affects us financially as well. We are living in some pretty serious tension right now.
Wanda Abel: She should be in prison. Plain and simple.
McCain, the widow of the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), endorsed President-elect Joe Biden over President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.
BIDEN: Can I respond to that, as well?
Rustin's close friends knew he was gay, but his religious and political associates distanced themselves after his arrest, Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco and Assemblywoman Shirley Weber told Newsom on behalf of the caucuses.
BODDEN: The difference is his wife will live with him.
STEYER: There's something going on here. I have worked for racial justice...
Former Vice President Joe Biden has not been shy about his Roman Catholic faith, with which he has always identified.
Kathy Patrick: I believe she is.
KLEIN: ...B, he was sued by the other Mike Rowe for his web series, Really, Really Dirty Jobs; or C, he regularly made small insults to marginalized groups? You know, Mike Rowe aggressions.
1978: A Taste of Honey Capitol Records Nominees: The Cars, Elvis Costello, Chris Rea and Toto It would be several years before Janice M. Johnson, Perry Kibble, Donald R. Johnson and Hazel Payne (who had first played together in 1971) would find success with Capitol Records and their disco hit, Boogie Oogie Oogie. Renamed A Taste of Honey, the band sold two million copies of their debut album, which hit Number 1 on the charts. With new members the band failed to score another big hit with their follow-up albums, Another Taste and Twice As Sweet, and within two years, only vocalists Janice Johnson and Hazel Payne remained. In 1984 Johnson released a solo album, One Taste of Honey, and a second in 2000, Hiatus of the Heart. Hazel Payne left the group to pursue an acting career, but performed with Janice Johnson on two PBS reunion specials. Drummer/vocalist Donald Ray Johnson continues to perform blues in Calgary, Canada, and has toured with such artists as Teddy Pendergrass, Smokey Wilson and The Isley Brothers. Perry Kibble, who became a music producer in Canada, died of congestive heart failure in 1999 at age 49.
Sandra Ames: Kathy was very upset, convinced that something had happened to Carolyn.
They have -- they need to address the issue of the cartel that say they have in Mexico and certainly we work very closely with foreign governments to stop the illegal flow of weapons in any direction. But I think that weapons were long available in Mexico before Fast and Furious. I think that the efforts that our government is doing to stop that flow is commendable because our agents work very hard to stop that flow of weapons into Mexico.
Then, Warren said that since the question came from a young trans person who asked about a welcoming community, she would have that trans child interview the nominee for education secretary and look for the child's approval:
A member of the Temple Emanu-El, the Upper East Side Reform synagogue, Bloomberg didn't raise either of his daughters Jewish nor is his current companion Jewish.
But Sandra Ames' story quickly changed. In official statements, Ames wrote that Kathy Patrick had admitted to cutting Carolyn's throat. And today Ames claims that the only reason she made that admission was due to false memories implanted by investigators. But she doesn't deny going to the crime scene or handling the murder weapon.
