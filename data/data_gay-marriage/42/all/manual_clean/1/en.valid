volz: (laughter) that question makes me laugh a little bit. so as a child, i was pretty accepting of especially my mom's worldview. i had a lot of trust in her. she was always cool in a crisis. and i believed that she knew what she was doing. my parents, i would say, did not use the i ching to decide what i should or shouldn't be allowed to do. i didn't have a whole lot of rules as a child. i kind of felt like i was part of the decision-making process to a degree that, i think, is pretty unusual.

south carolina prides itself on being the decider in gop politics. before 2012, it had correctly picked every eventual since 1980. but struggling former house speaker newt gingrich had a breakout debate performance just days before the primary there in 2012. he defended against questions about his personal life and wound up breaking the streak. that helped sway much of the support statewide toward him and helped him earn a decisive victory.

soon, however, cheney and trump were at political war.
we have seen a great number of false equivalencies in the past two years, and the most recent presidential election was defined by them. yet it remains striking to hear trump imply that nazis and the interracial group of demonstrators who gathered to oppose them were, in essence, equally wrong. it would have been naïve to expect the president to unambiguously condemn neo-confederates (heritage, not hate, etc.), but nazis? for reasons that are not hard to discern, the swastika, at least in the united states, has always been more clearly legible as a symbol of racial bigotry than the confederate flag.

she was the first senator to call on sen. al franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. a few big democratic donors, including billionaire george soros, have said that they will not support gillibrand because of her position on franken. she has also distanced herself from the clintons. in november 2017, she said that president bill clinton should have resigned after his affair with white house intern monica lewinsky became public. what trump says president trump tweeted at gillibrand in december 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him. lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand, a total flunky for chuck schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump. very disloyal to bill & crooked-used! mr. trump tweeted. critics interpreted the words begging and used in the tweet as having a sexual connotation. you cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the oval office, gillibrand wrote on twitter in response.

last year, writing about actress isabelle huppert in the new republic, the critic miriam bale noted that in the movie elle, huppert herself became an auteur, her craft and potent persona transcending the material and taking a hand in creating the movie that was every bit as crucial as the director's. the same, writ even larger, could be said for kidman, whose shrewd auteurist eye is revealed not just in one movie but through the arc of her career. in an industry dedicated to escapism, shallow reassurance and dumbing down, she has single-mindedly pursued thoughtfulness, intelligence and risk, as an actor and a producer.

scott conor crosby – president trump granted a full pardon to scott conor crosby. mr. crosby is supported by senator martha mcsally, the mayor and vice mayor of mesa, arizona, and the bishop of his church, all of whom attest to mr. crosby's service to his community and upstanding character. in 1992, mr. crosby made a 'spur of the moment' poor decision to participate in a co-worker's plan to commit a bank robbery. mr. crosby was arrested the same day and cooperated with the authorities. since his release from prison, he has spent significant time volunteering at his church, mentoring youth, and has earned a certification as an emergency medical technician. mr. crosby's civil rights were restored by the state of arizona in 2003, and this action restores his federal civil rights.

sixteen billion dollars -- well, that's the size of california's deficit. and it's nearly twice as big as governor jerry brown estimated four months ago. if he were running a bank, he'd be facing some problems right now.
you need to keep a close eye on what your school is teaching because the left only wants to teach your kids to engage in loveless sex, the sanctity of abortion, why america is evil, that men are women and women are men, and that global warming is real. (it's not.)

6. advances in nano- and bio-technologies have the potential to cure diseases and modify human performance, but without common ethical standards and shared interests to govern these developments, they have the potential to pose significant threats to u.s. interests and security. in addition, the development and spread of such technologies remain uneven, increasing the potential to drastically widen the divide between so-called 'haves' and 'have-nots.'

but northam's vision of a rapidly rising state flush with cash to build on its success is based on a fundamental disagreement with republicans, who still control both houses of the legislature. the governor wants to spend some $1.2 billion that could flood state coffers because of changes to the federal tax code under the tax cuts president trump signed last year.
none of us had the experience that black women have had that drives that maternal mortality gap that we are all rightly horrified by, of going into a doctor, and being less likely to have your description of being in pain believed because of your race. since we don't have the experience, the next best thing we can do...

volz: well, yeah, san francisco has changed quite a bit. with respect to cannabis, it is now legal for adult use. and san francisco and then california were first in denoting cannabis as an essential business during coronavirus, which was a watershed moment. nothing like that has happened before. so cannabis is very accessible to people. i feel that, at least for adults, that it should be. i think this is a good thing. but the culture has changed so much around it in ways that i find very heartbreaking.
sanders: i have opposed authoritarianism all over the world and i was really amazed at what mayor bloomberg just said a moment ago. he said that the chinese government is responsive to the politburo, but who the hell is the politburo responsive to? who elects the politburo? you have got a real dictatorship there. of course you have a dictatorship in cuba.

king: we're going to talk about that.
i would say i just want my parents there at this point. my parents wouldn't come to thanksgiving because they're so scared, so really would rather it not be a covid situation. like, i would rather not have masks and that kind of thing, stefani said.
another new company hopes to find a place amid investors' ever-changing values. motif, an online brokerage platform for investing in specific themes, such as biotech and health, introduced motif impact portfolios in march, where people invest in their beliefs and customize the list of funds put in those thematic buckets. investors may be particularly passionate about a subject, such as climate change or corporate governance, but if there are funds for companies investors don't believe are aligned, they can change those allocations. we are constantly voting with our consumer dollars, but not with our investing dollars, said hardeep walia, chief executive officer of motif.

at least hundreds of national guard troops were forced to sleep in parking garages after being booted thursday from the u.s. capitol complex following their job to secure biden's inauguration in the wake of the jan. 6 riots. i've never in my entire career felt like i've been booted onto the curb and told, 'figure it out on your own,'  said one of the soldiers, who said he served in iraq and afghanistan. some troops are headed home, while others have apparently been returned to the capitol complex, after an uproar on social media.
feinstein: i don't think that's the united states' position. i think its confined enrichment to five percent, limited to the medical isotopes. move anything above five percent out of the country or secure it --
ferrell damon scott – president trump commuted the sentence of ferrell damon scott. this commutation is supported by former acting united states attorney sam sheldon, who prosecuted his case and wrote that he … strongly does not believe that [mr. scott] deserves a mandatory life sentence. ms. alice johnson, the can-do foundation, and numerous others also support clemency for mr. scott. mr. scott has served nearly 9 years of a life imprisonment sentence for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. under today's sentencing guidelines, it is likely that mr. scott would not have received such a harsh sentence.
warren: i don't care how much money mayor bloomberg has. the core of the democratic party will never trust him. he has not earned their trust. i will. and the fact that he cannot earn the trust of core of the democratic party means he is the riskiest candidate standing on this stage.
we can and should be able to expect fair and impartial justice from judges regardless of whether they were appointed by republicans or democrats. we did not oppose every single trump nominee. we did not paint them with the same brush, mcgowan said. but, she added, there should be a baseline below which we would never fall.

sagal: but on thursday of this week, we heard that the president had really fired comey because he didn't like him, and he thought that he was making too much noise about the russia investigation. the white house dismissed that though because it came from a completely unreliable source - president donald trump.
robert william cawthon – president trump granted a full pardon to robert william cawthon. his pardon is supported by former deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and the office of the pardon attorney. mr. cawthon was convicted in 1992 for making a false statement on a bank loan application and was sentenced to 3 years' probation, conditioned upon 180 days' home confinement. mr. cawthon has accepted responsibility for his offense, served his sentence without incident, and fulfilled his restitution obligation. his atonement has been exceptional, and since his conviction he has led an unblemished life while engaging in extensive, praiseworthy community service.
johnson: well, and the justice department briefing anticipated this argument. acting solicitor general jeffrey wall says race is different. there's a compelling government interest in eradicating discrimination based on race. laws that target racial bias can survive very strict scrutiny, strict review under the first amendment. but those same classifications aren't so clear, the trump doj says, for sexual orientation. colorado only began issuing same sex-marriage licenses in 2014. and a divided supreme court only ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. there's still a lot of litigation out there on how and if old civil rights laws that mention sex actually covers sexual orientation too.
ginsburg and breyer are among the court's liberals. the third, justice kennedy, is a generally conservative justice. but he's the author of the court's same-sex marriage decision. and he's been the deciding vote in upholding the right to abortion. so if any of those three goes, you will see dramatically more conservative rulings on these and other issues for a generation to come, at least.
volz: which is also true. so it wasn't an outright lie. it was a withholding of information.
both bills approved tuesday now go to the house rules committee, which determines the daily schedule of bills receiving a full vote on the floor. the bills could receive a vote as soon as thursday.
o'donnell: well, mayor bloomberg, senator warren has raised...
justice kennedy was confirmed by ronald reagan, and i'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. but ultimately, he was confirmed. and he was confirmed in the last year of president reagan's office. so we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the supreme court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the supreme court, but the integrity of the senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.
they have -- they need to address the issue of the cartel that say they have in mexico and certainly we work very closely with foreign governments to stop the illegal flow of weapons in any direction. but i think that weapons were long available in mexico before fast and furious. i think that the efforts that our government is doing to stop that flow is commendable because our agents work very hard to stop that flow of weapons into mexico.
sydney navarro – president trump commuted the sentence of sydney navarro. ms. navarro has served nearly 8 years of a 27-year sentence for a non-violent drug offense. she has an exemplary prison record. in addition, ms. navarro obtained her ged, participated in extensive program work, and earned excellent work evaluations. notably, ms. navarro was chosen to speak to at-risk youth in the community through the share program. upon her release, ms. navarro wishes to reunite with her daughter and seek employment.

chris young – president trump commuted the remaining sentence of chris young. this commutation is supported by the honorable kevin h. sharp, mr. young's sentencing judge, former law enforcement officials and federal prosecutors, and multitudes of criminal justice reform advocates, including alice johnson, kevin ring, jessica jackson sloan, topeka sam, amy povah, the aleph institute, mark holden, doug deason, and david safavian, among others. mr. young, who is 32 years old, has served over 10 years of a 14 year sentence for his role in a drug conspiracy. although initially sentenced to a mandatory life sentence that judge sharp called not appropriate in any way, shape, or form, mr. young has made productive use of his time in prison by taking courses and learning coding skills. he also has maintained a spotless disciplinary record. mr. young's many supporters describe him as an intelligent, positive person who takes full responsibility for his actions and who lacked a meaningful first chance in life due to what another federal judge called an undeniably tragic childhood. with this commutation, president trump provides mr. young with a second chance.

and when you hear judge garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the oklahoma city bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. and i spent a lot of time on that.

but my relationship with the i ching as a kid was that i trusted it. and the fact that my mom felt confident using it made me feel confident as well. so i sometimes think about how, you know, the knowledge that my parents could have gone to prison at any time, how that should have been terrifying to me as a kid. and yet, it didn't keep me awake at night because i trusted my mom's decision-making abilities. and i trusted the i ching then. it was later, more as a teenager, that i was like, oh, no. wait. science (laughter), you know? and i started to rebel more against the idea. but it's really only as an adult that i look back at the situation we were in and worry about the kid i was.

one need only consider kidman's vanity-free supporting appearance in last year's lion, alight quickly on moulin rouge! and the others and go all the way back to her breakout roles in dead calm and days of thunder to appreciate the rigor and expressive range of an actress who can easily hold her own with the meryl streeps, viola davises and cate blanchetts of the world but is rarely mentioned in their company.

volz: oh, absolutely. so there had been, since maybe the mid-'70s, the beginnings of a medical marijuana movement. but it really had not made it into the press in a significant way. and it was very small. and marijuana was still, in the american consciousness, not considered a medicine. it was considered a party drug. well, the situation with hiv/aids was that the first effective drug treatment didn't come out until 1996. it was 15 years. and this is a disease with an 80-plus percent fatality rate. let that sink in for a moment.

then, graham added, mayor buttigieg says he's a gay christian. as a christian i believe the bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. the bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.

james brian cruz – president trump commuted the remaining sentence of james brian cruz. mr. cruz's many supporters include alice johnson, dr. robert jeffress, pastor of the first baptist church in dallas, texas, kelly shackelford of the first liberty institute, several former inmates who mr. cruz mentored or ministered, mr. cruz's work supervisor, and several business owners and managers. mr. cruz, who has served approximately half of a 40-year sentence for a drug crime, has truly reformed and has worked to better his life and the lives of other inmates while in prison. several former inmates credit mr. cruz, whom they met while incarcerated, as someone who helped changed their life, as a great source of comfort for many, and one who helps others without looking for anything in return. mr. cruz's work supervisor describes him as a dependable and hard-working employee, who has gained the respect of many staff workers and inmates alike and who helps arguing inmates make peace. mr. cruz writes that he recognizes the effect drugs have on people, families, and the community, and desires a second chance to live life as one who upholds the law, and lives to help others.

gregory jorgensen, deborah jorgensen, martin jorgensen – president trump granted full pardons to gregory and deborah jorgensen, and a posthumous pardon to martin jorgensen. governor kristi noem and senator mike rounds support clemency for this family, which has an exemplary record of service to their community. in the 1980's, gregory and his father, martin, gathered a group of south dakota cattle producers to market and sold processed beef. the jorgensen's marketed their beef under the dakota lean brand and sold the premium product as heart-healthy and antibiotic- and hormone-free. when demand outstripped supply, gregory, deborah, and martin mixed in inferior, commercial beef trim and knowingly sold misbranded beef. since their convictions in 1996, the jorgensen's have served their community devotedly. gregory was elected twice to the tripp county board of commissioners and spearheaded infrastructure projects to improve access for native american communities. deborah is a lifelong member of a non-profit dedicated to promoting educational opportunities for women. and martin was named national beef cattleman's association businessman of the year. the jorgensens have shown remorse for their previous action, and in light of decades of exemplary public service, they are well deserving of these pardons.

i think it's huge that he does not project the way other professional athletes have when it comes to masculinity, anthony nicodemo, a high school basketball coach in new york and lgbtq activist, told usa today sports. he marches to the beat of his own drum the way somebody like michael (sam) and jason (collins) didn't. they fit that piece of masculinity we have come to expect in sports being big and strong. adam doesn't fit into that box.

-- despots — and would-be despots — have seen in trump a model, as well as an alibi, griff witte, carol morello, shibani mahtani and anthony faiola report in today's newspaper. the strongman style of leadership is not new, of course, and it is not always obvious who is inspiring whom. but in interviews on four continents, diplomats, rights activists and foreign officials said that after two years of trump using the world's most powerful megaphone to cheer authoritarians, bully democratic allies and denigrate traditional american values, the impact on how others govern is becoming clear.
-- trump, like many of his advisers, has grown tired of giuliani's gaffe-prone media appearances frequently requiring the ex-mayor to walk back his comments, politico's eliana johnson and darren samuelsohn report: trump was apoplectic after a pair of weekend media interviews by his personal lawyer, in which giuliani said that the president had been involved in discussions to build a trump tower in moscow through the end of the 2016 campaign … trump spent much of sunday and monday fuming to aides and friends about his lawyer's missteps. … giuliani's public remarks — typically made in sporadic clusters of freewheeling media interviews — have long exasperated white house aides, including the president's in-house lawyer handling the russia investigation, emmet flood. … asked who in the white house is responsible for handling giuliani's missteps, a white house aide said, 'handling rudy's f--- ups takes more than one man.'
johnson: his record in office has not quite backed that up according to gay rights advocates. early on in this administration, the justice department revoked guidelines for how schools should treat access to bathrooms and locker rooms for transgender people. in july. the president tweeted would ban transgender people from the military. and his justice department also went out of the way to file a brief in another case. that case said the civil rights act, which provides protections against discrimination for people in the workplace, did not cover sexual orientation according to trump's doj.

-- south bend mayor pete buttigieg entered the 2020 democratic primary. cathleen decker reports: buttigieg made his plans official in a video and email sent to supporters early wednesday, before taking part in the u.s. conference of mayors meeting in washington, d.c. he announced in december that he would not seek a third term as mayor of the indiana city, a move widely seen as a precursor to a presidential run. he said wednesday he was setting up an exploratory committee for president, the legal mechanism allowing him to raise and spend money on behalf of his campaign. buttigieg suffused his announcement with references to his youth and the generational exception he represents compared to most of the democratic field. he turned 37 on saturday, making him the youngest entrant so far in the presidential race.

but ruin accelerated with the takeover of the party by pro-trump extremists. (ward famously suggested in 2018 that the mccain family disclosed his imminent death because the narrative would be negative to me.) republican operatives in 2019 were so concerned about ward's competence — justifiably so, given the 2020 results — that they tried to circumvent the state party.
in the house, he was a member of the pro-business new democrat coalition and received donations from the oil industry, which will likely not bode well with progressives who are pressuring the democratic party to support more audacious efforts, like the green new deal, to mitigate climate change. during his senate campaign, o'rourke refused to back medicare for all, a proposal many 2020 democrats have vouched their support for. medicare for all emerges as first litmus test for 2020 democratic contenders
as it turns out, that was not true. in fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. when the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. in november 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. as you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.

klobuchar: what i think we should do is make things more affordable, nonprofit public option, make sure we're paying for long-term care better, take on the pharmaceuticals, like you and i have done together...
volz: not back then, and i'll tell you why - she never got busted. and so she certainly wasn't going to announce herself in the press. and one of the things that's interesting in the brownie mary and mer the brownie lady confusion - so they were both part of the same zeitgeist. well, poor brownie mary kept getting busted. and she had a wonderful way of handling the press. she was grandmotherly and funny, very, very witty and adorable. and the press just loved her. they just ate it up. and so she, possibly more than anyone, was responsible for bringing the concept of medical marijuana to broader society. and my mom, meanwhile, stayed underground. she didn't get busted. she didn't go to the press. but she worked throughout all of these years to get edibles to people who needed them.
sanders: but that is different than saying that governments occasionally do things that are good. that's what barack obama said.
he often called for improvements to the affordable care act, president obama's signature domestic policy achievement. during and after his senate campaign, o'rourke made immigration a central issue. he has routinely denounced the white house for its hardline immigration agenda, including the discontinued zero tolerance policy that led to the separation of thousands of migrant families near the u.s.-mexico border. he also strongly supports legislation to put young undocumented immigrants, known as dreamers, on a pathway to u.s. citizenship. during a fiery speech in el paso last month where he drew sharp contrasts with president trump's stringent policies and tough rhetoric on immigration, o'rourke condemned mr. turmp's long-promised wall along the southwestern border. we know that walls do not save lives. walls end lives, he said in a border rally that competed with one of mr. trump's nearby rallies. in the last 10 years, more than 4,000 children women and men have died trying to come to this country to work jobs that no one will take, to be with a family member, to flee horrific violence, brutality and death. controversy in addition to the scrutiny o'rourke will likely face for launching a presidential campaign a few months after losing a senate race, the texas democrat can expect to be questioned by political rivals about his tenure in congress and personal life. although he had a generally liberal voting record in congress, o'rourke's progressive bona fides may come under scrutiny from the left.

one of the things that you do in the book is you talk about kind of the history of san francisco. and in the 1970s, there was all of this kind of explosion of creativity and art and experimentation. but there was also some really dark stuff. you know, the peoples temple, which was led by jim jones, was active in the city and very connected to a lot of the liberal politicians. and then there was the horrific assassinations of the mayor, moscone, and then the supervisor, the councilman, harvey milk that, i guess, was not a customer of your mom, but somebody that she met on her rounds a lot. how did all of that affect her?

wayne messam screenshot from wayne messam's 2020 campaign video wayne for america biography born in pahokee, florida and raised in south bay, mayor wayne messam became the first african american mayor of the city of miramar after unseating a 16-year incumbent in 2015. messam's parents immigrated to south florida from jamaica. his father worked as a laborer in the sugar cane fields of the florida glades after coming to the united states, and his mother would cook to feed the migrant workers. messam earned a full football scholarship to florida state university, where he started at wide receiver and was a member of the 1993 national championship team under legendary coach bobby bowden. he would go on to build one of the fastest-growing, minority-owned construction businesses in the country. wayne married his college sweetheart and business partner, angela, more than 20 years ago. they have three children, wayne ii, and twin daughters, kayla and kyla. issues while lacking name recognition outside florida, messam told cnn that under his leadership, the city of miramar has passed living wage legislation and has made great strides recovering from hurricane irma. he has also filed a lawsuit against the state so local mayors can advocate for gun control in their cities. these are issues that have national implications and i'm looking forward to be that agent of change for the american people and i'm so excited to launch my candidacy to be the president of the united states, he said.

and so, you're right, nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following supreme court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. but people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. and this becomes i think a symbol of a process that, if republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're democrats or republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the senate.

so during that span of time when there was just nothing for people to do to take care of themselves, cannabis emerged really early on as helpful with some of the symptoms. nobody thought weed was going to cure aids (laughter). but it helped with the wasting syndrome, which manifested with a total loss of appetite and crushing nausea. cannabis was good for that. it helped with insomnia, depression, pain. so people began to turn to cannabis to help feel a little better while this horrible, horrible thing was going on. and in the case of the wasting syndrome, it helped them eat. it helped them hang on longer. it became very important.

-- sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) used a visit to the early primary state of south carolina to pitch himself to black voters in a stark difference from his 2016 campaign. annie linskey and david weigel report: 'racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality,' sanders said, in a speech that used the refrain 'racism is alive' to walk through a litany of problems faced by minorities. the changes from sanders's last campaign were hard to miss. in 2016, he said that 'identity politics' distracted from what he considered real issues, like economic inequality and the decline of organized labor. this week, on his first trip to an early-primary state since the midterm elections, sanders called [trump] a 'racist,' pushed for an end to private prisons, endorsed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote and advocated for an end to the cash bail system. he spoke at two black churches, mingled with supporters at a barbecue joint and met with the state's legislative black caucus, which had largely rejected him in 2016.

-- the narrative: democratic presidential candidates across the board are embracing liberal and populist policies, demonstrating how much the party has transformed in recent years. david weigel and jenna johnson report: for years, democratic presidential candidates have been skittish about taking positions that were considered too liberal, for fear of scaring off moderates and independent voters. that caution seems to be gone, along with soul-searching about making explicit appeals to conservative voters. … the party's swift shift has left vulnerable several democratic candidates or likely ones who have voting records and previous stances that are out-of-line with current democratic thinking. those who defend their earlier stances risk seeming stuck in time to party that's quickly transforming, while those who have changed their positions risk being labeled as flip-floppers and opportunists.

totenberg: actually, the opposite - the longer a decision is in place, the more weight it has. and in the case of abortion, that decision has been repeatedly reaffirmed over a period of 43 years - versus the same-sex marriage decision, which is just 17 months old. and, indeed, while the court has fleshed out how far states can go in regulating abortions, it's not fleshed out how far states go in discriminating against same-sex couples on religious grounds.

1986: bruce hornsby & the range rca records nominees: glass tiger, nu shooz, simply red and timbuk3 prior to launching his solo career, singer-pianist bruce hornsby played clubs and bars, served as a session musician, and toured with sheena easton's band. in 1986 he released the way it is, the debut album from bruce hornsby & the range (the range included david mansfield, george marinelli, john molo, joe puerta). the album's title track, with its references to the civil rights movement, hit the top of the charts and has since been sampled by various hip-hop artists. the success of the album, which also featured singles mandolin rain and every little kiss, landed them the best new artist grammy. since then, hornsby has put out albums with and without the range; toured with the grateful dead; and formed the band, the noisemakers. the virginia native received another grammy in 1990 for his reworking of the valley road with the nitty gritty dirt band, and his track (song h) was nominated for best pop instrumental at the 2007 grammy awards.

a couple of years ago, i decided to move my movie collection to digital. but after the simpsons self-blacklister announced that digital copies would be scrubbed of the problematic episode, that even if you purchased the episode digitally, they were going to go in and remove it, i've gotten smarter. even if i already have a digital copy, i went back and purchased hard copies of movies and tv shows that are wonderfully problematic.

jay inslee jay inslee announces 2020 presidential bid 00:36 biography born and raised in seattle, inslee received a bachelor's degree in economics from the university of washington in 1973 and a j.d. from willamette university college of law in oregon three years later. after working in private law for more than a decade, he successfully ran for a seat in the washington house of representatives, where he served for four years until his successful bid for congress in 1992. inslee represented the state's 4th congressional district for one term until his reelection bid was thwarted during the so-called republican revolution of 1994. during the following years, he unsuccessfully ran for governor and served as a regional department of health and human services (hhs) director under president clinton. inslee ran for congress again in 1998 and defeated a republican incumbent in washington's 1st congressional district, which he went on to represent for nearly 12 years. during his congressional tenure, the washington lawmaker was a vocal critic of the war in iraq and an early proponent of federal initiatives to reduce greenhouse gases and the american economy's reliance on fossil fuels. inslee left congress in 2012 to launch his ultimately successful bid to be governor in washington, defeating the state's republican attorney general in the general election. after winning reelection in november 2016 -- the same time mr. trump unexpectedly won the presidency -- inslee declared that washington was, is and will always be a beacon for progressive values.

it's very rare to find a purely conservative or a purely liberal congregation, tooley says. so if there is some sort of a division, or if there's the creation of a new liberal methodist church, that almost inevitably will generate painful divisions in local congregations. often the clergy are more liberal than the laity. so in many situations, you may have pastors who would like to join the new, more liberal denomination, but a majority of the lay people in their church may prefer to stay in the old denomination.

after a nosey member of the community found out shelly fitzgerald was married and informed her employer, she was called into the office. not because they wanted to congratulate her on her previously unknown marriage, but because they wanted to fire her. for 15 years, shelly has worked as a guidance counselor at roncalli high school (rhs), a catholic high school in indiana. and when the school found out she was married to a woman they were not pleased. they gave her a choice: she could either dissolve her marriage or resign from her job. shelly isn't taking this lying down, she says she has no intention of leaving the woman she loves who she has been with for more than two decades. and she plans to hire a lawyer. but should she have to? the school says they have every right to force shelly to choose since all employees know that they are expected to support the teachings of the catholic church both in and out of school. that includes the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman.

during his second term, inslee has been a frequent cable news critic of the president and, with the help of the state's attorney general, bob ferguson, has challenged some of the trump administration's policies, including the travel ban, through high-profile lawsuits. in a campaign video focused on climate change, inslee announced his white house bid on march 1. issues inslee will make climate change the top issue of his 2020 campaign, hoping to draw sharp contrasts with the environmental policies of mr. trump, who has repeatedly cast doubt on human-induced climate change, and even called it a chinese hoax. he has been an ardent backer of sweeping federal action to mitigate the irreparable harm climate change is having on the global environment since his days in congress. with most 2020 democrats throwing their support for the audacious green new deal proposal introduced by new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, inslee's focus on climate change has the potential to gain traction among democratic primary voters and prompt fellow contenders to discuss the issue even more during the nomination process. inslee is also likely on the campaign trail to tout the growing economy in his deep-blue state, his role in the passage of a net neutrality bill and what he called the best paid family leave and one of the best minimum wages in the country. controversy inslee's tenures in congress and as washington's governor have largely been scandal-free.

warren was re-elected in 2018, and announced an exploratory committee for a presidential run dec. 31. warren and her second husband, bruce mann, have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. they live in cambridge, massachusetts with their golden retriever, bailey, who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender. key issues warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-wall street crusader. the 69-year-old senator serves on the senate committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs committee and the health, education, labor, and pensions committee in the senate, and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. in one instance, she helped to derail then-president obama's nomination of investment banker antonio weiss to a top position at the treasury department in 2015. fixing a rigged economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. i've spent my career getting to the bottom of why america's promise works for some families, but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster, warren said in a video announcing her presidential exploratory committee. what i found is terrifying. these aren't cracks that families are falling into. they're traps. america's middle class is under attack. how do we get here? billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.

after longtime new jersey senator frank lautenberg died in the summer of 2013, booker ran to fill his seat and defeated a little-known republican mayor in a special election. in 2014, he won reelection to serve a full term in the senate. during his years in the senate, he has sought to promote bipartisanship through conciliatory rhetoric. booker announced he was running for president on feb. 1, 2019, the first day of black history month. issues he has made criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana integral issues of his agenda in the senate. pointing to the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana-related offenses, he crafted the marijuana justice act in the summer of 2017. the bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 controlled substances act, withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance, require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called war on drugs. the junior senator from new jersey is one of the chief architects of the first step act, a landmark bill that president trump signed into law in december after rare overwhelming bipartisan support in congress. the legislation increases investment in programs to curb recidivism among federal prisoners and modifies several sentencing laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. although he hopes to tout it as a signature achievement of his career in congress, booker acknowledged that the bill is just one stepping stone to overhaul the criminal justice system.

sanders apologized to the two women who had settled with becker, and said that he was not aware of the settlement. what trump says president trump has alternated between praising sanders and insulting him as crazy. as some of mr. trump and sanders' populist ideas overlap, mr. trump often said during the 2016 campaign that sanders voters would defect to him over hillary clinton in the general election. mr. trump also accused clinton of cheating to take the nomination away from sanders, and criticized sanders for eventually endorsing clinton. while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers, mr. trump tweeted in july 2016. wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary, he wrote in another july tweet. in several subsequent tweets, mr. trump has called sanders crazy bernie. he has often referred to the 2016 democratic primary during his two years in office, sometimes in an effort to cast him as the face of the party's more extreme elements.

and at that point the process has broken down. democrats have not been blameless in this process. you cannot point to me a circumstance in which democrats have left a seat open when a republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.

but he would have these grand mal seizures. and sometimes they led to psychological instability, as well as memory loss. but i find it fascinating because the idea of a spiritually associated seizure is not new. dostoyevsky wrote rapturously about seizures. and some pretty interesting historical figures have been posthumously diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. so i don't know if my dad might be in that category. in any case, it was a strong force in his life.

totenberg: right. we get a conservative for a seat previously held by a conservative, as opposed to the centrist liberal garland likely would have been. this, in some ways, is the dress rehearsal for the next nomination, which, if it happens, will make all the difference in the world. two of the justices, ruth bader ginsburg and justice anthony kennedy, are over 80. justice breyer is 78.

in fact, mr. trump's policy of us going it alone, of america first, of having no values, no allies, and no strategy is disastrous for us. the biggest threat to america right now in terms of our safety of our citizens is climate. and it's time for us to deal with it that way. every single foreign policy issue is about american leadership and coalition.

adrianne miller – president trump commuted the remaining sentence of adrianne miller. this commutation is supported by former u.s. attorney brett tolman and the clemency for all non-violent drug offenders (can-do) foundation. ms. miller has served 6 years of a 15-year sentence after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and possession of a list i chemical. ms. miller, who has struggled with drug addiction, has fully committed to rehabilitation while in prison. in addition, she has taken numerous courses including drug education, life management, and has participated in the life connections program, an intensive, multi-phase re-entry program offered by the bureau of prisons. she is extremely remorseful, regrets her destructive choices and has taken full responsibility for her actions.

on immigration, o'rourke has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and but has shifted to a more progressive stance on the issue recently. in 2014, he called president obama's executive action creating the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program to shield young undocumented immigrants from deportation noble but hard to stomach because he believed it bypassed congress. he also backed ohio rep. tim ryan's leadership challenge against then-minority leader nancy pelosi in 2016. o'rourke launched a long-shot, insurgent campaign to oust cruz in 2018. his robust senate bid in texas -- along with his obama-esque oratory powers and social media dominance on the campaign trail -- catapulted him to national fame. although he failed to unseat cruz, o'rourke shattered fundraising records, galvanized a broad electoral coalition in texas -- including the state's large and growing latino community -- and lost by less than three percentage points. no democrat had come that close to winning a senate race in texas since 1988. despite the loss, o'rourke left many wondering if he would be running for president. although he told 60 minutes shortly before the election that he was completely ruling out running for president for 2020, o'rourke admitted shortly after the election that he had become open to the idea. issues in his six years in congress, o'rourke supported the legalization of marijuana, investing in clean energy like solar and wind to combat climate change, more expansive gun control legislation, lgbt rights and had a pro-choice stance on abortion rights.
and the way you do that is with drug courts. the way you do that, by the way, is with my proposal for a clemency board in the white house so that you don't have a president that pell-mell gives pardons to his buddies and to white-collar offenders, but that, instead, you have a set process that you use that's fair and is outside of the justice department, and while getting their advice.

aviem sella – president trump granted a full pardon to aviem sella. mr. sella is an israeli citizen who was indicted in 1986 for espionage in relation to the jonathan pollard case. mr. sella's request for clemency is supported by the prime minister of israel benjamin netanyahu, israeli ambassador to the united states ron dermer, the united states ambassador to israel david friedman, and miriam adelson. the state of israel has issued a full and unequivocal apology, and has requested the pardon in order to close this unfortunate chapter in u.s.-israel relations.

volz: he takes, not dilantin, but another medication. i think it's tegretol. and he says he hasn't had a seizure in 20 years.

frum: you know, it's kind of a screwy poll, i have to say. among other things, one of the questions it asks, are you less likely to vote for the president because of his stance on same-sex marriage.
mr. president, thank you so much for your time. we appreciate it.
number two, when you talk about money, let's put this in perspective. the federal budget is $4.5 trillion a year. we get $3.5 trillion in revenue. we lose $1 trillion a year.
there's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the supreme court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. george washington nominated a couple of supreme court justices in his last year. and obviously george washington had better poll numbers, i'm sure, than i did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, i think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.

democratic candidates oftentimes talk about jefferson, and madison, and founding ideals – but we need candidates that can talk about matthew, mark, luke, and john, hale said, referring to the first four books of the christian new testament. a democrat's not going to win a majority of the evangelical vote, but you can't win 10 or 15% and expect to win this election.
big fight in a small town
another place she seems to feel open and comfortable is on social media.
but can you blame the republicans who look at this nomination and say, there's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court. so can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win the presidential nomination [sic]. and if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the democrats do the same? they called — they're all already calling it the biden rule.

hipolito acosta, former undercover ins agent: yes to both of your questions.
burnett: the romney camp is not hanging back, rolling out its own video attacking the president's record on debt, announcing plans for a speech on the deficit tomorrow and, i have to say, sending e-mails and finding private phone numbers of members of the media to send or their p.r. people to send their stats on jobs. so, fighting back hard.
sanders: you know, pete mentioned -- i'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight.
rippon, 28, certainly hasn't shied from embracing who he is on the international stage -- and that included criticizing vice president mike pence's views on the lgbt issues in an interview with usa today sports last month.
it potentially could show the audience of the family leader a visible, positive representation of an out gay man who's running for the highest office in our land, he said. so maybe it could potentially change people's hearts and minds — or at least get them to think more broadly.

we had a very candid conversation. he's chief judge of the d.c. circuit, so i assume that he either reads the washington post or listens to npr, and i think had a pretty good sense of the posture that majority leader mcconnell took immediately after justice scalia's passing — the notion that the republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.
plans for the rally come days after a homophobic campaign video supporting putin appeared on social media, warning that his opponents will take the country into a nightmare future where people are forced to cohabitate with gays and lesbians.
king put the two on the spot by asking where they see themselves in the next 10 years, and it turns out the country crooner has no hesitation about continuing to be by stefani's side.
then, one stormy night, while sipping a glass of malbec, as ling and chan were enjoying their catnip, ling jumped up on jonas and rolled over on her back, paws up. taking advantage of the situation, jonas grabbed a q-tip and some wet ones and figured out a way to give ling a waterless pedicure. he was elated, but felt that something was missing. what his cats needed was a nice color of nail polish to complete the look.
that accusation was made by ex-punter chris kluwe in a january 2014 essay he wrote for deadspin in which he claimed that his advocacy for same-sex marriage probably led to his release the previous year by minnesota after eight seasons with the team. kluwe wrote that, in addition to the nuke comment, priefer's other remarks on the topic included: disgust at the thought of two men kissing; belittling any idea of acceptance or tolerance; and claiming more than once that the punter would wind up burning in hell with the gays.

sagal: hey. how are things in hickory, n.c.?
corker: the question is what's really happened here and do we have laws that affect what's been happening. there's some very specific language in the volcker rule that really -- that talks about hedging and it talks about aggregate, it talks about unique trades and the fact is nobody yet has been able to determine whether this is something that could stay in place or not.

so she would use the stroller to transport the brownies. and we'd go from business to business. and her customers just absolutely adored me and fawned over me. so i was very little. obviously, i don't remember much clearly from this period. but i do have these flashes of memory. and there's a certain feeling that comes to me when i think of it. it was a very exuberant period in the city and especially in the castro, where my mom was mostly working. and there was, i think, a lot of cheek-pinching and fawning and a lot of joy around it is the feeling that i get, anyway.

perhaps because of her demeanor of self-effacing, even demure, modesty, it's been easy to underestimate kidman over the course of a career that now spans three decades. but this week has offered a reminder of why we should prize an actress who has fashioned one of the most fascinating careers in a business notorious for pigeonholing its starlets early, keeping them boxed in and discarding them when their physical attributes show signs of sagging, bagging or otherwise naturally evolving.

avlon: well, look, follow the money. that's one of the tougher things to do, but certainly in this specific case calling for a hearing is a step in the right direction. the question is, is it not just about asking regulators what went wrong but bringing members of jpmorgan chase and of course this is all complicated by the fact that jpmorgan chase has been the responsible bank and they've been powerfully arguing against regulation, against the volcker rule. well, that argument is going to be a lot tougher to make going forward as we find out this loss isn't two billion as they said last week, but now four billion perhaps or higher. this is a complicated position they find themselves in of their own making.
but biden's emphasis on social justice issues over social policy flashpoints like abortion mirrors an ongoing struggle in the catholic church between pope francis, with his pastoral approach, and the church's more conservative wing.

there are many misconceptions about investing based on your values, namely that you won't see much of a return. but that's largely a myth, experts say. it is not as much a choice of do good or do well, said greg vigrass, president and chief executive of folio institutional, which builds robo-adviser technology for financial advisers. it is very possible these days to invest along the lines of your beliefs and value system and not give up anything in investment returns. folio allows investors to invest in their beliefs by, for example, excluding securities of companies that participate in factory farming or alcohol. performance depends on funds, though some asset managers believe these types of funds do better than the s&p 500 and others do not.

this moment in our history — a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol — i think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.

it's nothing new for actresses to search out envelopes to push, edges to explore or boundaries to transgress in the name of publicity, stretching or simply staying relevant. in kidman's case, her finest performance may be a cumulative one, far outstripping the workaday job of taking a character from the page to the stage. her genius is just as strategic as it is technical, in how she's consistently leveraged stardom on behalf of growth, taste and sophistication. with her preternatural technical and physical gifts, she easily could have been sleepwalking through the past 30 years. instead, she's chosen to keep her eyes wide open.

you can choose to have whatever opinion you have on the president's statement today condemning white supremacists, but it's hard to believe he would have read it out if he'd had his druthers. no, the real donald trump was the one we saw on saturday when he decided to condemn violence 'on many sides' in response to the deliberately provocative and intentionally violent neo-nazi march in charlottesville, virginia; when he decided to refer to the events as 'sad' in tweets; when he wished 'best regards' to those injured by the car that was deliberately smashed into them, killing 1 and injuring 20. when he acted in that way, he was operating according to his instinct. and his instinct said: do not attack the white supremacists.

-- the trump administration asked the court to accelerate the review of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census. barnes reports: last week, u.s. district judge jesse m. furman of new york ordered the administration to stop its plans to add the question to the survey. furman said commerce secretary wilbur ross broke a 'veritable smorgasbord' of federal rules by overriding the advice of career officials who said including the citizenship question was likely to cut down the response rate and make the census less accurate. normally, the justice department's next stop would be the u.s. court of appeals for the 2nd circuit. but solicitor general noel j. francisco said that would not leave enough time for a final ruling from the supreme court. 'the government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of june 2019 to enable it to be printed on time,' he told the court.
