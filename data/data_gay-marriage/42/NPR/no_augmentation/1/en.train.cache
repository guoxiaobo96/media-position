van meter also displays a real talent for crafting characters that feel real, with impulses both good and bad, and the capacity to love and to hurt. particularly memorable is evie's mother, deeply flawed but not irredeemable, indifferent and aloof and always looking to the sky. van meter has a keen eye for family dynamics, capturing the love and resentment that sometimes exist side by side in a family.

at the time i was in a sketch-writing class and i was so upset by these auditions i was going out on that i wrote a character and i called her the terrorist's wife. and my thing was that all women really are, at the end of the day, so similar regardless of what they wear, and a lot of the time we think that because a woman is dressed in hijab she's going to be a certain way, and she's going to react to certain things a particular way, we put all of this on people. my character was the opposite. i wanted to flip that whole thing.

one of the things that the trump family has always understood is that part of their business success needs to be making sure that no law enforcement agent or district attorney or prosecutor is going to blow the whistle. ... he has managed through money and charm to keep law enforcement at bay, and he has never been called to account. and what we find is that each time he is not called to account, he feels more powerful to go even further the next time. we see this exact pattern with ukraine. [the] mueller report does not lead to an impeachment. the day after mueller testifies, [trump] calls the president of ukraine and asks him to interfere in the 2020 election. so what is at balance in this upcoming impeachment trial? this is the final way to call donald trump to account. if he is not called to account, i think we can only expect what we've seen in the past, which is that he feels even more empowered to break rules, break norms in the way he's been doing.

the exchange alarmed officials at conservative religious schools, for which the loss of tax-exempt status or federal funding would be devastating. their anxiety deepened a year later, when the obama administration notified colleges and universities that it interpreted title ix as prohibiting discrimination based on a student's gender identity, including discrimination based on a student's transgender status. christian schools saw that letter as threatening a loss of federal funding if they refused to accommodate students who identify as transgender and want to be housed with other students who share their gender identity.

(fact check: it was six million european jews who were killed in the holocaust.) ... he has undermined the judiciary ... called experts stupid ... threatened to whack mayors who stood in the way of his tactics ... upset about traffic, he called the pope a son of a whore ... joked about a woman who was raped. ...

for years now, lawyers have been floating proposals that future high-court justices spend no more than 18 years at a time on the supreme court bench. the plan would space out appointments, so presidents would make appointments every two years, supporters said. that would bring regular turnover and fresh thinking to the court — and align with the longer life spans of americans since the nation's founding, they argue.

adjei-brenyah, like jones, wrestled with issues of race in his fiction, but he did so in radically different ways. his collection friday black deployed stories of dystopia and fantasy to, in the words of critic lily meyer, turn over ideas about racism, about classism and capitalism, about the apocalypse, and, most of all, about the corrosive power of belief.

so far, at least, guzman is attentive to gay and transgender students despite her school's official belief that human beings are created as gendered beings and that heterosexuality is god's design.
mayer: well, so this is what was interesting to me - is that pence has been very close with the kochs, and they have just showered money on his campaigns. and he's kind of act as a peacemaker between the kochs and trump. and but in that process, what interested me most was that i really do think that trump ran as a different kind of republican. he ran against the big-donors orthodoxy and kind of libertarian vision of people like the kochs. he said he was going to deliver something for the little guys and build infrastructure all across the country and use the government in various ways that the kochs disapprove of.
the goal of the meeting is to agree on next steps for the couple. it follows days of discussions at buckingham palace and consultations between palace officials and members of the british and canadian governments about the couple's options.

the newlywed masoud signed a marriage contract a year and a half ago, but in gaza's socially conservative society, he couldn't live together with his wife until he threw the requisite parties. he asked his father for cash, but he too is out of work.
roberts: anybody who did that would be doing it for the purpose of saying we just can't stomach donald trump. and we're giving people an opportunity to vote for neither him nor hillary clinton, knowing that hillary clinton would then win. so the democrats are dying for it to happen. but i think the likelihood is slim to none.

and i thought about that conversation a lot, and i thought about it after the midterm elections. and i went back to her, and i said, see? look what happened. people actually came out, and their voices mattered. and then she pointed to some of the negative rhetoric that's happened even since then. and i closed the book with saying i think we're both right. change takes time. it takes a lot of hard work. i remember when one of my best days in the administration was the day when the marriage equality decision came down. and yes, it felt like a thunderbolt of equality, but you can't forget that it took decades of people working really hard to make that day possible.

inskeep: instead, utah lawmakers passed legislation that was backed by the mormon church and by pro-gay rights organizations. it protects lgbt people in the workplace and elsewhere, although not in religious institutions.
david: i think that people still want to come, which i kind of find a little shocking. but employers are more reluctant to sponsor people because the process, especially in the employment-based green card realm or even for nonimmigrant visas in the h1-b categories - they've made it much harder for employers to want to sponsor somebody. they've made it much harder for employers to have applications approved. and so i think in the employment-based arena, i think employers have slowed down the process.
in regular phase 4, all businesses are open with capacity limits and other safety measures.

hasan minhaj: suddenly, america's marriage of convenience with saudi arabia is starting to feel outdated. how outdated? our military has been working in saudi arabia for decades. and if you are sent on a training mission in saudi arabia, this is the official military document you get. it describes the saudi people as indigenous tribes with some later mixture of negro blood from slaves imported from africa. oh, america, even in boring technical manuals, you still somehow managed to be racist.

his tragic drama the edge of heaven features a scene in which the coffin of a turkish woman murdered in germany is unloaded from a plane in turkey and another in which a german woman murdered in turkey is unloaded from a plane in germany. rarely is despair so symmetrical. in this movie, in the fade, the suspects in the bombing that killed katja's husband and son include the turkish mafia, the kurds and those familiar western european scapegoats the albanians. but katja suspects it was none of them, that it was neo-nazis striking willy-nilly at interracial couples. in the movie's middle section, she glowers across a courtroom at the accused murderers, a husband and wife, and is unable to comprehend their clear, untroubled faces or the sneering persistence of their defense attorney to raise doubts about a case that seems open and shut.
roberts: for some reason, they actually wanted to publish other people, too. and my agent had been encouraging me to take a pseudonym, and i really didn't want to. she said, nora, there's pepsi, there's diet pepsi and there's caffeine-free pepsi. and that's when my light bulb went off and, oh, let me rethink.
gross: mary tyler moore, thank you very much for talking with us.
but the whole episode, topped off by his support for the abortion measure, which was denounced by a significant number of pro-life female republican state legislators, had its effect. until he was chosen for the no. 2 spot on the national ticket, polls showed pence only an even bet for re-election.

keith: sanders drew a crowd of 900 people in a town of only about 9,000. several said he was getting them engaged in politics in a way they haven't been before. and if they show up - if turnout is strong - then sanders says he will win.

mayer: so he doesn't. it's interesting. i kept asking his office, you know, does he have a portfolio? and they were waving me off that they said, no, he doesn't have a particular portfolio. he is sort of just general counselor to the president in many, many different areas.

i think the idea of a woman having her period, a lot of people know it's such a normal thing, but it's made into such a big thing, we have to keep it so secret and all of that. so fats is obviously coming very much from that point of view, and the moment shugs comes out complaining about having, i got my period and my stomach hurts, fats just quarantines her. so we've taken it to an absurd level of, you have your period, you got to be quarantined. so we have do not cross police tape and the episode has hazmat suits and ... it's like she's disposing of a bomb, basically.

not even an hour after the meeting, kessler sent a text message to times reporter emily steel saying that he wanted to meet again. that afternoon, at the back of a chinese restaurant, kessler steered the two times reporters, steel and bernstein, toward what he argued was a different scandal: the behavior of the two lawyers they had just met. kessler alleged the attorneys wanted to turn his material to their own advantage, rather than that of their clients — the women who said they had been victimized by epstein and his social circle.
andrew bird: i was fresh out of music school working at a renaissance fair in southern wisconsin.
of the accounts that talked about guns, 60 percent were pro-nra and pro-gun, while only 15 percent were opposed. and of the content the internet research agency produced that mentioned firearms, guns, the second amendment or the nra, 77 percent of the posts were pro-nra and pro-gun.
and so, you know, you'll come in in the morning, and you'll say, well, when do i write? and they'll say, well, you can write between 4 and 6. and that's when you have to write. and, you know, there's no muse. it's the craft of writing, the inspiration for writing has to be the writing itself. and so - which isn't to say that there aren't days that i don't have anything, and those days i tend not to push it because i know that a bad writing day is not a productive writing day. but, you know, i guess i have a really good sense of how long something's going to take me.
gross: and this was during the folk music revival. so the musicians who you mentioned were really revered. and there was a growing awareness and growing popularity of folk music. so you were a part of this really important culture or subculture as a child and as a young woman and an adult. then when you were a child, your mother was working at the folk music center. and she had her hands full because she had three children. you had two brothers.
yearwood: he didn't tell me for a while.
martin: right. things that, i mean, so many of us grapple with...
a parallel issue to what we've been talking about - we've been talking about inclusion of women - parallel issue is the predatory behavior of certain men in hollywood - directors, actors, heads of companies. harvey weinstein, of course, comes to mind. i'm wondering what impact you think that might be having on the inclusion issue because we've seen how some men in hollywood have misused their power to assault or harass women. and that might be a compelling argument for hiring more women to...

minhaj: you know, i definitely knew about her. and as i was growing up, you know, she was doing - she got an opportunity to do residency in rotations in new york and then in stockton. so over the course of my life, she moved closer and closer to us.
tur: yeah, marco rubio's quite tall. i am much shorter than marco rubio. i think he means that not only in a physically demeaning way, but in a - you know, as an intimidation tactic. you're little. you're young, and you're inexperienced, and you can be pushed around. you're not a political heavyweight. you're not one of the big guns. i presume that's sort of how he means it. but he's also a literal - a very literal guy. when he sees someone who is little - and i am little - i think he is apt to say just that. that person is a little person.
franklin: yeah 'cause i don't like shaving either. it's like, you know, for any activity.
and we will never stop fighting for a democracy that works for all of us, for a prosperous and equitable minnesota that we will all be proud of, she said. i will never give up fighting for you, and i hope you will never give up fighting for me.
rocca: and my mother said - she said, (imitating his mother) people today, they are so blase. she said, in 1969, when they landed on the moon, we were paralyzed with excitement.
gross: when you say that thing, was it your hair, or was it a wig?
pusha t: you know, what a lot of people don't understand is that everything else is basically homegrown. i actually lived one mile from pharrell williams and chad hugo, who were the neptunes, maybe a mile and a half from timbaland. missy elliott was across town. we all lived very, very, very close.
gross: the interview with jill ker conway that we just heard was recorded in 1989 after the publication of her first memoir, the road to coorain. we're going to continue our remembrance of her with the interview we recorded in 1994 after the publication of her second memoir, true north, about setting out for harvard alone, leaving behind her suffocating family and a culture hostile to aspiring women. for the first time, she found friends she could talk to without censoring her words or emotions. and she found her niche as a scholar of women's history. to her surprise, she fell in love with and married the historian john conway, even though she'd always thought that marriage was not for her.
in a 2005 interview with fresh air, wilder said that those moments with his mother sustained him throughout his career. when your mother gives you confidence about anything that you do, you carry that confidence with you, he told terry gross. she made me believe that i could make someone laugh.

having first existed as the course of honour, an original work uploaded to the fanfiction site archive of our own (ao3), the revised winter's orbit remains true to its fannish origins, skewing more toward one genre than the other. as a romance, winter's orbit delivers on its promises like a well-inked marriage contract: there will be misinterpreted touches and only one bed; they will get stranded on an icy mountain. as a space opera, its specifics are blurred, acting more as backdrop than real plot driver.
the net worth of americans aged 18 to 35 has dropped 34 percent since 1996, according to a new study. it blames housing, education, and health care costs. kasey lobaugh of deloitte discusses.
new yorker staff writer jeffrey toobin discusses leonard leo, the conservative lawyer who is responsible, to a considerable extent, for one third of the justices on the supreme court.
garcia-navarro: and we're left with this image of katherine. someone said to me, who'd also seen the film, she has privilege but not power. do you see her as someone who has power at the end of the film?
e harper: yes, he did. he - when i met leonard and he said that he had had a drinking problem in high school, but that he had - he was - had taken care of it. he wasn't - he didn't have a problem anymore. i believed him 100%. we just didn't know much about addiction back then. we didn't have rehab centers. and people just weren't aware of what it meant. if you were an alcoholic, you probably - you didn't have the willpower to stop drinking, rather than having a disease or - and so as we approached life and our marriage, leonard's problem did come back and get worse and worse. and i did - i went to al-anon as a way to learn to cope with it. and that was something he did not - i snuck out, actually. and he caught me, and he got very angry, yes. and he did get violent.
legend: yeah. so many of the songs on once again are some of my favorites. i'm going to keep trying to top them. so hopefully we'll be saying that about my next album, too.
and the other part that i think is so important - and i have sat in on meetings that are known as the principals meetings that are held in the situation room of the white house where the national security adviser tries to develop a policy to give to the president. and the major part of that that makes it valuable is for the departments to state their views clearly, to have a certain amount of discourse and maybe even dissent because that's what's democratic, is to understand, what are the various paths to follow? how do you get from point a to point b? what does the state department do? what does the commerce department do? and that's the part that's really important - to what extent does the president appreciate when there are dissenting views when they are presented in a way - president clinton used to love to have us come and argue in front of him so that we really had to understand what we were all for. and i can't tell to what extent that goes on now.
don't get me wrong, as a descendant of slaves, i fully appreciate the civil rights movement itself. it's just a tough genre to pull off artistically. it's far too easy for these films to succumb to chin-to-the-sky self-righteous squinting at the heavens. what many films based on historical events lack is the uncertainty of the moment they're trying to reproduce — the doubt of outcome, the insecurity about the effectiveness of the strategy being utilized.
yearwood: actually, he makes me get up first. and i get up and i turn the fog machine on, and then he comes up through the floor.
that was a lot, elizarraras groans.
and for that, we owe smith everything. —talia schlanger (host, world cafe)
gross: well, you know, i mean, this was before the access hollywood tape was revealed, so you didn't know about that. but he did already have a reputation for behaving inappropriately around women. so did that figure into your reaction to that kiss as well?
the senator has always understood that people in positions of power have a responsibility not only for what they say, but for what people hear, said pablo carrillo, who worked for mccain for 15 years and served as his chief of staff from 2013 to 2017. and in that sense, i think that his approach to governing and leadership would have been guided by that in mind. indeed, that's something that we are well-served in remembering, especially those with responsibility.

akhavan: my family and i - see, there were very few things that everyone in the house could agree on. and her and mel brooks were two comedians that we just all loved. and she lost herself in all these different characters and just made you laugh, that there was just - there was no vanity there. it was just comedy. and that's the thing. if - i think if you can make, like, someone's immigrant dad laugh along with their teenage kids, then you're on to something.

there are still many states where you can be fired for being gay, and perhaps most significantly trans people are really being targeted by the trump administration for discrimination, bull said. he's put a ban on openly trans people serving in the military, and religious right activists are organizing at the grassroots level to make life harder for trans people, with bathroom bills and all kinds of legislation aimed at stemming the equality movement on behalf of trans people.

sagal: clearly hoping to prove that they could do just as good a job under trump as they did under george w. bush.
and if you cast the same actor in both roles, then you obviously have a family resemblance because they are actually the same person. but you also can't necessarily root entirely for one and against the other because they are the same person. and, you know, one of the best ideas that we had in creating these characters was, you know, the moment that ewan agreed to shave his head to play the balding, portly brother, it freed us up to put any kind of hair we wanted on the older, richer brother.
legend: no, this is - it's part of life.
when he was 15 years old, his parents sent him to study in france, so that he could return as an administrator, like his father. he paid for his initial rent in europe with three kilograms of coffee from home — a fact that provided the title for his autobiography. he had been sent abroad to study philosophy, but instead fell in love with american jazz. as he told whyy's fresh air in 1990, his parents were extremely upset by his decision to pursue music professionally, and cut him off.
montanaro: (laughter) of course it's not easy. the problem here is that republicans have been waiting for this moment for a decade - to control congress and the presidency again. they aren't about to give that up so easily and quickly. in fact, this morning on cbs, house speaker paul ryan knocked down the idea of working across the aisle on health care.
i am a 25-year-old single woman nearly done with graduate school. i'm on the search for a single man within my age range, but i often find myself attracted to men in their late 30s to early 40s. i don't intend for this to happen. i met a man at a bookstore recently, and we went on a lovely date. when we realized the age gap was more than 12 years, we mutually decided not to pursue a relationship and remained friends. this pattern has repeated itself with different men. and yet i find, when i try to date men my own age, they're unavailable. either they have partners or they can't keep up with me in terms of emotional maturity. would it be a waste of my youth to experiment with older men?
as part of our commitment to building a just and loving society, we must build a culture that cherishes the dignity and sanctity of innocent human life, he said. all children born and unborn are made in the holy image of god. the crowd stood and roared.
and that was a real lesson both for leo and for the republican party, which was that the conservative movement cares so much about these supreme court appointments that they will turn even on their own president, as they turned on george w. bush, because he didn't nominate a true conservative. and heading into the first republican president since george w. bush, that was the political environment that leo both recognized and helped create, which is that we the conservative movement care about this, we expect a nominee who will please us and that has to be a priority.
we didn't know each other that well. we had met a few times and corresponded a fair amount, but you never know how that will work when you're sitting side by side each other at a keyboard trying to write something funny. we really only got to know each other properly through doing that.

whether fleabag reaches such belief, you'll have to decide. for her part, waller-bridge has made a decision of her own. resisting the current imperative to keep shows going season after season, she's already announced that this is the end of fleabag. which is just further proof of how great this show is. after all, if there's anything harder than making a good season of television, it's knowing when you've said what you had to say.
they're also no longer making progress against heart disease, due to higher rates of obesity and tobacco use. while u.s. smoking rates have declined precipitously over the years, they remain stubbornly high in states such as mississippi, kentucky, alabama and tennessee. smoking rates are actually rising among middle-aged white women who lack a bachelor's degree.

the ruling struck down the key section and stripped the justice department of some tools to monitor elections. and several states have since moved to implement stricter voting laws, including requiring voters to show id and redistricting maps without federal approval first.
elving: we simply don't know what the president meant by this. perhaps it was a passing whim, a phrase that occurred to him, sounded good, a comment on how nice all these military leaders and their spouses looked on the eve of what might be our next confrontation with a foreign power. i think we can all hope that's not the case.

castro ortez wanted to call some of his friends to go check on him, but he kept reassuring her he'd be fine. by then it was friday night, three days after frestan went home from work.
so this - you know, it all comes to a head. and chief justice warren in the case says, you know, these laws are a relic of slavery and an instrument of white supremacy. and he says it aloud in - with capital letters. and he's basically, i think, trying to steer the country toward accepting that we can't have a country based on this idea anymore. it's time to put this to bed.
truth be told, i believe that the plan was that she would then get that degree and come back and have a good arranged marriage in india, but my mother being who she was, the daughter of a father who fought for india's independence, she was naturally attracted to the civil rights movement that was exploding all over the united states — but also in the bay area... she became very involved in the civil rights movement, and met my father. instead of going back to india and having an arranged marriage, she had a marriage based on love. and that really was, in many ways, an ultimate act of courage and optimism and really set in place the foundation for how i think of the world.

because, you know, it might, you know, ruffle some feathers when i say, yes, we have to strive for 100 percent freedom of the speech because once you open the door to censorship, it never stops with pornography. it never stops with smut. it start to spread. you know, who is going to decide what is obscene, and who is not obscene - what is not obscene?
danforth: yeah. it was an umbrella organization for all these gay conversion centers and preachers which has since disbanded. but she said he went to the conferences and, you know, essentially, he's 50 years old. this has been 30 years of this. and he still is, you know, living a life of denial and shame. so that's a consequence as well.
some groups have also noted that because an opposition to extramarital sex is also a protected belief, the proposed mississippi bill could also impact unmarried couples and single mothers.
dan diamond: i think that would be an overstatement, but there's certainly much more representation in this administration of those views than in previous republican administrations and certainly a major departure from the obama team. there are a significant cohort of folks who work together as advocates in the anti-abortion, anti-lgbt movements before coming into government. and that's unusual and notable.

i also - i think as - when i was very young, i did, you know, like a lot of young people do, i made a strong connection between myself - i'm in ireland, of course, so it was quite ludicrous - and native america. i grew my hair down to my waist when i was 19 at trinity college the first chance i got. the only thing i ever played on the stage was i played - because of my hair, i was cast as tonto, and some other guy, my friend, was cast as the lone ranger. that's as close as i've ever come to acting, and i was dreadful. i - but anyway, you can see that there was a sort of curiosity, and - about the whole thing.
gross: what i like about that scene is that it's clear that the cameron character is too young to have a firm sense of her identity, and what she has as an identity is being drummed out of her. do you want to talk about writing that line, emily, about like, i don't think of myself as anything?

and so we thought, well, why should either of these brothers look like ewan? and if you notice, you know - so we put emmit in a curly haired sort of like, you know, jock-from-the-'80s kind of hair. but he also is wearing these brown contact lenses that change his eyes, which is very dramatic. originally, he was going to wear those contact lenses to play ray, but we liked them so much better as emmit because with ray, then you really get ewan's eyes. you really see that - the empathetic human in there.

our narratives are very different. she grew up in india, like, literally in tooka village. she was around people that loved her and were there for her. and i was this brown kid who was alone in america with his dad. and so when she came back, i was just like, i hate this person. like, who are you? i just want a mom. now i got you.

and so that - i mean, this is one of the tricks about understanding mohammed bin salman, is on one hand, you feel like, you know, you should at least appreciate the ambition. this is a guy who really wants to change things in a country that i think many people felt was in dire need of change in 2015. but sometimes you hear about these project and you just sort of wonder, like, you know, does he really think this is possible? and if it's even possible, is that really a valuable way to spend all that money? like, glow-in-the-dark sand - really?
ross: yes - very much so. and it's something that never would have happened had i remained in the church of christ. he told me further when we got in the car. he said that was the first time since he came out in eighth grade that he had bowed his head and closed his eyes and said a prayer and prayed with the group.

gross: since gay rights and, well, lgbtq rights, and since, like, bathroom access for trans people had become such an issue by the time of the campaign, marriage equality had been won. but you just never know what the future's, you know, going to bring. did you feel, like, protective of your father or that somebody would try to use your father's identity as trans against you in some way, since you had people who were looking for ways to weaken you or diminish you or insult you in some way? and some of those people, like some of the trump supporters, i'm sure, were anti-gay rights and anti trans. so yeah, how did that figure into your calculations when you were thinking about - about your safety, about your identity as a reporter and how somebody with, you know, bad intent might try to, you know, use anything against you?

in recent years, the democrats that they've identified, guys like bart stupak, heath shuler, mike mcintyre, mark pryor, even senator bill nelson down in florida, another conservative democrat, they are a faction within the democratic party that has become an obstacle to many of the core values of the party. that's what the family means when they speak of bipartisanship as this idea that jesus doesn't come to take sides, he comes to take over. the democrats do tend to be folks who get into congress, and i think a lot of them - i think this needs to be emphasized - democrats and republicans get involved with this with the best of intentions.

davies: this is fresh air. and we're speaking with writer deborah feldman. her memoir about growing up in and eventually leaving the satmar hasidic sect in brooklyn was the basis for the netflix series unorthodox. her book, now available in paperback, is unorthodox: the scandalous rejection of my hasidic roots.
if true, it would be a big shift for trump, who last year astonished many conservative christians by publicly telling a pollster that he has never asked god for forgiveness. trump campaign spokeswoman hope hicks has not responded to a request from npr to clarify how trump currently describes his faith.
when he took the stage later wednesday evening at the faith & freedom forum at first baptist north spartanburg, cruz spent the majority of his time talking not just about his own faith but about how that faith led him to argue cases that protected religious monuments. he explained how he would make sure to appoint justices who would not legislate cases on marriage and abortion from the bench.
gross: jonathan safran foer, thank you so much.
at a very young age, i knew i wanted to be a lawyer. and mostly because the heroes among many of the civil rights movements were the lawyers. these individuals who understood the skill of the profession of law to translate the passion from the streets to courtrooms of our country and do the work that we know must constantly be done of reminding people of that promise we articulated in 1776, that we're all equal and should be treated that way.
but everything that happens at a given time in your life has echoes and resonances afterwards - what i would call, like, reprises, really, of thoughts, of moments in your life that happen in different context or - so i thought if i'm going to write the show that goes backwards in time, we'll start with the reprises; that is to say, start with the variation on the theme and then go back to the theme. and that's what happens here. it happens with a lot of other songs in the show, too. but this one very specifically with the lyric because it applies to two very distinct and distinctly defined situations - one a divorce and one when they got married. so you're taking two high spots of their lives, their marriage and their divorce.

and that - that's not true. but that's certainly - i think - a reputation that robin was happy to cultivate. then, when he starts to get into his movies and, you know, especially on popeye and garp, where he's working with renowned directors like robert altman and george roy hill - i mean, these are guys who, you know, they've put in their time too. and they also want to be in control of their projects. and it did lead to conflict, certainly on those first films, that they didn't want that much improvisation from him.
if you don't subscribe to the notion of a wedding as the happiest of all possible endings (and listen, i hear you. i mean, whether or not a marriage proves a happy one, the wedding is less of an ending and more of a beginning, by definition), try the gently funny, pulitzer-winning novel less. i've been talking it up a lot, lately, because i recently returned to it and was reminded of how perfectly, and with what gentle, unlooked-for but thoroughly welcome happiness it ends.
tom gjelten, byline: a new bill was introduced in congress with a title that should get it universal support - fairness for all - fairness for people who identify as lgbtq, but also for those people who believe god made everyone to be either male or female and intends marriage to be the union of one man and one woman.
the controversial proposal by the department of health and human services drew letters from nearly 4,000 organizations and individuals during an unusually short, 20-day public comment period that ended in early march. in their comments, consumer advocacy groups decried the proposal, saying it would wreak havoc by making it harder to get coverage. insurers were generally supportive.

and it goes further, to say that any kind of promotion of these ideas of homosexuality, including by foreigners, can result in prison terms. talking about same sex-marriage positively can lead you to imprisonment for life. and it's really kind of a perfect case study in the export of a lot of american, largely evangelical ideas about homosexuality exported to uganda, which then takes them to their logical end.

so fred trump becomes one of the largest donors to the democratic party. he becomes very, very close to a democratic political club called the madison club. and the way these clubs worked at the time was that they would get people out to the polls and they would sort of offer jobs to the people that were loyal. and they control everything.
she's a bit of a toughie, but tougher on the outside than on the inside, i'd say. she's a good person, but she's definitely prone to selfish acts. the interesting thing about her as a female character — and playing against rob delaney's very sweet, kind of optimistic character — is she's very aware that bad stuff happens and she kind of assumes that bad stuff will happen to her. not a bright, kind of sunny character. so that was always a challenge to make sure that she wasn't too gloomy or too down on things. but it was fun having the male character [be] the kind of chirpy, optimistic one.

gross: president trump isn't very religious, as far as we know. he doesn't appear to be ideologically opposed to abortion or didn't appear to be that way before the election, anyways. and, of course, last week, he spoke at an anti-abortion march. but why has hhs tilted in that direction of christians and catholics who are ideologically opposed to abortion and lgbtq rights?
gross: is the information you're getting saying, basically, that it's too late to prevent a wide outbreak in the u.s.?
gross: and among the things he writes about is housing covenants that prevented african-americans from moving into white neighborhoods. and one way of getting around those covenants was to give money to a white person to buy the house. and then the white person gives the black person the deed to the house, opening the door for the black person or black family to move into that white neighborhood. and so it was interesting for me to read in your previous book, a memoir, that that's how your parents got their home.

gross: so was linda emond in the role that was originated by lotte lenya in cabaret as fraulein schneider. and lotte lenya was such a great singer. and she was also, of course, the widow of kurt weill. and some of the songs sound to me very influenced by kurt weill, who, i would imagine, you, you know, listened to a lot while writing the songs since he's the composer we most associate with that period. he's the songwriter we most associate with that period. he's a german songwriter who fled the nazis.

akhavan: what's interesting is that - like, this film is about gay conversion therapy, and it's specifically about the topic of coming out. and i'm queer, and i had to come out. my family - both my parents are immigrants from iran. my brother was born there. they moved to new york city right before i was born. and coming out was hands down the hardest thing i've ever had to do. but i don't think that this is a film that only speaks to that experience. i didn't grow up religious. i didn't want to make a film that mocked religion and put down evangelical christians. what i wanted to talk about was fear about going against what was right.
green: the doj always has a choice about the types of cases that it's going to prioritize. it can choose to put lawyers on a certain case that's brought in with a complaint or not. it can choose to make statements and make a lot of press releases around certain types of issues or not. what we can see here is a promise, a guarantee that jeff sessions' doj is going to be putting resources, efforts and manpower into litigating cases that have to do with violations of religious liberty in the way that they see it.

carll has always had a gift for bending his tone and inflection when playing the part of a buffoon, but the easygoing self-awareness he applies to such roles now makes the performances not only land, but resonate deeply. in fragile men, written with the pop songwriter lolo, he pretends to console those clinging to white male privilege. at the first repetition of the chorus, his accompaniment brings to mind a highly stylized spaghetti western, with its lone, stoic hero riding off into the desert. the whole world is exploding, carll sings, his delivery pocked with acidic little sags. and i know it feels so strange / it must make you so damn angry they're expecting you to change. by the time he returns to those words, flanked by cursive, cinematic strings, the arrangement has swelled into the soundtrack of a full-blown melodrama.

xenophobia, racism's clone, masquerades today as a patriotic response to the presence of immigrants and refugees who are in our midst, he said. moreover, people in our nation continue to be victimized because of their color, or their first language, or their sexual orientation, or their religious beliefs like too many people did 50 years ago.

diamond: well, i haven't seen tucker carlson's piece, but i will say that the president has made a number of false claims, spread misinformation and frankly has hindered the overall government response, whether that was the president claiming that the number of cases would go from 15 - which was a number that he fixated on based on the number of americans who were initially detected in the early weeks to have come back from china or perhaps had a close relationship to someone who had returned from china where the infection had originally spread - the president maintaining that number of infected americans would quickly go to near zero, which - every official i talked to said was not the case. officials have been preparing for two months for this to sweep across the united states, and the president misled the american people by suggesting that this was under control when, by all accounts, it was never going to be.

lavalle: well, i'm doing that, number one, because son house is just one of the greatest blues musicians ever, and i thought my chance to, in any way, shine a little light - if anyone is interested in that song and they go back and they listen to son house sing that song, as opposed to how i just sang it, and you fall in love with him and fall in love with his entire catalog of music. and so maybe somebody will be led back to son house and his great music. but the other part of it was just the basic idea in there that tommy is this hustler who thinks he always knows how to fool people, he always knows how to play people. but he himself also gets pulled into a game. he also gets fooled by this white guy who gets him to come to his mansion and play this song because things go - it turns out he's got much bigger plans for tommy and much more nefarious ideas are afoot. and so i wanted to be that his father gave him a straight razor to protect himself, but the song and the - specifically, like, the actual lyrics of the song, were another way that he was trying to get his son to see that he should not trust this man he was going to.
completely. that always makes you be able to be vulnerable with your own grief. i mentioned my grandma and my dad — i lost them both several years ago, but when you're sitting there talking to somebody who's just lost a loved one, it brings that all back. the fact that both of them were so vulnerable, i think, is why the song got written and why it got written the way it did.

manson: because so many teachings about sexuality in the church depend on the main teaching here, and that has to do with natural law and the idea that sex must always create life. and if the church in any way deviates from that idea, it has to change its position on a lot of issues, including contraception, including even women priests. that teaching is based on this. so if they change one thing, the whole thing cascades, and i think that's just too overwhelming for them.

feldman: i started by blogging. i think that was how it had even came to be because an agent or - no, a publisher saw my blog and referred to an agent, and an agent offered to help me. and i got 25 rejections from publishers before david rosenthal at simon & schuster called my agent and asked me to come in for a meeting. and after meeting me, he made an offer - a very, very generous offer, considering the era and, you know, the fact that i was unknown and so young and had experience. and so we went to publication with a very small print run. and yet the book exploded. and it took - i mean, i remember everyone around me just pondering, like, how to explain it, how to explain that the book did explode against all expectations. and i remember my agent being like, oh, well, you know, maybe there is something very american about your story after all, just like the story is about women running away from the mormon communities and the amish communities and the mennonite communities. like, maybe running away from religion is the quintessential american story. so all of a sudden, i wasn't this niche, like, weirdo. but all of a sudden, i was the ultimate american. i was the person that ran away from the religious sect. and if you look at the landscape of america, there is something - there's something very national about that.
at the time, i thought he was nuts. looking around today, i almost see his point. almost.

detrow: i think that's a question he and his campaign are thinking a lot about and probably a big reason why we did not hear from him last night. the basic theories that sanders campaign had for his nomination are not playing out. he is not seeing a wave of first-time and younger voters. significant chunks of his 2016 coalition are not with him this time. and looking forward, many of the key states that sanders was relying on to get the nomination have now already voted. biden is the favorite in a lot of the states coming up in the next few weeks.

but i will say, it is really problematic when you have a catholic — the most prominent catholic in the country, which is what president biden is — taking this stand that he is in favor of abortion — which the church says is a grave moral evil; it's the killing of defenseless, unborn, vulnerable human life — and then presenting himself for communion, hasson said.

i think that's one of the effects that trumpism has had on our politics, is a lowering of expectations that makes it very hard for us to come back from the kinds of problems we've encountered in our politics. we have to be able to say people with power have certain obligations — and not just as outsiders watching people in power. all of us have some roles to play within some institutions, even if that's our family or community or workplace, let alone national institutions and politics and the economy. we each have to say, given my role here, what's my responsibility? i would bet you that the people who most drive you crazy in american life are people who are failing to ask that question when they obviously should. ...
so she is coming at a place where being so well known, having been the first lady, which is sort of a, you know, entitled roll. people see it as an almost royal sort of role. people approach her narrative with a lot of cynicism. and so, you know, to find that authentic place has been very hard.

toobin: yeah, lgbtq issues, of course. i mean, it's just - it's, i mean, you and i have come up with half a dozen very quickly that are all very significant forces within the democratic coalition, but they are separate. and they are not - and though they probably agree with each other on most issues, they are not representing a single judicial philosophy. and they are not mobilized together around judicial appointments. and that's something that conservatives have learned to do. and the proof is in the federal courts. you know, president obama was very focused on diversity in his appointments. and he appointed enormous numbers of minority candidates, of women candidates for the judiciary. he did not focus a lot on ideology. they were not a lot of very liberal nominees. george w. bush did. and i think as the donald trump administration proceeds, we will see a lot of very conservative and very young judicial nominees come out of this administration because it's something that leonard leo, the federalist society and conservatives as a group care a lot about.
sagal: he does like to make his entrances, i know.
lee: they were absolutely devastating. bishop long's ministry was built on what many would describe, and i would describe, as homophobic preaching and teaching, very conservative reading of scripture. and so his positions that he preached for a number of years put him in a position that when these allegations broke, they directly went to his character and spoke to his integrity and credibility as a minister. and so i believe that those allegations were a singular contributor to the demise of the new birth ministry under bishop long.
so i figured, well, i mean, what were the odds anyway i was going to be in a sydney pollack movie with dustin hoffman? so i never thought about it again. and i had gone to paris to do the collections, and in the meantime, sydney pollack saw my audition tape and said, hey, i like her. she's interesting. where's her bathing suit stuff? oh, we forgot. well, get her back. oh, no, we can't. she's in paris. well, do they have any photos of her in a bathing suit? so they send over a victoria's secret catalogue (laughter). and i got the part.

from the stanford university press description of the book: in the first major interdisciplinary study of asian-white miscegenation from the late nineteenth to the end of the twentieth century, koshy traces the shifting gender and racial hierarchies produced by anti-miscegenation laws, and their role in shaping cultural norms. not only did these laws foster the reproduction of the united states as a white nation, they were paralleled by extraterritorial privileges that facilitated the sexual access of white american men to asian women overseas. miscegenation laws thus turned sex acts into race acts and engendered new meanings for both.

i've been a massive kendrick fan ever since i first heard him, since his mixtapes, and i've been trying to track him down, coogler says. eventually i caught up with him a couple years ago — first with anthony 'top dawg' tiffith, who runs his label, and then later on sat down with him and kendrick and just spoke about much his music affected me. he talked about my movies that he had seen, and we said if the opportunity comes, we'd love to work with each other on something.

simon: it - i'm sure it's not deserved, but it's often considered just about the biggest flop in hollywood history.
hubbard: yeah. jamal khashoggi was an incredibly well-known saudi journalist. for many decades, he had been seen as part of the establishment. he was close to the royals. he was close to the government. when i started covering saudi arabia, he was incredibly valuable because he was a saudi that, unlike many others, would always answer his phone when you would call. and he would do his best to tell you what was going on. and he would say, this is what i think the government is thinking. this is what they're doing. this is what, you know, i think the king wants to do.
bw: from my point of view, mary is sort of the consummate nashville professional co-writer. she does two co-writing appointments some days ... whereas i don't really do that much. that's not as much my thing.

the catholic church remained quiet during the country's heated debate this spring, and the clear embrace of abortion rights undermines its legacy. it is the final nail in the coffin for them. they're no longer the pillar of society, and their hopes of re-establishing themselves are gone, gail mcelroy, a professor of politics at trinity college dublin, told the new york times.
gross: so you're not concerned that he's been cia director?
popkey: yes. and things that we might not have wanted to call sexual assault that maybe we would call sexual assault now, things that we might have called bad dates or weird workplace interactions. and i don't want to lump all of these things together except to say that that's a whole spectrum of conversation that i have had.

page: well, i think it was important to me from early on. i kind of made the decision that i didn't want to lionize the brokenness of men in that type. i didn't kind of want to do any more damage in that sense. i kind of wanted to try and continue in the tradition that shondaland is very good of - bringing in 21st century perspectives to whatever it is they're doing and try and kind of, you know, put some vitamins into pop culture.

sondheim: i wrote a verse - well, actually, i didn't solve it, and the speech that leads into it reaches a high pitch, and then she starts it on a low note. and so i wrote - in philadelphia when we were trying the show out, i wrote a verse for ethel to sing that would take her from a high pitch to a low pitch so that she could start the song properly. and she wouldn't sing it because in that verse, she - meaning rose - tells her father to go to hell because she's trying to get $88 from him and he won't give it to her. and so she tells him to go to hell, and ethel said her public would not tolerate telling her father to go to hell. so what happens now is she reaches a high pitch, and then she starts on a long note, and i think it's a real clunky connection, a real clunky transition.
so many of us who want to write and engage with the issues of the day, we're encouraged not to. we're told that that's not what real art does, jones said thursday at the morgan library in new york city, where she accepted the prize. and an award like this, i think it encourages all of us to keep following the strength of our convictions.
sagal: you've written now two books. the first was called girling up, and the new one is boying up.
gross: did he lose that memory permanently?
itzkoff: no. this was my first conversation with valerie. and i was able to speak to her through zach williams, who was her son with robin. and, you know, zach also participated in the book. and valerie really had a unique perspective on robin and was, i think, very sort of clear-eyed about him because, as you point out, you know, she had followed him on the trajectory up to a certain point - that she got to know him in san francisco right when he was starting to sort of break through there as a stand-up comedian and got to follow him to los angeles when he moved there to kind of - you know, to try to take up an acting and stand-up career there.

mr. peete: yeah, it's a neurological disorder that affects the brain in several different ways. and the best way to describe autism is it's a spectrum. certain kids on the one end of the spectrum could certainly be classified as asperger's, in which they're very, very brilliant and they can look at a series of numbers and tell you exactly what the numbers are or look at a math equation and just tell you what exactly what it is. and then there's kids that are totally nonverbal that can't say a word, and our son kind of fell right in the middle.

one of the things that's difficult about west virginia is that it is a place where — a lot is extracted from here, right? coal, lumber, now fracking for natural gas. and it's devastating on the land here. but i also think that that's part of where we get the conversation of why don't you just leave, is that people kind of envision west virginia as a place to take things out of.

in the short run, trump will have more than 100 other judicial nominations to make to the lower federal courts. there are 103 judicial vacancies on the federal trial and appellate courts, or roughly an eighth of the entire federal judiciary. there are 59 pending obama nominations to fill a majority of those seats, but republicans have been artful about slow-walking these obama lower court appointments, and the republican senate has confirmed only 11 judges since the beginning of the year. now all of those pending appointments will die.
the election of november 2016 — obviously it was a national election for president, but it was also the night i was elected to the united states senate. and as i write in the book, even just that night, which was the impetus for writing this book, i was experiencing our election and watching on the monitors this thing happen to our country. and i write about how my godson came up to me crying, auntie kamala, this man can't win. and he was afraid. and people were afraid. and my speech, impromptu that night, was we must fight. and that there is so much worth fighting for. and i wrote the book to talk about that.
and last spring, when donald trump was on the brink of clinching the republican nomination, don mcgahn, who later became the white house counsel, called up leo and said, trump wants to meet with you. and trump said to him, look, i want to prove to the conservative movement that i'm one of you. so i want you, leonard leo, to make a list of people that i should consider nominating to the supreme court for the seat that was vacant at that point - the seat that was being held open by mitch mcconnell, you know, not giving merrick garland a hearing or a vote - and make a list of conservative judges who would persuade the conservative movement how serious i am about appointing a conservative to the supreme court. and leo did.

on discussing men's place in the conversation of domestic duties
mayer: they haven't, but i have to say one of the things that i found particularly alarming was that mike pence has also become the host of a bible study group that meets in the white house. it's only for members of the cabinet in the trump administration. and the pastor that he has invited to run this bible study group, whose name is ralph drollinger, is someone who has gotten in trouble in the past for preaching that it's sinful for women to work if they have children at home. and, i mean, these are really antediluvian points of view that are so anti-female that i think it's, i mean, to me, a bit alarming that they would be, you know, in currency in this white house.
bolden: that's exactly what i'd do.

like grace paley and alice munro, ditlevsen's a master of compression who can capture the whole story of a marriage in a couple of pages. with a born writer's killer instinct, she likes to pounce on us with arresting chapter openings, such as this first sentence about her second husband, ebbe: whenever i try to recall his face, i always see him the way he looked that day i told him there was someone else.
we didn't know about the frequency of breast cancer back in those days. and i thought those things were as important for the university to become committed to as creating a separate academic program which would study women's experience in a cross-disciplinary way. i believe that working in those professional schools might have more immediate impact on the lives of a great many women.

a. hardin: you could just feel, like, the chemistry and the tension. and it was like, this thing is going to pop. you know, we - i really need to say something now.
conway: well, i think the important thing to remember is that in shaping that narrative, drawing that out of the ebb and flow of very different kinds of experience, you choose the things that seem meaningful to you at the time you're writing. and naturally, what you put into the narrative is shaped by what are important issues to you at the moment of composing that life plot and describing it. so i think if i look back at the road from coorain, at the point at which i wrote it, the relationship with my mother, who had recently died, and the reasons why i left australia were absolutely compelling to me.

how a person practices their faith can tell us an awful lot about how they're going to hold that office. and i think that's one of the interesting things about watching joe biden and thinking about joe biden as a catholic as much as any of those other public officials.
yeah, it did piss me off, and i think i internalized a lot of that because i didn't have the articulation and the confidence, frankly, to kind of rebel with my parents against that, but i think in my own way i did, because i continue to follow the things that inspired and attracted me, and i didn't fall down the path of just blindly getting married when i was 20.

reed: you know, i think if you took a poll, i think most evangelicals would not say that all muslims hate america. but i do think they would agree not only with trump but with a lot of other critiques of the state of islam today that there's a problem in their ranks that for whatever reason they have not been able to deal with. you know, if you've gotten members invoking your faith to cut off the heads of christians and to massacre people and to blow up innocent people at a jewish wedding, that's a problem that needs to be dealt with. i think that message does resonate. even though i personally don't agree that all muslims hate america, i don't believe the love muslim faith ipso facto is a religion of hatred.

the argument for parasite is this: it has plenty of people who absolutely adore it, which is important, because to win best picture, you need enough people who have ranked your movie first — you can't win by being everybody's second choice. (how that works is explained elsewhere; please don't make me do it here, because it makes my head hurt.) but if you have a good chunk of first-place votes, it's important to have a lot of second- and third-place votes, too. that's why if you can combine people who love your movie with people who like your movie, that's a way to win. i have always suspected this might be how moonlight won over la la land. even people who didn't love moonlight generally really liked it, while people who didn't love la la land might very well have ranked it low or last.
ivana trump, however, has dialed back the allegation. in a statement given just prior to the book's printing (also quoted by the daily beast), she said: [o]n one occasion during 1989, mr. trump and i had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage. as a woman, i felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. i referred to this as a 'rape,' but i do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.

to be clear, i am personally opposed to the death penalty. i have always been — and i remain — opposed to the death penalty. i believe for a number of reasons that it is a flawed system both in terms of the way that it has been applied historically, which is disproportionately against people of color and poor people.
gross: well, you know, you mentioned ritual and the importance that some rituals have taken on in your life. you write about that in a paragraph in the book, where jacob is thinking - and this is after his grandfather dies - he's thinking, judaism gets death right. it instructs us what to do when we know least well what to do and feel an overwhelming need to do something. you should sit like this. we will. you should dress like this. we will. you should say these words at these moments, even if you have to read from transliteration. i think that really captures very well (laughter) how ritual can be very helpful at times when you don't know what to do or what to say or how to dress. and, you know, the jewish rituals for mourning the dead tell you what to do for all those things.
gross: your parents found ways in prison to do good work. your mother started an education and literacy program in prison, and your father, i think, started a program for prisoners with aids. i think your mother started, also, a program for incarcerated mothers. was that encouraging to you to think that even in prison you could find a way to be helpful and productive and that your parents managed to find ways of doing that?

and this was a real turning point in his campaign. it was a real test of whether or not his support would stick with him. we hadn't had any primaries yet. nobody had voted. but he was getting these massive crowds. and he was being excused for anything that he said. and this was a test - will his supporters condone him going after an entire religion?
but a study, published monday in health affairs, finds the abstinence programs have been a failure.

the interview we'll hear today was recorded in 2010, after the book's publication. included in the book are his lyrics for the shows saturday night, gypsy, a funny thing happened on the way to the forum, anyone can whistle, do i hear a waltz?, company, follies, a little night music, the frogs, pacific overtures, sweeney todd and merrily we roll along. the book's title, finishing the hat, refers to a song in his show sunday in the park with george. we started this interview with a song from the first broadway show he wrote the lyrics for, west side story. the music is by leonard bernstein. a new revival of the show is now dark, along with the rest of broadway.
a simple majority of 51 votes is required to confirm a supreme court nominee. senate republicans currently hold 51 seats. sen. john mccain, r-ariz., has been away from washington, d.c., while he is being treated for brain cancer, but vice president pence could cast a tiebreaking vote if needed.
the result could well be the reversal of roe v. wade, the court's 1973 abortion decision; a court more hostile to the regulation of wall street; a court far more deferential to religious objections to anti-discrimination laws; and many more such dramatic legal turns to the right.
partly i think it is simply a reflection of the state of desperation, levine said. anything is better than what we face because what we certainly face is defeat, so how much worse might this be? at least we can try it, i think is one strand of confederate thinking. but another factor is the drumbeat of self-hypnosis that the confederacy has been keeping up during the entirety of the war. a message contained in that self-hypnosis is that the slaves are loyal. the slaves embrace slavery. the slaves are contented in slavery. the slaves know that black people are inferior and need white people to oversee their lives. black people, therefore, are grateful for our care of them. black people will defend the south that has been so good to them.
district of columbia v. heller (2008)
this is an awkward reality for the keepers of memorials and historic sites. keepers of the hermitage, andrew jackson's home, have been forced to wrestle with the reality that he took indian land, used enslaved laborers on multiple plantations and even personally chased escaped slaves. the hermitage has responded by expanding displays showing the dark side of this historic figure, but it is not planning to tear down the house.
if you want a republican who will stand unapologetically for marriage and life, i'm the only person on that stage who has a proven record of doing so over and over again, cruz said. religious liberty has been a lifelong passion for me.
the battles between the two movements, bull said, is ongoing, but the lines of that culture war have been redrawn.
mulaney: let me go see if a 29-year-old jewish woman who doesn't like any of my suggestions...
there was one problem. the files were sometimes not supported by the mobile devices or would get corrupted during the transfer. so in 2014, disale devised a workaround: he would make the videos, links, audio files and homework available to download over the internet using qr codes, or quick response codes. he would print stickers with the qr codes and distribute them among his students.
vedantam: that's right, david, because there was an important change under the aca where the medicaid expansion did away with asset tests. you still had to have a certain amount of income to qualify for medicaid, but there were no asset tests. in other words, couples no longer had a financial incentive to split up in order to protect the assets of the healthy spouse.
sharing their story — for science
noah: yeah, definitely. i think it was something i inherited from my mother who learned to do it. you know, i, like a baby duckling, was merely mimicking the survival traits that my mother possessed. and i came to learn very quickly that language was a powerful, powerful tool.
sagal: oh, really. oh, i didn't know that...
gross: this is fresh air. and if you're just joining us, my guest is john prine. i know you grew up near a junkyard and said that all the broken glass looked like a field of glittering diamonds. what was it like to grow up near a junkyard? did you play in it? was it...
allegation: drake said trump invited her to his suite after the tournament. because she did not feel comfortable going alone, she said she brought friends with her to his room. when we entered the room, drake daid, he grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission.
tom gjelten, byline: the supreme court's legalization same-sex marriage was controversial, but it was apparently in keeping with the thinking of most americans. the public religion research institute headed by robert jones found just 40 percent of americans supporting same-sex marriage in 2008. that number's now up to 53 percent.

inskeep: what about simply testing people to see if they have the virus?
gross: so, emily, my last question for you. what is it like to see this...
when you reduce the amount of service, you have to pack more people into fewer vehicles, so it leads to a higher possibility of contracting covid. it's actually pretty scary, said clark.
pugh: what can i say? one of the most amazing characters i think i've ever had the privileges of playing. and well, i mean, it was my second role. but i think...
rocca: can - you know, i was up in my mother's apartment watching the very first images from mars.
gross: the second film you made in the united states, one flew over the cuckoo's nest, is one of your most famous films. it got a bunch of academy awards. you keep stressing the absurdity of stories that surrounded life under communism in czechoslovakia, and you found out that you had been sent a copy of the novel one flew over the cuckoo's nest years before you actually made the movie, but you never got it.
salie: i don't have a car, peter. i'm not rich like that.
arquette has been nominated for an emmy for her portrayal of a civilian worker who enables a prison break in the showtime series escape at dannemora. originally broadcast april 29, 2019.
prine: ...and ripped my pants and had to go over to er. that was really embarrassing - having a mailman outfit on with the ass of your pants tore out, you know, and a dog bite. you look like a cartoon.
akhavan: well, men have that. with women, i think the thought is like you're straight and you just like, you know, the katy-perry-i-kissed-a-girl-and-i-liked-it persona. but with men, i think it's more - it's a phase. and your next stop is gay town.
sagal: all right. well, then, here is your first quote.
curtis: and i'm not dead yet.
shalhoub: yeah, yeah. and it's one of the things as a parent that we - it takes us i think for - took me forever to come to. and that is that, you know, you only have so much of an effect. and i think what's sort of fascinating about approaching this character of abe is that it goes beyond just, you know, the breaking of conventions. it goes beyond expectations. what he's really facing, as is his wife - the character of the wife too, is that their daughter is not really who they thought she was.
gross: and the legislation you're talking about was when he was governor?
vedantam: her new relationship, the house they'd moved into, the view from the porch - all of it looked beautiful on facebook.
chang: i mean, when i'm reading your book, i'm thinking, how hopeful does andrea feel about the future of democracy? and you do, at the very end, make a reference back to rae kushner. remember. she's jared kushner's grandmother who survived the holocaust. and you talk about how she wanted to retell the story of the holocaust because she believed remembering the past ensured against repeating the evils of the past. why did that resonate for you in writing this book about these two families?
rocca: a wife targeted with the initiate sex campaign will be bombarded by articles, including nine ways to initiate sex, why sex is so important to your husband and the importance of sex for a happy marriage. the spinner is the first business to monetize something called facebook sniper targeting. and if that doesn't unsettle you, you are too far gone.
gross: this is fresh air, and if you're just joining us, my guest is jane mayer. she's a washington correspondent for the new yorker magazine. her new article is called the president pence delusion, and it's all about vice president pence, how he entered politics, what his policies have been, what his ideology is and what kind of vice president he is and how influential he is in the white house.
taylor: yes, he wanted to be able to make a rational exit from life if he felt he had to. and he had the equipment with which to commit suicide and said, if i'm unable to get to the safe myself, i would like for you to do this for me. included among the contents was a box of triscuits because after taking the pills, he had read you could sometimes become violently ill. better to - not to do it on an empty stomach.

do you think your mom would want you to run for president?
sagal: at least give him a chicken.
sagal: so let's pick up on that right away. it is true that your voice was the first broadcast to mars.
babylon: the horde of immigrants that was walking to our nation like zombies.
gross: that's two versions of not a day goes by from stephen sondheim's musical merrily we roll along. and my guest is stephen sondheim. he has a new book of his collected lyrics and the stories behind those lyrics called finishing the hat. when writing about working with jule styne on gypsy, you say, only superhuman confidence keeps you writing fearlessly into old age; jule styne was one of the few who had it in spades. do you feel like you have that superhuman confidence to keep writing?
gross: right. my guess is stephen sondheim, and he has a new book called finishing the hat: collected lyrics (1954-1981) with attendant comments, principles, heresies, grudges, whines and anecdotes.
donald trump didn't do that. there was no reason to expect that he would do anything in a normal way, obviously, at this point. but instead of just allowing hillary clinton the three days of her convention, he takes the podium in doral, miami, at his golf course down there - his golf resort. and holds this freewheeling press conference, as he tended to do from time to time on the campaign. and in it, he called on russia to hack into the emails of hillary clinton, find her missing emails.
yeah, it's really beautiful. sometimes these dogs may be using their nose. sometimes they're just being highly observant. and dogs are. they watch our body language all the time. but there are now more dogs being used for children on the autism spectrum, and they are remarkable. they can usually tell ahead of time when a child is about to have a tremendous amount of anxiety, panic, meltdown or what have you. when there's too much stimulation for a child with autism and the dog is there, they'll lean into the child.
donald trump: she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no - there's nothing out there.

adler: but here's the biggest difference between then and now: at the time of the stonewall riots, you could get arrested for cross-dressing. carl siciliano.
bialik: correct. girling up i wrote a year ago, and it was a new york times best-seller, which was very, very exciting. and boying up is about the process by which boys become men. and it's not simply, you know, the biology, puberty, physiology stuff, but also a bit more about the kind of sociological prophecies by which we place men in our society, with voices of real men throughout the book, and also my experience as a mom raising two boys.
they knew time can blind us to certain truths, he wrote in lawrence v. texas, and later generations can see that laws, once thought necessary and proper, in fact serve only to oppress.

stuart adams: in november of 2013, a federal court judge actually overturned that constitutional amendment. and that sent shockwaves through the entire state. there were people that actually wanted to secede from the nation, if you can believe that.
let me just tell you, roy moore denies it, trump said. that's all i can say. he denies it. and by the way, he totally denies it.
sen. tim kaine spent much of his speech contrasting hillary clinton and donald trump. his son, a marine, just deployed to europe, kaine said, and he would trust hillary clinton with our son's life.
roberts: well, his - he points to polls that show that - that he is running ahead of clinton against trump. the reason, however, that he doesn't bring it up is that nobody has done any negative campaigning against him. there have been no negative ads against bernie sanders. nobody has gone back and looked at his somewhat colorful past. and no one has really examined his policies in-depth.
sagal: that's the reason? do you - i'm going to ask you guys to be honest, do you ever do this? do you ever fiddle with your phone while driving?
politics is an easy example. so, think about congress. congress can be a very formative institution. it produces a kind of human person, a man or woman who is a member of congress. but now congress is very much a performative institution. members think of it as a way to raise their profile, to get a better timeslot on cable news or talk radio or a bigger twitter following. and they use congress as a platform from which to comment on the culture, to comment on politics, to comment on congress, rather than using the institution as a way to shape themselves to become more effective in our politics. ...you know, a lot of younger members of congress are like this. so if you think about members who are, say, young, younger than 50 now, pretty much all of them in one way or another, think about the institution as a way to raise their profile. [sen.] ted cruz, after every session of the impeachment trial that's going on now, hosts a podcast and goes out and comments on what he's just been engaged in doing. [rep.] alexandria ocasio-cortez, on the democratic side, uses congress as a way to become a figure in our culture. now, this is crazy and it isn't useless, right? it's important for important public figures to also have a profile in the culture.
pugh: i actually don't think she has either of those things. i don't think she ever had privilege. one of the biggest things about why she is so cruel to anna, who is her maid, is because anna has more of a life than katherine does. so the funny play at the end, when she's left all on her own, is the fact that actually she has everything; she has nothing. she's still stuck in the same situation that she was before, and she has no one.

in 2012, moore successfully won back his seat on the state supreme court, just less than a decade after being removed from the bench. after winning the gop nomination — defeating another appointed judge despite being heavily outspent — the race turned unexpectedly competitive given moore's history, a similar scenario to what worries republicans now.

dan stevens: (as david haller) i saw things.
liasson: so there you hear the audience booing. bush responded by saying he was sick and tired of barack obama blaming his brother for all of the problems he's had, suggesting donald trump was doing the same thing.
sagal: hey, how are things in towson?
turkle: yes. and he just casually talked about our being scientists together in the same way that he was talking about disproving einstein and his theories about raw food vegetarianism and world peace. and he talked about me as an object of experimentation. and at the time, i had - was already at mit and thinking about, you know, how wrong it is to treat people as objects or to think that objects are people. i mean, i was thinking a lot about the conflation of objects and people in the early days of computation, you know, that people aren't objects, and objects aren't people. and here i was learning about my father talking about me as an object in that conversation.
simon: nuala o'doherty naranjo lives in jackson heights, queens. thanks so much for being with us.
mulaney: ...like, yeah, blue shirt lady - nice lady, sat at the end of the bar. why? did something happen to her? it's like, yes, that's why the homicide detectives are speaking to you.
wu: i am the most concerned that we end up in a situation where your - everything is known about you and so therefore, not only google, but google, facebook, twitter - the whole set of companies - essentially knows all your weaknesses and therefore how to manipulate you in subtle ways in order to have you do things you might not otherwise do. in other words, i'm concerned with our autonomy. i don't like the idea of people collecting information on me in general, but i particularly don't like it when it's used to sort of exploit your weaknesses or make you lose control in some ways.
sure, trump's followers like the idea of having fewer tax brackets, said conservative ben domenech, publisher of thefederalist.com, but, what gets them riled up and active is the embrace of the culture-war issues — that trump has shown himself perfectly happy to fight in a way that republicans in a lot of other positions have been unwilling to traditionally.
establishments including movie theaters, bowling alleys and museums are closed for indoor service.
the story of rising queer acceptance over the past four decades is often told triumphantly — like a parade of dramatic legal and political victories — or in a way that suggests that acceptance has been equally enjoyed. gen xers and millennials, who came of age in a post-aids world, learned about and discussed sex and sexuality in fundamentally different ways than baby boomers and the greatest generation.
so i had so much conflict within myself and something that i wasn't able to balance. it definitely led me to being very conflicted and it was only when my mother passed away and i left my family and i came to america that i was able to unpack all of these conflicts and all of this confusion about who i was and begin to find my own path and my own sense of where my morality came from. but that took a really long time.

adding to the stress is the fact that their young son, shiva, has been diagnosed with severe autism. what's a wall street titan to do when the walls close in? make a run for it, of course! here's the opening of lake success:
this dissertation took place between 2010 and 2012 as a three-stage research project aimed at exploring race and racism as a feature in the sexual and romantic lives of gay and bisexual men in australia. the author writes, across stages, it was clear that race is a salient but often unrecognised aspect of people's romantic and sexual interactions, a subtle prejudice that is enacted and felt even if it cannot be readily identified. although many men were ambivalent towards racialised partner discrimination, i found many striking similarities between discriminating among partners on the basis of race and other more general expressions of racism. indeed, some men were highly suspicious of anything that might impede an individual's 'sexual freedom', although arguments of individual liberty fail to recognise that sexual racism is the antithesis of individual thought and freedom.

for this reason, he proposed the idea of qr-coded textbooks to the government in maharashtra, the state where paritewadi is located. and in 2017, the government announced it would introduce textbooks with qr codes in the entire state. the codes link to supplementary teaching materials, such as explanatory videos, for students who need a bit more help in grasping concepts in the book.

baldonado: yes, you totally knew it'd be a broadway show, a tony-winning...
harth also told her story to wnyc in august after a twitter spat with trump:
there's an incredible amount of change that has happened in a relatively short period of time, and it has understandably had a lot of people feeling displaced, wondering and asking a question about where do they fit in, their relevance, are they obsolete. i think it brings into question questions of identity. what does it mean to be an american? what does it mean to be a productive american? what does it mean to be a breadwinner or the leader of a household? and people are also resentful of this change and where will they fit into it and will this include them. and [trump] read it accurately. and then he took it to the lowest common denominator. [he said] it is us versus them instead of what real leadership would be about — which is to read it and say, hey everybody, we're all in this together. and my vision of the future includes you. you are in my vision of the future. we will get through this together.
good morning. i'm noel king. for dan del tufo and his girlfriend julia kallmerten, the memorial bridge in portsmouth, n.h., is more than just a bridge. they're both engineers. dan worked on the bridge in college, and julia helped design the park underneath it. when they visited it this week, julia thought they were there to just take photos. but dan had arranged for the bridge to be lifted. and once it was at its highest point, he proposed. julia said yes.
withers: even after i showed them my driver's license they weren't buying it.
goldman: well, not surprisingly, you know, a lot of early shock and hope that he was ok. tiger's 45 and past his prime, but he's earned some recent respect for being a doting dad. he played in a tournament recently with his son charlie that, i think, softened his hard-edged image. you know, since he burst onto the pro scene in 1997 with a dominating win at the masters, he's been a global sports icon. he brought a lot of newcomers to the game of golf, including people of color. he's had a huge impact. so understandably, lots of concern with today's news and lots of relief that while his condition was serious, it appears it wasn't and isn't life-threatening.
the state's covid-19 dashboard, showing cases, deaths, tests and recovery rate, is here. regional metrics are here.
bernstein: the kushners arrived in america with $2 in their pocket. and jared kushner's grandfather was a carpenter, and he immediately went to work. and this was a time in america where the federal government was helping home builders in a variety of ways. so there were new loans, new mortgage structures for the federal government to help people buy homes. there was the federal highway act, which helped people get to all those new homes. and there were, of course, all these returning gis that needed those homes, so it was a great time to be in real estate. and for the kushner family, we know from rae's testimony and from the records that were left about joe and their children, charlie and murray, both of whom had real estate businesses - that for them, being successful builders was a way of saying to the nazis, we have won.
adams: yeah. my understanding is it works seamlessly and flawlessly. there haven't been challenges. people within the community feel like both sides are protected. and again, no one got everything they wanted. no one was totally happy with it. but everybody got the protections they needed to be able to function with society.
u. berliner: we're fine. we're very happy to talk to you.

gabbard, who has attracted interest from some republican voters, has said repeatedly she would not launch a third-party bid for the white house. but some democrats still fear just that and worry a third-party bid by gabbard could hand trump a second term.

briger: the way he's describing people in red hook, i mean, it sounds excessive. it sounds maybe slightly pathological. but it's also really interesting that it sounds like the way he described the monsters of his writing.
prine: well, i mean, i was shocked but not shocked because i don't - i mean, i can't comment on whether i thought it was a - whether i thought it was first-degree murder or not, you know? but i do know he was always - he always had guns around. and he was always waving them around, you know? and i'm not sure exactly how the whole thing happened, but that was the part i was not shocked about. when you got all of those guns sitting around, you know, something's - one of them is bound to go off sooner or later.
thompson: well, it's not a simple answer to the question because, of course, as with all ian's work, it's about the complications of being human. that is to say, in my view, the reality of life. and it was very important for her to show that she respected the views of the family and of the young boy enough to go and discuss it with him. she wasn't willing just to brush it all aside and make the ruling that, of course, as he points out later in the film, she was bound by law to make. i thought that was a very interesting part of the decision-making process for her.
mb: and i grew up in a really small town called swainsboro. my experience the first 18 years of my life was so incredibly small-town. and becky actually migrated a little bit.
we've seen this pattern, actually, among a number of groups where we see ambivalence or being divided on the issue of marriage equality. but on this question [small businesses], african-americans have been very quick to say — by a ratio of 2-to-1 — no, no, no. we don't want that going on. and i think the reasons for that are pretty clear. it starts to look like lunch counters and things like that.

adams: the sensible way to attack any issue is that we respect the legitimate concerns of others. we dealt with the issue as part of the legislation when one of the big sticking points was actually the definition of gender identity of transgenders (ph).

moore: (laughter) i don't know. i guess it began with the cry. the first time i cried was the episode in which laura bleaches her hair blonde, looks in the mirror and with her friend millie's help decides she looks more like harpo marx than what her goal had been. and so she quickly tries to dye it back before rob gets home from work. now, this is a real stretch of the imagination. she decides to dye one half of her head back, not being able to get the other half done before dick walks in the door. and so she greets him half blonde, half brunette and sobbing.

epstein was first convicted in a florida state court of a sex crime involving a minor in 2008. after his release from prison, epstein still held significant sway in new york city, hosting titans of finance, politics, media, academia and high society. he hosted parties at a townhouse that was reportedly the largest in manhattan. even so, the times wrote about epstein sparingly, and, when it did, even admiringly.
gaines-cirelli: well, you're right. there - for some years now, there have been persons within the united methodist church clergy and laypeople who have been pushing back against the official position of the united methodist church, which has been exclusionary to lgbtq people. our official policy has been that lgbtq persons will not be ordained, that we will not officiate at same-gender weddings. and in the last number of years, many folks have made a decision to intentionally break the rule to do what they felt their conscience was calling them to do and that the gospel was calling them to do, which is to fully include all people and to support them in their callings to ministry.

burstein: secretary clinton grew up at a time when she was part of the second wave of feminism. she grew up during the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement. there's almost a zelig-like anthem to her life and the various places that even in early life she was encountering and being involved in.
unfortunately, as the years peeled on, joy began to feel that it wasn't just her husband's smell that was changing.
david: a lot has changed. the president has signed numerous executive orders in the name of national security safety - the other notion of buy american, hire american. so everything is, you know, vetted more strongly than it was before, probably unnecessarily because we had some very good procedures in place. in october of 2017, the administration had indicated that we are now going to have to interview every applicant applying for a green card. so previously, employment-based cases, for the most part, weren't interviewed. now they're in the queue for interviewing. so that's set family-based immigration back tremendously. the employment-based cases are generally going forward first. the family-based cases are taking, you know, back seat to those cases. and so, you know, more people are having to wait to get things processed. and we don't have the resources to do that. and again, it's probably not necessary.
meyers: norway. that's great. i love this. where in norway?
but the democratic party has got this very broad coalition they're trying to hold together. and even among white democrats, we see some some variation. even though there are double-digit differences between the regions, it's still worth noting that white democrats in the south are still twice as likely to say african-americans face discrimination than white republicans in the south. you can see the regional pull, but that partisan pull is still there.

we fail to see how any reasonable man can but conclude that these laws are slavery laws were incepted to keep slaves in their place, were prolonged to keep the slaves in their place, and in truth, the virginia law still view the negro race as a slave race, that these are the most odious laws to come before the court. they robbed the negro race of its dignity and only a decision which will reach the full body of these laws in the state of virginia will change that. we ask that the court consider the full spectrum of these laws and not just the criminality, because it's more than a criminality that's at point here, that the legitimacy of children right to inherent land, the many, many rights, and in reaching a decision, we ask you reach on that basis. thank you your honors.
i think that when she talks about her mother, it is authentic, and it feels that way. in her speech in brooklyn, when she finally reached the number of delegates, she almost choked up talking about her mom. she said she had a hard time not crying. and i think that that is almost the only poetry that she has. it's very hard to craft the sort of wellesley activist wife of a president into something that average americans can relate to and latch onto.

when the jennings family stops off, now in disguise, for (presumably) a bathroom break at a mcdonald's, philip and elizabeth talk about whether he might stay behind to try to remain in contact with henry. but after he goes inside, picks up some food, and throws a glance at a happy american family of the kind he sort of wishes he could have had, he goes back outside and gets in the car with his wife and daughter, and they leave. the music now: u2's with or without you, which has been heard so much, in so many places, so many times, that ... can it still work?

jonah mutono: i used the name kidepo'' because it was a good way to hide. i've never been the performative type. none of my friends really knew — they knew that i make music and i would write songs occasionally, but just going out in the world and being someone who writes songs, that was such a new concept for me. so i decided at least to have the privacy and the space to be able to put music out and still hide parts of myself.
prine: yeah, that was 13 years.
in fact, that's what led the group to reject the idea of formally registering as a lobby. the founder of the group said we can have more influence working behind the scenes if we don't register as a lobby, which is true, which is exactly why we have those laws that were strengthened by the 2007 open government act. but beyond the secrecy of the organization, which is essentially strategic on their part - they're tactical on their part in thinking about how they can further the agenda, there's the question of the agenda itself.

state senate minority leader karen mayne sponsored the bill and tells npr that it was just a small piece in utah's criminal code that needed to be revamped. you hear all over the u.s. how you have antiquated laws about horses in the streets and all kinds of things, so we wanted to make them modern-day, in the now, mayne says.

over the years, the social service delivery has almost eclipsed the evangelical outreach, and that's a cause of consternation among salvationists. it looks like, unless they can figure out a way to make their mission, their evangelical mission, more attractive to young people, you know, they - it's possible that they could become a large social service organization with a very few clergy running it. and that would be not what the founder had in mind.

i loved every minute of this story, from the dollar-a-word vocabulary (jejune! forwent! insouciance!) to mary's dramatic introduction to nicholas sparks. amid the brief diary entries and opulent prose, sellet manages to hide a clever and biting social commentary in mary's point of view. one doesn't need intimate familiarity with the classics to enjoy by the book, but the more you know, the more you'll laugh. i, for one, cackled out loud!
simon: let me just say to our wonderful audience that we welcome audience reaction, but let's try and avoid making it partisan reaction if we can. mention some other names that we should know in the senate race please, john.
with hillary clinton, it's been very difficult to find, frankly, that poetry in her personal narrative, partly because you have a candidate who's unlike most in that she's very private. she didn't want to talk about her mother's story when her mother was still alive. you know, she - it's interesting. focus groups don't like it when she talks about her grandchildren. they feel like it's inauthentic.

social media is a really powerful tool for people of common interest to convene, he says, but then it's important for them to get offline, meet in a pub, meet at a place of worship, meet in a neighborhood, and get to know each other. because the truth is, on the internet, everything is simplified. and when you meet people face to face, it turns out they're complicated.

consumer groups are unhappy with the pre-verification idea — and the extra requirement of prior coverage for people who have gotten married. particularly hard-hit would be couples who were uninsured previously because they could not afford health insurance as singles or could not get it under their state's medicaid rules. additionally, consumer advocates and some regulators say requiring newlyweds to prove prior coverage violates the health law.

lee: bishop long's ministry, although, it did a lot of good - let me be very clear when i say that there were a lot of moments of positive ministry moments where lives were changed in terms of social-economic standing - but the way in which that ministry took place was an emphasis on personal piety, holiness and not much the prophetic witness against injustices in the broader society.

north carolina recently enacted legislation commonly known as the bathroom bill, a law that bans transgender people from using public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. and a controversial so-called religious liberty bill in georgia — which would have allowed religious officials and faith-based organizations to deny services when doing so would violate a sincerely held religious belief — prompted a number of companies to threaten to boycott the state. the governor vetoed that measure.

i go back to aligarh, and i go back to delhi often where my cousins live now. and i'm very aware of the opportunity that i have when i go meet them. and that's where i understand and i empathize with what my dad feels. and when i was, you know, in high school and trying to meet and talk to girls, go to the movies on a weekend, you know, try to maybe go to like some sort of social event, fit in, maybe - you know, i never would invite school friends over my house. i'd go over to, you know, like, my friends' houses. i - it was just about trying to fit in and find my place in the world where my dad really felt, look, if you take care of these necessary things, you'll find your place. but i meant that emotionally. i want to find my place emotionally. where do i belong, you know? and that was a tough thing for him to understand.
gross: i thought it was interesting when he said, i married my best friend, because people are always asking, what is the nature of their marriage?
it is, but i live here in los angeles with my brother and sister. i managed to convince them to come with me from uganda when i moved here. and so, i have my family around me. my sister is making me cake. i don't know what else i really need, to be honest.
and that may be true. he's certainly traveled there extensively. he says he likes to accuse the state department of ignoring africa so he becomes our point man with guys like museveni and uganda, this nation he says he's adopted. as we give foreign aid to uganda, these are the people who are in a position to steer that money. and as museveni comes over, and as he does and spends time at the family's headquarters in arlington, virginia, a place called the cedars, and sits down for counsel with doug coe, that's where those relationships occur.

the point is that all of these situations have filtered into the american conscious, and there is something about hillary clinton people do not trust. and so whether you can - and i talk to voters all the time about this - whether you can put your finger on exactly what it is or, you know, the details of the emails, there's something that - they'll say, i don't trust her. the emails, the - goldman sachs - they just kind of throw out these words. and so i don't even think that they're sort of real issues you can combat except a general sense that she is not trustworthy. and frankly, it probably goes beyond the list that you mentioned to whitewater and cattle futures and all of the things that they think of when they think of the clintons and that, frankly, you know, donald trump has reminded - has drudged up again.
when i read this letter, i'm thinking that it sounds to me like your husband has a behavioral addiction that's connected to this shame-based sexual life that he's put deeply underground. we're talking about somebody who has repeatedly, over a long people of time, continued to engage in a behavior that he knows is destructive. and in this case it's about sex.
what trump has said about him (emphasis ours): the white house issued a readout of trump calling erdogan after he won a referendum that expanded his power:
this story is the first in an occasional series on india: against the odds.
calm as a sunrise mantra and ferocious as a knife fight, the music on pianist matthew shipp's latest trio album courts the transcendental with an earthly vigor, the mercurial snap and sizzle of bassist michael bisio and drummer newman baker a source of constant drama and surprise amid the pianist's ethereal interludes and bracing percussive runs. the recording marks shipp's 60th year, capping a prolific spree of collaborations with a core expression of masterful elegance and verve. –steve dollar
minhaj: yes, and it was one of the largest mass exoduses of people from india to pakistan. my dad's family stayed in aligarh in india, which was a huge decision because you're dividing a country based on religious lines. so the things that he saw and witnessed as a kid, he doesn't want to hear about my identity crises at school, you know, and how i want to just, you know, fall in love and fit in. for him, things that he witnessed during that generation and era were very, very extreme and oftentimes violent.

i think what has to happen in order for christian rap to survive is that it has to create its own space. if you wanna know what my 10 year goal is, it's to create infrastructure and its own space and niche to where it doesn't have to be the redheaded stepchild of any space; it's its own space, but still connects in those other spaces where it makes sense. because i think that's what hip-hop did early on. no one would sign hip-hop artists—that's why def jam was created, because no one would sign rev run. they created their own space and then once its validity was proven, it was ingested into the mainstream. and i think it's the same thing for us.

sarah gailey knows how to build the heck out of a world. in two of their recent books — 2019's magic for liars and 2000's upright women wanted — the author created a school of wizardry and a dystopian wild west, respectively, that enticed lovers of these fantasy/science-fiction tropes while yanking them both on their ear. i was enchanted by both, and i went into gailey's new novel, the echo wife, with a big expectation for yet another immersive, wonderfully detailed, fictional setting. i was not catered to. there isn't any real world-building in the echo wife because, well, there's no world to build. it already exists. it's our own. the book takes place, more or less, in the here and now, and even the rich concept behind its science-fictional premise — namely cloning — keeps a fuzzy distance. once i got over my initial bout of pouting, though, i gave myself over to gailey's latest exercise in character-driven speculation. and i was happy i did.

i'm largely stealing this from a rather brilliant woman i met right at the beginning of the pandemic. the first pandemic-themed episode i did was in mid-march. and one of the guests was a woman named dr. luana marques. she's brazilian by birth, but now works at harvard as an anxiety expert. and she told me about something called the — i think this is the right name — yerkes-dodson [law]. you can look this up on google; it's a bell-shaped curve. and it talks about this sort of utility of anxiety, which is an interesting concept. and it kind of gives us permission to not feel bad about the fact that we're feeling a certain amount of justifiable fear and anxiety.
davies: this is fresh air. and we're speaking with ben hubbard. he's the beirut bureau chief for the new york times. he's spent more than a dozen years reporting in the middle east. he has a new book about the young crown prince of saudi arabia, who is effectively ruling the country. the book is mbs: the rise to power of mohammed bin salman.

wu: (laughter) one thing i'll say about hitler that many people don't realize - and i don't mean to besmirch the industry - but he did get his start, not only as an artist, but as an advertising man writing art for advertisements. and more than anyone else, as you said, he completely understood the union between government propaganda and between - and advertising, that they were in some ways the same thing. in fact, the big steps forward for advertising, especially after world war i were when government just began employing the tools of advertising for its own purposes to get people to join the army and other things.

now, you know, i don't want to say - i don't want to overstate the case. he's not, like, singlehandedly responsible for a third of the supreme court. but if you look at anyone else, there's no one else with anywhere close to that level of influence. and i think it's indicative of where the republican party is, which is aligned at the hip with the federalist society when it comes to judicial appointments. and their agenda and their belief in political change through the use of the courts is a core of the republican party now and something that leo has led the charge on.
simon: yeah. i especially liked that - there's no way around it. this film is about the loss of a child, but it winds up being about the persistence of love in a marriage.

elving: there were some in the immediate crowd, scott, who were smiling. but the president chose to make his tour of the damage in a rather affluent area where the damage was not so severe. elsewhere on the island, these remarks seemed surreal. plus, there was his rather cavalier comment about puerto rico's debt crisis, which is quite severe and which he dismissed and said, well, that's gone. that's gone. that's gone. well, the next day, the president's budget director had to walk that back and say we shouldn't take that word for word. and all of this gave the impression that the president wasn't taking puerto rico as seriously as he did the hurricane disasters in texas and florida.

the risk for those party activists, kondik said, is that good could be a less attractive candidate in the general election. kondik said republicans already have an uphill climb retaking the house of representatives. if the gop has to spend money to boost good in a district that trump won by 13 points, he thinks that climb could be even steeper.
my form of alcoholism was much more controlled because i grew up in that very uncomfortable, very sad situation, and i determined that i was never going to do that, never be drunk. and i probably never was really out-and-out drunk. and i certainly never drank during the daytime. but i wasted a lot of my time, and i forgot a lot because i didn't remember much of what had happened the night before. i got out-of-proportion angry about things that were really unimportant. but that's what alcohol does to you.

baldonado: well, speaking of the catholic church's influence, the parents in the story - connor's parents - are kind of in the process of ending their marriage. they wish they could divorce but historically, i guess, at this time period divorce wasn't legal in ireland, in the 1980s, is that right?

in other words, the closer one lives to the epicenter of a major metropolitan area, the greater the chances that the person votes for democrats. just as reliably, of course, moving away from the epicenter dramatically increases the chances that a person votes for republicans. wilkinson's maps show these tendencies to be so routine and so pronounced as to be almost comic.

but, you know, what went hand in hand - i think - with the preparation for those roles, the work on those films, i mean, i think that was a time when he really - i think - got deeply in touch with his own inner darkness. and that is unfortunately leading up to, you know, him falling off the wagon and starting to drink again. that when he's making, you know, movies like insomnia, he was working in very remote geographical places. i mean, we're talking, like, you know the furthest parts of canada and alaska and not really surrounded by very many people that he knew, feeling kind of disconnected, really deep into these dark roles. and that is part of what kind of led him down that path.

bernstein: well, it's bad for him. and i would argue it's even worse than the last time he faced serious troubles, which was when his casinos declared bankruptcy. and that's because there isn't a banker in the world that didn't see what happened january 6 in the capitol and that doesn't believe that they would lose money by financing donald trump. his bankers have walked away from him. real estate brokers have walked away from him. the professional golf association, i think, is the biggest cut for him, his sort of et-tu-brute moment, where they said we are not hosting the championship in 2022 at your club. so donald trump faces a situation where his customers are not his political backers, and there's a disconnect. and there's going to be a real financial reckoning coming at the same time he needs to find lawyers, who he also famously doesn't pay, to represent him in the multiple investigations going forward.

millies: certainly a man of his age is someone who's formed very much by the second vatican council, by that optimism that characterized midcentury catholicism in the 20th century. catholics had spent so much of the late 19th century and the early 20th century living in urban settings, ghettoized in a culture apart here in the united states. world war ii brought catholics into the mainstream. certainly, the cold war brought catholics into the mainstream. and then in the 1960s, we had this wonderful moment of catholic confidence with the election of the first catholic president, john kennedy, the second vatican council, that told us that the church and the modern world can live together and can reinforce one another. joe biden's very much formed by those experiences as a man of his generation would be. it's an ecumenical outlook. it's an interreligious outlook. it's an outlook that sees the modern world as an opportunity rather than a problem.
turkle: my grandmother took care of this family of five, which centered around my grandfather, who had a mercurial temper, who worked very long hours and wanted things just so. and one of the things that he wanted just so was to never feel that he couldn't provide for this family. that was really what was most important to him. and in order for that to happen, my grandmother had to maintain the illusion that she had enough food even during the depression even when that was not true. and so she had this way of cooking where she would make, for example, these things called mandels, which were little rounds of pastry, which were then fried and browned, which you would put in a soup to give it a much more hearty feeling without having to add more meat or even more vegetables. and she would, you know, have special ways of making knishes or special ways of making kreplach - which also are sort of pastries filled with very, very little tiny bits of meat but a lot of pastry that would be very filling - and ways of stretching chicken soup with lots and lots of noodles. and i mean secrets of her - she called it depression cooking that she would teach me as i would stay and spend the day with her cooking.

of course, now when i watch a journalism-centered movie, i'm looking for inaccuracies, groaning at my tv when a reporter uploads an article to their website without going through their editor first. though it's a bit of a leap that public radio would produce a show about dating and relationships, i had a lot of fun imagining how a station might hypothetically approach this type of show, how listeners would react, and without spoiling anything, what the ultimate fate of the show would be. because the concept of the ex talk stretches the truth, it was important to me that the rest of the journalism details felt as authentic as possible. journalism ethics play a role, too: shay and dominic are never entirely comfortable lying to their listeners.

when our constitution was formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable, for there we find provision made for that very class of persons as property; they were not put upon the footing of equality with white men--not even upon that of paupers and convicts; but, so far as representation was concerned, were discriminated against as a lower caste, only to be represented in the numerical proportion of three fifths.

and so i think that there's a bit of reframing that still needs to happen and saying, this is a novel that happens to star four young women, but it's about figuring out who you are. it's about charting your own destiny. it's about weighing what your family expects of you versus what society expects of you versus what you expect of yourself. and these are really universal themes that aren't tied to gender at all.

cheryl: it is moral for you to delay your divorce to keep your health insurance benefits. but to me, that's not the question — it is, does your husband want to do this? it might be a good idea to get really specific about what amount of time would allow you to figure out this health insurance situation. you know, the sad thing about a divorce is that at the end of the day, it really is a business negotiation. these health insurance questions are really common, sadly, in this society where we don't all have access to health insurance. and so, i think it's a reasonable claim to ask him to delay the divorce.

wu: it's also very complicated. i think, by this point, almost everything on youtube has some ad or another. i mean, i don't work there. but, you know, the only parts of the web that have escaped this are the ones that never embrace this model. i'll bring up wikipedia as an example. wikipedia, a nonprofit, is an enormously popular website but has managed to operate without advertising. and, you know, maybe it's a little simpler than google and youtube, but it does show there's another way.
foer: she was born an shtetl in eastern europe called kolki in poland and was a member of some kind of socialist youth group. and when the nazis were making their way east, there was an understanding that it was political and that they were going to come after people who were involved in certain political groups or she felt that she had to run away. and she left her family then and went further east into russia and, you know, has just an amazing story of survival that lasted a couple of years, and then made her way back to the village of her birth and found that everything was destroyed and that, you know, other women were marrying - wearing her mother's clothing. and she left and met my grandfather in a displaced persons camp, where my mom was born. and they all came to the states a couple of years later.
the impudent ones, published more than 40 years earlier in 1943, reads like a dress rehearsal for the lover, minus the temporal fluidity and linguistic skill. core themes are similar: french family manqué, deceased father, fallen daughter (maud) with two older brothers. similar to the lover, maud's amorous life provides an opening for her eldest brother jacques to be bailed out.
forman: well, i lived with other families afterwards. and - listen, how do you learn about these things? it's so ridiculous to think today that, you know, we have to just hide everything from our children, and then they will be wonderful citizens, you know. i remember that for us, when i was already 6 years old, i discovered a medical book, you know, in my father's library. every time i was home alone, i was browsing, you know, through this book, watching this, you know, drawings of human body without cloth. that's how you discover things.
boudin: that's right. my father's lucky compared to most people who are incarcerated in that he does have his own cell. but, as is often the case, it's not a closed cell. it has an open wall of bars that opens onto a pathway adjoining numerous other individually celled inmates, and so there's no way to be fully six feet away from other inmates. the toilets are right up against the bars on the corridor. and so when any inmate is using the toilet, they're up against an open - essentially an open wall of bars. and there are so many people in the prison and on the particular cell block that social distancing is entirely impossible.
cristina's small body of work was released on the ultra-hip label ze records, which also put out music by influential post-punk artists kid creole and the coconuts, james chance, and lizz mercier descloux. the label was co-founded by her partner and eventual husband, the british-born michael zilkha, who persuaded cristina to record her debut single, disco clone, as a lark — but she ended up elevating the material, filtering it through an ironic sensibility informed by her interest in camp and theater.

many who spoke in support of the former judge said moore was being unfairly targeted because he has stood up for christian principles. moore is known for refusing to remove a ten commandments monument he'd had placed in the alabama judicial building rotunda and for ordering state judges to ignore the u.s. supreme court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide under the federal constitution — each of which led to his being removed from the bench on separate occasions. other speakers decried the lgbt transgender mafia and said that moore was the enemy of both democratic and republican homosexualists.

my personal view is that he had next to no involvement in the writing of that book, said wacker, citing graham's physical condition and also the book's fundamentalist message. that book reflected the views of the early graham, he said, the late 40s, the early 50s. it did not reflect the views of the later graham.
you know, you pursued a really interesting intellectual journey. you spent a lot of time in france and studied these french psychoanalysts. and you kind of crafted your own way of pursuing your intellectual interests about how minds change. and at a time when sociologists were tending to use more quantitative measures, you wanted to do a ph.d. in both sociology and psychology and be trained as a psychoanalyst. why did you want to take that approach? what did you think it offered that was distinctive and important?

so it's interesting that you decided to become a prosecutor because, you know, your parents were in prison. your adoptive parents, bill ayers and bernardine dohrn, they were members of the weather underground. and your father participated in bombings kind of some - intended to be, i think, symbolic bombings, but still bombings of buildings that were symbolic of the power that they were imposing. this was the era of the vietnam war. so there's a bombing of the pentagon, of the capitol building, of a new york city police headquarters. so i - your father says they worked hard to make sure no one was injured. i'm not sure if anybody ever was injured during those bombings.

solidifying that region helped newt gingrich pull off a win in 2012. but it's also not a silver bullet to victory — mike huckabee carried the area in 2008, but fred thompson got enough of the vote to help john mccain to victory. mccain had strong showings in the less religiously focused midlands and lowcountry regions.

lavalle: i would say that what lovecraft was getting down on the page a great deal was his fear of everything - everything. he feared women; he feared anyone who wasn't white; he feared jewish people. i wouldn't be surprised if he feared, like, cars as well. like, he was just so afraid of the modern world. and he managed to - rather than making it a one-for-one and just having those groups of people who he feared and hated show up in the books and stories as people acting terribly, he came up with these strange and impossible creatures because really on some level, he was almost trying to capture the depth and breadth of his terror.

reacting to news of kennedy's retirement, schumer also said, this is the most important supreme court vacancy for this country in at least a generation. nothing less than the fate of our health care system, reproductive rights for women, and countless other protections for middle-class americans are at stake. ... the senate should reject, on a bipartisan basis, any justice who would overturn roe v. wade or undermine key health care protections. the senate should reject anyone who will instinctively side with powerful special interests over the interests of average americans.

there are people who are suspicious of slick marketing and packaging of some of the elements that predominate in this story — female friendships, romantic intricacies, marriage and divorce, pregnancy and motherhood, and who have learned to bump books like this into a firmly unserious subcategory. thus, this is a women's saga, while the story of, say, a crime family that operates over generations on the violent and vengeful energy of a bunch of men, with women primarily appearing as sex objects or symbols of the dream of a serene life that is forever out of reach, would simply be called a saga. despite the fact that the best available information has indicated for years that women as a group buy and read far more fiction than men in most genres, whatever is about women at home and with friends and children and lovers is women's fiction, rather than just ... fiction.

bill kurtis: meet our nato allies.
feldman: well, first off, i think that i turned to books and not to rock music because i probably would have found rock music very threatening, very frightening. even with books, i chose books like little women and pride and prejudice because i felt safer with those books. they felt familiar enough. you know, the world of pride and prejudice, where marriages are arranged and women's value is determined by their status as a wife and mother, it's very similar to where i come from. it doesn't feel so foreign as to be threatening. the one time in my adolescence when i was exposed to, i guess, a portion of pop culture - in the chapter where i discuss accidentally seeing the film mystic river - i was nearly traumatized by that experience because i had no idea how to understand the film. i had no system of references for it. and so i believed that everything in the film was a true indictment of the outside world and that my community was right, that the outside world was evil and that people did constantly commit crimes like murder and theft willy-nilly. i didn't really know how to understand the outside world. and for a long time, even after i left, i experienced the outside world as terrifying.
and then bush named harriet miers, his white house counsel, to replace o'connor. and then when her nomination imploded, he named alito. and this was an interesting moment in leo's career, i think, this bush effort, because, you know, leo is proudly and effectively a member of the conservative movement. and harriet miers was really unknown to the conservative movement and in particular, unknown to the federalist society. she was not a constitutional lawyer.

so trump, never a guy to sweat the policy details as a candidate and now as an administrator, he didn't have much of a policy shop around him too in the way that hillary clinton had dozens of internal staff and external advisers. so the trump administration ended up relying on, first, staff associated with mike pence, who had deep ties to the anti-abortion movement - and then also think tanks like the heritage foundation, this very conservative group in washington, d.c., that had fallen out of some favor and really got a big break by attaching to the trump campaign as kind of the dark horse candidate. and that really started to manifest the representation of anti-abortion views, the christian conservatives.

montagne: now, you know, if there is a single name associated with organizing the christian vote, it might well be yours. you were the head of the christian coalition in the 1990s, the group that helped usher in a republican congress. and you agree that this has mystified a lot of people. so tell us how - what you've come to in the way of the reason why.
so as elizabeth and philip stand at that overlook, in one sense, they've paid a very high price by being separated from their children. in another, they got away with murder many times over. but when she says to him, we'll get used to it — nudging him back to russian — elizabeth is putting her finger on the most haunting question that faces her and her husband: can they go back? can they become russian again? they made new lives and abandoned them. they made children and abandoned them. they are not without country, but they are without identity.

i wrote it in the bathtub, and i had been closing up the house that i had lived in with my ex. it was a home that we bought — sort of all of our dreams of california and sunshine and rock 'n' roll. and the very last thing i did was i took a bath in my favorite bathroom — bathtub that i actually had constructed myself and suddenly sort of having these words come out through music. and i guess i had the presence of mind to record it. i don't remember pressing record. but then that sat in, you know, my tape recorder and was not touched for another year and a half or so because i wasn't ready to release. i was just sort of trying to manifest that through my voice.
and i think she's been reflecting a lot about her own mother's journey. her mother was born on the day that congress gave women the right to vote and into poverty and neglect. and, you know, some a hundred years later, her daughter could be the first woman in the white house. i think it's something that, frankly, hillary told me she's still processing.

sondheim: oh, sure. i wanted this to be the first musical to use [expletive]. and in fact, i first used it in krupke. i wanted the last line of krupke to be, gee, officer krupke, [expletive] you. and we played the song for the head of the record company, columbia records, goddard lieberson, who was going to do the album and also for a lady who was raising money for the producer at the time, and she blanched visibly and clearly was upset by it. she didn't complain; she just was sort of shocked and unhappy. but then goddard told us that if we used that word, we couldn't ship the record across state lines because it would be in violation of the obscenity laws. so we changed it to krup you.
on june 12, 1967, the u.s. supreme court justices ruled in the lovings' favor. the unanimous decision upheld that distinctions drawn based on race were not constitutional. the court's decision made it clear that virginia's anti-miscegenation law violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.

jonas: yeah. despite and in spite of losing two children, i think the one thing that they - that kept them together was that they were each other's friends, confidants. they had the ability and still do have the ability to talk about anything and get through it knowing that the other person is in their team. so whenever - aditi especially, as you can see in the film, is very feisty and has, you know, her own opinions and is sort of, like the leader of the family. but she always knows that no matter what, niren is going to be on her team and vice versa. and they have this crazy faith in each other, which is so inspiring to me. even now, you know, when they walk into a room, they'll look across the room and each other like every couple of minutes because they're like, oh, this person's with me. they walk in hand-in-hand. it's so beautiful to see.
'the power notebooks' daringly explores contradictions in lives of women
more recently, the two of them have owned different parts of president trump's healthcare agenda. seema verma was tasked with coming up with the replacement to obamacare. that's a job that she really wanted. it got her a lot of face time with president trump - so far has not been able to deliver on that. and her team would say, her allies would say that secretary azar has undermined her in that effort by taking potshots at the plan and doing other things to slow down her efforts to come up with a replacement. to be fair, republicans have tried and failed to replace obamacare for years. this is not just a seema verma issue.
still, history always gets the last word. and by the end of a very english scandal, you may well think it's the impetuous norman, not the acclaimed thorpe, who's the more honorable man. indeed, their destiny seemed to bear out the truth of the lines that oscar wilde - who himself fell afoul of britain's homophobic laws - wrote while in prison. to speak the truth is a painful thing, wilde said. to be forced to tell lies is much worse.
for instance, anne sexton was one of my favorite poets, and one of the things that i think inspired her writing, but that she received so much criticism for, was that she revealed too much about herself. she was too confessional. but then, therein lies the rub, because aren't we here to make art that people can relate to? that's the kind of art that inspires me, and that's the kind of art that i wanna make. but honesty is a commodity right now, because if you tell the truth, you might offend people. people don't like to hear the truth. so that's why i said i will never be what society expects me to be. i didn't feel that way then, and i don't feel that way now and nothing's changed.

but justice gorsuch seems both sure-footed and sure of himself and his views. though he was confirmed in time to hear only the final two weeks of the term's oral arguments, his votes and opinions in those cases — and others that the court has disposed of since he was sworn in — paint a vivid picture of a justice on the far right of the current supreme court bench.

something more will be needed to address the steady erosion of working-class life, with all the heartbreak and despair it's engendered.
sondheim: no, no. no, no. no, i never - in public. no, not at all. but since i was writing a book that is critical of my own work, i wanted to show the standards by which i, you know, write my own lyrics. and it seemed to me - curious enough, i had thought - when i first began the book, i thought, i will not criticize anybody else; i will only criticize my own stuff. well, that is, in its own way, the mirror image image of self-aggrandizement. self-depreciation is just the other side of the coin. it's all about me, me, me, me, me. and i thought if i don't put it into context of other people's work and show what i admire and what i don't admire about my predecessors' work - i never talk about anybody living in the book, only about people who are dead because it doesn't hurt their feelings. and also, they can't fight you back. but mostly, you know, i really disapprove of people who criticize - particularly, practitioners who criticize other practitioners while they're alive. i think that's really bad for them because it always hurts. but i thought, you know, i've got to - i can't just criticize myself. so i looked very carefully, as i always have, at, you know, the dozen best lyric writers in the american musical theater who preceded me and look at their work carefully and talk about it a little bit.

the coronavirus is highly contagious, and people gathered in church may engage in behavior, including singing, that is especially conducive to the spread of the virus. in several instances, outbreaks have been traced to a single religious gathering.
ringhand: gorsuch really put the senators in a difficult situation because one of the things that senators can learn from this process is which issues nominees think are on and off the constitutional table. when a nominee thinks an issue is well-settled, they'll usually tell us what they think about it. and if a nominee simply refuses to give a firm opinion about anything, senators lose that ability - they lose the ability to evaluate what the nominee thinks is in play and what isn't.
advocacy groups cite research indicating that those risks and harms include forfeited education, a greater likelihood of poverty, and increased rates of disease and mental health problems, as well as a higher incidence of domestic violence.
the silence had to do with a very real fear of persecution, exposure and shame. the consequences were tragic. for instance, there is no doubt that countless gay men and trans individuals in india contracted hiv as a result of the fears engendered by section 377. by now, because of the aids pandemic, it is well understood how criminalization and marginalization multiply the risks of disease, for instance by keeping people from openly learning about safe-sex methods or by forestalling healthy romantic relationships.

trump, on the other hand, has indicated that he supports planned parenthood. in a march news conference in florida, he said that millions of women have been helped by planned parenthood, adding that he is a common-sense conservative.

minor, who also does quite a bit of production, is eight albums into his career, and accustomed to toggling between hard trap beats, abrasive industrial production, hazy, sung-rapped r&b and anthemic melodicism. he musters a force both athletic and theatrical in service of his earnest searching, anguish and confrontation, sometimes testifying to spiritual overcoming in language that hints at his fluency in contemporary church praise vernacular — the closest he gets to familiar ccm territory — but also, crucially, daring to vividly voice righteous anger about dehumanizing views of african-american people that shape criminal justice, economic and ecclesial systems of power. (the track man, from 2018's the trap, is a prime example; demanding respect for his steadfast, noble hustle on behalf of his family, minor opens with steely, drawled couplets, before switching to a tauntingly combative cadence punctuated with animated outbursts.)

to cite one example, when the state's controversial religious freedom law was enacted, pence appeared on abc's this week. in the 12-minute interview, host george stephanopoulos tried in vain 12 separate times to get an answer to various versions of this question: if a florist in indiana refuses to provide flowers for a gay couple's wedding, is that legal under the state's new religious freedom law, yes or no?
mayer: well, so interestingly, he never had a single bill that he sponsored that passed. so he obviously was not a major legislator. but he did do something else that was kind of remarkable, which was he quickly climbed into the top of the - or near the top of the republican leadership. he became the head of something called the republican study group, which was the sort of clique of right-wingers in congress. and he challenged the leadership of the speaker of the house, who was john boehner. and then soon after, he became the number three person in the house. boehner put him in charge of the republican congress.
and so my family ended up, out of desperation, purchasing a bride from a poor, broken family abroad. and she was not aware of any of the issues, and so she was essentially tricked into the marriage by being offered all sorts of bonuses like jewelry and an apartment and so on. and they married them off. and of course, my mother realized shortly after the marriage what was going on, but she was stuck. she had nobody who would help her, and she had no other place to be or go. and like me, she also didn't have an education, and she also didn't have the resources and the ability to survive in the outside world. so for a long time, she stayed in that world. she got pregnant. she had me. she suffered from severe postpartum psychosis, i was told. i don't know if this is true. her state of mind and her health was very poor when i was a child and she wasn't able to take care of me, is what i was told. and so even before i lived with my grandparents, i was being shuffled around from aunt to aunt and cousin to cousin. and their marriage was deteriorating. and by the time i did move in with my grandparents, she was gone.
in 2006, kristin and justin hege bought the house they thought would be their forever home. at the time, she was 29 and he was 27. it felt perfect: the right size, the right location. they brought one of their sons home from the hospital to that house.

mayer: it does. and one of the interesting things to me in writing about pence is it poses such a juxtaposition between the way that trump ran, which was as a populist outsider who was attacking the big-money forces in the republican party as corrupt and saying that they were puppeteers trying to control the candidates as puppets. and trump made a huge point of saying, i'm my own man; i'm so rich; no one controls me. yet as his vice president, he chose mike pence. and you could hardly find a candidate in the american political scene who has closer ties to the big donors and particularly the koch brothers. he's been sponsored by them for years.

shteyngart's take on america on the verge of a trump presidency is anything but yada yada yada. his comic view of the country is, by turns, compassionate and mournful; wickedly satirical and ultimately, aspirational. he captures what one of his own favorite writers, philip roth, once called the indigenous american berserk but he's not, in turn captured and disfigured by it. he imagines that there might yet be another fork in the road, another highway rest stop, another snoring american right beside you, dreaming their own great american dream.
akhavan: people always ask me. like, i get a lot of questions about this, and it's like don't forget these are all teenagers. it was a set of teens, and it's not my place to ask them who they prefer. and i think when people make assumptions about young actors, that's a bit toxic and gossipy. it's not my place. i care a lot that my hods, my heads of department, are female. i care that my collaborators are queer. i want to create an environment where my work has authenticity. that matters to me, and that's within my control. but i think it's really strange to make assumptions about an actor's sexuality. in terms of gender, i think there's a lot to be said about casting trans actors in trans roles or seeing trans actors for cis roles. that's a debate i want to engage in, but i can't quite put my finger, you know, on a 19-year-old's sexuality and nor would i want to approach that.

on a court that has become increasingly conservative, kennedy's role has been pivotal. in 5-to-4 decisions, his vote has usually determined the outcome on some of the hottest legal and social issues of the day — not just gay rights, but abortion, campaign finance, gun rights, affirmative action, the war on terrorism and the death penalty.

jodi came to me very strongly before i even realized that i was writing a book. i was hanging out with jodi, and she kind of took up residence in my mind, and i became a little infatuated with her. i started thinking about her all the time. and then the plot and the rest of the story sort of fell into place. i really actually kind of felt like i was getting to know her. and so it was a process of realizing what she had been through.

people are going to have a stark contrast and a choice, jones says. someone who has been talking to them about issues, about issues they care about every day, or someone who has a sordid history — not only a personal history but a professional history. jones has been burying voters in tv ads, including one featuring the names and faces of moore's accusers.
emails between boies and times reporters show him wrestling over whether to trust kessler, hoping but not certain the informant was real.
chang: in other words, a classic leading man for this kind of material.
mr. sharlet: yes, it's - i always say that the family is secretive, but not secret. you can go and look at 990s, tax forms and follow the money through these organizations that the family describe as invisible. but you go and you look. you follow that money. you look at their archives. you do interviews where you can. it's not so invisible anymore. so that's how working with some research colleagues we discovered that david bahati, the man behind this legislation, is really deeply, deeply involved in the family's work in uganda, that the ethics minister of uganda, museveni's kind of right-hand man, a guy named nsaba buturo, is also helping to organize the family's national prayer breakfast. and here's a guy who has been the main force for this anti-homosexuality act in uganda's executive office and has been very vocal about what he's doing, in a rather extreme and hateful way. but these guys are not so much under the influence of the family. they are, in uganda, the family.
that's precisely what rubio, president trump and the rest of the washington committee that claims to support guaidó's movement don't get — and don't seem to want to get. that was obvious when the trump administration made guaidó's lost battle sound like a lost war.

use the coronavirus crisis to save money
in your work covering the coronavirus epidemic, you've been covering the official government response, trying to find out what's happening behind the scenes, and you've also written about certain feuds within the department, like, you know, within the trump administration and how those feuds are contributing to how the trump administration is handling the epidemic. and just this week, one of the stories that you broke was about this email breakdown in medicare and medicaid. and there wasn't enough communication about the email breakdown, so medicare and medicaid missed a certain number of emails. they were out of the loop for a while. i mean, that just contributed to the general chaos. so what's the larger significance of stories like that?
diamond: vice president pence has been a major player here. he's the one in the white house with the conduit to this movement, his staff as well. he spoke at the march for life last year, that's the big anti-abortion rally that's held every year in washington, d.c. this is a signature issue for him. and the agency, which had been for many months this year without a full-time secretary, has taken a lot of cues from the white house. and those are coming from the mike pence wing of this administration.

sagal: it's worth pointing out in regard to that remarkable thing that donald trump said that donald trump's famous for his adjectives - things are huge, amazing, unbelievable, terrific. but when talking about his own brain he just went with very good.

rabbis whose testimonies were rejected can still practice in their respective countries; they operate independently of israel's rabbinate. but the israeli state rabbinate has frequently questioned foreign rabbis' judgment in religious matters. last year, israel's religious authorities issued a ruling that raised doubts about the credentials of the new york rabbi who oversaw ivanka trump's jewish conversion.

you know, riyadh, the capital of saudi arabia, is not a particularly friendly city for pedestrians. but i said, ok, let me go to the mall and take a walk around. and i showed up, and there's guards at the door who said, no, no, it's family time; you, as a single man, you can't come in. well, ok, fine. so i sort of sat outside, and there were a bunch of young saudi men there who were trying to get in. and they were sort of, you know, trying to glom on with saudi families, act like they were members of the family to see if they could sneak in. and it was just entertainment. they just wanted to get in so they could walk around, see what was going on, maybe, like, spot some girls and, you know, try to give them their phone numbers so that they could text with each other.
sagal: no. apparently, they're two - they're actually friends. and they on the podcast will talk about, quote, race, fatherhood and the painful divisions that persist in american society, unquote. well, yeah. who cares? we want to hear about what it's like to be incredibly rich and famous. on today's episode, why separate private jets are essential to a healthy marriage. also, barack and bruce try to remember the last time they were forced to wait for anything.

that was the most horrible feeling because i felt like i failed my family. the irony is that then when they came in and found out, you know, this other room there, they went in. they looked around. they went out. they were even smiling at me. and then they went down again with my mother. but then i hear the door click, and then there was silence. and this was, you know, they came like 8 o'clock in the morning, and this was like 2 o'clock in the afternoon. and there was silence. and i hear the car going away in the street. and there is a total silence. they just didn't even let my mother go upstairs and say goodbye. and i am alone, absolutely alone in the whole house. and there was nobody in the town of chanslaff would come home.

obama and harry were quite chummy during the interview, but one subject didn't come up: whether the former president will be invited to the prince's wedding, scheduled for may 19 at windsor castle.
it was all classic palin — rambling, unpredictable and taking aim at the gop establishment. she said trump would kick isis' ass. she slammed president obama as weak-kneed. and, using one of her signature phrases, she praised trump for going rogue left and right.

from the time prince harry and meghan markle — now the duke and duchess of sussex — got engaged, their relationship was considerably less expected. markle is an american. her mother is black. she's an active feminist. she's an actress. she's divorced. she took such abuse in public in the early days of their relationship that harry issued a statement explicitly calling out its sexism and racism — calling it sexism and racism, in those words.
the allegations against moore have come during a cultural moment reflecting changing views about allegations of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual assault. in the weeks since bombshell new york times and new yorker reports about hollywood megaproducer harvey weinstein, several famous and powerful men have been accused of sexual misconduct and suffered varying impacts on their professional fortunes as a result — including men at npr.

itzkoff: i think it was a mutual breakup. and i think that valerie was certainly aware of what robin was doing behind her back and felt like she had to allow it in the sense that he was finally getting to experience, certainly in his career and in his artistic pursuits, all the things that he'd always wanted to have - that he was a no. 1 stand-up with a best-selling album. he was on one of the most popular shows on tv. and so all these other indulgences were part of that experience and allowed him to be who he became. so she felt like she had to permit it. but there's no way, obviously, that a relationship between two people can continue comfortably under that kind of pressure and that kind of lack of understanding. and that - the weight of that ultimately ended the marriage.
davies: deborah feldman's memoir unorthodox: the scandalous rejection of my hasidic roots was the inspiration for the netflix series unorthodox. she's also written a second memoir called exodus.
but the interviews themselves, frankly, are moving quite smoothly, which, you know, lends credence to the notion that we've all been crying about - it's not necessary to interview everybody. so if the person is approved, you know, for the employment, the interview is just whether or not that person is a security threat, which is frankly done by fingerprints and doing internal background checks. seeing the person face-to-face isn't going to make much of a difference and hasn't.
suzanne petroni, one the report's co-authors and a senior director at icrw charged with expanding the evidence base on child marriage, is hoping the data will be a wake-up call for governments. until now, petroni says, research on child marriage has mainly focused on determining its prevalence, causes and costs to women at the individual or family level.
and so they basically used that to craft their approach to the administration. and it turned out to be a wild success. i mean, trump, you know, frequently talks to king salman. he frequently talks to mohammed bin salman. jared kushner has become a close personal friend to mohammed bin salman, so much so that, you know, people in other parts of the u.s. government complain that they don't know what they talk about. i mean, jared kushner will fly to saudi arabia. he'll meet with mohammed bin salman at some desert ranch. and then he'll fly home.

when belief suddenly ends, seemingly in the middle of a thought, elverum's eyes search the room. the audience responds with applause, but a version of this dynamic plays out everywhere he's performed for the last three years — long silences broken up by tentative claps, nervous laughs struck by grief and absurdity. the albums a crow looked at me, now only and lost wisdom pt. 2 engage elverum and his fans in open wounds he chooses to share — death, love and the loss of love — and that we choose to listen to. written with diaristic detail, but in awe of an endless horizon, elverum's existentialism is exhausted, but seeking.

conway: well, i think it is part of the development in our culture which says that there's really no central point of view from which to look at the world today so that everybody's story is relevant in some way. and so now, we have memoirs written by very young people. once upon a time, you only wrote toward the end of your life. they're written by people of every ethnic and class background and every sexual orientation, whereas once upon a time, that terrible experience of poverty would have been fictionalized by a dickens. or the absolutely appalling experience of incest would have been turned into a novel. now, we have lost most of those senses of what it's appropriate to talk about in the first person, and so much that was previously fiction is now presented as a memoir.

shalhoub: no. i had been studying italian a little bit, but no. i had to learn a lot of that italian phonetically. stanley's favorite (laughter) story is that - you know, we had this scripted dialogue. and we would be doing these scenes and speaking in italian back-and-forth. and then he would kind of go off script and start improvising in italian, forgetting that i didn't know italian.
new york city officials last week said black and latino residents were dying at twice the rate of white people. in chicago, more than 70% of virus-related fatalities were among african americans — a percentage more than double their share of the population. black residents in milwaukee county, wis., have seen similarly disproportionate rates.

over the course of 10 months in 2016, the researchers surveyed 40,000 people on their attitudes about discrimination — a typical poll sample might have about 1,000 respondents — which gave them enough data to sketch a more pointillist picture of how americans see one another. (they could, for example, isolate the views of latinos in the southwest who self-identify as conservatives.)

it's really tough to know, but it's not about public opinion. even republicans — like, rank-and-file republicans on the ground — about half of them support a path to citizenship. another 10 percent support legal residency. it's only about 3 in 10, even republicans, that support identifying and deporting immigrants.

this explains why the film has been a hit among rural women. it points up some of the problems that plague them — especially the male indifference to how vulnerable women feel when they lack a toilet.
there's a reason for that lack of information. men are often the focus of prison reform efforts, not women. officials also acknowledge there's been little long-term research centered on female offenders, even though more than 200,000 women in the u.s. are currently incarcerated. the sentencing project, a nonprofit advocacy group, says that's a huge 700 percent hike in the number of women serving time since 1980.

the united states and western allies have long turned a blind eye to totalitarian regimes guilty of a long list of human-rights violations. often, it was in the name of stability and at the expense of people suffering in those countries. but american leaders have mostly been mindful to choose their words carefully to maintain some semblance of a moral higher ground. what trump is doing is different — past american leaders would almost never express admiration for bad actors. trump, in many cases, has been doing exactly that.

the administration also angered some gay rights advocates by initially defending a law that barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages, even in states where they were allowed. at the same time, the white house was working in countless smaller ways to expand gay rights in housing assistance, hospital visitation and other areas.
this, so far, is a producer/songwriters' battle, and it works because it showcases the distinctly collaborative art of creating big records. amy made me a better producer, says salaam remi. she had a knack for saying really smart stuff, and i had a knack for pushing her to write what she really was thinking. the plaits of collaboration are tight. but as sure as in baseball the tie goes to the runner — in music, the song and the love it inspires goes to them that perform it. it's one of the reasons this verzuz series, created by producers swizz beatz and timbaland, works. it brings producers and songwriters out of parenthesis and into all-caps. and along with d-nice's club quarantine, the throwdowns remind a pandemic-weary world of what it is to feel seen and understood — in a moment when we understand so little.
the feeling of resignation carries over to star, a strangely hesitant r&b number in which he's cautious and deferential as he moves out of their home, and the computerized folk track dark places, where he's reacquainting himself with loneliness while trying to negotiate his way out of it. the lyrics in these songs complement beck and pharrell's respective musical instincts, which nudge familiar genre tropes slightly off their predictable patterns and expected tonalities. the result is a mood where all that was once safe and normal to now seems a little bit alien, if not exactly uncomfortable. the grooves are pleasant; the tone of the music is never as dire as the words being sung. it's that strange state of mind where you're acutely aware of your problems, but your brain won't quite let you feel it all.
that is where the issue of racial disparity in death rates highlights the overall difference in the way america is experiencing covid-19. and that difference largely follows the dividing line between urban and rural america.
on wednesday another woman told the post that moore pursued her when she was a high-schooler working at the local mall and phoned her during school when she had ignored his advances in person at the mall. she eventually went out with him, but during that date he gave her an unwanted forceful kiss. other local residents in the gadsden, ala., area have said it was well-known that moore would hang out at the mall to try to pick up teen girls.

that sounds an awful lot like putting the burden on oppressed people to transcend their own oppression. the obamas have faced criticism in the past for such respectability politics — which also imply that if a person of color doesn't succeed, perhaps it's because they didn't try hard enough.

the space opera worldbuilding is broad but shallow. of particular interest is iskat's gender spectrum, indicated by flint (female), wood (male) and glass (nonbinary), which allows people to perform their gender through hairpieces, bangles, or pins. it also challenges kiem with moments of dissonance, when he misreads a thean person's gender based on his own biases. on the thean side is a clan system with intricate relationships and loyalties — many of which jainan had to give up when he married taam. yet despite how jainan suffers from not honoring his own customs, maxwell doesn't delve into what exactly those traditions are, nor into jainan's tense position straddling two cultures. and the auditors' deliberate distancing from other humans is fascinating, yet never truly explored.

the aca allows people to sign up outside the open enrollment period for a variety of special reasons, such as moving, losing coverage, getting married or having a child. this provision has always been a sticking point with insurers, who have maintained that too many customers who made a change during the special enrollment period were sicker and costlier than average. in response, the obama administration tightened some of these requirements last year and announced it would run a pilot program starting this summer to randomly select half of all special enrollment applicants for verification review, holding up the applicant's insurance coverage until they provide the proper documentation.

when this policy came out i stood [in] the conference center with my mother. she looked around and said, 'my family worked to build this and it should belong to all of them.' she broke down crying and has since left the church, braidan weeks tweeted. the pain that has already happened can't be undone. i hope that the church truly wants to heal with the communities of utah. because even those of us that are no longer members helped build the church to what it is. we care about this state and its people. cheers to hope.
whitman's poetic self is capacious. doty calls leaves of grass a kind of collaboration with totality, referring to lines such as these from whitman's song of myself:
many will not reveal their last names and are reticent to explain why they ended up homeless. fragments of conversations provide glimpses of pain and grief — lost jobs, marriage break-ups or mental health issues.
another huge impact is in restoring a sense of self-respect and dignity. and we are now filled with hope and determination that these changes will be speedily reflected in vital legal and policy changes in india — such as in terms of equalizing marriage, inheritance and adoption rights irrespective of sexual or gender orientation.

sagal: no, it was actually fake. the bbc headline read, is donald trump a sex pest?
during his presidential campaign, in a bid for the support of social conservatives, trump issued two lists totaling 21 names and pledged to pick his first supreme court nominee from those lists. he did just that in naming gorsuch to fill the open seat once occupied by scalia.

but even before those details emerged, moore refused to concede the race and made unfounded allegations of voter fraud following his defeat that were roundly rejected in court.
what he's accused of: invaded a sovereign country (ukraine) and annexed part of it (crimea). ... aiding syrian president bashar assad militarily. assad is accused by the west of using chemical weapons against his own people. ... meddled in elections, including in the u.s. ... allowed hackings of western bank accounts without prosecution ... some 100 men suspected of being gay have been swept up in chechnya, including three who were killed last month. ... people with disabilities face discrimination, including not studying in mainstream schools ...
cornish: but this touched on your life recently, right? i mean, you write about the roseanne barr incident, that you were the target of this racist tweet from her. when that touched you personally, how did you react?

still, she questions her motives in writing her controversial 2018 harper's article about issues raised by the #metoo movement that she found troubling — an essay that unleashed a torrent of ugly attacks against her even before its publication when it was rumored that she was planning to out the creator of the sh--ty media men list. (moira donegan preemptively outed herself.) my life was finally so comfortable; i could go into the office and teach students i loved, she acknowledges. i could write careful books that took years of research and inflamed nobody. why would i go back into arguing against received ideas?

oh, it's not that i don't like it. it's like saying the word politics. it just means a lot. in a way, it's too general. i think a lot of people just don't really understand what it means, either. because a lot of people think that if you say you're a feminist, you don't like men and that's simply not true, in my case.
conan: and to study what in particular?
i have saved at least $5,000 on renting a wedding hall, having a banquet, two wedding parties, renting cars and other details, said aziz masoud, 26 and jobless, who was carried on his friends' shoulders in an alleyway of gaza's jabaliya refugee camp earlier this month.
toobin: oh, absolutely. all his friends told me that, that this is a child with a very substantial disability, spina bifida, as well as other medical problems. and the notion that a child with genetic disorders that could be identified in the womb, the idea that a woman could terminate that pregnancy, is anathema to him. and i think that is not just an abstract belief. i think out of the love of his daughter and the love of his son, who was also afflicted with spina bifida, is something that shaped his views. you know, of course, the real issue with abortion, of course, is who decides. you know, if leonard leo and his family believe that no fetus should be aborted, that of course is fine. supporters of abortion rights believe that that decision shouldn't be up to leonard leo or his judges or his government. it should be up to the women who are facing that decision.

the jolt was short-lived. palin would make missteps that had a negative affect on the campaign. but her star turn with the base would inspire the outgrowth of the tea party, help republicans take back the house in 2010, and lay a lot of the groundwork that made a trump presidency possible.
sagal: is she there? is she there?
he's entitled to make a mistake every once in a while, trump replied, nudging pence.
mr. sharlet: well, there are a lot of just plain old sad details: doug hampton telling us that john ensign, even when confronted this, told hampton he's going to continue to pursue hampton's wife and that, you know, essentially nothing can stop him. hampton's description of his attempts to work through this c street and the family, which he really respected, to hold ensign accountable. hampton's, really, attempt to do the right thing, and especially according to the ideas that the family promotes: this idea of personal accountability and the reality that the family interpreted that accountability as - they interpret it in financial terms, senator tom coburn saying one thing and then another about the transfer of funds from ensign to hampton's family. hampton really just, i think, i have sort of a newfound respect for him after last night because it does seem like he's sort of seeking transparency on this whole thing.
by her mid 20s, guisewite had a successful career in advertising. she was eager to take advantage of all the new opportunities that were opening up for women. but being single and independent had its drawbacks. she felt caught between what she calls the two bettys — the 1950s icon of the ideal homemaker betty crocker, and the new, vibrant, feminist voice of betty friedan. she wanted what both had to offer.
noah: yeah. that's - i've seen that everywhere. i've seen that everywhere. people, you know - people make jokes about that. and that was funny. when i first came to the u.s. - because i do accents. and i've traveled the world.
much of the decline stems from higher rates of suicide, opioid overdoses and alcohol-related illnesses — the deaths of despair that case and deaton refer to. americans are drinking themselves to death, or poisoning themselves with drugs, or shooting or hanging themselves.
progress on this journey often comes in small increments, sometimes two steps forward, one step back, obama said during a rose garden celebration hours after the high court's decision was announced. and then sometimes, there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.
garcia-navarro: right, played by madeline weinstein.
she found the corporate structure so stifling, she didn't even make it out of training. within three months, she was once more wearing a badge and gun as a patrol officer at the houston county sheriff's office. she's been there since 2006 and has been promoted twice.
what coronavirus exposes about america's political divide
research shows that experiencing discrimination has harmful effects on health, casey says. that's an implication all the more troubling because the poll also shows the serious barriers to health care for lgbtq and especially transgender people in america.

last november, she says, she completely surrendered to the changes she knew she had to make. she quit her beloved job to focus on recovery, and her last drink was on thanksgiving day, she says. days later, she wrote about her long-held secret in the louisville courier-journal: i'm jessica, i'm the 2019 kentucky state teacher of the year, i'm an alcoholic and i've been suffering in silence for years.

moore: (as laura petrie) dried - rob, this is our baby and that's all there is to it.
mccain's willingness to buck his own party earned him the nickname maverick, a moniker he wore proudly. but that independent streak — and his famous temper — did not always endear him to party leadership.
gross: but, you know, this sermon isn't even just about homosexuality. it's about like all pleasure, the things that give you pleasure, they're sins. so it's kind of like cutting off the possibility of pleasure because it's evil. and i think - yeah.
pugh: ...you know, when she first marries alexander, her husband, we all had the kind of same idea that even though she has been sold with this piece of land, maybe she's excited to have this marriage. maybe she wants it to go well. and you know what? maybe she's excited to lose her virginity. she's probably 17, 18 years old. and we kind of played with the idea of her being eager.
sanders: and i also forgot to thank you because you're one of those artists who, on top of having an incredible debut, the sophomore album, once again, was even better.
shalhoub: it was actually, i think, in the '50s.
shalhoub: (as primo) it's good, huh? you like?
baldonado: yeah, so people who wanted to get divorced still had to stay together and that's sort of a tension in connor's household.
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross, back with jonathan safran foer, author of the new novel here i am. it's a novel that asks a lot of questions about faith, religion, family and fidelity at a time when things seem to be fracturing on a personal and global scale. the main characters are the members of a jewish family. the parents' marriage is fraying. the oldest son is preparing for a bar mitzvah he doesn't want to have. the son's great-grandfather is an elderly holocaust survivor preparing for death. foer's novels everything is illuminated and extremely loud and incredibly close were adapted into films.
james corden: i mean, i feel it's only right that we would listen to this while we're here.
o'doherty naranjo: i think that gives you strength. before this, i was running a political campaign to run for state assembly here. and it just seemed silly. i had 70 volunteers trying to help me. and i said, you know, why are we doing this? we need to change our focus. and the question was how best to redirect their efforts.
briger: well, sebastian barry, thanks so much for joining us today.

a new nbc news/wall street journal poll conducted by marist, released friday morning, showed cruz had slashed trump's 16-point lead last month to just a 5-point advantage. but in the upstate, trump was still leading him by 4, and the real estate mogul still had a 3-point edge among white evangelical christians statewide.

before returning to the u.s., big sister went to little sister's empty apartment in a city along the mekong river, where she'd lived before she got married and had stored her belongings before going on the run. big sister discovered medical results on a coffee table, showing that her little sister was pregnant a few months before she disappeared. earlier, her family had also found a love note revealing little sister was having an affair with the handsome businessman — something he'd denied during our long lunch.

lgbtq activists, for their part, have expressed alarm that the move will actually harm these couples, many of whom hail from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal. without a legal marriage, and thus without a visa, such partners face the threat of deportation; but activists point out that if they get legally married to stay in the u.s., they could also face persecution upon returning to their home country.

ojalá pase interpolates rodríguez's melody as well as seven lines of the song's chorus, inflecting them with new meaning: ojalá se te acabe la mirada constante / la palabra precisa, la sonrisa perfecta. yotuel's verse places the idealism of rodriguez's words and of the revolution since 1959 in contrast with the pain and lack of movement yotuel sees in cuba today: llora mi pueblo y siento yo su voz / tu '59 yo doble 2 / 60 años trancado el dominó.
b harper: and let's also be clear about that. biracial didn't come into fashion until maybe, like, 2003. like, obama's the first black president, you know what i mean? i mean, it's like, biracial is this wonderful pie-in-the-sky concept that america can't seem to really catch up with.
gjelten: that's how society is changing. people who say the idea of a same-sex union goes against their religious beliefs have given up on making same-sex marriage illegal. instead they're advocating a right not to go along with it - a government clerk who does not want to issue a marriage license or the baker who doesn't want to make a cake for a gay wedding. jeremy tedesco, senior counsel at the alliance defending freedom, says supporting that right is important because someone opposing same-sex marriage in that way could now face a discrimination suit.

and, you know, i never understood why litmus tests are such a bad idea. i - you know, every - every member of the senate judiciary committee, all the senators, have a view on roe v. wade. none of them have any influence on whether roe v. wade is upheld or reaffirmed. but the one person who might have an effect on that, which is the nominee, is - under the conventions of our system - not supposed to say. and i think the way people like leonard leo can learn about what gorsuch thinks about roe v. wade is to have these sort of coded conversations about precedent, about the structure of the constitution, that give a very clear sense to trump and to, you know, his supporters, what gorsuch is going to do. and to - you know, just to answer your question, trump did not ask neil gorsuch will he vote to overrule roe v. wade. i think there is very little doubt - especially if you know what leonard leo cares about - that neil gorsuch will, at every opportunity over the next three, four decades, vote to overturn roe v. wade.

diamond: this is essentially an entire team dedicated to ensuring religious liberty in health care and punishing doctors and hospitals that don't allow workers to express their religious objections. this creation of the team, which we scooped last week, was clearly politically choreographed. there was the march for life in washington where tens of thousands of anti-abortion supporters came to the city. the announcement of this new division was scheduled for a day ahead of that. and then religious leaders at the events were able to tout it and celebrate and say, look what the trump administration is doing to protect religious liberty.
when the coronavirus first struck the u.s. in march, every state implemented restrictions aimed at limiting its spread. businesses closed, schools and offices went remote and much of the country was under strict orders to stay home — at least temporarily.

as hhs secretary, price would not only oversee obamacare as it currently exists, but also run the government's largest social programs, including medicare, medicaid and the children's health insurance program. he would also have authority over the food and drug administration, the centers for disease control and prevention, the national institutes of health and other major health agencies.

taiwan has been at the forefront of protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. it is poised to legalize same-sex marriage in the next two years because of a constitutional court decision in may. in late october, taiwan had its 15th annual pride parade, which drew about 123,000 participants from around the world. many news outlets dubbed the event asia's biggest gay pride parade.

so far, clts is showing modest success globally. a 2009 study out of duke university compared around 500 village households in india's orissa state exposed to a shaming approach with another 500 in a control group. families below the poverty line in both groups got a subsidy for toilet construction. shame proved to be more effective than subsidies, though a combined shame and subsidy approach was better than shame alone. a 2013 impact evaluation of a clts based approach in indonesia that interviewed around 2,100 households found that communities that received the intervention were 23 percent more likely to build a toilet than those who didn't and had a 30 percent lower rate of diarrhea. and a randomized trial of a clts intervention in mali, involving around 4,500 households, published last year in the lancet, found kids in villages with the intervention were slightly less likely to be stunted or underweight than kids in control villages.

mb: this has been a real gift to me, because i have tended to spend too much time on those craftier, emotional hefty songs. ... writing in this unabashed, fast way has really brought the joy back to writing for me because even though i love writing autobiographical, emotional songs, it's exhausting. i mean, i love it, but it's emotionally exhausting. ... in this context, it's not even hard work because we're throwing these little creative elements in that we've been honing for years.

as a record, crudo is perfect, and agonizing. laing describes kathy's distress, her panic, her dodges and cowardice. there's a brutally accurate list of might-as-wells: if the world is ending, kathy might as well have chicken for lauren's birthday and file a review, she might as well continue with her small and cultivated life, pick the dahlias, stake the ones that had fallen down. because laing writes about picking dahlias, because she admits the pleasures of the life we know is her own, she never runs the risk of hypocrisy. we know the novel's few claims of truth come from a writer as baffled as we are.

lavalle: ...by 10 or 11. so how could these people have power over me? there must be some cosmic evil at play, you know? there must be something that explains why i feel so powerless. and lovecraft in his own life felt incredibly powerless. he was from a family that once had wealth but had lost it all. he was raised in a very cloying family atmosphere and then his mother died. his father was institutionalized. and then he was essentially left alone, left his own devices. and so in many ways, even though he was this incredibly smart and well-read human being, he was also this - in many ways this flailing 10 or 11-year-old kid. and the complement that you can pay to his art is that he actually got that down on the page in a way that this 10 or 11-year-old black kid from queens could also relate to.

conway: well, i don't think my mother is diminished by depicting the tragedy of her life because i start out in the road from coorain showing people this absolutely wonderfully powerful, rich joyful, creative woman. and to chronicle her deterioration as a result of a society that had no place for an older woman and taught a widow to think of her life as over doesn't seem to me to diminish her, it just really emphasizes the tragedy of her life. and other people, people who are living, i always show what i've written about them. and if they don't like it or didn't, i would either leave it out or change it or find some other way to say what i wanted to say. in fact, nobody has ever asked me to change anything.
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross, back with sheryll cashin, author of the new book loving about loving versus virginia, the supreme court decision that overturned laws banning interracial marriage. monday will be the 50th anniversary of that decision. one of her earlier books is a memoir about growing up in huntsville, ala., where her parents were civil rights activists. when we left off, we were talking about being from an activist family.

as pence noted with this self-deprecating joke at the republican national convention, he and trump couldn't be more different in their styles: you know, he's a man known for a large personality, a colorful style and lots of charisma, pence joked. and so, i guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket.

ms. winston: the army has 100,000 members, but they have 62,000 employees. so they almost have as many employees as they do members. so they've realized that they can't run on their ranks alone, and so they've had to reach out to folks who want to serve the mission along with them.

diamond: there are so many different ways, both very big and visible to small and kind of hidden away. this administration's policies are being shaped by the views of leaders who are anti-abortion and who have expressed, before joining the administration, some very strong anti-lgbt views too. for instance, there's a corner of hhs called the office of refugee resettlement. it takes custody of more than 100,000 refugees every year. it also handles unaccompanied minors.

it's never going to be the hard sell, where they're going to, you know, twist museveni's arm behind his back and say do this. as the family themselves describes it, you create a prayer cell, or what they call - and this again, this is their language from their documents - an invisible believing group of god-led politicians who get together and talk with one another about what god wants them to do in their leadership capacity. and that's the nature of their relationship with museveni.

so, you know, i didn't understand those things as a young man. we had a terrible row about it, and we never spoke again not because he wouldn't forgive me. it was because i was young and foolish and ridiculous. you don't realize how quick the years go, and i didn't speak to him really, and i regret that. but as recompense, i have tried to think about him every day, and, you know, cherish him in memory. that's all i can do.

sally levitt steinberg, adolph's granddaughter, tells the almost mythical origin story of how her grandfather met an engineer on a midwestern train, and the two of them came up with the prototype for a donut-making machine. after many failures, levitt finally succeeded in 1921, setting up the machine in the window of his bakery in harlem, n.y. instead of having to roll out the dough, cut the donuts and fry them in a pot, bakers could just set up this machine, which plopped perfect circles of batter into hot oil, then fried and flipped them at just the right time. it's the exact contraption that later hypnotized richardson — and so many others.

john chester: i grew up - in my 20s, i worked on a couple of family farms, but they were, you know, industrial, sort of commercial monocrop operations, growing corn and soy for, essentially, perdue chickens, but no understanding of soil or the importance of biodiversity or how the whole ecosystem went together; in fact, it was all about suppressing, you know, the ecosystem and controlling it and fighting it. so there wasn't really an understanding beyond just driving a tractor, building fences and weed-whacking.
far from a political liability, the president's embrace of same-sex marriage helped to mobilize young supporters. and he was handily re-elected. in his second inaugural, obama wove the push for gay rights into a broader civil rights tapestry, stretching from seneca falls and selma to stonewall.
much of that justice is here, poetic and otherwise, in her nashville cottage, which she moved into when her marriage ended and made her own – her own decorations, her own flowers, her own furniture chosen not for some future that she aspired to, but the one she has right now. petals for armor is, in part, about finding this place for herself alone. she's been re-reading dr. clarissa pinkola estés' book women who run with the wolves, and there's a particular passage about the power women can gain when they give themselves time and permission to go home, wherever (or whatever) that may be: they take back their voices and write. they rest. they make some corner of the world their own. they execute immense or intense decisions. they do something that leaves footprints.
martin: how do you respond to the fact that many people who adhere to other religious traditions - progressive religious traditions or even religious traditions outside of christianity - consider the current administration demeaning, abusive to people outside of a group of core supporters? and they are troubled and hurt by the fact that white evangelicals are such a strong base of support for this president when he engages in conduct that they consider so hurtful. how should they think about that?
modern chinese history is punctuated by multiple rounds of political purges. the recent sweep away black campaign draws inspiration from another anti-graft initiative launched in the early 2000s by now-disgraced politician bo xilai.
garcia-navarro: yeah. but there's also a deep undercurrent there that i couldn't help coming back to, which is as a girl also who's young and trying to figure out her sexuality, to be in a relationship with someone who may not be heterosexual is painful and difficult and makes you question all sorts of things about yourself. and on the other side, you have elliott, who also is interested in alex, and he's out and he's very sure of who he is, but he's not sure what kind of relationship he's going to have with alex going forward. and so there's just a lot of sort of - i don't know - collateral damage around that.
a senate election in alabama. a republican tax bill moving through congress. violent protests in the middle east following u.s. recognition of jerusalem as the capital of israel.
adam felber: well, here's the thing - i think because - if you're that rich, there's some satisfaction you get from stealing from the poor.
if you think about it, the numbers are kind of shocking. thirty-two percent of republicans say that african-americans face a lot of discrimination and 77 percent of democrats say the same. it's a 45-point partisan divide.
cashin: that was the first time and the signature time when the supreme court of the united states says explicitly, this law is about maintaining white supremacy - the first time they used these words to name what the civil war and the 14th amendment should have defeated, right?
so we - i assumed, anyway, that whomever we would hire would not be able to sing very well because to get all those qualities and a singer - certainly, nobody sprang to mind. and the chances of finding somebody like that were slight. so i put all the vocal weight on frederick, the hero, and on anne, the young wife - the 18-year-old. and desiree, the middle-aged lady, i had her take part in two numbers in the first act, both of which are essentially comic and do not require any heavy singing.
sagal: and this used to - you used to say this, but it's fallen out of practice. a, well, dad-sizzle it, b, great wertheimer's majesty, or c, jesus's favorite sweater vest.
as i've traveled this country, through all fifty states; as i've rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what i've also seen, more than anything, is what is right with america, obama will say. i see people working hard and starting businesses; people teaching kids and serving our country. i see a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, unconstrained by what is, and ready to seize what ought to be.
number eight - another hbo series, sharp objects. that was with amy adams. patrick melrose and sharp objects were both very dark, psychological studies. but i really think they were very well done. number seven - a returning show from hulu, the handmaid's tale. again, dark, dark, dark, but what an amazing performance. elisabeth moss is just so good in that. number six - another marvelous performance. this is from the marvelous mrs. maisel. and it's one of the better comedies on all of television, one of the best. and it looks so good. it's like a world i want to go in. it's mad men all over again, except it's lighter.

moore: on my behind, right. but within a few weeks, we were sneaking them into a few other scenes in every episode, and they were definitely cupping under and everyone thought it was great.
diamond: alex azar is a more traditional choice for the job than tom price. azar's a george w. bush administration veteran. he was a high-level hhs leader. he was also in the private sector, a pharmaceutical executive at eli lilly. so he has lots of administrative expertise. he's someone that democrats feel they can work with. tom price, his predecessor, who left the agency after the reporting of me and my colleague rachana pradhan, hadn't been a high-level agency official, and he was much more partisan. he had really been an attack dog for the republican party on the affordable care act. so azar is seen, interestingly, as a more moderate choice who's inheriting an agency that has had more partisan bend. he did telegraph in his hearings that he believes, though, in conscience protections. that issue came up. and after he said that, that was seen by the evangelical community, the christian conservative community as a sign that he will continue some of these pushes, if not all of them.

now, i did that throughout the show. i still began, as i always do, writing the score from the first song on, but knowing - always making notes as to how i would use it later in the show. so i never wrote blind, so to speak; i wrote knowing, ok, this will be useful when this - because we had plotted out the show, and we knew what was going to happen in the second act; in other words, we knew what had happened in the past. and, so yeah - so i was writing to that kind of plot.
but you have this gargantuan survey pool.

politically, price is conservative. he opposes abortion rights, receiving a 2016 rating of 0 by planned parenthood and 100 percent by national right to life. he has voted against legislation aimed at prohibiting job discrimination based on sexual orientation; for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between one man and one woman; and against the bill that would've ended the don't-ask-don't-tell policy regarding disclosure of sexual orientation in the military.

the news from moore that he is running again was quickly met with heavy pushback by national republicans, who had long urged him not to run again for fear his candidacy would endanger their chance at flipping democrats' most vulnerable senate seat next year. moore wasn't their first choice in 2017 either, as many lined up behind luther strange, the republican who had been appointed to fill the remainder of former attorney general jeff sessions' term. but moore would go on to beat strange, the former alabama attorney general, in a runoff by more than 9 points.
another way i would put that is that we've had a chance to kind of step away from our country and see it at a distance in so many areas of life - in race relations, in political relations, in gender relations and also in our relationships with our technology. and seeing things fresh and seeing them anew gives us a chance to come back and act more deliberately in all of these areas. and that's why, even though this has been such a frightening and alienating experience, i think it also is a chance to start fresh. and i end up feeling optimistic about the future.

the neatly concluded series finale has fallen out of favor. perhaps since the black screen that ended the sopranos -- and the subsequent cultural accusations that it was unsophisticated to find it unsatisfying — it has been understood that to leave questions unanswered is to respect your audience. certainly, the americans leaves plenty of questions unanswered: will stan ever find out whether renee is, indeed, a russian spy? will paige be able to talk her way through her parents' disappearance and emerge unscathed as an american, since stan presumably doesn't plan to bust her? will philip and elizabeth stay together in russia?

hubbard: sometime very early in his tenure, mohammed bin salman realized that technology could be a big asset for him, that he could use it both to kind of shape how saudis understood what was happening in the kingdom and also just for pure surveillance. and so you have one of his deputies, this gentleman named saud al-qahtani, who would surface later in connection with the murder of jamal khashoggi, who was basically deputized to go out and buy the best hacking technologies that were available on the open market and to also look into technologies for manipulating social media. so if we talk first about social media, you know, social media in the u.s. is one thing. a lot of people are on facebook. in saudi arabia, it's a completely different magnitude because in the united states, you have - you know, there's a lot of places where people can go to talk about stuff, you know? and you have talk shows. and you have - you know, it's just a bit easier, whereas in saudi arabia, partly, you know - anyway, for various reasons, social media is massive in saudi arabia. you know, saudis carry multiple cellphones. many of them have multiple twitter accounts. they spend huge amounts of time on social media. and it's tremendously important just for how they understand the world, for how they understand what's happening in the world and what's happening inside of saudi arabia.

part of that success is due to the huge number of judicial vacancies that existed when trump took office — 122. that staggering number is due to the fact that republicans, who controlled the senate in the last two years of the obama presidency, confirmed only two appeals court judges — a record that dates back to the 1800s.

and what she goes on to argue is that even if we change the laws, even if we change our social policies, even if we find all of these other official ways to acknowledge women's equality — which is something that we have now done by many measures — after both the suffrage movement's success and the second wave's successes, we will still have to adjust our personal biases and expectations, and that the way to do that will be to live through what she calls an epoch in which women and men cease to marry each other and thereby adjust to each other and begin to view each other as true equal independents.

in a march interview on msnbc, trump said that women should be punished for having abortions. pence opposes abortion rights — in indiana, pence signed a bill earlier that month banning abortions because of a fetal abnormality. the bill sparked criticism from women who found the law invasive. but trump's comments went too far for pence, whose office responded with a statement that he disagrees with trump:
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. the belief that homosexuality is a sin and that you can be healed of this sin with the help of jesus is the premise of christian gay conversion therapy. the new film the miseducation of cameron post is set in the early '90s at a fictional residential gay conversion therapy program called god's promise where teenagers are sent by their parents or guardians usually against the will of the teenager. once arriving at god's promise, the teens are called disciples and are forced to conform to rigid rules. their communication with the outside world is cut off for several months. and they have to agree that all sexual behavior outside of marriage between a man and a woman is a sin.

and i didn't really understand that concept, so we had a meeting with all of his therapists at one point, where they all were in the room, holly was in the room, and i came in and one of the therapists - the specialist in floor time asked me to get on the floor with r.j. and start interacting with him so they could evaluate him. and i got down on the floor, and it was just a disaster. he didn't look at me. he was playing with a fire engine at the time. he just kept turning the wheels around and around and really didn't pay any attention to me.
i think it's a positive that the president seems to finally realize the severity of the problem. unfortunately, his short remarks contained a lot of mistakes and misinformation. the president said that travel from europe would be suspended for 30 days. that wasn't completely correct. the white house had to immediately walk that back. u.s. citizens and their families and legal permanent residents can still come back. the president said that cargo would be banned from europe. that would have been a huge blow to the economy, especially given that some crucial medical supplies come from the eu. but it turned out that trump misspoke again; cargo will still be allowed.

sagal: well, one last thing, which is that you have a presidential medal of freedom, right?
those are the question that need to be asked. and those questions, i think, have even started occurring, or occurring even more strongly, within the christian right itself. and i thought one of the most promising developments of this to come out of the scandal was a christian right magazine called world magazine - hard christian right. this is probably the leading christian right magazine in america. and they looked at what was being said about the family - said we've got to check into this. and they did one of the best investigative reports. they confirmed the overseas travel. they confirmed the strange theology of seeking out dictators. they went further than i had in looking at some of the financial connections that don't seem to quite add up, the policy of secrecy and so on. and this is coming from a christian right source. and i think what that does is it moves this whole conversation out of the old left-right debate and moves it where it should be, into the public square where we're talking about transparency, we're talking about accountability, we're talking about politicians taking responsibility for the ideas that shape them and that they put into effect. and those are matters that i think pretty much everybody, left and right, agrees on. and i think the result of all this, the pressure that happens from these local reporters, and from the christian right corners, and maybe from my book is to force the family to start answering questions about itself.

she got ready to drive past the charter jet terminal at the right moment. and i kind of darted out from the main terminal, and there was a little patch of concrete that we had scouted out earlier where i ran over and it gave me a view of the charter jet field. so as rachana was driving by and able to see tom price getting out of the plane - his distinctive shock of white hair - i was able to see the kind of backup view of the overall staff. and then i ran down and saw kellyanne conway, who he was traveling with, and others appeared to be getting into black suvs escorted by secret service. so that was a pretty pivotal moment because we had been working for months and months to confirm it, and we saw it with our own eyes.

in the book, judy and gary are not joiners either, mainly because of gary's extreme anxiety — it's easier for him, and for them as a couple, to keep themselves apart from others than to try to find couples who can deal with their issues. but that separateness comes at a cost. by the middle of the book, judy starts to see how their reluctance to engage socially has left her without a sense of community. with her difficult marriage and her now-distant teenage son, she feels alone in the world. which only makes her wear her dog more.
folks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of donald trump's mouth, he said.
cashin: well, it's a source of pride, you know. i just - my childhood was like that, you know? my parents, after being part of this movement that desegregated public accommodations, they moved on to desegregating the schools. and me and my brothers were some of the first black children to attend previously all-white schools. we integrated the school we went to. we integrated a neighborhood. we forced our way into a neighborhood. the n-word access a particular school. that was what i was used to. and then i grew up in - my father founds this independent party, ndpa. and i grew up...

and the question i always ask my brothers and sisters in the conservative denominations, robinson says, is, 'could it be that god is leading us into a deeper truth about gay and lesbian, bisexual, transgender people?' 
mr. siciliano: it made me angry. it was like, you know, gay street youth created this thing that's made things so much better for so many of us, and yet at that time, there was no shelter of a covenant house. people of that time would get brutally gay-bashed and beaten when they tried to go to covenant house.
sagal: the stakes are high this time. ready to play?
i remember one time, i went on a little bender where i tried to learn as many words as i could from the dictionary, and i thought, i'm going to increase my vocabulary onstage, and i'm going to expand my word count. my word cloud will be immense. and i got onstage, and i lost half of the audience because half of the people in the audience were going, we don't know what perambulate means; why do we have to think about this? and i realized, you've got to be careful in citing what your intention is. are you using language, you know, as a flourish, or are you trying to communicate as effectively as possible with another human being? and that's what donald trump, in my opinion, did very, very well.
warren: that was a big, sort of comprehensive bill that has a lot of - people have a lot of opinions on. spending is obviously something that conservatives in the house have a lot of opinions on as well. but nobody seems to be really interested on either side of pennsylvania avenue in any kind of government shutdown where republicans are in charge of all sides of the political government. so i think that is an easier task to complete. health care is another story.
albright: well, we were in the middle of doing it, frankly. what happened was that what we were dealing with was questions about missile limits, a very technical subject which kim jong il knew a great deal about. and i was able to have a discussion with him. and we were just beginning talks in kuala lumpur when the election of 2000 happened. and the bush administration - well, i'd had briefed secretary designate powell on what was happening. he thought it was very interesting. and then a headline appeared saying powell to continue clinton policies in north korea. the white house disagreed, and they were cut off. so we were getting somewhere, and by the time when we left office, the north koreans didn't have fissile material. they didn't have these kinds of missiles, and they didn't have nuclear weapons. so it was a big loss that we weren't able to go forward.

seattle mourned the news: elizabeth and robert mar died of covid-19 within a day of each other. they would have celebrated 50 years of marriage in august.
close: oh, any cult is to make the world better but their way.
chang: i mean, ultimately, you are interested in the parallels and the intersections between these two family stories - the trumps and the kushners - because they're both in the executive branch now. and the case that you make throughout your book is that with the trumps, they don't see much difference between the national interest and the family's interests. is that why you're describing what we're seeing now as an oligarchy?
president obama's years in office have seen a flowering of gay and lesbian rights, culminating a year ago when the supreme court legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states.
on the other side of capitol hill, president trump has reignited a fire in his own party. not surprisingly, he did that with a tweet this morning, which read, the freedom caucus will hurt the entire republican agenda if they don't get on the team and fast; we must fight them and dems in 2018. the president blames the house freedom caucus for the failure of the health care bill.
meanwhile, their father, robert, had also become sick. he had been a civilian operations analyst for the u.s. navy.
a new novel makes the 'sugar run' out of jail and back to west virginia
the first three episodes of the new season focus on turmoil in the royal marriage between elizabeth, played by claire foy, and her husband philip. it's an elaborate story, showcasing doctor who alum matt smith's amazing ability to play philip as both a sympathetic figure trapped by the rigid demands of royal life and a blithely selfish jerk blinded by entitlement and childish petulance.
what's open, and what's restricted or closed?
what trump has said: as yet, neither trump nor his campaign has responded to searles' allegations specifically.
gross: there's a story that you tell, ellen, that i'd like you to tell 'cause i think every woman who isn't, like, beautiful but has a friend who is very attractive might relate to this story. and it's a story about meeting bob dylan with a friend of yours who wasn't a close friend, who came backstage with you. and you had backstage access 'cause your parents knew everybody, including bob dylan.
moore had remained defiant, however, using a very trumpian strategy of running against the media and the d.c. establishment he says have conspired against him and are behind the allegations. and he won the gop primary over the appointed strange earlier this year, despite being heavily outspent by both strange and the senate leadership fund.
gross: so katy tur, what was your reaction when donald trump mentioned that you had stumbled?
moore: that's the amazing part of it. most alcoholics are in such a state of denial about their condition. they will blame everything but themselves for whatever is going on. i didn't have hangovers, per se, but i found that it was getting very difficult to hold the eyeliner brush steady when i was applying my makeup in the morning.
sabrina corlette, an attorney who studies the individual marketplace for the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university, said the directive could result in fewer healthy enrollees — which insurers also would not like — and doesn't address some of the biggest concerns for the insurance industry, such as the fate of federal subsidies that help low-income consumers pay deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs.
steinem: yes, and quite true. wonder woman, who was my favorite comic book character when i was growing up - by the time we started ms. magazine, and we were all grown-ups, she had lost all of her magical powers. you know, the 1950s were a hard time for all women, including for wonder woman. she had become kind of like a car hop. so we put her on the cover of ms. magazine in her original self, and we ran her golden age strips inside and asked our readers to lobby to bring wonder woman back with all her powers intact.
on the campaign trail in october 2016, then-candidate donald trump spoke in gettysburg, pa. he noted that time warner owned cnn, and then declared his opposition to the $85 billion proposed sale. it is, he said then, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in hands of too few.

this is fresh air. let's continue our series of emmy nominees. the netflix drama series the crown is nominated for 13 emmys, including outstanding writing for a drama series for our guest peter morgan. the series focuses on a young queen elizabeth, her husband philip, whose life is turned upside down by her ascension, her rebellious sister margaret and her uncle david, whose abdication from the throne in the 1930s shocked the nation and created a deep rift within the royal family. peter morgan also wrote the screenplays for frost/nixon and the last king of scotland.
bentley himself resigned earlier this year amid a sex scandal. the optics of him appointing strange, who as the state attorney general was investigating possible misuse of his office to cover up the alleged affair with an aide, greatly hurt strange in the race with moore, according to several local observers.

albright: well, it was interesting. the first time i met him was when he was still kind of acting president at an apec meeting that took place in new zealand. and he was in a stage of his life where he seemed to want to be very ingratiating to everybody and wanted to kind of pretend - or was, in fact, kind of a small figure. then, when i went back to prepare for the summit that president clinton had in the summer of 2000 - and i have to say, i was very impressed with how smart putin was. and when he met with president clinton, he - putin - was able to talk without notes, as president clinton was, and also took notes and really was very smart. i think that he is a smart man. he has played a weak hand very well. and he is a former kgb officer, and we can never forget that.

let's start with a scene from the film. cameron, the main character played by chloe grace moretz, has been sent to god's promise after she was discovered making out with her girlfriend. in this scene, soon after she's arrived god's promise, she's been invited by reverend rick, played by john gallagher jr., to talk with him over a game of pingpong. rick is one of the people who runs god's promise. he considers himself ex-gay, having been, quote, cured of homosexuality with the help of his older sister who founded and directs god's promise.

shalhoub: yeah. that - some of that just - it just developed over time. i can't explain it. it just made sense to me that he has super sensitivity to all these - all this outside stimuli. and he sees the world so differently. he looks at it so differently. his vision is unlike anyone else's. and i can't really explain how some of that stuff evolved. i just - i always describe it as sort of uncorking a bottle and just letting all this...
(soundbite of tv show, turn up charlie)
barry: well, the whole adventure of these seven books, indeed, has been to try and go and find, if only in the imagination, these bits and bobs of my family, the people who weren't talked about, the people who - around whom a silence fell, whether for political reasons or because they went so far and never came home. and this was one person that my grandfather told me about when we shared a - a bed and a room when we were - when i was small in the 1960s in ireland. and he'd tell me these wonderful stories, and this was a story he couldn't tell because all he knew about it was that a great-uncle of his had been at the indian wars. so that's where that started.
trump makes first public appearance with pence
crudo is a news novel, and a twitter novel, and a historical-record novel. (more on that later.) it's a romantic comedy, in that it ends with a wedding. the prose is extravagantly beautiful, like the dahlia-filled garden where kathy and her husband sunbathe naked. it's also exceptionally funny. laing is expert at bathos, british understatement, dry desperation. human relations, kathy asks, how. the question emerges from neurosis, but swells to become what she calls the real question of existence: if it was happening to someone, it being unspeakable violence, how could she be happy?
amid the brief diary entries and opulent prose, sellet manages to hide a clever and biting social commentary.

he spoke with fresh air's dave davies in january. they started with a scene from the first season of the crown a few days after elizabeth windsor, then 25, has learned her father has died and that she's now queen. elizabeth is played by claire foy. she's with her husband philip, played by matt smith. we hear first from her private secretary, played by harry hadden-paton.

first ladies are famously circumspect about how they weigh in on politics, if they do at all. and it's rare that we hear any of them give opinions about the current occupant of the white house. but president trump has changed a lot of norms in our politics. and former first lady michelle obama does have thoughts about that. she lays them out in her new book. it is called becoming. and it goes on sale next week. npr's danielle kurtzleben from our washington desk has read the book, and she joins us with a preview. hey, danielle.
and one particular photograph i saw there were two or three boys doing the dancing, you know, with the men. i was a little bit - i mean, as a modern father, of course, i was a little bit alarmed by that. i mean, but there's no point being modern - modernly - if that's a word - alarmed by the past because it's just - it is a different country. whether or not i read that it was actually a possible employment - but to my way of thinking, you see - i mean, this nascent america predicated upon such incredible violence, but also the possibility.

yet trump's antipathy for cnn is so strong and well-known that it colored public perception of the case. in those remarks at gettysburg, trump preceded his declaration about corporate ownership with a dig at the corruption of what he called the dishonest mainstream media.
gradually, over what would become a 14-year hiatus, american football became icons of the late '90s midwest emo movement, a symbol for other bands to draw inspiration from, both in celebrating and mourning the band's then-short-lived career. the band's heavily ornamented math-rock style influenced emo music through the 2010s, and the debut album has been cited as one of the best emo albums of all time by nme and rolling stone. then, in 2016, the band returned in an almost mythical fashion, with a long-dreamed-of, also self-titled sophomore follow-up, built to fill its own shoes and the deep, indelible footprint it left on the bands that followed. would you even know me if time hadn't stole me? lead singer mike kinsella asks on the second album's opening track, where are we now?
but this fear of amalgamation - that was the term of art before 1864 - the fear of white people mixing with blacks and, you know, the idea of - we need a white racial purity, and we need to protect it. that was part of the political machinations. and so in the lincoln-douglas debates, when lincoln is debating - and this is what brings him on the national scene - one of the things that stephen douglas really pushed at him was - he claimed that because lincoln was anti-slavery, he was pro-amalgamation.

showrunner and executive producer maggie friedman has said that this change to the book's approach makes the story richer, but it's hard not to suspect its actual purpose is to make sure the famous actresses who take over in the roles are in the show from the beginning, as opposed to asking audiences to invest in a story about teenagers starring actresses they don't know well, anticipating that katherine heigl and sarah chalke will take over around, say, episode 4. (heigl and chalke are even asked to play the women as college students in a few sequences, which is pretty ... odd, given that these actors who played them as high school students are right there.)

the walk of shame — a tour through a neighborhood led by a clts facilitator — draws on the powerful force of social pressure in tight-knit communities. other clts methods include visceral demonstrations of bacterial contamination. one strategy is to show how flies in contact with open feces invisibly contaminate drinking water by touching a piece of human hair — representing a fly's leg — to a pile of stool, dunking the hair in a cup of water and asking someone to drink from the clean-looking but obviously contaminated water. when eva kumari paudel, a community health volunteer in another village in nuwakot, said she didn't have the money to repair her toilet that was damaged after last year's earthquake, a community mobilizer with u.n. habitat fingered the small gold hoops snaking down each of her earlobes. you have money for these ornaments and you're asking for money for your toilet? he asked her. that's a classic clts approach.

the late '00s saw an explosive, cross-genre revival of retro-sounding soul music that continues to shape the pop landscape to this day. arguably, that trend's catalyst was amy winehouse's earth-shaking final album. working closely with producers mark ronson and salaam remi, plus a then-little-known brooklyn soul ensemble called the dap-kings, the young, beehived-and-tattooed london singer pivoted from jazz to the velvet musical vocabulary of '60s girl groups and motown. yet however smartly it evoked the sounds of an earlier era, back to black could never have been mistaken for anything but contemporary — or anyone but winehouse. funk and r&b grooves snapped through a post-breakbeat filter; her lyrics about lost love and self-destructive habits pulled zero punches; her delivery came fluid as exhaled cigarette smoke. even tears dry on their own, whose arrangement reproduced tammi terrell and marvin gaye's version of ain't no mountain high enough down to the drum fills, sounded magnificently fresh with winehouse's lead line — a romantic duet flipped into a frank, lonely rendering of a breakup's aftermath. this was a soul record that wouldn't forget that hip-hop happened, a thoroughly modern tract on heartbreak whose bluntness made it believable. —rachel horn (npr music)

what that has meant for azar is he's gotten a boost within the administration and within this core group of trump supporters. but at the same time, he's further alienated a health department where most career health professionals don't share these views. they don't think that the trump administration should be cracking down on funding for abortion clinics and also broader reproductive health strategies around the country. but it seems like secretary azar has made the calculation that it's better to appeal to the anti-abortion constituency at present even if that means turning off some of the people who work directly for him.

phillips had released just one album and a handful of loose tracks leading up to last year's impressive major label debut, solar. as a lyricist, he tends to alternate between introspection and charismatic cleverness, but even his friskiest, most lighthearted songs—purple dinosaur, enemies? and shakira, for example—subtly circle around a sense of relational responsibility. his mode on much of solar, though, was prickly processing, clarifying disclosure and self-examination that didn't shy away from describing descents into depression, but throughout it all, his flow retained sprightly dexterity and understated, conversational wit.

popkey: (reading) it was the situation we'd all - the girls of my generation - been warned against, been warned specifically against getting ourselves into. in my adolescence - this was the early '90s - consent wasn't yet affirmative. and though no means no was the standard, it was also understood that it wouldn't protect you. no short skirts. and watch your drink. and tell a friend where you're going and call her when you got there and again when you get home. when we thought about sex, we thought mostly about ways to defend against what we didn't want instead of ways to pursue what we did. so that now the way i thought to attract a man was to make myself vulnerable to attack - sitting alone, drinking too quickly. i'd made myself a sitting duck and deliberately because men were attracted not to predators but to prey, not to strength but to weakness.

as the song progresses it grows grander in scale, and finally peaks with the ecstatic glossolalia of female gospel singers. the effect is similar to the great gig in the sky, in which pink floyd used a similar arrangement trick to convey a cosmic notion of death and the afterlife. but whereas clare torry's voice was foregrounded on that song, the gospel vocals in everlasting nothing are distant in the mix, like a siren call to oblivion that beck is tuning out for the time being, choosing to stay grounded as he faces the unknown. it's not quite a happy ending, but it's at least a dramatic ride into the sunset, capping all the gloomy resignation with some sense of direction and purpose.

the myth of trump's economic populism, as proved by the tax bill
the year is 1965, and jeremy thorpe, played by hugh grant dipped in 5 o'clock shadow, is an mp who dreams of leading the liberal party and becoming prime minister. rakishly decked out in edwardian suits and a tiny hat, the vain thorpe boasts slippery charm and the impeccable connections of an old etonian. yet, he also cultivates a streak of louche recklessness - especially in his private life, where he's sexually drawn to what his mp pal peter bessell, played by alex jennings, terms the spear's side. that is, he sleeps with men - risky business at a time when homosexuality is still illegal and can get you imprisoned.
i suddenly discovered one day that although i had joined the history department at the university of toronto with a group of young men all trained in american doctoral programs like me, i was the only one who wasn't being promoted, and i found that i was also quite severely discriminated against in my salary. and so i just got in a rage, went and confronted the department chairman and the dean with this information, and they very quickly rectified the situation. but when i was finished, i realized that there were loads of other women faculty who were in much more jeopardy protesting such things than i. so i began organizing the women faculty, and before i knew it, i was in a leadership role that i just stumbled into. and very shortly thereafter, there was a change in the university administration and i sort of had to put up or shut up, and so i accepted a position as one of the university vice presidents. and so i sort of backed into it and then found out i really loved it.
it seemed like a odd use of tens of thousands of dollars in private jet funds, so i called around to all these different health care leaders in nashville - did you meet with tom price? - just trying to kind of reconstruct his schedule in reverse. and that's how we were able to figure out that he was in nashville in part to have lunch with his son. he was only on the ground for a few hours there, and having the lunch was one of the big focuses of that trip. so that kind of effort was necessary to just build out price's schedule, get the contracts involved, get the dollars, and get to this point where we were able to say, over five months in office, he spent more than a million dollars on charter jet travel, about half of that in the united states and then, you know, a little more than that when he was traveling abroad to events where he brought his wife, which is a little less unusual. cabinet officials will take these charter jets, these gulfstreams that the u.s. air force owns, when they're traveling abroad. but it was notable given that that's what tom price was spending his time on at a moment when republicans were trying to achieve priorities like repeal the aca.
sort of. the character is nominally kathy acker, but her life is olivia laing's. the best way to put this might be that crudo is a memoir in drag. we get the outer trappings of kathy acker — her dead, dysfunctional mother; her breast cancer; her body of work — but crudo starts in 2017, when acker has been dead for twenty years, and the character's daily life and inner landscape are pure laing.

in 30-plus years of collaboration, pianist carla bley, saxophonist andy sheppard and bassist steve swallow have rarely recorded or toured. yet there's a depth and subtlety in their communication, illustrating bley's simile of their musical union as a long and happy marriage. life goes on melds introspection, wry humor, social commentary and blues, familiar ingredients that nevertheless continue to reveal richness over repeated listening. the three bley-composed suites capture the mood of the times, as in beautiful telephones, in which the self-declared charles ives admirer incorporates fleeting references to patriotic themes like the star-spangled banner and god bless america before touching on the ultimate hubristic anthem, my way. –elzy kolb

sagal: we spoke to elizabeth gilbert in september of 2014, and i asked her to describe her best-seller.
legend: yeah. and for a long time, the network system and kind of the traditional media outlets were afraid to touch certain things, afraid to be edgy in certain areas. and some of it has an overlay of racism and fear of kind of marginalized people having centrality in these systems.
albright: within the system, and partially because it is a way of undermining democracy and the democratic institutions that are the basis of democracy, or criticizing the press or thinking that there are those that are enemies of the people and are the cause of distress or a bad economic situation. and it kind of works on the fear factor rather than the hope factor.
frestan met castro ortez in 2012 on one of his visits back to his home country. she said they fell in love quickly. she even took in his eldest daughter with another woman as her own; the couple had two more daughters together and were married in 2016.
leonard: you know, everybody's getting married. some people have one child, some people have two children. all my friends have these high-powered jobs, and they own houses and all of these things.
this album dismantled the hip-hop boy's club. for the first time in history a woman rapped, sang, wrote and produced every song on a major rap release. within the first sounds that we hear, missy elliott invites you to become engulfed with the undeniable virginia-based funk, a region that's equally southern and eastern, through aquatic synth sounds paired with earthy drum patterns. the result? a vibe that's both familiar and futuristic. without selling overly sexualized imagery and without imitating hypermasculine gangster rap, elliott awards us with pure originality. she didn't just change the scope on how we interpreted sexy and gangster: the genres bended to her liking. the sound shifted to jazz with her vocal improvisations and scatting on the rain (supa dupa fly), over an ann peebles sample. it became the blues on beep me 911, a somber song about uncertainty and urgency. and her esteemed comrades busta rhymes, timbaland, lil kim, aaliyah, da brat and ginuwine complemented and fit comfortably within the theme of the perfect album. elliott presciently knew her music was groundbreaking and reminded us throughout the record with her boisterous lyrics. today, supa dupa fly remains one of the best hip-hop records of all time, and its level of innovation and musicianship remains unparalleled. —stasia irons (kexp)

at the white house on monday, president trump was asked about his earlier promise to protect transgender americans and others in the lgbtq community.
gross: well, before the - we did the interview, i had no idea what to expect.
these are first-hand documents, direct testimony from ex-slaves on a variety of topics related to the war and post war. and many of the documents are related to family issues, and marriages in particular. so i was quite taken with the richness and complexity of some of what was revealed in these documents in comparison to the then-existing literature on the topic.
after recently finishing the series, i am now a convert, too. it's not just brilliant, it's brilliant in a bunch of different ways: characters; story; dialogue; and costumes — just to start.
boudin: we've taken bold, aggressive action to make sure that there is not an outbreak in the san francisco county jail. san francisco and the bay area, i think we're way ahead of the curve nationally in terms of taking bold measures to prevent the spread of the disease. and the same is true within san francisco's county jail. as district attorney, public safety is my primary responsibility. and right now we recognize that the single biggest threat to public safety in san francisco, as across the globe, is covid-19. and what we need to do is let medical professionals guide public policy. it's what i wish the president of the united states would do, and it's what i'm trying to do to the extent possible with the san francisco county jail and criminal justice system.
gross: yeah. well, the way you're describing it, it's taking, like - the gay conversion is taking a legitimate form of therapy and group therapy and using it to fight who you are, not to bring out who you are. and it's doing it for harm, and not for your own good. so that's part of your doorway in, is having undergone a group therapy yourself, but feeling like it was a very positive thing, not a destructive thing. but, you know, in the gay conversion centers, what's really, like, unusual, inexplicable in a way, is that these conversion centers, the residential centers, they're trying to convert gay and lesbian kids from being gays and lesbians by surrounding them with other gays and lesbians...

as the most prominent african-american catholic bishop, gregory has been a strong voice for civil rights and tolerance. his appointment as the d.c. archbishop comes on the anniversary of the 1968 assassination of martin luther king, jr. commemorating the event last year in a homily at a remembrance mass in atlanta, gregory said the nation was dealing with as problematic a political situation as it faced in 1968.

as an actor, damon has too much integrity to pretend he can multitask to that degree and still be, you know, a fun person. so he turns his face into a mask of stoicism and gives the dullest performance of his life. it's in service to the movie, though, which he co-produced. i'm sure he thinks, i'll win that oscar next year.

there's no control group that can tell you which five nominees in a nine-nominee year like this one would have been nominated under the old rules, so it's all speculation in good fun. but consider, for instance, that only eleven foreign language films have ever been nominated in 92 rounds of nominees, and three of those (amour, roma and now parasite) have been nominated since the field was expanded 10 years ago. does parasite make it in a five-nominee year, given the likelihood of nominations for at least traditional oscars-y movies like the irishman (mob movie with previously-winning director), 1917 (war movie with previously-winning director), once upon a time in hollywood (auteur violence), little women (gorgeous and wonderful period piece by previously-nominated director) and marriage story (domestic drama with a-list actors)?

arquette: well, conceptually, as a woman, i was really excited to explore this middle-aged woman being a sexual being and being really comfortable with her body and being sexual and, you know, in general, being comfortable with her body, even though later, she wants to lose weight and do all this - but in her sexuality, being in her body completely, which is so different than me because i've grown up in this hollywood structure that's always telling you you're not right, no matter what the hell you look like. no matter how young and beautiful you are, you're not beautiful enough, and there's always something wrong with your body, and there's always something wrong with the way you look.

it seemed another example of how emboldened the loose agglomeration of white nationalists, neo-confederates and fascists that make up the so-called alt-right had become over the past two years, since they had hitched their wagons to donald trump's star. (one of the key architects of trump's long-shot campaign for the white house was steve bannon, who as the head of breitbart news turned it into the alt-right's unofficial propaganda organ.) while the views of the torch carriers in charlottesville weren't exactly mainstream, the protesters clearly no longer felt they had anything to hide. they didn't need the hoods and masks that once shrouded the identities of their ideological forebears.
families of those convicted in the anti-corruption drive harbor some hope as some provinces begin to push back against overly harsh sentences or even overturn verdicts meted out during the campaign.

in this paper, russell robinson call[s] for a focus on the impact of structural conditions on preferences regarding intimacy. as he writes, we tend to think our preferences are natural and fixed when, in fact, they may be more plastic and susceptible to structural influences than we imagine. he also warns against uncritical celebrations of increasing interracial intimacy as a sign of reduced prejudice and social progress...[c]elebrations should be tempered by the awareness that race structures even our most intimate relationships. although two people have crossed racial lines and may have even committed to spending their lives together, we cannot easily conclude that they have transcended race.

and he does levy some pretty brutal criticisms of the republican party over time, but it's from within the party. he always campaigned for the republican candidate. he always said it's still the party of emancipation. it is still the party that saved the union, and it must somehow find its way back to its creeds - even when it was pretty clear it was not.

that anger informs petals for armor, but it's not everything – it's just part of the story. still, she's not afraid of letting the public see her rage, even as she's watched idols like tori amos and alanis morissette be framed not just as processors of natural human emotions, but angry women, as if it were a genre in and of itself. how did that happen? she wonders. how did we suddenly label these people as 'crazy bitches'? i don't understand how that happened. you would think culturally we would continue to grow and liberate ourselves.

sexuality is often a pathway for connection, for intimacy, for tenderness, for sensuality, for playfulness, for power, for curiosity, for relaxation. and when people are deprived of sex, it's this whole set of feelings and experiences that they're deprived of — not just the act. ...
in the case of india's sex workers, for instance, a wealth of data shows that today only 1 in 10 ever work in a brothel. instead, the overwhelming majority operates from their homes or small lodges, often using mobile phones. yet, in the popular western imagination, all of india's sex workers work in the heinous conditions of mumbai's brothels of the 1980s.

the fact that the heroine of the film is pro-toilet reflects reality. women are more receptive to setting up a toilet in their home than men are, says appavou, who was a consultant for a unicef project that funded the installation of toilets in rural india. open defecation leaves women at higher risk to sexual violence. using fields to defecate can expose them to snake and scorpion bite, he says. men tend to use open spaces that are closer to their homes and aren't as worried about a lack of privacy.

and, you know, for a journalist trying to make sense of saudi arabia, he was someone who was incredibly valuable. by 2018, he had broken with saudi arabia. he had become a critic of mohammed bin salman. there were lots of things sort of on the more authoritarian side of what mbs was doing that he didn't like.
democrats likely will have no input — there is no need to extend an olive branch to the other side, as there was when president obama picked merrick garland, in part because republicans controlled the senate.

as for her life with les, joy says, once it became clear that she might hold in her nose a tool that could move research on parkinson's forward, les had a eureka moment: they had more knowledge to offer science. joy had smelled his parkinson's more than a decade before diagnosis, so maybe, les told joy, if they thought very carefully about their life together before the official diagnosis, they'd be able to pinpoint early symptoms that hadn't yet been identified by science.

in the case of grant tinker and why he's widely considered the best and most influential network executive in tv history, it wasn't so much what he did, as how he did it. over the years, i've interviewed dozens of people who worked with and for grant tinker. and each and every one of them said that the most amazing and important thing about him was that he identified the people he thought were the most creative, then encouraged them to do what they wanted while protecting them from network interference.
williams: you know, she had that wonderful magazine she published while she was in jail called truly inside living, which was wonderful.
but i think that one of the things that people worry about is that if they tell the truth of who they are, that they can't be loved. i think that when they come into therapy, they're telling you all of these things that they won't tell the people that they want to be loved by in the outside world, because they're afraid that those people won't still love them if they know this. i think what they discover in therapy is that the truth of who they are is what draws people to them.
page: i think it's - we're at a point in history where kind of since you had jane austen, the bronte sisters, mary shelley start writing these books that we've kind of adapted into the genre of the period drama, we've had, like - what? - four or five waves of feminism since then. and the genre on television appears has stood fairly still. and so we kind of wanted to see what we could do to advance that in the lens of the show. i think we're at a point in history where, generally, people consider themselves to be feminists in the sense that we believe in the equality of the sexes. and so how can we bring that agenda into the editorial stance of the show? and for my part, that's in the male romantic lead. and so...
sagal: yes. so i'm trying to give you a big hint here.
superwoman works as thrilling showdown. as refutation of the strong black woman yoke. as a pure and contemporary blues. as a creative collaboration for all time. the song spent three weeks at no. 1 on billboard's r&b singles chart, and went to no. 8 on billboard's pop singles chart. white began years later to refer to the record as her testimony.
ken tucker, byline: nora jane struthers has one of those strong, clear voices that cuts across the grain of a melody with a bracing sharpness. she started out as a kid bluegrass musician in a duo with her father. her 2015 album called wake featured songs at the intersection of folk, country and rock. the music on her new album champion tends to be a bit louder - less acoustic, more electric. i guess it falls under the catch-all term americana. but i think the songs are nervier, thornier than most of the americana i forced myself to listen to. champion is a more concerted collaboration with her band, the party line. part of that increase in collaboration may have to do with the fact that between her previous album and this new one, she married the band's guitarist - a development that figures in some of the best songs here.
gross: it's kind of like, oh, you're little, and adorable and totally powerless (laughter).

when donald trump took office four years ago, he did not divest himself of the businesses that made him rich, a move which his critics said would lead to countless conflicts of interest. well, since then, u.s. taxpayers have paid trump properties for security costs involved in hosting hundreds of presidential visits. foreign and domestic politicians have paid for countless stops at his hotels and resorts. and so as he leaves office, a question - has the trump presidency been good for the business of the trump organization? well, here to walk us through that is andrea bernstein, host of the trump, inc. podcast from wnyc.
mohler says the church position on complementary gender roles may seem outdated but comes straight from the bible.
albright: well, from everything that i have read, i think that it is a dereliction of duty not to see what the russians have been doing and that this really requires a whole-of-government approach to it where the president directs the various parts of the government to do what they have to do to figure out what the russians are up to and how to prevent them from doing more during the midterm election and all the time, frankly. and then, also, and as secretary of state, the other part that would be important is to point out what the russians are doing in other countries. we know, for instance, what has been happening in europe.

simon: i know they wanted the film to be made, but there must have been rough passages for them, weren't there?
forman: well, they thought it's a metaphor on the politburo and the communist party. you know, that firemen's ball committee, right, that it's a metaphor for the whole leadership of the country. so they banned the film. you know, that it was orchestrated by the government people, this strike or threat of practically all the volunteer firemen, the whole country because they needed - you know, the people were so apathetic already. you know, they didn't give a damn. but, of, course if the people read in the newspapers that, well, tomorrow if your house is on fire, just kiss the house goodbye because the firemen are on strike, likely because they are upset about this film. so, you know, that turns people's anger against the artists, against the film's filmmakers, you know?

today the sugars address the issue of may-december relationships, involving one partner who is significantly older than the other. some say love is ageless — but others note the practical questions to consider: what happens when one person becomes physically unable to do the things you once enjoyed together? if your partner is older, are you likely to live many years alone after that person is gone? are the things a 30-year-old is concerned about different than the things a 50-year-old cares about?

8. nina simone, fodder on my wings (1982, verve) 16 (8)
mchargue: i think that the future is both. i think you'll continue to have institutional christianity, and i think you'll continue to have sort of a church in exile. my work is about acknowledging the validity as both as ways to know and follow this historical figure jesus, and figure out what that means. i think everywhere people gather together around a table, god can be present.
wu: so google's adwords, they allow you to bid on words that people will type into the search engine, and they cost more or less. for example, i think mortgage refinancing can cost - now, it's probably hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars. so, in other words, they are allowing you to bid on what people are going to type, and that is the adwords program. so you own certain terms, and then your ads show up as opposed to someone else's.
david edelstein, byline: diane kruger is in nearly every shot of in the fade, and her wide, open face with its hollow eyes says more in silence than other actors in lengthy speeches. what she conveys most deeply is a mixture of anguish and bafflement. kruger plays a german woman named katja who loses everything in an instant. her turkish husband nuri and little boy are killed in a terrorist blast.
diamond: it's still unclear what the strategic plan will have. and if it does say that life begins at conception, that's a big win symbolically for christian conservatives, evangelical groups who firmly believe that and will be able to tout it and say, look - the trump administration, the government now agree with our position. and there are possible implications down the road because if that's the hhs position, they'll be able to use that to defend different policy outcomes.
on auditioning for zero mostel, who played max bialystock in the producers
diamond: when mike pence was governor in indiana, there was a major outbreak of hiv, an outbreak that public health officials said was largely preventable. one step that pence could have taken was allowing for needle exchange so people who were infected with hiv and injecting drugs wouldn't necessarily infect others. but as governor, pence held off on that. that was seen as a policy by lots of conservatives as something that was essentially rewarding drug users and not a position that pence wanted to get behind. the local planned parenthood clinic had been closed because of state cuts that pence supported. planned parenthood does more than provide abortions; it can help in a public health crisis by providing low-cost or free services like hiv testing.
cornish: and on that issue, donald trump has been making overtures to the gay community in his speeches. is that something that worries this group of evangelicals?

the song for the 23rd amendment is by the mellow tones, a group of students from d.c. high school duke ellington school of the arts, along with their teacher mark g. meadows. the chorus, why won't you count on me? reflects on the continued disenfranchisement of our nation's capital. the final amendment of the album, the 27th amendment, put limits on senators' ability to give themselves a pay raise, and it has arguably the most unusual path to ratification of all 27. the first draft for the amendment was written by none other than james madison in 1789, but back then, it didn't get enough votes from the states for ratification. it wasn't until a college student named gregory watson awakened the dormant amendment centuries later that it was finally ratified. the 27th amendment song is by kevin devine and tells watson's story.

biden diametrically differs from former president donald trump in his support for a more inclusive society, on issues ranging from immigration and health care to lgbtq equality. francis has moved away from pope john paul ii's and benedict xvi's emphasis on sexual morality, preferring to focus on social justice and the rights of the poor and marginalized. he has repeatedly lashed out at what he describes as the destructive effects of laissez-faire capitalism on society and the environment.

the white house has released two excerpts from president obama's speech. they show that obama will paint an optimistic picture of the country.
he's come out just this - just last week and said that this bill is necessary because europeans are recruiting homosexuals in uganda, that europeans are coming in and trying to make ugandans gay. and he's been rewarded for this because this is sort of where these sort of social issues and foreign affairs issues and free market fundamentalist issues all come together.

though seven of these women ended up writing fiction, many broke into print by reviewing books, theatre, movies — and other reviewers. they were fearlessly, caustically outspoken. nineteen-year-old west, who had a knack for choosing targets, went after h.g. wells in a scathing review of his novel, marriage. dean comments wryly: the episode marked possibly the only time in history that future lovers have met when one gave the other an abysmal book review. mccarthy, too, tested the conventions of reviewing propriety with a note of wickedness in her takedowns, which often came across as harsh or haughty. pauline kael, supporting herself and her daughter, was brash, but she was also precise, dean writes, insisting that the only principle worth defending was pleasure.

private gatherings are limited to no more than 10 people from a maximum of two households, and the state's face covering requirement is extended to such gatherings, effective nov. 24 for three weeks.

there was something odd, too, about the pregnancy results. the little sister's given age was wrong, making her seem a decade younger. puzzled, yang and i went to the hospital that issued the document and showed a copy to several doctors.
what had happened was that at that time, and this was immediately after graduating from high school, i also got married immediately after graduating from high school. and about a month after that, i was pregnant, and these commercials were almost impossible to do anymore because i had my breasts bound down to begin with even before i was pregnant because pixies are supposedly of neuter gender. and to try to do that after i was even 1 month along and certainly into two and three was impossible, and so we had to stop. and i think they just went to straight commercials after that. and i went on to happily have my baby a few months after that.

legend: i often will go through days where i don't look at my mentions, particularly when i know there's some story that brought me to the attention of the magas out there. when they kind of mobilize around hating you, your twitter mentions are just an utter mess. and so there's some days where i just won't look at it, and it's fine.
phil elverum's songs come full circle, swooping down like vultures and floating up like ashes from flames. throughout his work in mount eerie and the microphones, idealism comes up against realism, existence entangles with impermanence and love discovers new forms. so when he sings, let's get out the romance, in close harmony with julie doiron at the tiny desk, there's a history going back nearly two decades to an isolated cabin in norway where he first wrote the phrase.
and the prospects of donald trump appointing another, you know, two or three people to the supreme court, continuing to roll back environmental regulations - i mean, this is another thing. we need to talk about climate change. the absolute worst thing you could do for climate is have donald trump in office for another four years.
zhang ping's people told us that if we kept asking for our money, zhang had friends in the police force and our entire family would be killed, says a relative of liu who asked to remain anonymous because they are routinely threatened and surveilled by local law enforcement and face legal consequences for speaking to a foreign reporter. soon after these threats, zhang ping reported liu to police, alleging he was running a criminal gang and carrying out violent debt collection; liu was arrested shortly after.

but there they were together, and i have to say, you know, this faustian bargain idea, it goes two ways. it may've been strange for trump to pick pence. it's very strange for pence to say yes because he is supposed to be someone who, as you say, is so puritanical and such a social conservative.

conservative christians in america are undergoing a huge shift in the way we see ourselves in the world, mohler says. we are on the losing side of a massive change that's not going to be reversed, in all likelihood, in our lifetimes. in his view, christians must adapt to the changed cultural circumstance by finding a way to live faithfully in a world in which we're going to be a moral exception. (it is this goal, mohler says, that explains the passage of religious liberty laws to protect people who want to express their opposition to same-sex marriage or transgenderism.)

like, that was, like, one of the great revelations of my life that somebody saw me and did not see something hideous or terrible or worth overlooking but instead said we see in you someone who could do something wonderful, like heal yourself and get better and be strong and all this stuff. and that idea of - you know, for all of us maybe sometimes you need to have someone to have faith in you before you can have faith in yourself.
on wednesday, the day of kennedy's retirement, the supreme court ruled 5-4 for a child-support specialist who challenged an illinois law requiring government workers to pay partial union dues, even if they're not members, to cover the cost of negotiations on their behalf.
baker: it's not a question that these are bad negotiators, they're stupid people - i think he's used that term. i'm sure they're all very bright people. but they have a different agenda. they're actually trying to make it easy for our companies to relocate their factories in mexico or china or wherever it might be. and part of the story here is he's not going to have to beat up china 'cause, you know, if he says, hey, i want to make it more difficult for u.s. companies to relocate in china and then re-export their goods back to the u.s., well, you know, china's not going to be happy with that. but most immediately, general electric's not going to be happy with that. so those are the people he's going to have to beat up.
and i think the big question going forward is - the thing to remember about mohammed bin salman is he's still very young. i mean, he's 34. if his father passes away soon, he could very quickly become king, and he could be king for 50 years. you know, he could be king - if he lives to be as old as his father, he'll be king sometime into the 2060s. so i think the big question about - you know, as watching mohammed bin salman going forward, is - is he learning from his mistakes? like - and i just don't know. does he look at sort of the yemen war? does he look at what he did to saad hariri? does he look at, you know, some of these other things? or does he look at the killing of jamal khashoggi and say, wow, we really messed that up - that was not the right way to do this?
gross: i would imagine that you grew up with a lot of suspicion of police officers and people in the criminal justice system, of prosecutors because, again, your parents were behind bars, serving long sentences - a life sentence in your father's case - for their participation in a politically motivated robbery of a brink's truck that led to three deaths. and your adoptive parents lived underground for a long time. they were members of the weather underground. and your father participated in acts of bombing in ways that he hoped wouldn't injure anybody.

to moore and his supporters, that defiance is a badge of honor. and it's a big reason many voters are likely reluctant to believe the sexual misconduct and sexual assault allegations against him too, given the christian nationalist positions he has wholeheartedly embraced in the past. and at the crux of that is a stringent opposition to abortion.

flowers never lie – if you don't water them, feed them or grow them in the sun, they fail to thrive. but people can be different. people can wilt on the inside while the exterior looks bright, hiding dead leaves and tangled roots around wounded hearts. for years, williams had been in a toxic relationship and marriage that, from an aerial view, seemed to be hitting all the marks. in truth, as she sings on the perfectly infectious dead horse, she was holding her breath for a decade.

anderson adds that the trump administration's reversals are entirely appropriate. if you have determined, as the trump administration has, that obama overstepped the authority of the executive branch and misinterpreted the meaning of sex discrimination, anderson says, then all of the various actions that the obama administration took where it interpreted the word sex as gender identity were unlawful. so going back to the original meaning of the word isn't a 'tit for tat,' it's a restoring — upholding the rule of law.

martin: hmm. so there was a real push me, pull me around marriage in that era. on the one hand, there were cultural reasons to marry, and the other hand, there were cultural pressures against it. there were legal pressures against it. it sounds to me that this was just a very complicated period emotionally for people, in addition to, you know, all that they had to deal with. but there are those who speculate that slavery is, in part, the reason that marriage is still such a fraught topic in the black community today, in that the institution of marriage never took hold among african-americans to the degree that it did among whites, in part because during slavery, marriage was not respected.

about six months ago, i married the man i had been in love with for seven years. i had a feeling of safety with him that i never felt with anyone else, and a deep connection, despite our very different backgrounds. my husband grew up in central america with an abusive, alcoholic biological father who died when he was young, an often-absent teenage mother who was constantly working to provide for her children, and later, an american stepfather who was in the air force. once in the u.s., my husband's family moved often because of his stepfather's job, while my husband struggled to acclimate himself with the culture and the language. in contrast, i grew up in a four-person, stable, middle-class family in pennsylvania.
so they - i think it's a valid question that remains open about whether or not he truly wanted to be president. and there's a good argument to be made that he did not want to be president and that he's not having a good time while he's in office. but i think that that is ultimately a question that nobody other than donald trump can answer.

i belong to a generation of americans for whom the idea of not only a royal wedding but a royal marriage was largely established by charles and diana, the prince and princess of wales. their staid ceremony and their seemingly joyless marriage (aside from the births of their children) made marrying into the royal family look less like a fantasy than like a march into oblivion — a grudgingly accepted transformation into a wealthy but hollowed-out target for photographers hoping to catch you at your worst.
severino: yeah. they're really trying to rewrite this - the record on that. the biden rule was always about an election in a presidential year, and in particular, at the end of a second term…
it could mean winning over skeptical voters like francis byrd, a financial analyst from brooklyn. to him, buttigieg is too inexperienced to be running.
two nevada gun shops confirmed that the shooter had bought weapons from them, apparently in the past year. one of the shops, guns and guitars in mesquite, issued a statement saying that all necessary background checks and procedures were followed.
describing herself as a reagan republican, she plans to break party lines in the senate race.
but children, in a kind of cold way of looking at it, are an externality, he says. we as parents, we as family members, we get the good. and the world, the community, pays the cost.
gross: so he'd often call you little katy. how tall are you?
curtis: yes, but it's really halloween.
i must remain sober. i've been sober for 17 years. if i'm not sleeping, i still have to be in bed for seven or eight hours a night. i force myself to eat. my wife and i force ourselves to go on the odd date so that our kids [see that] their parents have a relationship. ... work was a part of that. because i needed to put a support system in place so that grief could work through me and not kill me.
diamond: the information that i have is the outbreak is almost certainly coming at some level, but what health officials can still do is slow the outbreak, mitigate the outbreak, for a bunch of very good reasons. one reason is because there's only so much capacity in the system if everyone gets sick or significant amounts of people get sick at the same time.
singletary: so you're actually not you're not really taking a leap of faith. you sound like you have a plan.

trump to pick kennedy successor from list of conservative judges
moore's campaign has continued to hit back at the allegations that were first reported in the washington post last week, painting his candidacy as a battle against the washington, d.c., establishment that has turned against him.
for the most part, people thought, 'well, ed's successful, he's smart, he's capable,'  he says. internally, nothing else felt further from the truth.
conway: if you live with somebody who's almost a generation older than you, it can work in two ways. that difference can be stressed, or it can be very easily bridged. my husband is chronologically 18 years older than i am, but in a lot of ways, he's psychologically a good deal younger. he's much more naive and, in many ways, much more open to experience and much more spontaneous so that, in fact, his chronological age is a lot more advanced than his psychological age. and i'm the reverse. so he's a very youthful 78-year-old, and i'm probably quite a mature 60-year-old. i can imagine that it would be very difficult living with someone whose energies were really terribly depleted and obviously declining so that one's life experience became very different. i think it's really very interesting to live very close to somebody who's having to struggle to come to terms with the issues of their own mortality and so forth - a valuable experience, which i'm glad to have had.
gross: he had been addicted in high school. it sounds like he had a really bad alcohol problem in high school. he wasn't drinking when you met, at least not visibly. but then the first night you saw him falling down drunk was on your wedding night. and eventually, it got really bad.

nina simone knew her own power. not only did she cover the song i put a spell on you, but she also used it as the title of her autobiography. the song, originally released in 1956 by jay hawkins, cemented his screamin moniker. but in simone's hands, it became something more, a kind of simmering sorcery.
gross: i always learn so much when i listen to him. and it's so interesting to compare how stephen colbert has changed from the time he was on the colbert report 'cause on the colbert report, everything had to be cast in the terms of his persona. and on the late show, you can tell how passionate he's become about politics in america now and how angry. and what he says is hilarious. but his genuine anger at watching the trump administration just kind of comes right through.
sagal: and were you one of those fans of the genre who said, oh, i could do this, or even, i could do this better?

prof. carbone: we were astonished to find how closely the vote, especially in 2004, to a strong degree in 2008, maps on to family structure. here's the thing that's happened in the blue world. what you have is, again, a system, far more independence. and we find that people who do marry later late 20s, early 30s you've got a pretty good sense who's going to be successful and stable and a good marriage partner at 30. you're still guessing at 22.

[during] the damn. tour, we probably came up with 50 percent of it — the production, the hooks and ideas, sounwave tells npr music's sidney madden. when we got back from the tour in september, that's when we were able to execute our ideas and reach out to people we respect and whatnot ... kind of just put the stamp on it. so, i want to say those two months was the most vital on that tour, in terms of creative process.
gross: did you think of it as discrimination against older women? did you think of it as there not being enough roles for women in their 40s? which really isn't very old. or did you think, oh, it's me - no one wants me anymore?
gross: this is fresh air. let's get back to my interview with madeleine albright. she served as secretary of state under president bill clinton. she was the first woman to hold that position. before that, she was clinton's u.n. ambassador. her new book is called fascism: a warning. the president has stated many things that aren't true, verbally and also through twitter. just over the weekend, he tweeted about daca - these big flows of people are all trying - he's talking about people crossing the border from mexico. these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca. they want in on the act.
after only six months of marriage, i'm contemplating filing for divorce. my husband claims that he never met anyone from the dating website or craigslist. he admits to paying for sexual acts four times and says that someone he works with showed him how to do it. he makes his actions seem like part of a fantasy world, something that was mostly lived out online. but at some point, sugars, real people became part of this world, and it was no longer a fantasy.
meanwhile, stan finds henry at hockey practice and tells him about his family: that they're spies. and that they're gone.
gross: let's talk about the family's connection to uganda, where there's a, really a draconian anti-gay bill that has been introduced into parliament. uganda already punishes the practice of homosexuality with life in prison. what would the new legislation do?
gross: do you know who's actually producing the convention? and actually, what i'm really interested in, who's booked the guests, who's decided to have lena dunham and to have the mothers of sons who were shot - sons and daughters who were shot by the police and, you know, the other performers, paul simon and alicia keys?
and we started to form this song, which was sort of, like, it's hard to describe. but there was a kind of like an art college movement in the sort of late '70s, early '80s in england of sort of i'm too good for pop music. i'm kind of an artist and i'm an intellectual but oh god, here we go. i have to be in a band. and to imagine being sort of 18 and you're still little bit spotty, you've got a little bit of acne but it's, like, 1981 and you've learned some big words from reading albert camus and you're now writing a song.
toobin: well, certainly, the one that will probably attract the most attention - and it's not clear that it will get to the supreme court in the next month or so, although it well might - is donald trump's executive order on immigration, the one barring or temporarily barring immigration from several muslim-majority countries. and several federal judges have struck that down. it's now in the appeals process. of course, it was revised, then the revised version was struck down. that will certainly be a big deal. to be honest, the justices have done their best while they were at eight, you know, to sort of keep the pipeline as clean as possible of really controversial cases.
sandifur: (as young phyllis, singing) say toodle-oo (ph) to sorrow. and fare thee well, ennui.
b harper: it was a wonderland. it was a wonderland. you know, any sound that you could imagine could be made seemed to be inside those four walls. and the players that would come in and pick an instrument off the wall and be as high a level of virtuoso as you could possibly hear - to walk out the doors, and the next one could come in that day or the next morning, it was - at the time, like my mom had mentioned, you take it somewhat for granted because you think that it's normal. and then you grow into recognizing that her parents, my grandparents, created one of the most special music environments - musical environments i've ever seen.
gross: this is fresh air. let's get back to my interview with ellen harper, author of the new memoir always a song: singers, songwriters, sinners, and saints - my story of the folk music revival. in 1958, her parents founded the folk music center in claremont, calif., which ellen now runs. her son ben harper, who is also with us, like his mother, grew up at the center. he's now a grammy award-winning singer, songwriter and guitarist. he wrote the foreword to her new memoir.

while defending the protesters and claiming that they weren't all white supremacists, he changed the subject to attack others. what about the alt-left? he said, when asked about the white nationalist alt-right.

davies: you know, to kind of see the process unfold in the movie is really beautiful. you know, we've had a couple of interviews on the show lately about climate change. and while, you know, its advocates for change do see some signs of hope, it can be pretty dispiriting. and i think this film is as inspirational as that can be discouraging, in a way. and it almost makes it hard for me to ask kind of the hard questions, which i do wonder about. like, can this scale - i mean, can farming this way feed a planet? you know, because we had the green revolution in the '60s with all the hybrid seeds and then the monoculture agriculture that does a lot of harm but produces an awful lot of cheap food. i mean, i don't know if you think about it on these terms, but it this a way to feed the planet and change the way we grow food and eat it?

while serving as a young bishop in chicago, gregory was close to the late cardinal joseph bernardin, the chicago archbishop and one of the most esteemed catholic leaders in the country. bernardin was famous for his pro-life vision, which he defined broadly. abortion in his view was wrong, but so was capital punishment, militarism, and social injustice. a true pro-life commitment, bernardin said, had to be carried like a seamless garment.

napoli: (laughter) she loved her private jet. but she, at the same time, was a news junkie - before we called it that. and when she saw someone wronged or an ill in society or when, as in the case of alcoholism, she became passionate about trying to help solve the problem - she was a big no-nukes activist in the '80s, a peace activist. and she just applied her wealth toward the greater good.

so i don't think this is a term with the kind of big blockbusters, like same-sex marriage or obamacare, that we have seen in recent years. but, you know, terry, one issue that i think everyone should keep an eye on, which will keep coming up in one way or another, is something that is another gorsuch specialty, which is the hobby lobby-type issues, which is basically the issues that arise when religious people or companies owned by religious people say, we don't want to follow the rules that are established for everyone else.

it's 1942, and britain is reeling from the hardships of war. german u-boats are cutting off food imports, and women are being urged to keep calm and carry on in the kitchen. that isn't easy when staples like butter, sugar, cheese, eggs, milk and meats are being rationed.

i hope this song will provide people some comfort that they will remember who they've lost, or even what they've lost — not even a person, but people feel like they've lost a year of their life. but i do think, on the bright side, that there will be some amazing art that comes out of this. because i feel like art always saves us. people will take the broken pieces of their heart and turn it into art for everyone else who's going through this. people will feel a little less alone and we'll get through it.
millions of people around the world use social media every day, every hour, every minute to stay in touch with friends and family. and yet, social media isn't always very social. studies show that people who spend more time on facebook or instagram or snapchat may feel more socially isolated than people who don't. npr's social science correspondent shankar vedantam says this might be because our online lives fail to match up with our real ones.
while national republicans have abandoned moore's candidacy en masse, the alabama republican party announced thursday it is still standing behind the former state supreme court chief justice.
gross: what impact did that have on his political career?
green: this administration has a strong base especially among white conservative voters who identify as evangelical or born-again christians and catholics. and among these groups, religious liberty is a huge concern. they tend to think of religious liberty in the context of, for example, objection to transgender identity, objection to same-sex marriage, objection to birth control or abortion. and so we see those types of priorities being elevated under the trump administration across agencies.
sagal: so you're ready to go?

the 2008 campaign, in which mccain received nearly 60 million votes on election day, showed mccain's resilience. in the summer of 2007, he was seen as an afterthought in the republican primaries after his campaign collapsed and ran out of money.

kapor klein keeps an eclectic inner circle. it includes a former head of the naacp; the woman who filed (and lost) a high-profile sexual harassment lawsuit against a leading venture capital fund; and ulili onovakpuri. the 32-year-old advises the health care portfolio, deciding which startups get money. but their relationship started when she was a teenager. her now long-time mentor gave her a scholarship to uc berkeley. (kapor klein launched the ideal scholars fund, for high-achieving minority students, after california ended affirmative action in schools.)
clinton: i think i certainly became more wary. i felt like i was on a tightrope, no margins whatsoever. i watched other people run for office — men, let's be honest. when you're the only woman, or the first woman, or one of very few women, there isn't that template.
diamond: the division is so new, and the rule that came out to accompany it is a proposed rule. so we're still in the early days. i do think it's illustrative, though, to look back at what the george w. bush administration did. in one of its final acts the, administration expanded conscience protections and made them broader. so pharmacists, other employees - not traditionally just doctors and nurses, as you said, that maybe didn't want to prescribe medicine related to contraception or work with gay or lesbian americans on fertility treatments. there were a number of examples of those folks being unable to access the care that they wanted. and that's why the obama administration, fairly early on, started working to roll back and narrow what religious objections could actually be be filed.
it said to 10 million americans — myself included — who had felt like an unwelcome presence, it said, 'you belong. and we're proud of you. and more to the point, we're proud of ourselves for being a part of bringing this moment to fruition,'  wolff said.

but there is one uber investor who stands out for how she decided to speak up. it was not very silicon valley-like of her, but freada kapor klein wanted to turn the crisis into a teachable moment. and while this week's events could lead her to say i told you so, she has a different takeaway.
it's also important to remember that, while my parents did play a role in the crime, neither of my parents was armed. neither one of them was actually even at the scene of the robbery itself. they were getaway car drivers. and that doesn't mean they lack responsibility. it doesn't mean that it was improper for them to be punished and held accountable. it was. but i think it's also important that we remember and recognize the particular role that each individual person plays in a crime. we do it in virtually every area of criminal law.

sagal: that would result, because of saturated fats, in harder butter. and apparently, there is no difference than what it is. and in fact, one of the prevailing theories right now is that this isn't real. somebody said on social media, hey, i think the butter is much harder than it used to be. and then everybody started saying, yeah, it really is. everybody convinced themselves that it was true. can you imagine living in a country with so few real problems that you have to make them up?

particularly interesting will be how the supreme court's view of presidential power evolves. in the eight years of the obama administration, the court's conservatives have demonstrated an unusual and deep suspicion about executive power, while the court's liberals have shown relative deference. it will be interesting to see if that changes when the president is a republican with an agenda, instead of a democrat.

if anyone has doubts about how different the court is likely to be when a centrist conservative like kennedy is replaced by someone more hard-line, there is the example of justice sandra day o'connor's retirement in 2006. president george w. bush chose samuel alito to replace o'connor, and the effect has been profound; o'connor has even complained privately that alito is systematically dismantling her legacy.
and actually i wish more of the web had stayed nonprofit. but the advertising model took over and i think has delivered us to where we are, along with the development of content, which is designed to do nothing else but make you click on it or share it. and i think it's kind of a low goal for content, and i think that's taken us to our current abyss.

but that has become a very important part of supreme court confirmation hearings, that, you know, i think partisans on both sides recognize that these hearings are political events. and senators respond to political stimuli. and television advertising is something that gets their attention. but also, you know, placing op-ed pieces, you know, getting web pieces up in support of gorsuch, mobilizing conservative intellectuals, mobilizing judge gorsuch's law clerks, some of whom were democrats, mobilizing - you know, establishing support within the american bar association, which gave gorsuch a good rating.
say thank you — even if it's only to yourself. gratitude is not pretending everything's great, it's just a way of looking at the positive side, says scott — a reset. for example, instead of berating yourself for not completing four tasks on your to-do-list, try focusing on the fact that you accomplished six of them, she says.

the cameroonian musician sued the american megastar; jackson settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. in 2007, rihanna sampled jackson's version of the soul makossa line on her song don't stop the music.

on chesil beach is the story of an unconsummated love and marriage. you might wonder, in this day and age, how interesting a film can that be? very. ian mcewan has done the screenplay based on his acclaimed 2007 novel. it's the first film directed by dominic cooke. it stars saoirse ronan and billy howle as florence and edward, a just-married young couple who spend what turns out to be their only marital night - actually, not even a night - in a hotel along the beach in dorset, where the young lovers fundamentally and irreparably misunderstand each other with everlasting consequences.

even with the people the jenningses have killed and the lives they've destroyed, the show excruciatingly draws out their destruction of stan's identity to the point where it seems like one of the most merciless things they've ever done. in his own mind, he is a loyal american. he is fbi, he is tough, he is unsentimental. he hates the russians, he hates the kgb, he will do anything for his country. he is honest with his own government. he puts his job first. he is bound, first, by duty — just as philip and elizabeth are telling him that they are.

kander: that's part of the reason. the story of how the other one got written is fred and i were writing songs for a film called new york, new york. martin scorsese was directing it. and it starred liza minnelli and robert de niro. we wrote five or six songs and went down to marty's (ph) office to play them. and liza and marty were there. and then in the background - i don't know if we got introduced or not - was robert de niro sitting on a couch. i'm not sure i even knew that at the time. anyway, we played the songs for them. and everything was all set until suddenly we saw this arm waving from the couch. and marty went over and said excuse me, de niro wants to speak to me. and then we watched what was a very animated conversation. and we couldn't hear anything. and scorsese came back and in a very embarrassed way said that de niro had felt that the title song, which was very much attached to him in the film, was just too lightweight compared to the song that was attached to liza, which was the world goes round. and would we consider taking another crack at it? and of course we left and thought, some actor is going to tell us how to write a song? and we could not have been more internally pompous, i think. anyway, we went back to fred's apartment.
ryan: i don't think there's any question. i think that, you know, senator sanders has some support with, like, alexandria ocasio cortez, who's a huge figure in the latino community, and others, you know, i think that have helped. but i think at the end of the day, nothing's going to sharpen everybody's mind like the prospect of removing donald trump from office. and so i think that the coalition and the democratic party and - across the country is going to come together behind joe biden, and we're going to beat donald trump.

i knew i wanted to write about a woman set in the time of life when loss seems overwhelming; when the sense of possibility you feel when you're young and when your family is young is lost and has been replaced by melancholy. people you love are gone; dreams you had for yourself haven't been realized; most things haven't turned out the way you thought they would. loss and grief for big and small things can wear you down and wear you out and that's where this novel starts: in that still point of sadness. it's what i knew. that moment makes you wonder how you're ever going to get through the dark tunnel to the other side. everyone i know has hit this point in one form or another — in their marriages; in their careers; following the loss of friends and family — so writing about it felt like channeling a kind of collective consciousness.

i think [in] the process of making this record, something that was important to me was coming to terms with that 15-year old version of mandy 'cause she still lives in me; i carry her around. she's kind of the reason i'm here today and still have a semblance of a career. so i've made peace with the embarrassment i think i had over the creative choices that i'd made at that point in my life. and i also have an appreciation for the fact that i came out of that — what would have been a pretty tumultuous time as a young person in the pop music scene, thrust in this adult world — i've come out the other end kind of a functioning adult. [the line no regrets, with a few exceptions] is a bit of cheeky nod, i think, maybe to stuff that is a bit more surface, like some of the fashion choices i made. i'll still apologize for those; the '90s were not really kind to me.

and we're kind of lost on the internet. we don't have any barriers. we have a demand for growth that is insistent. and so advertising just keeps getting heavier and heavier and heavier. it doesn't have any natural limit, and we haven't found the place for the limit. and i think it's really important, therefore, that some of the revolts that are undergoing right now, you know, whether it's ad blockers or other things, are people trying to set some lines so that we say, you know, this far but no further. and this is where it ends. and i think both those are very important for our future.

hawley: you know, there's some technical issues to it. you know, you want to film it the way you would film any other conversation between people. so, you know, if you're on two sides of a table, you would have ewan playing emmit on the left hand side. and he would do his scene. and then you'd send him off for about an hour and a half to get turned into ray. and he'd come back and sit in the other chair and play against a different double.
and that's exactly what i ended up doing. on the day of publication, i had the paperwork signed 10 minutes before i went on national television with barbara walters on the view because i basically said if they wouldn't sign the mediation agreement that we had been negotiating for so long, i would tell america that i was going to lose my child. and they ended up backing down for exactly that reason. it was a very clever calculation on behalf of my lawyer. and it was only after the book was published that the pursuit from the community became very intense. and that's when i felt the full force of that rage.

diamond: president trump has made it clear through his actions, through his tweets, that an official's place in his administration can be decided in a moment. and i think that has leaders like alex azar and seema verma constantly aware that they need to be reinforcing their relationship with the president, whether that means going on tv, as alex azar has done for months and months, and immediately praising the president as the bravest leader on hospital price transparency or the most courageous leader in fighting the drug industry. seema verma has also been effusive of about the president and looking to praise him at every turn in a way that we would not have seen during the obama administration or even during the george w. bush administration.

mcinerny: yeah, i met him in real life first through my friend moe who is also a widow, and she'd invited me over to her backyard and - to burn things, which is a huge passion of mine. i love fire and burning stuff. and so i came over with, like, a big bag of medical bills from aaron's time in the hospital and, you know, a book of matches. and i was just ready to enjoy a fire. and then this guy shows up. and he joins us around the fire. he sits in a potentially faulty, plastic adirondack chair, and it collapses underneath him. and his feet fly through the air. and this is like a year after my husband is dead. my body is so tense. i haven't, like, laughed in so long, and i laughed so hard i almost threw up. so he is clearly a man of taste and sophistication in that he (laughter) wanted to be - he definitely wanted to spend more time with a woman who had pointed and laughed at his misfortune, which i've been doing ever since.
and, you know, i think when it came out, a lot of people kind of pooh-poohed it and kind of said, oh, this is, you know - i don't think there's much in it that's objectionable. i think what's remarkable is that it's so incredibly ambitious. i mean, we can certainly debate how likely it is that he's going to be able to pull all of these things off. but, you know, i remember thinking at the time, well, you know, there's a lot of other leaders in the arab world who are not thinking this positively about their future of their countries. you know, i don't think that bashar al-assad in syria, for example, is thinking about where his country is going to be in 2030.
respect for improv's possibilities, dedication to textural diversity and shrewd deployment of rhythmic gambits — the veteran bassist aligns his elements with a master's touch on this suite-like program. two saxes, piano, bass and drums never walk the same path twice and find intrigue wherever they travel. balancing such moves takes a deep grasp on storytelling, and as moments of hushed beauty give way to brawny exclamation, appreciating the music's breadth is as easy as applauding its focus. –jim macnie
and sadly, i mean, i think there's almost something tragic about mohammed bin salman. i mean, this is a guy who craved international legitimacy, who craved international recognition. i mean, he went to great extents to show the world i'm the guy who is going to change saudi arabia. i'm going to diversify the economy. i'm going to give rights to women. i'm going to try to, you know, get rid of some of the nastier aspects of wahhabism that we've been spreading around the world. and he really wanted to get credit for all that stuff.

in the 1960s, when almost all of the situation comedies were dumbed-down fantasy shows like my mother the car, the dick van dyke show was a singularly modern and believable comedy about, in part, a loving husband and wife. in the 1970s, the mary tyler moore show was a subtle but undeniably feminist role model; as single working women on tv go, a direct ancestor of such later series as hbo's sex and the city and girls.

nu's the time: moses boyd, leading light of london's vibrant afrofutureshock diaspora, released dark matter just before the pandemic erupted and the killing of george floyd sparked months of protests in the u.s. and elsewhere. boyd's a sound physicist who brews swirling layers of multiple genres into a kind of 21st century electro-acoustic soul jazz, warmth and groove transposed through funk, dub, reggae, grime, afrobeat and hiphop influences. with its kaleidoscopic spray of beats and melodies, its percolating undertow of pan-global currents, the brooding rasp and cadences of dancing in the dark, the urgent, flashing-lights vibe of b.t.b. that foreshadows 2020, cop cars and ambulances circling the dance floor: dark matter matters.​ –david brent johnson
...jabs at sometimes-endless church committee meetings:
what trump has said: in 1993, trump said that ivana's allegations were obviously false, as the daily beast reports, quoting newsday. trump's lawyer, michael cohen, said that you cannot rape your spouse — a statement that is entirely untrue (cohen has since apologized). he also threatened the daily beast reporters who wrote the story at length, saying at one point: so i'm warning you, tread very f****** lightly, because what i'm going to do to you is going to be f****** disgusting. you understand me?

singletary: well, you know, i don't want to worry about that. i tell parents first of all, i do not advise parents to co-sign on a credit card for their child, or to put them on as authorized users. i know that that's the conventional wisdom out there, but you do not want to link your credit with your child - or anybody, for that matter, unless you are married to them.
lavalle: yeah. i think - if anything, i - you know, with the paranoid mindset is that there is a secret out in the world, there is a conspiracy out in the world and i'm being denied access to it, right? like, part of the reason someone gets so deeply into, say, conspiracy theories or paranoia of any kind is not just that you believe there are things being done against you or anything like that. it's also that you are excluded. you are outside of those in power or the machinations that are making things happen. you're not the beneficiary is usually the idea. and as i think i said the last time, i came from a lovely family. but i would say to some degree, there's a certain degree of paranoia about outsiders or an idea that people are not always planning to do the best for you, right? so that was my operating mindset just as a human. and so to have someone reach out and say - i don't want to say magically - but it seems always almost magically, like, we not only see you, but we think you might be worth more than what you think you are worth.

diamond: i think the heritage foundation emerged as this policy shop that the trump administration, first as a campaign and now as a white house, was really able to draw on. there was kind of a purity test after the election. not a religious purity test but an ideological and loyalty purity test that ended up weeding out republicans who had criticized trump. and there were quite a few of them. there were also moderate republicans who decided early, they didn't want to work for trump leading up to the election and right after.

simone's 1965 album, also entitled i put a spell on you, is the closest you'll ever hear her come to pop. the swaying strings and delicate vocals of marriage is for old folks give you a sense of simone's incredible musical range. plus it's a joyful reminder of the humor people forgot simone possessed once she became the siren of the civil rights movement with searing songs like 1964's mississippi goddam. the standout on this album, feeling good, is a number that simone transformed from a show tune for a barely-remembered british musical into a gold-standard strutter. simone's version trades wide-eyed pouting for unadulterated power, from the opening bars — featuring her voice and nothing else -- to the brass line that bows down to her pipes. by the time she careens towards the climax, you know this woman has indeed put a spell on you — and just about anyone else that dares get in her way. —audie cornish (host, all things considered)
gross: early on into your marriage, you realized that you both had a lot of mood swings. you had always had depressions, and you realized he had very serious depressions, too. and you write about during some of those depressions he'd become almost unrecognizable, quote, as though a stranger had replaced my sensitive and loving husband with someone obsessed by demons of rage, tormented by suspicion. it must have been very unsettling, especially early on when you saw changes like that and wondered, you know, who he was becoming.

mr. sharlet: well, people are certainly talking about the family in a way that they hadn't, and what's been really great is that local press around the country has been asking their representatives tough questions. so you have terrific reporters down in oklahoma, and north carolina, and michigan, and kansas, and mississippi, and tennessee going to their congressmen and saying, look, what's your affiliation with this group? we're not challenging your freedom of religion. you tell us that religion's very important to how you legislate and here's a religious group you're involved with, that does these things. why is secrecy necessary? how does it shape your views? does it help you? does it - is it something we want to know about?

but it's worth looking back on how precarious life was and continues to be for many lgbtqia people. in the early 1980s, outbreaks of what was initially — and disparagingly — called gay plague began popping up all over the country. the reagan administration's early inaction helped those early outbreaks explode into the aids crisis, which would define the politics of queer life. (reagan's onetime friend, the movie star rock hudson, would die of the disease; the reagans did not respond to requests from hudson's family for help.) the fear of the poorly understood disease would help further stigmatize queer communities. some religious conservatives attributed the disease to god's wrath for their supposed sinfulness. (the aids crisis has gone on to become increasingly racialized; in recent years, black and latinx men and black women represent the majority of new diagnoses.)

feldman: the rage took many forms. some of it was organized. some of it was more impulsive and spontaneous. i had - i got a lot of threatening hate mail from my family and from my community. my family told me that they had already prepared my grave, and they couldn't wait to dance on it. all i needed to do was to commit suicide. there were people discussing on online forums in hebrew and yiddish what would be the halakhic permission to kill me. they were waiting outside my apartment. you know, they were publicly speaking out against me, trying to defame me and discredit me.
so the united states is behaving in exactly the opposite way from what had been expected before. and so that is the issue. america has been viewed as really a country that stood behind democratic principles, human rights, was not for torture, was not for really undermining aspects of democratic society and that we're not fulfilling the role that we're supposed to. and america, the leader - the chair of the leader of the free world is empty.

presiding over a table with towering stacks of folders, trump's lawyer suggested there would be a wall between trump's business and his presidency, even though trump himself made it quite clear that he would not be divesting. i have a no-conflict situation because i'm president, trump said. i could run the trump organization, great, great company, and i could run the company — the country, he added. i'd do a very, very good job, but i don't want to do that. trump never separated himself from his company in any meaningful way. trump's daughter ivanka trump and her husband, jared kushner, also didn't fully divest from their business interests. the couple made tens of millions of dollars from an array of limited-liability companies while also serving in the white house. trump's commerce secretary, wilbur ross, pledged to congress that he would largely sell off his assets, then took dozens of meetings with executives to whose companies he had personal financial ties. others did divest, but then proceeded to use their agency budgets as their personal piggy banks. friends, donors, and hangers-on also thrived. top gop financier elliott broidy leveraged his fundraising into access, including a meeting in the oval office. broidy attempted to use that access as a calling card with foreign officials from whom he sought security contracts. like several other beneficiaries of trump's generosity, broidy eventually found himself in legal trouble, pleading guilty to violating foreign-lobbying laws on behalf of malaysian and chinese clients.

prof. winston: the salvation army was the brainchild of william booth, who was a british evangelist. and in the 1860s and �70s, he tried several different missions to reach the un-churched poor in london, but none were very successful. so, one day he was brainstorming with his top command - well, i call it a command in retrospect - but with his top men, and they said, what we need is an army, a salvation army. and he loved the name, he was sort of autocratic to start with. and so, they had a great time making this into a living metaphor.
minhaj: well, he has already asked for a complete and total shutdown of muslims entering the country, and he's asked for american-muslims to sign up for a registry.
one thing that all the totalitarian states did was make the great leader's face everywhere. and i will say in this campaign, one candidate in particular has been incredibly successful. now, he doesn't control the media, but donald trump has been incredibly successful in having his face appear everywhere. you cannot go a day without seeing that face somewhere maybe 10 times. sometimes you go to a website - a news website. it's repeated 40 times and through an operation of a private media, we somehow have replicated some of the visuals of a totalitarian state.

i have never provided alcohol to minors, and i have never engaged in sexual misconduct. as a father of a daughter and a grandfather of five granddaughters, i condemn the actions of any man who engages in sexual misconduct not just against minors but against any woman. i also believe that any person who has been abused should feel the liberty to come forward and seek protection. i know that a lot of people wonder why this story was written. why would women say these things if they are not true? i can't fully answer that because as much as i have disagreed vehemently on political issues with many people over the years, i cannot understand the mentality of using such a dangerous lie to try to personally destroy someone. as a former judge and administer of the law, i take the protection of our innocent as one of my most sacred callings. false allegations are gravely serious and will have a profound consequence on those who are truly harassed or molested.

but what modern conservatives, as you said, especially the libertarians, have done is they've plucked out a speech from 1875 - but many others, too, before that and after that - where douglass would answer the question, what does a negro want, which was always bandied about. and his answer would be, let them alone. leave them alone. let them alone.
wendle: james grew obsessive, certain there had to be an answer. so he holed up in his office and watched the tapes of his live coverage from that day over and over and over.

a new poll conducted by the national republican senatorial committee shows that moore now trails jones by 12 points — reflecting a 12-point drop in support for moore since before the scandal broke. moore's favorability has also cratered, with just 35 percent of likely voters surveyed holding a favorable opinion of the gop nominee and 52 percent having an unfavorable opinion. the nrsc has already pulled financial support from moore. politico first reported on the poll, and npr obtained the survey from a gop source.
when the coronavirus task force was being assembled and alex azar became the leader, my understanding is he did box out seema verma. he didn't push to have her on the team, even though she oversees these programs, like medicare, like medicaid, where many millions of americans who are covered by those programs now will want to go test - be tested for coronavirus. and their feud dates back to a simple workplace fight, i think, which is - alex azar is technically seema verma's boss, but seema verma has done a lot of things to go around her boss, and azar simply does not abide that.
lavalle: well, you know, on one level what i was sort of thinking about was the hustle of writing as a whole, right, and specifically the hustle of being a black writer, that time and again - and this is - there's - i mean, if you're a southern writer, if you're a midwestern writer, if you're a woman writer, if you're a jewish writer, there's all these hustles that exist that if you play into them, there are already readers, there are already accolades, there are already avenues that have been set up to essentially decide that you are good at that because you essentially just look like someone who should be good at that. right, it's the idea that if you look the part, we'll overlook your mediocrity. and that's something that is always on my mind. as a black writer, i mean, there are certain avenues that i think - you could approach them in ways that have been done by geniuses before, and because it sort of looks like what a genius of a previous generation did, you may enjoy the glow of that genius, that secondary light. you can be a moon to their sun, and you can make a whole career off of essentially being that. and i was terrified at the idea of turning into someone like that, and so i wanted to funnel that into the book as, like, on some level that's what tommy's doing.

diamond: it's certainly more in line with what we would see from any republican administration. i do want to clarify, terry, anytime there's a political handoff - and in this case we're coming off the obama administration which had spent eight years advancing abortion rights, changing the definition of protections for transgender patients and other more liberal policies - there was going to be a course correction under a republican president. any republican president would have instituted more of a focus against abortion. i think the question here is are these new leaders plucked by trump from non-traditional roles doing things that are substantively different than their predecessors under previous republican administrations? and there's a lot of evidence that suggests, yes, they are.

these young nobles have that compelling dynamic best summed up as the grumpy one (jainan) and the sunshine one (kiem): the prince is personable and engaging where his outsider husband is stiff and awkward. this is fertile ground for the tropiest of misunderstandings, compounded by our heroes' own self-loathing baggage. kiem's assumption that jainan's hesitation to touch him must be rooted in repulsion is catnip to this romance reader, while jainan's bafflement every time kiem reveals hidden layers and actual care makes one want to coo, who hurt you?

one of the things that's interesting that we found in this process, terry, is that it is, in fact, possible to safely and quickly decarcerate. we found a lot of people who, it turns out, shouldn't have really been incarcerated in the first place. for example, we had a mother who was conserved and was simply waiting for placement in an appropriate mental health facility. we were able to get her placement expedited rather than having her wait in jail for months on end, as is often the case. we had another young woman with a high-risk pregnancy with no criminal record, who was in jail on a misdemeanor. with our reentry partners, we were able to get that expecting mother into a prenatal care facility where she can stay safely until her birth.

asner: (as lou grant) yeah, i like dogs, big dogs.
cornish: how does it happen? i mean, what is the trigger? i guess, as you're going to and from mass?
in recent years, boies' firm did legal defense work for the times. then, in late 2017, the newspaper fired boies schiller flexner over revelations he hired a private firm run by former israeli spies for harvey weinstein. as the new yorker first reported, that firm sought to intimidate the times' sources and even tailed its reporters. boies says he was unaware of the extent of the firm's work.
at the gala celebration after the show, she said, mr. trump immediately zeroed in on her, telling her how much he liked her style and inviting her to visit him in new york to talk about her future. soon enough, she said, he delivered another unwelcome kiss on her lips, this time in trump tower.

mccammon: now, adam and laura acknowledge they were lucky here. laura says both her family and her christian friends took what felt like a pretty open, nonjudgmental approach to talking about sex, something she says not everyone finds in the church.
i went back and read the transcript of a very famous press conference, the pretty in pink press conference she did in the heat of the cattle futures commodities scandal in the white house. she was just being barraged with criticism. she sat down in her pink st. john's suit, and she just answered questions for over an hour and a half, just - every question she had, just give it all to me.

when the obama education department issued its federal guidance to schools in may of that year, buchert felt empathy and relief — first of all — for young transgender people around the country, she says. there are real people — real trans people — who are suffering discrimination, not going to the bathroom, skipping gym class. those kinds of discriminatory conditions can have a lifelong impact on these youth.
gross: so one of leonard leo's jobs at the federalist society has been to kind of create a pipeline for students to get to the bench and for people on the federal bench to get to the supreme court, people who conservatives approve of because the federalist society started more as a student organization and then it became something to channel people to judicial appointments, right?
gross: and that's hasan minhaj at the white house correspondents' dinner. when you hear groans like we did after some of your jokes, do you take that as a good thing (laughter)?

the power notebooks is filled with apt quotes. roiphe cites virginia woolf on the importance of financial independence — the threat to which fuels her own concerns when, as a single mother of two children by two different men, she feared for her job after a colleague at nyu tried to sabotage her chances at tenure.
the price of bauxite, used to make aluminum, was rising and so were juxin mining's fortunes. prosperous, zhang became obsessed with improving the village, according to his sister, zhang zhaohui.
gaines-cirelli: people felt, you know, hurt, rage and just deep disappointment. we had a moment in 2019 where the church could've done something really different from so many other mainline denominations. we could've found a way to stay together in the midst of our differences and model something that - the country i think really needs right now is to see faith community who's able and willing to find a way to remain in relationship even in the midst of deep disagreement.
mary tyler moore's famous sunniness could mask a lot of steel. she said, without telling too many stories about it, that she'd had a childhood that made her sing and dance for approval. she struggled to live with diabetes. she had a son who died in his 20s, lost a sister to drugs, and a brother to cancer. mary tyler moore suffered from a drinking problem for 10 or more years, worked hard to overcome it, and was strong enough to talk about it.
gross: so really you'd never lived that kind of single life.
moore: just that she was going to be a wife, a television wife. and that really had its classical parameters and dimensions. and they were established and they hardly ever varied except as to whether or not the wife was the star of the show, in which case she was the funny one, or if she were the straight man for the male star and she was then totally supportive. but all these wives were kind of obedient and, you know, a representative of the vows to love, honor and obey. they hardly varied from that. and with carl reiner's character, the way she was written, laura actually had opinions of her own. and while she was asserting herself, she also didn't make dick van dyke look like a dummy. it was a matter of two people.
sagal: wait a minute. i'm sorry.
thompson: it depends. i mean, i've learnt to give myself decompression time. and i would say to all young actors who work that you do have to be aware that you're playing tricks with yourself and with your subconscious mind and that i've had experiences where i've gone and played someone and i've come back home and not been able to shake it - just not been able to shake it off. it's complicated. and that's been bad for me. i mean, it's not terribly good for your mental health. so you do have to - yeah, you have to keep an eye. and playing fiona was interesting actually. it wasn't a long shoot. it was six weeks, but it was very intense. and i'd been rehearsing not only the language is quite - a lot of her language is quite complicated. but i also had to learn these piano pieces, which took me a long time because i hadn't played the piano for ages.
this is going to be so detrimental to the united states, you know, a year from now, two years from now. i know the illegal immigration is heart-wrenching and - sort of you can understand it from a humane perspective. but what this is doing to our economy is going to be felt for years to come.

curtis: ...which is about what happens when you let go of a balloon. so one of the stanzas of that book is where do they go when they float far away? do they ever catch cold or need somewhere to stay? now, where do you think the balloon is going to stay in the illustration in the book?
lanky and libidinous — sex is both her torment and her refuge — fleabag is also startlingly self-dramatizing. she constantly breaks the so-called fourth wall to talk directly to the audience as she enjoys kinky sex, bickers with her success-mad sister claire (sian clifford) or bemoans that her widower father (bill paterson) has taken up with her godmother, a two-faced artist played by oscar-winner olivia colman.
and i've told that story - you know, gave a speech last year in alabama. and i had people come up to me and say, i didn't know that. and then they didn't - you know, went back and looked at it. it's like, i can't believe it. it's like, you know, we will forget history if we don't keep bringing it up again.
mathus: it's like a pure expression of music that - when we get together. we just enjoy the music.
it's only until i got there that i realized that i had been prepared better than most of my fellow african-american students who had gone to predominantly white institutions, he says. they had been in an environment where they themselves were trying to study this thing we call black theology, and this place that we call the black church, by themselves in a vacuum, whereas i had gone to a historically black college, where that was the center of our focus, where that was our context.

joel pollak, an editor at breitbart, appeared on msnbc to argue that three of the four women's accounts had no business in the national news, because a 30-something moore pursuing relationships with 16- to 18-year-olds was not inappropriate. as far as we know, there's only one relationship that's been alleged that's problematic, pollak said, referring to moore's alleged sexual contact with a 14-year-old.
the times journalists wrote that their report lays bare how powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy.
briger: well, one of the things that sustains him through all this carnage, and one of the most enduring parts of the book is the relationship that thomas mcnulty has with his lover handsome john cole. and, you know, they maintain this clandestine romance as soldiers in the army, and then they have a domestic life together. you know, i found it interesting that you decided to write a book about a gay relationship in an era where even that phrase would have been a foreign one. i mean, did you...
mayer: so he was raised as roman catholic and was an altar boy, as were all the pence boys. and when he went off to hanover college in indiana, which wasn't that far from his home of columbus, he converted to evangelical christianity. and his mom and his - the rest of his siblings are still very catholic. and i really enjoyed talking to his mom. she was - one of the things that's sort of surprising about pence and i think explains some of his success as a politician is his mom is - has a great sense of humor and is very charming, and his brother was quite funny, too. the two of them were ribbing each other over coffee as i was interviewing them.

trump: as reported by the economic policy institute in may, this deal doubled our trade deficit with south korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 american jobs.
conway: well, it's a basic difference in strategy and what one thinks will be an effective mechanism for changing institutions. i thought that the most important thing was to transform the program of instruction of conventional departments and schools. i mean, i wanted the law school to study the legal treatment of domestic violence, or the school of architecture to study transportation and how the way it's scheduled in a city affects how women can move around. you know, just when poor mothers need to collect their children from school is just when the bus schedule is at its least helpful and so forth. or, i wanted the medical school to spend more time researching heart disease in women.
getting used to a slower pace means you don't have the same adrenaline rush, but it also means that you can be i think more reflective and deliberate about the kinds of things you want to get done.

by the time they arrive at an inn, at which there is only one bed (because road trip romance), their desire for each other is very strong and very mutual. as their journey becomes more and more bonkers — with more and more steamy sexy times — both lady farris and duncan dread what will happen when they finally get to the orgy. or after; he's a hero who wants marriage and she's a woman who wants her freedom. their happy ever after may not be conventional, but it is very satisfying indeed.
prine: (singing) when i was a child, my family would travel down to western kentucky, where my parents were born. and there's a backwards old town that's often remembered so many times that my memories are worn. and daddy, won't you take me back to muhlenberg county, down by the green river where paradise lay? well, i'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking. mr. peabody's coal train has hauled it away. well, sometimes we'd travel right down the green river to the abandoned old prison down by airdrie hill, where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols. but empty pop bottles was all we would kill. and daddy, won't you take me back to muhlenberg county...
meyers: victoria beckham admitted in a new interview that while performing with the spice girls, her microphone was usually turned off. even crazier, bernie's mic has been turned off this whole time. (imitating bernie sanders) i don't need it. it's a waste of valuable electricity.
edelstein: that scene is wonderfully snappy, and there's an even better one in which ralph fiennes, as an aristocratic director, gently attempts to elicit a thoughtful line reading from a cowboy star played by alden ehrenreich, staggeringly miscast in a sophisticated love story. fiennes and ehrenreich are virtuoso farceurs. their rapport is musical. but in between the great stuff, hail, caesar! droops. the lengthiest subplot features the biblical epic's thick-witted, alcoholic leading man played by george clooney, who gets kidnapped by a shady consortium of communist writers and held for ransom, all while they try to indoctrinate him in the evils of capitalism. all their scenes are dead on the screen. clooney seems to like working with the coens because they always cast him as a dumb guy. but his idea of playing dumb is to furrow his brow and babble hysterically. i wish he'd have switched roles with josh brolin, who's good - he's always good - but who might have brought a volatile innocence to the role of the actor while clooney might have found his rhythm as a well-dressed thug using every drop of political savvy to keep childish performers in line. watching hail, caesar!, i wondered why it felt so over-deliberate before it hit me that, duh, almost every film joel and ethan coen make is over-deliberate. it's their temperament, their style.
in 1966, there was a protest at julius's bar in manhattan — the bar, citing state regulators, refused to serve these openly gay men, kreis says. and at the time, the chairman of what's essentially the new york city's version of the equal opportunity employment commission, suggested that this was a form of sex discrimination — and this is only two years after the civil rights act of 1964 was passed.
rott: there was no joy in fighting fire anymore. year after year, the blazes just got worse - firestorm after firestorm, thousands of homes lost, communities destroyed.
wendle: the clerks can't be sure why couples would risk it. it could be that one person needs another's health insurance or couples who'd planned to be wed in the coming months rushing to get married in the event they won't be able to, or it could be the spell of love.
davis: well, i mean, come on. you know, i mean, both are kind of unattainable. it ultimately all worked out for me, but the likelihood of becoming a famous model was actually pretty slim, and i didn't. i did get work, and it was through my model agency that i got my first acting job.
gross: oh, i have another question about laura petrie's look.
pusha t: (rapping) with ye back chopping. the cars and the women come with options. caviar facials remove the toxins. this ain't for the conscious. the is for the mud-made monsters who grew up on legends out of yonkers influenced by [expletive] straight out of compton.
will later made a mint off of bran cereals, even though that was truly john harvey's creation, markel says. there was a lot of bad blood between them, and then after the lawsuit they rarely, if ever, spoke to one another again.
moore: and then lucy and several other shows followed. but in that show it's a little like doing theater that's captured on film. you rehearse for five days. and then on the evening of the fifth day, the audience comes in and the cameras, having blocked their moves and yours lined up with them, you film it from top to bottom in continuity.
mayer: yes, of course. they've been pushing very hard on that. the thing you have to remember about them is that they - ok, they've got the second-largest private company in the country, and it is very much engaged in the fossil fuel business. they've got 4,000 miles of oil pipelines. they've got a coal company. they've got coal-powered power plants. they've got coal up in canada. and so their whole business plan relies on stay - keeping america on fossil fuels. and so they've thrown a tremendous amount of weight behind stopping anything that would get - put a tax on carbon or push america towards some kind of agreement on climate change that might tax carbon pollution.
reynor: (as brendan) did the sex pistols know how to play? you don't need to know how to play. who are you, steely dan? you need to learn how to not play, connor. that's the trick, that's rock 'n' roll. and that takes practice. and you're not a covers band, by the way.
s rushfield: they went to all of my nephew's baseball games. he played all the way through his senior year in high school. poor meemaw actually took a foul ball off the top of her head at one game.

this scene can be read as an attempt by the bachelor franchise to dispel criticisms (and the memory of a 2012 lawsuit) concerning its whitewashed casts. it shows how these attempts can be clunky at best, offensive and creepy at worst.
and then, at the same time, i think there's a lot of concern that the hack is more widespread than the dnc. if they could get to the dnc, could they get to the campaign? could they get to the clinton foundation? i mean, i think that there are concerns that there is more coming. julian assange has said that there is something very incriminating.

so kobani is this small town in northeastern syria that few outside syria had heard of. and it got thrust onto the global stage by the men of the islamic state who think they're going to just overrun this town and have yet another battlefield victory — because this is 2014 and they haven't had one loss. and there comes this david and goliath story that starts to take hold of people's imaginations about this syrian kurdish force helped by a few other folks, including iraqi kurdish forces, who decide that they're going to fight to the death to stop the islamic state — and women play a central role in that battle. it almost becomes a david versus goliath. only david is a woman.

chris stewart: there's enough space where both of those can be accommodated, and that's what we've tried to do here today.
bernstein: right. i mean, that was the point. and trump made it very clear that he would favor people who patronized his hotel. there was just one day in april of 2018 when a group of executives from t-mobile who wanted justice department approvals for their merger checked into the hotel. that same day, trump held a fundraiser with two business associates of rudy giuliani, who had contributed $300,000 to a superpac related to trump and were, therefore, able to go straight to trump to pitch their idea for a gas company in ukraine. that was what was going on at the hotel. and president trump made it very, very clear that if you paid him, you could play.

itzkoff: julliard - and particularly, its drama school - was a very different institution in the time that robin was there. and it had only been running its drama school for a few years by the time he enrolled. and it was a much more darwinian environment. it had, at the end of each year, these kind of systematic cuts that got made - that they would look at the student body and say, here's who can advance, and here's who we can dispense with. and robin had actually come in as an advanced student. even after his first year, they kind of looked at him.

sagal: so you are so prolific and successful. it's amazing to me. do you know offhand how many books you have published?
turkle: yes. well, the most important basic things that my mom had not told me about her illness - because she wanted me to go away to college, which had been my dream. it had been my dream since junior high to go away - to not just go away to college but go to radcliffe. john f. kennedy had gone to harvard. i wanted to go to harvard. when i rode away to harvard and they said they didn't take girls, i want to go to radcliffe. they told me i can go to radcliffe. so she knew that if she told me that she was ill, i would stay home and go to college in new york city. so that's kind of the baseline.

new york is a great place; it's got great people, loving people. when the world trade center came down, i saw something that no place on earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than new york, trump said. and everybody in the world watched, and everybody in the world loved new york and loved new yorkers. i have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that ted made.
shalhoub: (laughter) no, i didn't really see them that way until i, you know, grew up and left home. and then, you know - and then kind of in hindsight but not just my siblings, too, you know, other people that were part of our lives - my grandparents, my uncles and aunts, friends of my parents. there was this whole kind of tapestry out there, you know, kind of wonderful, crazy, bizarre characters, some with accents, some with strange habits. and they've all - they all sort of still live in me in a way.

the fact that my parents weren't armed, the fact that my father is literally the only person from that crime who is still incarcerated today even though he was not a shooter, even though he was not armed, is problematic. it's disproportionate. and it does not get us closer to bringing those three men back. it's a tragedy that i know weighs heavily on him every day of his life. he has, as long as i can remember, expressed his remorse for what he was part of, for the mistakes that he made and for the ways in which his political commitment to racial justice led him to participate in such a tragic and misguided crime.

in addition to changing social and cultural attitudes, conservative religious schools face a changing legal environment regarding lgbt issues. title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
the supreme court, when it weighs in on these title vii cases, will probably tell us a lot about what the law is going to be — unless and until congress acts, bagenstos says. those decisions will determine how sex can be interpreted under current law. but, he adds, ultimately you'll get more stability when congress passes a new law.

considering the fact that we're going on the road and i want to honor that part of my life and my career — and perhaps people and their nostalgic connection to that time in music, as well — i've been revisiting some of [my old music]. i mean, i know that people are coming on the road and want to hear candy, so that's a no-brainer to me. but listening back to that era of music, there's definitely some songs that i'm like okay, this wasn't so bad. i'm excited to figure out a new arrangement of this song. i feel like some of these songs — maybe not all of them — can lend themselves to an acoustic rendition, and i'm excited to see people's reactions if they come to see us on the road.
greene: i would be happy to come back. talk to my bosses, kenny.

the unexpected death of justice antonin scalia and the looming face-off between the white house and the senate over his replacement have revived proposals that would limit the tenure of u.s. supreme court justices.
what i think is not fair journalism is to somehow imply i was involved in what was being discussed when the times knows, and has acknowledged, that i didn't even know about those text messages until they showed them to me, boies tells npr. he says he is being tarred by the newspaper's conclusions over his friend's texts.

moore also weighed in on franken's situation via twitter, claiming mcconnell rushed to judgment in his case, but not in the case of the allegation against the minnesota democrat.
as different as the two rappers are artistically, they proved equally thoughtful about their aims and aspirations in conversation.
and so the narrative of my life takes its form around those issues. and, of course, since i'm a strong feminist, i also wanted the narrative to drive home the point that i'm writing about two generations of australian women who couldn't contribute what they might have to their society because of their being female. were i to write that story today, you know, i've come to a much different understanding of my mother, partly from being widowed myself. and the things that drove me out of australia seem less important to me, and i would probably construct the narrative quite differently.
it's like a dream, one plaintiff said, according to the times. now the government only needs to act.
so i absolutely think that that life experience, that my family history, shaped my personal and professional choices. and i think it gives me an insight into the difficult decisions i need to make as district attorney that is often missing from policymakers in the criminal justice sphere. recognizing the complexity, the full humanity and the potential of every single person that we prosecute is a really critical and often missing component of criminal justice in this country.
kelemen: just minutes into the hearing, a former state department official-turned-activist, ann wright, was dragged out of the room, shouting in protest.

emma thompson on 'the children act'
gross: ok, so how did you meet her?
turkle: yes. so that meeting did so much. it reconciled me with my - my mother had been dead for many years, 10 years at least, when this meeting happened. and it reconciled me with her after her death because i had been so angry at her for keeping my father away from me. and yet she had never wanted to tell me why. we had never had that conversation. so a lot of the empathy diaries is about - and, of course, so much of my work is about - the importance of these necessary conversations, of not keeping these secrets because, of course, all i wanted to do was to tell her that i understood now and how sorry i was.
gjelten: wilson has helped some legislators draft laws that would guarantee a same-sex couple the right to get a marriage license, for example, while also allowing an individual clerk the right not to sign the license as long as someone else can sign it.
mccammon: there's been a lot written in recent years by people who grew up in the evangelical christian purity movement, which teaches that premarital sex is a sin. adam and laura say they know that some of those messages and the way they've been presented have made people feel shame about sex and their bodies.
thank you, bill. thank you so much.

so the internet, you know, 10 or 15 years ago sort of felt like the wild west. you could go out there and do anything and search for things, and, you know, find out about stuff. now always in the back of my mind, you know, whether it's email or whatever else, it's like, well, is this going to show up somewhere? is someone going to keep track of this and, you know, know i was searching for - maybe it's an embarrassing disease, maybe it's a weird hobby? whatever it is, it's kind of become the opposite of a freedom an enabling tool in that way because when you're being watched, you behave a lot differently. i think all of us are like that. and so i'm kind of concerned the combined effect, not only google, all these companies is kind of to make us more boring and that seems the opposite of what this medium was supposed to be.
kansas began following a phased reopening plan in may, which became voluntary by the end of that month. general safety guidelines apply statewide, and decisions about restrictions and reopenings are made at the county level.

noah: that's really racist. you shouldn't do that. and i said, what do you mean, it's racist? they said, oh, you can't do a chinese accent. that's - and i said, i'm not doing a chinese accent. i'm doing my friend's accent. and they said, yeah, you can't do that. and i said, ok, but can i do a russian accent? and they said, yeah, yeah, of course, you can do that. i said, and a british accent? they said, yeah, go ahead. and i couldn't understand.
sagal: yeah, i know. remember winter? wasn't that fun? what do you do there in boston?
but i think going on the ellen degeneres show for the third time is very different from sitting down for an in-depth interview with a print news outlet.

so nato was very important during your tenure in that position. i mean, the shape of nato changed. and now we've seen brexit, and we've seen president trump having this kind of changeable, ambivalent position about nato. how does that feel personally? because you were so - like, nato was such an important part of your professional life as secretary of state.
rowan atkinson: (as mr. bean) bean. it's me. hello, i'm bean, mr. bean. hello, i'm bean, mr. bean. hello, i'm bean, mr. bean.
legend: i think it's a combination. i think i've always thought of myself as a very political person. i've always read - even as a child when i would go to the library, i would choose to read about dr. king. i would choose to read about the struggle. i would choose to read about people who fought for justice. and that's always been inspiring to me. i've always thought about my role as an artist and as someone with influence as something that is a special gift that gives me the opportunity to speak out about these things. and i wrote an essay when i was 15 years old. it was a mcdonald's essay competition for black history month. it was called future black history makers (laughter).
that was like the final straw for some of the people that were holding on by a thread in certain groups. but i remember i was on an arena tour, this lady just walks up to me and gives me the biggest hug. then she puts this note in my hand. ... she said, i remember thinking that black people were just whining. i never considered myself racist, but just listening to your music made me think i have some work to do on myself. i remember watching your video weeping. thank you for making this music and being gracious in how you made it. i thought to myself, wow, people are actually being impacted by that in a great way.

without belaboring the point, frears and company make us see how the thorpe affair wouldn't have happened had homosexuality been treated as a normal part of life instead of as a crime - a reality that drives thorpe to act on sociopathic tendencies he already possessed. yet, the show also reminds us that norman is doubly victimized because of his place in the british class structure. although thorpe is clearly a lying scoundrel, the establishment closes ranks around him because he's one of the right sort. norman is not. he's an honest nobody. and the powerful treat him as little more than roadkill to be mocked and ignored.
tur: i certainly hope so. i do, i do.

prine: i wrote that with three buddies of mine - david ferguson (ph), dan auerbach from black keys and pat mclaughlin. i thought i mentioned earlier that we wrote for about 30 years now together. anyway, the four of us thought it would be a good idea to get together and try and write some songs. i think specifically, we were going to write them for dan auerbach's solo project. he was - he's got two solo records out now. and we wrote six songs in two days. and i didn't think any of the songs were for me. i thought we were writing them for dan. one of the songs was the song boundless love. and dan didn't record it when he went in to do his solo project. so i looked at it when i was trying to gather songs up for the tree of forgiveness. and i liked the song, except i didn't think there was enough of me in it, like, john prine in it. so i called up dan and said, i'm going to john prine this song up. and he said, what do you mean?

lamott extols the freeing possibilities of accepting the inevitability of what she famously calls the s***** first draft. tallent, in contrast, takes readers deep into her own internal high-pressure chambers of self-loathing and not-enough-ness — feelings that can goad creativity, but also ultimately shut it down.

sondheim: you are the promised kiss of springtime that makes the lonely winter seem long. you are the breathless hush of evening that trembles on the brink of a lovely song. those are all very pretty words, but what do they mean? take a look at that image - those images. i don't know what they mean, and i also don't know how they apply personally to anybody. oscar did a lot of poetic lyric writing, which i would call poesy, using images that i think are not germane to what's going on. i think that's just a writer trying to be poetic. and that's an example.

the problem of the only child, dang it, is the prose. it feels stilted and odd. when seonkyeong meets hayeong, she remembers that her husband had said that his ex-wife wouldn't allow him to see the child. so after the divorce, he never saw her. most editors would have cut one of those sentences because they are repetitive. you can picture a better paragraph telling us after the divorce, he never saw the child: his wife wouldn't allow any visitations, or something similar. bits like this abound, along with strangely choppy paragraphs.

wu: oh, no, it's incredibly complex, and it's based partially on the information that has been gathered about you. so, you know, if you have a weakness for furry slippers or something, you might end up with that kind of advertising. it's a very complicated algorithmic decision. there's no one dude who's deciding what ads are going with things, and it's very individualized also. and that's the idea of collecting information is that in theory, you're showing people things that they should want to see or for which they are a good target. so, no, there's no master person.
steven taylor, a political science professor at alabama's troy university, agreed that social issues may be a sticking point that many conservative voters aren't able to overcome in voting for jones. in addition to abortion, moore has hammered home his opposition to same-sex marriage and transgender rights.

relationships are complex and there are many ways that people let each other down, that people do not show up for each other, that people break their vows. in other words, betrayal comes in many forms and sometimes just because one has not cheated or slept with somebody else doesn't inherently give that person moral superiority. sometimes a partner has been deeply absent, neglectful, indifferent, contemptuous, rejecting sexually for nine years in a row. ...

vanderwerff: yeah. i remember when i was a little kid, i always wanted to - you know, we'd have, like, family gatherings or church gatherings. and the women would get up at the end of the meal, and they'd go into the kitchen. and i always wanted to go with them. i was always more interested in what they were talking about and what they were saying and what they were doing. i liked their style of gossip more than the gossip of the guys. but at the same time, i had, like, these huge ambitions. you know, i wanted to be a writer. i wanted to do these big, important, exciting things. and there wasn't as firm a path to do that as a woman. and, like, also, the word transgender was just, like, not in the national conversation. it was not a word i heard until i was really in my 20s.
davies: now, one of the reasons i picked that scene was that you - we both see monk being kind of phobic and obsessive but also kind of brilliant at analyzing a crime scene. and there are times when the - it's - you're sort of almost uncomfortable with what he's going through. and it's also really funny. was that conscious?
arquette: exactly. and then there's the third man, who is benicio del toro's character, matt. and i felt like with him, he scares her, but he's also the most alpha male she's ever been with. and she's used to being the alpha, so it's very strange for her to get thrown off her game. there's a part of that that she really likes, and it's confusing to her.

turkle: i said, no. this isn't the old country. i mean, i think he was desperate. i think he just felt completely not up to the task of raising his family by himself. and he saw me, as, you know, the center of the household. and then he says, without missing a beat, as though he thought - perhaps thought that there might be this negative outcome to the conversation, he proposes that he's going to ask my mother's sister, my wonderful aunt mildred, to marry him because he says that in the old country, that would happen too. he asked mildred to marry him. and it really was, you know, the end of, you know, it really broke my family apart.

more prominent, less vulnerable americans — ellen degeneres, as one major example — were coming out. and in 2003, lawrence v. texas, a landmark supreme court case that effectively decriminalized homosexuality, softened the ground for later gay-rights goals, such as same-sex marriage.
the idea of the film was to examine the british class system in 1963, '64, to see whether it was changing, see if it was reflecting the very cultural upheavals that were going up in the united kingdom from the beatles onwards, apted told whyy's fresh air in 2013. the idea was that we would get seven-year-old children from different backgrounds — from rich backgrounds, from poor backgrounds, from rural backgrounds ... and have them talk about their lives, their ambitions, their dreams and whatever, and see whether that told us anything.

gross: i've heard this question posed this week to tony perkins from the family research council. you know, how do you square trump's behavior with your own evangelical views? and he said, basically, the relationship he had with stormy daniels was before he became president. and then the interviewer pointed out, but the payoff he made to her as part of the nondisclosure agreement was right before the election. it was during the presidential campaign. and he sounds like - perkins sounds like he's willing to give the president a pass because it didn't happen during the presidency.
and i look at these decisions and, in the moment, can somewhat understand why a mid-level official might say we have to follow policy and procedure. but in the middle of a crisis, turning to bureaucratic rulebooks is not the way to address this, and that has left the u.s. just a step behind at every step of the way.

it's one of the challenges of really loving this is us that, although it has done some wonderful work — especially with randall, beth, and randall's father william — it can't quite escape the taste for a gotcha that's dogged it since the pilot. sometimes, that means really nifty moves that sneak up on viewers and give them the best kind of emotional startling. but sometimes, as here, it lowers the effectiveness of rebecca pulling up to the house, because it's hard not to look for loopholes. things like toby flatlining last season and then just sort of ... being fine? those things start to set this is us up to be the show that cried wolf. so while you now probably know what happened to jack, keep your wits about you.

boudin: the problem with money bail, for those who aren't familiar with it, is that it puts a price tag on freedom. it says to someone who is wealthy that no matter how dangerous you are, you can buy your way out. and it says to someone who is poor that no matter how frivolous the charges against you - no matter how innocent you may be, no matter how strong your ties to the community and how low risk you may be, because of your poverty, you're going to languish behind bars.

ives gives more answers than short-story writers tend to. she's done with the enlightenment; she rolls her narratorial eyes at the inching progress of women's liberation, so called; she sees in the animal kingdom a set of role models for worrying less over the fact that everything is possible, and working to live more simply, even as human complication hovers infinitely at the edges. her conclusions are deft and persuasive; she frames them less as revelations, which would be the standard short-fiction choice, than as primal knowledge unearthed by bizarre circumstance. i'd move to her weird cosmos any day.

it's a shame that the story isn't built better, because the cast is solid and both heigl and chalke have good moments, particularly in the chronologically last section where the styling is less distracting. chalke is a solid comic actress, and kate's somewhat nervous exploration of her middle-aged sexuality is fun to watch, if not particularly new. heigl understands tully, i think, as a character built on a series of disappointments, and i wish the script gave the character more of a chance to build rather than just react, react, and react to individual events.
legend: well, i think those spats probably didn't advance anything one way or the other. i think they embarrassed the president, and i think he definitely took an l in the situation (laughter) kind of in the twittersphere and in the eyes of public opinion. and i think it was probably entertaining for a lot of people, and it just further showed what a crappy human being he is on every level, but he shows that every day. but what it actually did - it highlighted the town hall, which was what got him (laughter) so riled up in the first place, that we didn't praise him specifically in the town hall. the town hall was about criminal justice reform.

for anderson, trump's pivot was no surprise. despite the signals that he might be friendly to the lgbtq community, anderson says, the general stance that trump had taken was, 'look, i'm going to be a friend to social conservatives. i'm going to be a friend to evangelicals and catholics.'

other stories trouble human existence without fretting over secularity. in louise nevelson, the narrator, grumbling over how thoroughly my life has been defined by my female status, declares defiantly, i am one of the animals. i live among the other human animals and am one of them. nothing animal is outlandish to me — a assertion she seems to hope will, somehow, help her escape the infinite expectations placed on women. (spoiler: it does not.) in bitter tennis, the narrator leads a regular new york life while claiming to live on the bottom of the ocean, among the bristlemouths, the viperfish, the anglerfish, the cookiecutter sharks, the eelpouts. to what extent, the story asks, is her life a full human one? can you lead a complete human existence while thinking of yourself partly as an animal?

she was born in 1956 to two huge stars — the singer eddie fisher and award winning actress debbie reynolds, andrew says. from a certain slant being born to two famous people — who ended up famously divorcing — can be tragic. time passes, and it has to be funny.
we'd seen their wedding in the movie's prologue in a prison, when nuri, serving time for drug dealing, leaves his fellow prisoners with whoops and back slaps and saunters to a makeshift reception area and a joyous bride. only a few years later, he has a successful, legitimate business and an adorably bespectacled child who sits in his dad's office, reading a book explaining the concept of empathy, which he pronounces empa-tee (ph). no doubt the irony is purposeful. a few minutes later, empathy is vaporized.

lucinda franks: i certainly hadn't planned to end up with a much older man. my dream had always been to find a person my own age, with my own interests. i was in my mid-twenties and a journalist for the new york times when i interviewed the district attorney of new york, robert morgenthau. he was about 53 at the time. i was a hippie, and he was an icon of the establishment. one night, he asked me on a date. i thought he wanted to sell me a story, but he had other ideas. he asked me to a party at arthur schlesinger's house on behalf of jimmy carter, who was running for president. i dressed up in my best silk-patterned blouse, my bell-bottoms and my platform shoes. we walked into the schlesinger home, and there were these women in silk and satin. they looked at me like i was homeless. i turned around and started to walk out the door, and i walked right into jackie kennedy onassis. everyone looked at jackie like she was a god — their jaws dropped and they couldn't stop smiling. i looked up at bob and he was smiling, too, but not at jackie. the rest is history. we've been together now for 38 years.

white's voice — with its distinctive rasp and sweetness — is its own revelation. this song was an anthem, white said in 2018. it separated me from the pebbles and the janet jacksons and the jody watleys i was being compared to. the daughter of a beautician and a real estate agent who played trumpet on the side, the former cheerleader had sung background for sheena easton and julio iglesias. inspired by heroes diana ross, liza minelli, tina turner and sammy davis jr., white peels off thrillingly awkward, un-rhyming lyrics with bold sorrow —
the album also foregrounded her gift for sharp and vivid lyrics. the lie of love, a hazy ballad she co-wrote with barry reynolds, condenses the detail of a literary novel about a loveless marriage, between two rich-but-miserable people, into four minutes of bitter cynicism and listless ennui. she's passive on pills, he's vicious on booze, she sings, with a tone of pensive resignation. many of cristina's songs highlighted the emptiness at the center of wealthy decadence with a snarky glee, but the lie of love plays this theme as more of a tragedy. she didn't like these characters, but she certainly pitied them.

nutritionists i've talked to said it's not the healthiest snack, but it is healthier than, say, greasy junk food that they might get in arena concessions — fried food, hamburgers, whatever the case may be — particularly if there's just a little bit of hunger before a game. and then you dive a little bit into the science of it, and peanut butter and jelly is comprised of various components that humans enjoy, dating back to basically the neanderthals when they were craving certain things for survival. different kinds of fats and proteins and starches and what not, and this marriage of all these essential components are combined into pb&j. so when you ingest one, when you bite into one, these varied opioids are released. you're happy, most people kind of recognize that.

in the universe of popular music, this album exploded like a brand new sun. it took aretha franklin eleven songs to shift the canon of am radio away from the realm of girlish glee to the cataclysms of womanly love. i never loved a man connected with black and white audiences and became the biggest commercial success of her building career. on this atlantic records debut, franklin trucks confidently in the desires of a modern-day woman. in a word, she's real — plain-spoken and passionate, without guile or undue glamour. the album has funky rhythms, of course. and horns. and some of the most memorable hooks in popular music. franklin's re-imagining of the otis redding single respect is now on the national recording registry of the library of congress, reportedly as a feminist anthem. but the song is also redolent of black consciousness and pride. and yet, it's franklin's renderings of vulnerability in love that make the album universal. the title track was her first million-seller. she also wrote or co-wrote some of the best-known songs of her career for the release, including baby, baby, baby and dr. feelgood. for better or worse, each song here sounds like she lived it. producer jerry wexler called the famously private franklin our lady of mysterious sorrows. —gwen thompkins (wwno)

devi: (through interpreter) there are so many abuse cases, often involving fathers-in-law or brothers-in-law. it's different from the city. in villages, abusers can hide behind their families. victims, if they speak out, taint the whole village's honor.
prof. winston: well, they do a lot of good works. the army has 8,000 centers around the united states that do everything from day care to group homes, to medical work to rehab, to social service delivery. they assisted 30 million people last year. they served 70 million meals. they're really on the front of social service delivery. they were there with katrina; they've been there for disaster relief. they often are unheralded because we may not see them, given the lives you and i might lead, but they're actually on the ground, in the communities helping people.
reynolds' career stretched for decades. in that time, she starred in more than 50 films, including the musical singin' in the rain, as well as two broadway shows and two tv series. as if that weren't enough, reynolds also recorded a no. 1 hit single in 1957: tammy, the theme song to one of her greatest successes at the box office, the film tammy and the bachelor.
shelley says the splc's brand promise is broken.
the question of religious freedom — and how it should apply to muslims — was also part of the discussion at the convention. at one point, john wofford, a pastor from arkansas, stood up to ask why a southern baptist should support the right of muslims living in the united states to build mosques when, as wofford put it, these people threaten our very way of existence as christians and americans?

later the former alabama chief justice said he did not recall ever dating a girl in her late teens and agreed that it would have been inappropriate.
gross: if you're just joining us, my guest is katy tur, and she covered the donald trump presidential campaign for msnbc and nbc. now she's written a memoir about it called unbelievable. we're going to take a short break then we'll be right back. this is fresh air.
and sure, maybe it could work in some cases anyway, but a lot has to go well. you know, you don't know this person. you don't even know if you like them. everything has to function. and you need emotional and mental involvement for that to happen. and then maybe that's possible with time. maybe two young people could still have a chance to get to know each other and build some trust and maybe discover their bodies in that moment, even though they've always been disconnected from them. but as soon as the community gets involved and puts this sacred pressure on the couple, it must be done; otherwise, your holy duty has not been fulfilled. that chance goes up in smoke, and it doesn't end well.
elving: yes, a turning point in the court's history to be sure. kennedy had often been the swing vote between the court's liberal and conservative blocs, although he usually voted with the conservatives and did so in all the major cases decided in the waning days of this court term. still, his replacement will almost surely be more doctrinaire and less tolerant on issues such as abortion rights and certainly same-sex marriage. i mean, kennedy wrote the decision in four key cases establishing gay rights in america over the last several years. but he also wrote the citizens united decision that has brought more corporate and union and super pac money into campaigns.
with wedding halls closed and public gatherings forbidden to prevent the spread of the virus, many couples have celebrated their marriage in alleyways and apartments — so grooms can save the fortune they're normally expected to spend on big parties.
santa maria is an optician in boston and she sold her car when she moved there. she still goes into the office during the pandemic, but even if she didn't need to, she says she would still ride the train because she can explore the city and it makes her feel less lonely.
sagal: i do have to ask you about what i think is your most famous role out of the many, many, many films you've done, which is, of course, fatal attraction. and that was the first time that you had played a villain - right? - because the roles that you were before were very heroic. you were like the force of good in the natural. and so was it - i imagine it must have been fun to play a psychopath.
for me, as a scientist, one of the ways it's specifically brilliant is its exploration of the human capacity for genius, that rare flash of excellence and what its possession demands. whether its science, art, or comedy — genius just happens. an invitation to consider those happenings, is one of the gems the marvelous mrs. maisel offers.

chozick: i think this is one of, terry, one of the biggest surprises of this campaign is that young women have shown no reflective gender allegiance. and i think that the clinton campaign really thought that they would. and not only have they - not only have they gotten behind bernie sanders, but they seem to be - and of course some of them have come around after the primary, but during the primary, they weren't just for bernie sanders. they were in revolt against hillary clinton. they thought that she shouldn't, you know, think she's going to - she'd get it just because she's a woman.

i would not have said anything about mr. trump, never — i would never have said anything if he didn't call himself a christian. it'd be none of my business whatsoever to make any comments about his language, his vulgarities, his slander of people, but i was deeply troubled ... that here's a man who holds up a bible one day, and calls a lady bimbo the next. here's a man who calls himself a christian and yet just has the audacity to make fun of a lady's menstrual cycle. ... he didn't just do this on occasion, but repeatedly, unrepentantly. somebody sent me a list of 64 people he's called loser. just this week it's continued. ...

i'm an independent woman with financial stability who is still discovering her voice in many ways. i'm scared that dating an older man would interfere with this process of self-discovery because they have already found their voice or, at least, are more settled in a version of who they are. i'm concerned about what effect such a power dynamic will have on me.
but the growing number of saudis seeking refuge abroad undermines prince mohammed's international image as a leader bringing new personal freedoms to the kingdom, says 30-year-old samah damanhoori. she was granted asylum in the united states last year after she accused her family of abuse and declared she was no longer a muslim.
we don't need our teachers and principals going to work in fear, she said. what we need is another mother who's willing to do what's right. whose bravery can live up in equal measure to my mom's.

when i found out about the ex talk, i absolutely had to read it (even though, as a rule, i don't love contemporary romances) because it's set at a pacific northwest public radio station. office rivals shay and dominic — she's a veteran producer, he's a cocky j-school grad who won't shut up about his master's degree — end up having to pose as exes to host a new dating and relationships show for their struggling station. naturally, they fall for each other.
i mean, she is not a person like bill clinton who just, you know, pours himself out on the rope line. she's not a politician like president obama who can give a soaring oratory. i mean, her best setting is a tiny policy roundtable with six people where she's hearing about their problems and prescribing policy solutions. and so i think that this is all - yes, she's been in the public eye forever. but at the same time, her friends over and over describe her as a deeply private person. i mean, it's stunning that she's now running against a reality tv star because she is a person who has tried desperately to keep parts of her life private.
hey, y'all. from npr, i'm sam sanders, it's been a minute. so we talk to a lot of actors and singers and performers on this show. many of them have won awards, but very few of them have achieved the award status our next guest has. he is an egot, one of maybe 20 or so in the world ever. an egot is someone who has won an emmy, a grammy, an oscar and a tony. today's guest has won all of those awards. you could call his career legendary. i am talking about john legend. please admire my pun.
now the part of the show where we invite on respected people and industry leaders and subject them to an embarrassing quiz. it's called not my job. comedian neal brennan has gone from working the door at comedy clubs to writing and co-creating the emmy-nominated chappelle's show on comedy central. he has a new netflix special out now called 3 mics. it's funny and emotionally raw. critics love it. i personally love it. i know that you will love it. neal brennan, welcome to wait wait... don't tell me.
with tapestry, carole king cemented her place as one of the key architects of 20th-century popular music. here, she fully claims the spotlight, not only as a top-notch composer, but as a deeply soulful lyricist and singer. considered her crowning achievement by critics, record sales of over 25 million confirmed that the public agreed. from i feel the earth move to you've got a friend, the track list is a veritable master class in pop standards with king, one of america's most dependable hitmakers, flexing in a new genre. with her unadorned piano wrapped in plainspoken lyrics about the pulls of kinship and self-actualization, it's no wonder the record stands the test of time as not only a bedrock in the singer-songwriter genre but also as the soundtrack of suburban feminism of the early 1970's. king's evolution as both an artist and woman are perhaps most evident in the grown-up version of will you love me tomorrow? that appears on tapestry. the first major writing credit for the then-teenaged king and lyricist husband gerry goffin, which hit no. 1 for the shirelles in 1961, is transformed from a girl's yearning question into the bittersweet doubts of a woman wise enough to know that even true love doesn't always last til the night meets the morning sun. —jill sternheimer (lincoln center)
moore: oh, do i. it was freezing cold. it was in minneapolis in january, i think, or february. and we didn't know what we were doing. we were just there to grab a lot of footage that shows a young woman's exuberance being in a new city, looking around, gazing at the sights. and i had in my hand a hat, a little beret that my aunt had given me for christmas. and i had packed that along with whatever other warm things that i had, which weren't too many because i was a californian, to go to minneapolis to do these film spots. and jim brooks said, oh, i have a good idea, mary. take that hat, put it on your head and now run into the intersection. and it'll be all right. we'll watch for cars. and (laughter) throw it up in the air as if to say this is my town and i'm celebrating my life that is taking place. and i did it and luckily, magically, wasn't hit by a car, although i got some pretty strange looks. and in fact, in - i guess it must be in every episode you can see this one woman in the background who looks at me as if not only am i the world's strangest person but that she would like to personally lock me up.
there is, and you could sense that, you could almost taste it. there's an angst in the country, and i think there's a fear. i think there's a fear of we don't know what's next. and i've tried, maybe you can help me, i've tried to put my finger on the root of this fear. i feel like really we're better off than we were eight years ago, 10 years ago in many ways. there's certainly things we can do better at, but the economy is somewhat stable. we're not engaged in the level of international conflict that we've been involved; still, you would think we were. there's just a level of anxiety.
as a result, tinker's string of hits and creative tv triumphs, either as a production executive or network chairman, included not only the mary tyler moore show, but hill street blues, st. elsewhere, cheers, the cosby show and others. many of those shows weren't just critical and popular successes. they were groundbreakers an envelope pushers. the dick van dyke show had been the smartest tv sitcom of the '60s and became the model for the mary tyler moore show, premiering on cbs in 1970. in that series, mary tyler moore ended up playing mary richards, a single, working woman, at a time when that was a quietly, but clearly feminist premise for a tv sitcom.
cashin: exactly, exactly. white supremacy is kind of remarkable, right? and if you think - what george wallace represented, in - you know, may he rest in peace, he changed, you know. my mother voted for him by the time that - you know, in his last iteration, he changed. and actually (laughter) george wallace started out as a racial liberal, and then he didn't want to get out-nigra'd (ph) as - that's his famously - but, you know, white supremacy forced people throughout the history of our country to decide where are you - what are you going to do with this line? what side are you going to be on? are you willing to subvert it? are you willing to go against this, you know? and at that point, wallace and, you know, white supremacy democrats in the state were trying to hold on to this idea.
but you still think there's a place for it.
but what we have done is we've been very clear the family leader's calling balls and strikes. we've cheered him on for different policy decisions that we think are really good for this country. but we've also called him out on things that we believe is not the appropriate rhetoric. it's not that we won't invite president trump. and maybe after this (laughter) - maybe after this interview, i'll make the decision - let's also extend an invitation to president trump.
klein: so each mic has a specific style of performance that you're doing into that mic.
as to whom president-elect trump might pick and what the process will be, we know at once a lot and a little.
the clintons did a tremendous amount for this state, said little rock mayor mark stodola, a democrat. stodola says that the clinton presidential library has brought billions of dollars to arkansas and that bill clinton remains an active presence, staying in the apartment atop the library nearly every month.

minhaj: oh, my god. it's the toughest show i've ever done in my life. it's really, really hard. you have been invited to their dinner. it's a dinner for journalists honoring journalists. and then you come in at the end, and you make fun of them. so it's very difficult. also, you know, there's representatives on both sides of the aisle. so there's a lot of groans in places that you normally wouldn't get groans. i worked on the set in comedy clubs, and people were cheering and wooing. that's not what i got when i got in that room.
here i was making what i thought was this very original argument that ... normalizing adult women's independence from the marital institution ... was one of the ways in which women were getting closer to social and economic and sexual equality. ... and one of the great humbling experiences in my research was, first of all, discovering that there were lots of women in the 19th century who were making this exact argument in the popular press.

gross: (laughter) so were you chosen to do that part because you're not nasty?

tonight marks dakhabrakha's return to globalfest and tiny desk. the ukranian band's first globalfest performance was in 2014, and their 2015 tiny desk concert remains a favorite. we've had them in our spaces, so it's a real treat to see them in theirs, the dakh theater in kiev. coming together, their performance maintains the energy and joy that define their music, bouncing off each other musically and emotionally. dakhabrakha aims to keep ukraine's musical and storytelling tradition alive by making it more accessible to a younger, international audience, a kind of self-proclaimed ethno-chaos. they craft stunning sonic worlds for traditional songs, reinventing their heritage with a keen ear for contemporary resonances.

in the end, republicans recognize that they may be better off without having to deal with moore in their caucus.
gross: yeah. the song is all about denial. sally bowles is in denial that she's pregnant and is probably going to have an abortion. this means the end of her relationship with her lover, who is also bisexual. that was not necessarily going to go well anyways. and she's in denial that the nazis are taking over germany. and it's not going be a fun time. things are on the verge of not only collapse, but destruction. so, you know, you get that in the show, but, yes, when people sing it out of context, it's like, yeah, isn't life fun?

paul boger of mississippi public broadcasting reported thursday on the state senate debate over the bill. the vote broke down along party lines, boger reports, with republicans in favor and democrats vocally dissenting:
i was interested in ... the idea of race as something that is both fictional and also something that is real. ... the idea that these twins are identical and one essentially becomes white because she declares herself to be white and one is black because she does not do that. there is an aspect of that that reveals how flimsy those categories are. if you can transgress them through performance, if you can perform whiteness and become white through that performance, then what does it actually mean to be white or black or anything?
sagal: well, grab your presidential medal of freedom and use its power.

it's only been a little over a decade that our own movement has come to understand homosexuality and gender identity in different ways, says rabbi jacob blumenthal, ceo of the rabbinical assembly, an international association of rabbis in the conservative tradition.
and when you think about, you know, how long jeff sessions is likely to be attorney general and what his influence is likely to be during the two, four or whatever years he serves, it's a fraction of what the judges can do on the supreme court. but liberals have just never engaged in similar numbers and with similar passion to conservatives about the supreme court. another difference is liberals tend to organize in issue-type groups, is that there are civil liberties groups - the american civil liberties groups. there are environmental groups - the sierra club. there are children's rights groups. there's the children's defense fund. they don't mobilize as a movement involving law together. and that's something that conservatives have learned to do. and that's - that has really diffused the power of liberals when it comes to the supreme court.

he also embraced political parties vehemently. he came to see that if you don't attack the law and you don't find a way to change the power at the base of slavery, you would never destroy it. so he's moving - not only moving away from garrison. he's moving full force into the politics of antislavery. it's not going to be a smooth ride, by any means, through the 1850s. but by '51 and '52, he's become a thoroughgoing political abolitionist believing in political parties, believing in political activism.
albright: i have to say, on the whole issue of daca, he has so many things wrong that i wonder whether he is deliberately lying or whether he really doesn't understand the issue. and he just says whatever is on the top of his head because i heard that statement and i thought, seriously? i mean, you know, or you should know, what daca is about - and then also blaming the democrats for the problem when that definitely is not the answer. so i do think this is the issue that we have to be so careful about.

blight: yes. that's a fascinating aspect of his life because he undergoes a kind of ideological, strategic, even intellectual transformation. in the late 1840s, early 1850s, i think it's the first great transformation of his public life. he also had quite a breakdown in this period. he could barely make ends meet for his family. he's trying to be the self-made man who could not provide. but he embraced, for example, things like the possible uses of violence.

moore refused to concede tuesday night, saying that his campaign would wait on god and let this process play out. he pointed to the uncertain write-in totals he believed could still change the outcome and trigger a recount. however, there has to be a difference of 0.5 percent or less between the two candidates to trigger an automatic recount, and with almost all the votes in, jones' margin of victory was about three times that.

at the same time, there are also low-level bureaucratic failures that are enough to make a person cry. there was a new york times story this week about the team in seattle of flu researchers who wanted to use their research to help uncover where coronavirus might be spreading, but because of complicated regulations, they were not technically supposed to use their data that had been collected for the flu to also search for coronavirus. and they tried for weeks to get permission from local leaders, from national leaders, especially, and just couldn't get it. they were being passed from bureaucrat to bureaucrat. finally, they went ahead and helped uncover the seattle coronavirus outbreak but then were told to knock it off.

i derive unbelievable pleasure from writing dialogue for sharon and then hearing her say it. i do think that one thing the show did well is it's a pretty evenly balanced yin and yang of male and female energy, because it's written by, and produced by, and stars one man and one woman who were slogging away in the same dirty little office to make it.
struthers: (singing) laying in bed, listen to the sound of you in the kitchen turning beans into crown's cream walls, curdling the morning sun. thought i was awaking to a world in white. something about the kind covering up that light tells me spring has come. winter's warm and summer's snow wrapped up in this lovers glow. time is still a pass right through. each season comes down to you.
my husband wants to stay married and get better. he has confessed to his family, my family, and some of our friends the same information that he has confessed to me. he is seeing a therapist, and i have gone with him three times. lately, he's turned back to healthier distractions in his life: running, doing yoga daily and reading regularly. but how do you recover from something like this?

the analysis confirms previous public health findings that abstinence-only education programs don't succeed in reducing rates of teen pregnancies or stds. moreover, public health data indicate that such programs have little demonstrated efficacy in helping adolescents to delay intercourse, the authors write.
now i literally just get to put together every kind of good idea i ever had and make this new creature called me, the dad version. and he will be amazing, right, and also will mess up constantly. but so what? he's still better than the one who wasn't there at all. i mean, he's still better than that. so almost no matter what, i feel like i'm giving myself at least a b+. so...
sitting in today is lucinda franks, a reporter and author of the memoir timeless: love, morgenthau, and me, which tells the story of her marriage to a man who is 27 years her senior.
from the rowman & littlefield book description: drawing on established scholarship on the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality, asian american sexual politics shows how power dynamics shape the lives of young asian americans today. asian-american women are often constructed as hyper-sexual docile bodies, while asian-american men are often racially 'castrated.' the book's interview excerpts show the range of frames through which asian americans approach the world, as well as the counter-frames they construct. in the final chapter, author rosalind s. chou offers strategies for countering racialized and sexualized oppression.

everything about les appealed to joy. he was very thoughtful and generally quiet but had a wicked sense of humor.
in country music, the decade has been dominated by youthfully suave, masculine displays of flirtation — or, to put it another way, by songs and performances that tend to feel like low-stakes stuff. that's a far cry from an outlook that country was known for throughout much of its modern commercial history: a tragic view of the world, well suited to openly anguished singing and accompaniment by weepy steel guitars and fiddles.
obama: 'reject cynicism and reject fear' and elect hillary clinton
garcia-navarro: what is your response to them when they say that?
we do not scare easily, biden said. we never bow, we never bend, we never break when confronted with crisis. no, we endure, we overcome, and we always, always move forward. that's why i can say with absolute conviction, i am more optimistic about our chances today than when i was elected as a 29-year-old kid to the senate.
cardinal timothy dolan was reportedly the first to respond, noting how often he speaks on the phone to the president. trump was delighted and announced he would watch cardinal dolan's online service the next day at st. patrick's cathedral in new york. on the following monday, dolan was interviewed on fox news.

identified as the world's worst jailer of journalists in 2014 and 2015. china was holding 49 journalists in 2015; that number was down to 38 last year and eclipsed only by turkey (81), as erdogan moved to consolidate power and repress opposition. china is ranked near the bottom (176 out of 180) in the world press freedom index, beat out only by syria, turkmenistan, eritrea and north korea. ... clamping down on access to the internet and censoring it. google left the country last year despite the huge potential market because of it ... lack of religious freedom. uighur muslims, for example, are labeled extremists and terrorists; families of tibetan self-immolators have been punished; 1,500 crosses have been torn down from church steeples; a small chinese jewish community has been harassed and prevented from worshiping together. china only has five licensed religions: buddhism, catholicism, islam, protestantism and taoism.

kurtis: well, she's still a winner. you got two out of three.
i think the military is the great exception to our loss of trust in institutions, because i think that it is still clear to us that the military is formative, that it shapes the people within it and takes one kind of human being and produces another. we've lost the sense that many of our other institutions do that, because i think in some respects we don't expect them to do that in the way we used to.
the marketing materials for the only child promised it would keep me guessing until the last page, but that didn't happen — at least not in the way the publicity department intended. i did keep wondering if it would read differently in its original language, and circling back to the conundrum of things lost in translation. but even then, i think the novel's structure doesn't allow for that many thrills.

my little sister has been missing since nov. 23, 2013, the woman wrote in an email. she married a farmer in a remote village and was abused by her husband shortly after her marriage. she escaped from him after a few abuses.
mason: well, it began first in the late 19th century. so the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints had began practicing polygamy beginning in the 1850s, or at least began that the public practice of plural marriage. and the federal government began to pass a series of laws that were increasingly punitive. and church leaders sent a number of families to settle in northern mexico, also in canada, with the hope of escaping some of this federal prosecution. so that was the first wave of settlers, actually led by church leaders.

the power of journalism is that it offers us a process of verification and confirmation and affirmation that lets us believe what we're told. so the loss of trust in journalism, i think, has in part to do with a general collapse of trust and expertise. but it also has to do with the way that some professional journalists have allowed themselves to be pulled out of the institutions that empower them with that kind of trust and to stand on a platform on their own, building their own brands — on social media and on cable news — offering opinion in ways that are very hard to tell apart from the professional work they do, and making it hard for people to know if they should be trusted.
so how did you and phil spector meet up? i mean, my initial reaction was, wow, that doesn't seem to - that seems like a really unusual musical fit because, you know, my first thought was, like, phil spector - girl groups, the ronettes, darlene love. then i was thinking, well, phil spector did produce music by john lennon later on. and he produced a leonard cohen album. so what brought you together with him?
npr could not independently verify the recordings, but their contents appear to be damning.
gross: so i want to get back to donald trump. your book ends with these words - donald trump went on to washington. he may or may not still be there by the time you read these words. i'll add, he's still there. and then you write, there's a pretty good case that he didn't want to go in the first place, didn't like it when it got there and wished for a way back into his old life that didn't involve scandal or shame. do you often wonder if donald trump actually wants to be president now, if he's sorry that he got into this?
ellen harper, ben harper, welcome to fresh air. it's a pleasure to have you on our show. i want to start with a song. it's called a house is a home. and it's from the album of duets that you recorded together called childhood home. you recorded this in 2013. it was released in 2014. and, ben, this was when you decided you wanted to do an album of duets with your mother. what made you decide to do that?

but the show offers something more than just a tired trope about genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration. instead, it also unpacks the capacity for genius to simply erupt unbidden with all the chaos that can follow. i don't want to give away plot details but, more than once, maisel's raw talent for stand-up makes its appearance, not in a well crafted, finely honed tight-ten, but as an on-stage inspiration that wells up out of her. and, more than once, that eruption sweeps away finely crafted plans and hopes.
the house speaker, mike hubbard, had been convicted of misusing his office for personal financial gain last summer. and then we had chief justice roy moore of the alabama supreme court removed from the bench because he was defying federal court orders on same-sex marriage. so overall, it was a rough year for alabama politics.

that said, the army here in america, for a long time, tried not to be activist but in recent years, it has run into this issue regarding gay rights. and specifically, in 2001, the army sought an exception from discriminating against the lgbt community in hiring, and it told the bush administration that it would support the faith-based initiative if they could have that guarantee.

a similar rationale was put forth by the 2nd circuit in the altitude express, inc. v. zarda case. as the american bar association said last spring, indeed, the court found that sexual orientation is doubly delineated by sex because it is a function of both a person's sex and the sex of those to whom he or she is attracted.
but while many people might be jumping into marriage, catherine cohan, a penn state psychologist, wagers in the long run, there'll be a lot more breakups.
stabenow: well, there's checks and balances in the united states senate, and republican colleagues chose not to participate in advice and consent and move forward to even have a hearing on president obama's nominee. as republicans now move forward on president trump's nominee, we will participate in questions and investigate positions and then cast our votes. and if the person does not reflect what is best about america, there will be a great deal of opposition. but we will certainly take it step by step.

chozick: it's interesting, terry, because i watched in her 2008 campaign when gender was very much not mentioned. she was running as the strong commander in chief. she didn't talk about being a mother. frankly, she didn't talk very much about her own mother who was alive then and campaigned with her. this campaign, she has very much talked about her mother who passed away and her impoverished childhood. and i think, you know, it has not been lost in hillary clinton the significance of this moment.
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. my guest, ellen harper, grew up in the 1950s and '60s surrounded by folk music icons, immersed in songs about unions and civil rights, as well as blues, hymns and gospel music. her parents founded the folk music center in claremont, calif, east of la. ellen has worked there much of her life in addition to having been a professor of education at cal state in san bernardino and singing and playing with several bands. she runs the center now.

no one questioned that barack obama's heart was always in the right place on gay rights, socarides said. he just needed the pressure that we put on him and the political support. what seemed like someone who was not willing to act so boldly, to now we see it's probably one of the most important parts of his legacy.

buttigieg: well, i think that that perspective, it's so simplifying and i think not fair to a diversity of views among african americans and among a lot of people who are democrats who may have come up in a socially conservative background but are also on a journey, as the country is. you know, right here in south bend, we didn't know what would happen when i came out. we knew it was a fairly democratic city but also a socially conservative city. and i was just - i was ready, and it was time. and we did it in a reelection year. and i wound up getting 80% of the vote. it was better that time than i did the first time around.

i've spent a lot of time over the past weeks trying to understand why rodham is such an upsetting novel. there's the sheer invasiveness of the project, of course (can you imagine the real clinton reading about herself having sex or, for that matter, having ritual predebate diarrhea?). and then there's the way it asks you, in those early chapters, to fall for bill, only to bring you up short with your own hypocrisy: is alleged sexual predator bill clinton really any better than alleged sexual predator donald trump? sittenfeld asks. or is he just more charming?
conan: here's an email from matt(ph) in san francisco: i'm 28 years old. my parents paid for my tuition, room and board in college, which was a huge help. i have transitioned into a successful accounting career. after six years of college, i can't imagine having $20,000 to $30,000 worth of debt that some of my peers have - or upwards of $100,000 for those earning an advanced degree. however, how are we ever going to save up for our homes?
akhavan: i don't know what people think about me. it's none of my business. in terms of the word bisexual, i hate the word bisexual. and that's why i feel committed to keep saying it about myself because it's factually true. and i guess i want to push myself to say like, well, do i hate the stigma around that word? can i reappropriate the stigma around the word? we were talking earlier, you asked me - so the working title of my tv series was the bisexual.
mayer: so this was when pence was in congress in 2009. he really did the kochs a big favor. there was legislation pending that might have put a tax on carbon pollution, and it would have been terrible for koch industries. and pence took up the cause and tried to help defeat that legislation and specifically carried around a pledge that the kochs had created, trying to get people to sign it. and after he was successful in that, the kochs invited him to come to their secret donor summits. and at that point on, they started showering him in money. so it was - it's really became a working relationship then. and i hadn't realized that until recently.

still, reynolds made a handful of big-screen appearances before she landed her big break: the lead role in the 1952 musical singin' in the rain. reynolds, then just 19 years old, was perfect for the part of kathy selden, but for one rather glaring detail — reynolds did not know how to dance at the time she was cast.
falk: i think they're both narcissists. they probably have substance-abuse problems to a certain extent. they're both pretty good at their jobs, but they're incredibly self-involved and are sort of completely uninterested in their own psychology — or, in jimmy's case, too interested in his own psychology.

certainly. so much depends on location, preferences of certain players. the lakers have theirs catered by whole foods, the san antonio spurs have theirs catered by heb central market which they have a partnership with in san antonio. you go up to portland: half of their peanut butter and jelly sandwich order is toasted because the star player damian lillard likes them that way. you go up to milwaukee and they're kind of one of the more interesting operations in the nba. they do a pb&j buffet before the games, but the variety of nut butters and nutella, all kinds of jams and jellies, different kinds of bread — they do peanut butter and jelly shakes, peanut butter and jelly oatmeal, waffles.

but then one day, about 10 years into the marriage, when les was 31, he came home, and strangely, joy says, he smelled different. his lovely male musk smell had got this overpowering sort of nasty yeast smell, she says.
and it just - i was struck by how recent that decision was and just the idea that at that time 39 years ago, we might not have been able to be married. and learning about this really resonated with me. so i've always sort of taken note of loving day which is june 12 every year since then, and we wanted to do something special to commemorate the 50-year anniversary.
chozick: no. i don't think secretive means - has anything to do with gender. i really don't. and i also think you can't approach every story thinking is this word going to be interpreted as sexist, you know? i mean, she's running for president. if she's being secretive by keeping a private server in her basement in chappaqua, i don't think that has to do with gender. and i think that you can't walk on eggshells, you know, afraid of that. i mean, that said, you know, we have to be conscious when we describe her hair, her clothes, but we do that for men as well. you know, we describe men's clothes all the time.
lavalle: ...just so that he could avoid being near them.
so anyway, he's the guy that introduced me to phil spector. i ran into him in the late '70s out in hollywood - ran into hilburn, that is. and i asked him what he was up to. and he said he was working on a book on phil spector, and he was up at his house every night interviewing him. and he said, do you want come up there with me? and i said, well, phil spector would know me from adam. and he said, well, he was quoting your song donald & lydia the other night. and i said, really? and i said, well, i'll come up there and say hello. so i went up there, and it turns out it was just around the time that he'd produced the leonard cohen record, and it wasn't out yet.
a lot of negative reaction in the press too like, oh, no, the world is ruined now. the women have guns. so it was all very shocking and great because what it really - well, first of all, i'll tell you how it affected me. this sudden change in how people reacted when they recognized me was very, very pronounced. it was night and day, where before, they might say, hey, beetlejuice or something. now they were saying, oh, i have to tell you what i thought about this movie, and this is how many times i saw it. and my friend and i acted out your trip. and i'd be like, which part exactly?
is this a record? charles lloyd celebrated his 80th birthday by making this time-shifting live album in 2018, 51 years after his first live album. it finds the tireless tenor sax master boldly reinventing music he recorded as far back as 1965's dream weaver. his stunning combination of grit and grace, torrential abandon and carefully calibrated contemplation requires his much younger band members to listen just as hard as they play. a meeting of kindred spirits, indeed. –george varga
conway: well, you know, if you tell the story of your life, it is no more fanciful and no more interesting to people than all the fantasies they have about you. so you might just as well have your say on the record, too.
this is where the water gets a little deep, so we won't wade in too far. but suffice it to say that at some point in time, according to various passages in the bible, jews will be in possession of jerusalem and a new temple will be erected. thereafter will come the antichrist and a period to be known as the tribulation. it gets harrowing, but, cutting to the chase, christ himself will return to earth in triumph and glory and all true believers will be united with him in heaven.

in that first meeting with the times reporters, a second lawyer was present, by the name of stan pottinger. pottinger would play an essential role in the times' tale. he and boies are friends; their unrelated firms represent different clients with similar accusations against epstein and his associates. (pottinger did not return four messages from npr seeking comment.) though he is not nearly as prominent as boies, pottinger was a justice department official under president ford and dated gloria steinem in the 1970s and 1980s. he is now at edwards pottinger.

and so i think we do have to be careful not to think that everybody wants to be like us. and so i believe that we need to be helpful where we can, where women in countries want to have support from outsiders, and be supportive of women running for office, and try to figure out how to end domestic violence and a variety of different things. but the issue there - and it really did surprise me, i have to say - was that i gave a typically american answer. i mean, i always think that for women, the best word for us is choice. we need to be able to choose what we do with our bodies, and our lives and how we generally operate. and i was surprised that i had given a typical american answer that didn't suit anybody. and it continues to trouble me because i think we have to be careful not to mirror image. on the other hand, we need to be helpful.
i mean, when you get to chivington - colonel chivington at sand creek massacre, and the terrible orders, and the terrible outcome, and the efforts of a man called silas soule - i tried to honor him by having him in the book with a different spelling - going to proceed against this colonel and then himself being murdered a week later. i mean, you begin to think, this history is too dark. this - i can't manage it. but there's a part of you also - as i say, that novelist part of you, that very, almost disreputable, suspicious character that lurks inside you - that also thinks, well, yes, but this is an incredible thing to even to try and get half right. do you know?

matthew soerens of the evangelical refugee resettlement group world relief praised the move, noting that churchgoers of many religious denominations are eager to aid refugees, and are strongly opposed to governmental efforts that would block their ability to be a part of this sort of ministry.
john powers, byline: we hear a lot of talk about the special relationship between the united states and the united kingdom, mainly in foreign affairs, yet nowhere is the relationship more special than in television. i sometimes think pbs would have to shut down if it couldn't import shows like downton abbey and sherlock. americans are especially fond of shows that reflect britain's obsession with its national history where our shows about the past too often sink into toothless earnestness. something like the crown crackles with a sense of playfulness, of fun.

that includes inviting in an endearing young couple she met through a program for homeless at-risk youth. also their pet bunny. she says she's learned many lessons from this.
of course, the parts of this ceremony that felt modernizing were only symbolic for everyone except the couple themselves. it doesn't actually modernize the monarchy, let alone a country, to invite one minister rather than another; it doesn't change anything for poor people to have a gospel choir singing.

the novel is structured around the three rounds of the competition. each round takes place once a month and offers an opportunity for ingenuity and intrigue. (what can i say? cheaters gonna cheat.) ultimately, though, this is less a wartime version of cutthroat kitchen than what i think of as the sisterhood of the travelling pans: a heartwarming story of four women determined to make their own way in the world, who find unexpected friendship — and strength — in each other.

america's culture war, waged in recent years over gender roles, sexuality and the definition of marriage, is increasingly being fought inside evangelical christian circles. on one side are the christians determined to resist trends in secular society that appear to conflict with biblical teaching. on the other side are the evangelicals willing to live with those trends.

gross: trump has made it clear he wants low numbers. he didn't want people who tested positive from a cruise ship to be evacuated and then quarantined because the numbers would go up, and he didn't want those numbers to go up. it would look bad; it would make him look bad. so what do you think the most consequential decisions he's made so far are in terms of the virus, decisions for better or worse?
sondheim: yes, it was his best friend.
the wisconsin supreme court struck down the state's safer-at-home order in may, preventing it from enacting its phased reopening plan, though local governments can issue restrictions such as on businesses and gatherings. an executive order issued nov. 10 advises wisconsinites to stay home as much as possible and recommends individuals and businesses take additional precautions to protect public health.

along with questions about self-confidence, niceness versus meanness, and where these writers stood on feminism and sisterhood (not surprisingly, being congenital outsiders and adamant individualists, they were mostly on the sidelines), dean considers the thorny ethics and ramifications of this sort of outspoken gonzo journalism. ephron lived by her screenwriter mother's credo, everything is copy. didion put it somewhat differently: writers are always selling somebody out. malcolm was attacked for impugning the honor of journalists in the opening line of her fascinating 1989 book, the journalist and the murderer: any journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself knows that what he does is morally indefensible.

my concern is that somebody would make a decision against christianity because of mr. trump's behavior. and that's my high concern here. and to that person i would say, the way he speaks about people is not the way our master, our savior has taught us to speak; it's not the way our scriptures urge us to speak. the bible urges us to be respectful to all people, especially people with whom we have disagreements, to never libel people, to never label people. now, this is a huge deal in scripture, and so i would encourage that person, and the reason i've gone so verbal and vocal with this is because i'm protective of the reputation of christ and the church, and i would ask that person not to interpret the christian faith through the words of mr. trump.

at the same time, many african-americans did not respond in this way and were reluctant to legalize their marriages. they were unsure about what legalization could mean, how it might encourage further interference with their relationship. so there was initially some resistance, and there was some resistance even from white southerners, as well. and so you find some coercion from the federal government, from missionaries trying to enforce marriage. but again, most african-americans did want to embrace the idea of formalization and legalization of their marriages.

sondheim: the leading lady in the show is supposed to be charming and beautiful - beautiful enough, even though she's entering middle age - to be a rival to a beautiful, young 18-year-old girl. that's the idea of the triangle of the show. and we knew that in order to get somebody like that who would have charm and beauty and be able to play light comedy - because it's very elegant, the writing of the libretto. hugh wheeler's writing requires somebody who really knows how to play light comedy, and there aren't a lot of people who can do that or couldn't in those days and none now because the whole fashion had gone out.

it is here that doty unspools his teenage marriage to an older woman, ruth, with its strains and secrets, its sexual misalignment. hiding my sexuality meant hiding my body, he writes. although he escaped the horrors of aversion therapy, mental institutions, and prison, he lived through a weird, nearly total silence...an entire culture conspired to say that something evident was simply not there. it makes you crazy. doty examines his sexual life with rigor as well as a sense of wonder. he relishes the moment — insatiable — while simultaneously standing on the sidelines commentating.
but if you get into the gray zone of if a person is seeking plan b emergency contraception, under this conscience division, it certainly seems like a pharmacist could just decide - i don't want to prescribe this to you. and again, there are big, rural parts of this country where there aren't a lot of health care providers. and a single pharmacist, a single doctor might be the only conduit to getting the care that some of these patients want.

what are these sly creatures? mountweazels are fake entries deliberately inserted into dictionaries, encyclopedias, or other trustworthy reference works as traps to catch plagiarists and copyright infringements. as their name suggests, they are evasive and weaselly, distantly related to intentionally ambiguous or misleading weasel words. according to wikipedia (which may well be filled with its fair share of mountweazels), the term was coined by new yorker writer henry alford in an article in which he flagged a copyright trap in the 1975 fourth edition of new columbia encyclopedia — a bogus entry about a photographer named lillian virginia mountweazel, who (in a dead giveaway) died in an explosion while on assignment for combustibles magazine.

as the fourth of five genius children, mary's home life is tumultuous enough. she wishes only for a simple life with interesting companions, so that she might cast them all in a literary journey of her own making. her wish is granted on the first day of school, as her best-and-only friend dumps her shortly before she meets the crimson contessa, the beauty, and madam ceo (aka arden, lydia, and terry). mary warns the trio against the curly-haired, blue-eyed lothario alex ritter, a heartbreaking vronsky-type whose earlier flirtation with the beauty will undoubtedly lead to disastrous ruin that may or may not involve a train.

callahan has spun gold out of archetypes of the american west before, notably on his 2011 album apocalypse. as the title implies, shepherd is his pastoral album. the first literal definition of pastoral, of course, involves shepherding — but the word also refers to the countryside, to a literary tradition, to the sweet simplicity of an idyll, to the care and leadership of a congregation. all of those implications seem close at hand for callahan, who has attributed the pause in his output to some perfectly ordinary life events: his marriage, the birth of his son, the death of his mother. throughout the new album, you get the unmistakable sense that, for him, it feels good to be writing again. you'd get that sense even without a song called writing, which opens with the line: it feels good to be writing again.

many in their millennial generation may reject conservative thinking on social issues, but the young men who choose to be southern baptist pastors have full knowledge of the church teachings. their church mandate is somewhat limited: not to persuade the broader culture of new moral truths but rather to help their own congregants live their lives as a moral exception to the rest of society.

the result is a docuseries that humanizes dylan farrow, mia farrow and their bustling family, while allen remains an odd, distant presence. in particular, the film presents mia farrow as a concerned and attentive mother, contrasting with allen's contention that she was vindictive and angry, coaching her child to make groundless accusations. instead of an exclusive interview, allen often appears in clips from the audiobook of his 2020 memoir, apropos of nothing, which he recorded. but the clips, which reveal a sort of oblivious self-focus, aren't particularly kind to him.
one critical lesson is to pay heed to data and other forms of empirical knowledge.
ohio embarked on its phased reopening plan beginning in may, allowing certain sectors and activities to resume operations gradually. officials instituted additional restrictions, including a nightly curfew and stronger mask and gathering requirements, in november.

that is how lgbtq equality will work in the church; nothing, a glimmer, and then all at once the sun will be up & we will wonder how on earth we ever saw anything different this is a wonderful day to be alive!!! wrote calvin burke, who is gay and a student at brigham young university, which is operated by the lds church.

mixed-race asian-white women become the perfect vehicles for diversity on this show because they are white enough to present to the family, as morning said, while still being exotic enough to fill a quota. morning suggested they also get a boost from the model minority myth and the recent idea that being multiracial is cool.

for example, in 2014, many gaojiagou villagers rallied to help vacate furniture from a soon-to-be demolished restaurant. three years later, authorities decried the act as illegal demolition and arrested only six people — all relatives of zhang's.
in a 1985 interview, the legendary saxophonist sonny rollins told me the glory isn't in grasping the ring, it's in reaching for it. rollins in holland, which gathers three separate dutch settings by rollins in 1967 with bassist ruud jacobs and drummer han bennink, shows sonny's expansive ambitions and ardent pursuit with bandmates intent on pushing and hurtling cantankerously along with the leader. the late '60s are an under-documented phase of his career, yet this is more than a welcome vintage, it's a solid addition to the rollins canon. –martin johnson
psychologists disagree on whether expecting your marriage to be a deeply fulfilling relationship makes it more likely that the union will thrive, or that it will doom you to disappointment.
cruz has surged ahead of trump in some polls in the hawkeye state, and the timing of the palin endorsement seems designed to blunt that momentum. palin still has a loyal following among conservatives and tea party voters; she has visited iowa many times since her national run and has cultivated relationships in the state. her endorsement of then-state sen. joni ernst in a crowded 2014 gop senate primary was credited with helping lift the now-u.s. senator to victory.

toobin: well, leonard leo is the executive vice president of the federalist society, which is a lawyers group, a nonprofit organization, that was founded in 1982 and basically operates to bring conservative lawyers together for meetings, for panels, for conventions. and leo has become sort of the public face of the organization and someone who really is a networker extraordinaire who has learned who are the brilliant, often young, conservatives in the world and has cultivated them to have high-level government jobs and judicial appointments.
on rainbow sign, ron miles, burnished-glow cornetist-composer, assembles a stellar ensemble (jason moran, bill frisell, thomas mogan, brian blade) to crank out a hook-rich blend of improvisation and structure. the tracks span basic blues, a dark waltz, a spiritual, a riff on ethiopian pop and more, the players shifting parts and paces seamlessly, sinuously. it's a masterful album. –fred kaplan
but cruz came prepared with fiery responses, saying the only reason trump is raising the issue now is because his support in iowa and elsewhere is slipping.
big sister is emblematic of those dreams. she came from a poor farming village, eventually made it to america, continued her education there and landed an it job.
speaking from the oval office soon after kennedy's announcement, president trump said kennedy has been a great justice of the supreme court. trump also said the process to replace kennedy will begin immediately. the president pointed to a list of potential nominees he put together and made public previously. it will be somebody from that list, trump said, adding hopefully we will pick someone who is just as outstanding [as kennedy].
gross: probably better than he knew it - he probably had staff to tell him when to go someplace. but that's a lot of hours. so what was your reaction when he was actually forced out of hhs?
and he was a hit - a huge hit. and they hired him to then go out on the road as an itinerant lecturer across new england at first and eventually, within a year or two, all across the northern states.
but that only seemed to inflame palin allies. her daughter bristol wrote on the website patheos, in a blog post titled is this why people don't like cruz? that after hearing what cruz is now saying about my mom, in a negative knee-jerk reaction, makes me hope my mom does endorse trump.

ringhand: (laughter) well, it's wrong in two ways. first of all, it attributes to justice ginsburg a practice that preceded her by decades. and secondly, she did avoid answering questions, as you noted, on controversial cases in her era that included, for example, the death penalty.
reed: well, first of all, i should preface my analysis by making it clear that both i and faith and freedom coalition are strictly and assiduously neutral in the primary. i've got a lot of friends running for president, and i'm for my friends. but i think first of all, we need a reality check - he is winning a plurality of that vote. and it's impressive in a crowded field, no question about it.

legend: while i was in college, and even before i went to college, i was a choir director. so in high school, i was doing that at my home church in ohio.
monica hesse: hey. how are you?
and that's a much larger problem. you make certain assumptions as a parent. and you kind of think, at a certain point, you've figured things out. and then all of a sudden, that person that you raised and nurtured and thought that you knew is someone else completely. and, you know, that means that the sands beneath your feet are - they're not just shifting. they're sort of disappearing.
part of the reason why the phenomenon continues is because it often goes unpunished. in 2014, the human rights ngo international humanist and ethical union, which has representation at the u.n., submitted a statement to the general assembly noting that honor-related crimes are rarely investigated, and the laws against them are rarely enforced in many countries.

there are so many children now who have parents who are incarcerated. what was the experience like for you, as a child, making so many visits to see your parents in prison, being searched before going in, seeing the conditions your parents were living in? did it become a kind of normal thing for you? or was it always upsetting to see that?

toobin: well, see, now we're getting - i think - i mean, this is really the heart of the matter. i mean, which is like, well, what are - what is neil gorsuch going to do on the supreme court? why was he appointed? what are his substantive views? and here's where leo's role - i think - is enormously important because he understands the code in which a nominee and a president or the president's designees can speak that gives the president and his advisers comfort and knowledge about what his view - what the views are without tripping over into these so-called litmus tests.

while educational level is not a major factor for white newlyweds, black and latino newlyweds with at least a bachelor's degree are more likely to have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity than those with some college experience or less education. that educational gap is starkest among latino newlyweds. as the authors of the pew report, gretchen livingston and anna brown, write: while almost half (46 percent) of hispanic newlyweds with a bachelor's degree were intermarried in 2015, this share drops to (16 percent) for those with a high school diploma or less – a pattern driven partially, but not entirely, by the higher share of immigrants among the less educated.

in the case of puerto rico, again, we're at the mercy of congress. we're hoping that they're going to be merciful, but perhaps they will provide something that really doesn't respond to the needs of the island. that's why representation or democracy, it's just so basic, the very basic right of a citizen is the right to vote.
for them, one alternative is ridgewood baptist church in a working-class suburb of louisville. the pastor, matt johnson, grew up as a southern baptist, but his church is one of a group that broke from the southern baptist convention about 25 years ago. it now serves a diverse congregation, and the men and women who make up johnson's lay advisory dawnings committee advocate that it opens doors to everyday people.
such a determination would presumably be made by the courts. perhaps the most controversial provision in the equality act is a provision that claimants cannot use the religious freedom restoration act (rfra) of 1993 to challenge any application of the legislation.
mo rocca: how do you celebrate halloween? what do you get dressed as, yourself?
too bad his character concocts a conspiracy that would make people who think nasa faked the moon landing roll their eyes. the movie packs in a lot of relevant stuff - the threats posed by a surveillance state, the lack of online privacy, the morality of edward-snowden-like leakers and even the economic meltdown in greece, which factors in when bourne and an assassin get swept up in an athens riot.
president xi jinping launched the campaign in 2018 with the slogan saohei chu'e, meaning sweep away black and eliminate evil. after three years, the initiative concluded last year. china's legislature, which is convening this week, will likely hail the campaign as a smashing success: nearly 40,000 supposed criminal cells and corrupt companies busted, and more than 50,000 communist party and government officials punished for abetting them, according to official statistics. now beijing is signaling it will continue elements of the campaign.
you know, i'm not a marvel comics guy - apologies to those who are. and i didn't know that legion was an x-men character, and i have to say i'm glad i didn't because i watched the story unfold kind of on its own terms. and i wonder if you thought about that story because that's clearly the way you tell it. and are there ways you wanted to kind of diffuse the expectations that might come from people who expect him to be a superhero?
davies: a lot of the story is told visually, and there are a lot of situations where when i'm watching, suddenly the characters are transported to some other place, and we're not sure if it's real, if it's imagined, if it's a flashback. and it's unsettling and confusing maybe, but it occurred to me that it might in some way kind of simulate what he's going through when he doesn't know quite what reality is.
the state's covid-19 dashboard, which shows cases, deaths, hospitalizations and other public health data, is here.

the times sought without luck to substantiate kessler's claims last fall; online searches easily pulled up his supposedly classified documents; a coffee company denied any knowledge of him as an investor; he frequently contradicted his own assertions. (npr unsuccessfully sought to reach kessler on a mobile phone number he had used in the past. a message left with a man who said he knew him was not returned.)
so disale set out to change their mindset. when his students didn't show up to class, disale says he would go to the fields to talk to their parents. he learned their native language kannada to gain their trust and translated the curriculum from marathi, a language some students did not speak, into kannada.

most of these people were never tested for the coronavirus, and were not included in the official count until gothamist/wnyc reported on them. now the city is tallying probable cases of covid-19, along with cases confirmed by a laboratory.
one such person is the narrator of a full-service shelter, who volunteers her time at a new york animal shelter where dogs wait to be either adopted or euthanized. they knew me as one who shot reeking crap out of cages with a hose — and liked it, she proclaims. and i would rather do that than go to a movie or have dinner with a friend. the narrator recounts the indignities visited on both the dogs and the people who staff the shelter in a matter-of-fact manner; the story is heartbreaking precisely because it's so resolutely unsentimental.
but remember, terry, these things get planned well in advance. political candidates get matched up to political correspondents. we know who's running and we know who's going to cover them. high-profile people get high-profile correspondents. donald trump was not a part of anyone's plan. and for that matter, neither was i. it's a political outsider in trump. it's a political outsider in me. so they matched us together and - what they thought would have been six weeks because nobody was taking donald trump seriously. they presumed he would eventually drop out, that it was just an attention-getting stunt. they said, hey, listen, it'll be - it'll be short and then we'll send you back to london. and i signed on saying, ok, you know, if i hate it, at least it will be short. and it just never ended. he was serious and people were not laughing him off stage as some might have expected during a presidential debate. they were cheering him on. and his poll numbers only went up and up and up and up. and i suddenly found myself on a rollercoaster that i could not get off of.
'crudo' is a news novel, and a twitter novel, and the first successful trump novel.

but when we start to look under the hood, it turns out that it's almost entirely republicans and political conservatives driving this shift. democrats were 80 percent in 2015 and 77 percent in 2016. independents were 59 percent in 2015 and 58 percent in 2016, right on top of each other. but you look at republicans — republicans drop 14 percentage points between 2015 and 2016.

in other interviews with christian right publications, he said, i use my role as a u.s. senator to open the doors to power. in other words, he presents himself as representing the united states. he also, frankly, is flying into these countries on military transport, and he is this powerful u.s. senator.

sagal: all right, here is the last question, and it's about somebody you actually may know - francis ford coppola. he invented an incredibly useful device, and this is real, what was it? a - a portable static generator to fake a bad phone line so you can get off the phone if you don't want to be on the phone anymore; b - a shirt with a numbered grid on the back so you can indicate to someone exactly where to scratch your itch; or c - beer goggles goggles, which reverse the effect of inebriation on visual perception.
four of the compound residents also are charged with kidnapping a child who later died. the remains of a small child were discovered three days after the initial raid. the boy, 3-year-old abdul-ghani wahhaj, was the son of defendant siraj ibn wahhaj and had been reported missing from his home in georgia since december 2017. the search for the child led the fbi to begin monitoring the group and to the eventual raid.
the novel gets off to a somewhat slow start with a mockingly ponderous preface that, although amusing, did make me relectoblivious — that is, accidentally rereading a phrase or line due to lack of focus. no such trouble focusing once the intertwining plotlines gain momentum in their increasingly intense pas de deux.

mostly, though, mcentire focuses on telling stories of domestic betrayal in grand yet thoroughly grounded fashion. in the title track, her protagonist describes modest desires that were met, only to be dashed after she'd come to count on them. i never dreamed of wanting more than a small-town, simple life, mcentire sings, sounding subdued over a simple acoustic-guitar figure. a little money in our pockets, 'you're my husband, i'm your wife' / but then i fell in icy water, standing in the grocery line / i overheard my name and yours and one i did not recognize. she opens the chorus with an exposed, dejected high note, and punctuates her phrases with distinctive curled vowels and melodic trills, making warm, expressive use of a timbre slightly thinned by the passage of time.

(note: while both book and film share a winking meta-narrative structure, in goldman's novel, the layers of asides and inversions and formal invention are more numerous, and go deeper. it makes it the more satisfying version of the story, but also the more intentionally ambiguous, as far as endings go. if you're looking for sheer uplift — the pirate and the princess get married! the kid is less of a jerk to his grampa! — go with the movie.)

and i think in barry, it's not so much the anxiety of it. it was more of this idea that i was naturally good at impressions. and i was telling alec berg this when we were just starting, right? and i go, you know, i was always good at impressions. but i - what i always wanted to do was write and direct. i moved out to los angeles 20 years ago to be a writer-director. and i was a production assistant, and i did all these things and, you know, in a fluky way, got on saturday night live.

here's an email from mary ann(ph) in boise. my husband and i recently purchased a home without a spare bedroom to prevent his adult children -in their 20s, unmarried, uneducated, with babies - from asking to move in with us. even though they chose not to complete their college education and to have children, they expect both financial and day-care support from us. we have tried as graciously as possible to explain that these were their decisions, and they have to live with the consequences. i'm surprised to see they have many young friends, both married and single, choosing to have babies before they are financially or emotionally ready. is this a national trend?

and when i look back on what the president did or did not do, one major piece of behavior is his attack on what some might call the steady state, the career civil servants across the government who work for multiple presidents and bring expertise. the president has driven a lot of those people away. that has weakened the response across government. it has made it harder to coordinate some of these efforts. and in this current moment, there were teams that were either cut or turned away or minimized that could have been useful to fighting a pandemic.

tur: it was really difficult because this came out of nowhere. they had been doing really well. they were on top of their game. we would go to restaurants and we'd hear people talking about my dad, and they would have no idea who my dad was because my dad's face was never on television. i mean, they were, you know, a part of the fabric of los angeles. and it changed in an instant. they lost their business. they were difficult to work with. and kcbs, who they were working with at the time, got a chance to hire their employees out from underneath them and find a different helicopter to use. and so it undercut our entire business, and suddenly we were massively in debt. they weren't the kind of people who saved a lot of money.

ultimately, what we see is that mildred and richard loving were not the focus of the loving v. virginia story or of their historic moment — stories need conflict, and in regards to the issue of race this couple has none. the real story is that it took so long for a good portion of america to acknowledge legally the simple, benign reality of their love.

holmes: in either case, those who read this surreal story from kafka identified more patterns when there weren't patterns and even when there were patterns.
minhaj: yeah. the daily show oddly became the current equivalent of journalism. you - he actually would see clips of it, and he held jon in the same esteem that he would hold, you know, dan rather. so to him, he was like, oh, this is a guy who's actually doing something good for society. and i would, you know, sometimes tell him, you know, dad, you know, jon was a stand-up comedian. he's like, no, no, no, he's - this guy, he's a news anchor. he's just funny. i mean, he doesn't tell jokes to drunk people at 2 o'clock in the morning. that's what you do, ok. this guy's not a clown. he's a real - you know, the real deal. and so when i had that moment when i got the job, i wanted to share that oscar speech with jon. but all i could say was like, my dad knows you. and he's like, all right, i'm sure he does. all right, man. i'll see you later. like, jon doesn't understand the magnitude of what that meant. but for me, it was a huge deal. i had been doing stand-up 10 years, one month and nine days. and to finally have something where your parents know what it is, it was just - it meant everything to me.
gross: and i wasn't sure you'd give me a straight answer to anything. and i just want to say thank you for...
throughout the album, reo continues to explore such duality; despite the youthful exuberance of her hooky synth lines, glittering keyboard melodies and soaring harmonies, reo's head space while recording was anything but carefree. in a statement about standout single ghosting, she shared it was written during a time when i felt completely incapacitated by my own mind — my struggles with mental illness had reached an all time high, which resulted in me being too afraid to do anything. i more or less trapped myself inside the fabricated safety of my bedroom and stopped living my life.

i started trying to do king lear, but i've never performed king lear, and i realized that i just wasn't intimate enough with the play and that the play's themes didn't speak to my themes that i wanted to write about. you know, henry iv probably explores fathers and sons and masculinity and the attempt to arrive at some kind of, quote unquote, manhood or adulthood about as well as literature can do. and that was what my story was.
poundstone: drove himself to the er rather than taking an ambulance, shot a nail in his heart. i don't know.

what should i know about testing?
tinker: oh, the pandemonium in the cop house bothered them, which at least i remember as being part of what was entertaining about the show. the fact that furillo, played by daniel travanti, was not - didn't seem to be in charge. the cops were kind of, you know, losers also. they just thought everything that turned out to be strong about the show was weak. and it's very similar to the mary situation. and i'm not a big believer in slavishly following research. it's one of the things that's wrong with television is that if you throw the whole - the decision-making process to the research department, you're not making any instinctive, visceral judgments about programs, which are show business.

the same people who claim they are not against integration, just busing as the means, cannot tell you what tactic they would support that would actually lead to wide-scale desegregation, she wrote. it is unlikely that we will ever again see an effort to deconstruct our system of caste schools like what we saw between 1968 and 1988. but at the very least, we should tell the truth about what happened.
shalhoub: yes, he is. and also in this time period - and it kind of speaks to everything kind of that's going on in our culture today - women had certain set roles at that time. and so, you know, as a father, he is - you know, he has a certain expectation. and that expectation is toppled because he cannot imagine how his daughter - now that this has happened, he can't imagine how she's going to survive, you know, having two young children, no job, no career. how's she going to manage? and, you know, he has to make a very large adjustment.

'fresh air' marks the 90th birthday of broadway composer john kander
it's a scene that sort of is there for no function other than its own sake. but i think it gets at something about religiosity and what happens when one is confronted with scale and perspective. there's a really wonderful book called man is not alone by abraham joshua heschel, which makes the case that everybody is religious. you know, we've just been sort of too vigilant about our terminology and our definitions and too precious about it. but there's nobody who is indifferent to the experience of standing in front of an ocean at night. there's nobody who is indifferent to the feeling of, you know, lying on your back and looking up at the night sky.

manal al-sharif's path to activism began simply enough: in 2011, the saudi woman filmed herself driving a car, then uploaded the video to youtube. ordinarily such a video might not get much notice, but because it's not socially acceptable for women to drive in saudi arabia, where there is a de facto ban, sharif's video went viral.

i had a very negative reaction to loving-kindness meditation [at first]. first of all, the name itself. i mean, could you come up with anything more treacly? and then it gets worse when you actually hear what the practice entails. so here's how it works: you sit and close your eyes and you envision a series of beings, so people or animals. classically, you start with yourself and then you move on to a good friend, it can be your pet or kid, some easy person in your life that it's very easy to generate warmth for. then you move on to a mentor, a benefactor or somebody who's played a positive role in your life. ... and then you move on to a neutral person, somebody you often overlook. and this is a poignant category right now, because the neutral people — the people manning the cash registers at the supermarkets and delivering our food and mail, and the neutral people for many of us that we often overlooked — are saving our lives quite literally now.

but i couldn't forget, as i watched harry get married, that my first real memory of him as a fully formed human was seeing him as a gutted 12-year-old redhead, walking behind the carriage that carried his mother's casket, his goodbye letter to her in view. he's talked about how agonizing that experience was, and how broken he felt for years after diana's death. so how can it not be some relief to see him and his brother, joking and grinning, not only happy but seemingly at least a little normal, marrying women who looked happier to be marrying them than their mother looked when she married their father? how can it not be a relief to see their father lean over to chuckle with william, and to see him step in to walk markle the rest of the way after her own father tagged out? i empathize with other people's sympathy, i suppose: if one family is to be born into a completely bizarre set of duties and rituals, better that they invite a fiery speaker who advocates for justice; better that they marry people they seem to like and mutter sweet nothings to each other when they don't have to. better that they place conviction on that platform than simply tradition.

i always questioned them, even when i was practicing to be a good muslim and i was trying to please god and stay away from hellfire and go to heaven, i was still questioning these things. i wasn't really happy. the more i was trying to follow the rules we had been taught, the more miserable i became.
moore: you know, there was another thing that won them over. it wasn't just the fact that he was pomposity to the nth degree but that there was a vulnerability and a sweetness to ted. we found out later that ted, who was a more out of work than in work actor, had gone out and bought himself a blue blazer and a crest and had it sewn on the pocket so that he would look the part. and everybody just thought that was, you know, real throat-clenching stuff. and you know, if there had been any doubt about whether or not he was the right one, that clinched it.
mulaney: (as john mulaney) well, then you don't do that, you do something else. or you just say, welcome, i'm the venue owner, and then you walk off. look. don't be bad.

hesse: well - and i think there's also a matter - i mean, men have proven that they're interested in women's stories at the box office when those women are wonder woman or captain marvel, when those women are headlining dc comics or marvel comics movies. little women is a quiet movie because it's about relationships and it's about family and it's about more intimate experiences.

as i mentioned before, the obamacare cases were very much structural arguments. congress doesn't have the power to issue the individual mandate. the executive branch doesn't have the power under the law to establish the marketplaces. now, of course, the obamacare cases were won by the obama administration in the supreme court, albeit narrowly. but if you see the trends of where the court is going, certainly those cases might well have come out the other way.
aubrey: well, we know it's been a very bumpy start - right? - lots of stories of delays, backlogs, despite promises to expand quickly. now, over the weekend, the fda issued emergency use authorization for a new diagnostic tool. this can provide results within hours rather than days. the company says it's going to make this available - roll this out by march 30th, so end of next week. so this could speed up testing.

anne bobby: (as beth, singing) not a day goes by, not a single day. but you're somewhere a part of my life, and it looks like you'll stay. as the days go by, i keep thinking, when does it end? where's the day i'll have started forgetting? but i just go on thinking and sweating and cursing and crying and turning and reaching and waking and dying and no, not a day goes by. not a blessed day, but you're still somehow part of my life and you won't go away. so there's hell to pay and until i die, i'll die day after day, after day, after day, after day, after day, after day, till the days go by, till the days go by, till the days go by. not a day goes by. not a single day. but you're somewhere a part of my life, and it looks like you'll stay.
the phrase, and they lived happily ever after — what we've come to consider the classic fairy tale ending — crops up often enough, with some variation, in the folk tales compiled by the brothers grimm. but while the virtuous and pure of heart in those stories often ended up blissfully co-existing in perpetuity, ol' jacob and wilhelm gleefully doled out some pretty gnarly, grisly and downright grim punishments to their various antagonists. (cinderella's step-sisters, for example. look it up. yowza.)
even the state's senior gop senator, richard shelby, had admitted he didn't vote for moore, saying the republican party can do better and revealing he had instead written in another candidate. that may have pushed other on-the-fence republicans to also write in a candidate, and that margin could have helped ultimately tip the race in jones' favor.
and i find that relationship between parents and kids so amazing. i see so many parents who impose their dreams on their kids instead of, you know, giving them the wings to have their own dreams. and i think that's so important when it comes to parenting is to be able to give your kids the confidence to stand on their own feet because it's what's going to define them when they're adults. and my mom and dad definitely did that for me as aisha's parents do for her in the movie.

one of psychology's most popular findings is the endowment effect: that we value something more just because we own it. to see if this applied in romance, colette nataf and thomas wallsten at the university of maryland ran an experiment with a bunch of college students by having them buy and sell the phone numbers of potential dates. they found the students were less willing to give up a phone number once they had it, and the effect was particularly strong for women.
madeleine albright: well, first of all, i'm delighted to be with you. but let me say the reason that i wrote the book and the warning is, as you've pointed out, it's something that i saw or have certainly heard about from my parents. and part of the reason for writing it is to say that in fact this can happen in countries that have democratic systems, that have a population that's interested in what is going on, that is supportive. because so many of the things that have happened and happened in czechoslovakia were steps that came as a result of ethnic issues with the german minority, but mostly steps that seemed not so terrible that there couldn't be a deal made. and so that's what's so worrisome, is that these fascism can come in a way that it is one step at a time, and in many ways then goes unnoticed until it's too late.
batchimeg batsuren is more than a decade younger than budee, just 22, but she too recalls being treated differently because of her sex. as a child she was made to clean up while her brothers went out to play, a role that she was told would prepare her for marriage. she joined women for change after reading sheryl sandberg's 2013 hit book lean in: women, work, and the will to lead. dressed in a purple hoodie and jeans, she loves to talk about soccer. in addition to being the group's project officer she coaches a local male soccer team and can frequently be found watching local and international games. people question why a woman is interested in the sport, she says, but she shrugs off the comments.

younger white people are much more likely than older white people to say that black people face a lot of discrimination. most republicans reject the idea that black people do. black people are the racial group least likely to support same-sex marriage but the group most opposed to laws that would allow businesses to refuse service to lgbtq people. these are just some of the findings in a massive new study on american attitudes about how americans perceive discrimination, from the public religion research institute, a nonpartisan group that studies attitudes about culture and public policy.

tur: yeah. so this was new hampshire, and it was early on in the campaign. i think it was november 11, 2015. it was right after the milwaukee republican debate. and i am there in new hampshire. i'd just done a hit on morning joe. and the question that mika brzezinski asked me was about why donald trump was changing his tone because he was nicer in that debate than he had been in the past. he - the week previously he was - the week prior to that he was going after ben carson, suggesting all sorts of things about how fit ben carson was for leadership and to be a presidential candidate and in a bit of a nasty way.

jesmer: i do. i think the rnc has done what they can do. they've been trying with the resources they have to prepare to kind of hand over a operation that was functioning and running. but that was always predicated on the fact that the nominee was going to be able to come in there and raise tens of millions of dollars so they could kind of fund the last, you know, half of the operation. and that part is very concerning with the latest fec reports.

i think the likelihood is that until relatively recently, parasite wouldn't have even been nominated, so there's not a very big group of wins to compare it to. thus, not having won the producers guild award (often considered a very powerful precursor to the oscars) or not having its individual actors nominated is certainly noteworthy as to patterns, but making too much out of those things seems like a mistake.
grieving what once was: the loss of a relationship
yearwood: i do really think that she ruined my entire life by - yeah.
cornish: yeah, though, it's not the first time if you think about the idea of bush's brain - right? - with karl rove or, you know, people talking about steve bannon for a time with this president. there is this narrative often that the adviser has more influence than they should.
sagal: right. that's fine. yeah, it was the boy who drank too much. it's about a boy who drinks too much.
now i can say, 'yes, i can do that.' because even if i fail, i have the community. i have my sisterhood, they can support me, she says.
aside from that, she talks about her utter fury at the access hollywood tape - that infamous tape where president trump was caught on tape talking about grabbing women by their genitals. i mean, i do want to be very, very clear here. this is a minuscule sliver of this book that she spends on trump. it's a handful of pages. it's way at the end. so if you pick this book up and you're expecting a bunch of sick burns against president trump, that's not what this book is.
davies: i want to talk just a bit about the pandemic and what it's done to our connection to all of these digital tools that we have. you know, you've written a lot about the importance of face-to-face conversations, of not limiting yourselves to text messages, of, you know, intermediated conversations through machines. you know, we've lost a lot of face-to-face conversations. we're doing a lot of video conferencing. what do you see as the impact of what we've been going through?
gross: but you were with sydney pollack. you were working with dustin hoffman. you can pick up a lot on a set. what were you looking for and what did you come away with?
so castro ortez tried to care for him by cellphone video from 3,000 miles away. frestan's fever was rising. she encouraged him to drink tea, bathe, take naps and eat whatever he could. but he looked pale and was sweating, and he had uncontrollable coughing fits. one morning while they were on a video call, she watched him get up to go to the bathroom, then collapse on the floor.
gross: so the first line in the lyric is, attend the tale of sweeney todd. and you say that that's an example of how god is in the details, which is one of your prime rules of lyric writing. what's contained in that phrase?
i would not have done it if i could have found another way to tell the story, she said. i had been through so many just sort of shocking experiences. ... i knew that i could never get that from someone else's house because you can never get that level of access and that kind of intimacy.

chozick: so this is - was video from the same people who made the famous man from hope video that introduced - reintroduced bill clinton to the country. and it was very biographical, very much rooted in hillary's mother's story, tracing that through kind of hillary's life but also putting it into the women's movement from, you know, maya angelou to harriet tubman, just powerful women that have come before her.
gross: well, emily, thank you so much for talking with us. emily danforth is the author of the novel the miseducation of cameron post, which is adapted into a new movie by the same name co-written and directed by my other guest desiree akhavan. and, desiree, i'm going to ask you to stick around 'cause i want to talk about some other work that you've done. and, emily, just thank you.
fraidy reiss: we at unchained at last, last year, went and collected marriage license data from across the united states. we were able to get the data from 38 states. the other 12 don't even track marriage age. and in those 38 states just between 2000 and 2010, more than 167,000 children as young as 12 were married - almost all of them girls married to adult men. and so extrapolating from what we found, we estimate that nearly a quarter million children were married across all 50 states in that decade.
so they come up with this idea of a third way, that they later start calling totalitarianism for christ. and they predict that the united states will pretty quickly embrace this and will get rid of political parties because democracy doesn't work. people arguing and debating doesn't work. they don't want a republican party, a democratic party. they want one big party - theirs.
(soundbite of film, one flew over the cuckoo's nest)
gross: have there been any liabilities for you to become a more public person, which is what you've become since writing your memoirs? because i think a lot of women and a lot of men in positions of authority, like you were as the head of a college, would try very hard to not let the people who they work with know a lot of personal things about them. for a lot of people, that's a strategy for maintaining a certain dignity and respect and power within an organization.
taylor: that's right. and not to mention tolstoy and henry james and marcel proust, vladimir nabokov. it's quite a roll of honor those overlooked. i think it just became irritating.

you have, over in the house, you have guys like representative zach wamp of tennessee, a very conservative republican. you have representative frank wolf of virginia. you have democrats, as well, and i think that's what - part of what distinguishes them from a lot of other christian-right groups.
prine: he was actually born down the road in mercer, ky. but he ended up over in paradise because his father was a carpenter. and he'd work - like, he'd stay three months in a town, rent a house. and when the job was done, he'd put his family up and move to the next town. my dad went to something like 11 different elementary schools and many different high schools, too, because his father moved around so much.
gross: did that mean you were scared a lot of the time?
but netanyahu could restrain himself from taking radical moves on the big issues he faces. for all his rhetoric and his move to the right, he generally avoids making moves where he can't be confident of the outcome. when making war — like against hamas in gaza — he does so where he knows israel will face little cost.
but what i loved most about the roles of new rochelle housewife laura petrie and minneapolis tv producer mary richards wasn't what they represented or how they were written but what mary tyler moore brought to them. as an actress, she brought vitality, sexuality and an awful lot of stubbornness and strength. whatever part she played, mr. grant was right. she had spunk. here she is in a flashback sequence on the dick van dyke show, angrily lashing back at rob after he jilts her at the altar. he'd gotten in an accident on the way to the wedding, but she doesn't know that yet.
sagal: you'd do the third one, that the rabbit sued bugs bunny for copyright infringement.
clifford also confirms details about the supposed affair with trump. she says she began an intimate relationship with trump years before his political aspirations took shape and more than a year into his marriage to now-first lady melania trump. she says that it began in the summer of 2006 in lake tahoe and that it lasted well into 2007.
their new alliance comes as the onetime detente between trump and cruz, the two top outsider candidates in the crowded race, has come to an end. in last week's debate, cruz attacked trump over his liberal new york values. and cruz's campaign has been pushing clips of trump previously stating his support for partial-birth abortion and gay marriage. meanwhile, trump has been raising doubts about the canadian-born republican's eligibility.
and in the late summer of 1841, they invited this very young man - he's 23 years old - out to nantucket to a big antislavery convention. and it was there in the athenaeum on nantucket where he gave his first speech to a room full of abolitionists - a room full of white people. and in essence, he got up and told some of his stories about his youth, about being a slave.

this week in politics: another round of primaries
of course. i definitely hope so, but i guess i didn't write the album with that in mind. i was just trying to process what it was and what the truth of it was, more for myself than for anyone else. so in perpetuity, however it contributes to the discourse is yet to be seen. for now, i don't feel like i'm a big activist personality in that way.

sagal: you're going to go with helen hong's story of the remarkable and aristocratic young lady who ended up running the spam museum in austin. that's your choice?
pete buttigieg: yes. my experience is being on the ground dealing with the kinds of issues that you deal with in executive leadership and government. look; i get the daunting nature of the office. there's also the case that none of the candidates for the presidency right now has been president except one, donald trump, who i think is actually the least qualified of all. you know, there's something to be said for longevity. but i also think there's something to be said for being newer on the scene and not having spent too much time in washington. you know, i sometimes wonder if i'd be getting that question if i were a member of congress or the senate even at my age. i probably would be less likely to get it. and yet, the truth is...

foer: and, you know, very, like, hyper-rational. and then i was somewhere in between. and i've always been somewhere in between. and i hope the book reflects that somewhere in inbetweeness (ph). you know, it's a very, like - the book has a lot of humor and irony and can be cutting and argumentative. but i hope it also has that whispering quality that i referred to earlier of, you know, an appreciation of scale.
as long as it's about creativity and art, no, because i don't think i'm pandering to people. and i'm not in my bathroom taking hundreds of selfies or, you know, just having nonsensical conversations with my iphone about nothing. i feel like, if i am going to reveal things about myself, there's usually a reason for it. i'm either trying to get an idea across, or i'm trying to make people laugh. i like to always think that there's some kind of meaning to what i reveal, and that it's not being confessional just to be confessional. i don't need to talk about when i'm having a yeast infection, for instance. sorry to be so disgusting, but...
gross: let's go to the very early denzel era. and let's see if our listeners recognize you in this scene. and hint, it's the pilot for a series, a tv series that ran a long time. and you co-starred throughout the run, and it helped make you a star. so here we go, the very early denzel.

 'no,' he told me, 'i don't think so,'  castro ortez recalled, and he added,  'i don't want to go out to expose others.' 
what should i know about testing?
tur: i guess it - it put me onto the political scene in a significant way. you know, it was a really contentious, intense interview. i didn't realize how angry he was. in the moment while i was interviewing him, i presumed it was all part of his shtick. it was all part of this show that he has. he's a reality tv-show host. he's known for the catchphrase you're fired. he's known for getting in people's faces. so i just thought this was him being tv's donald trump. when i watched it on the air alongside chuck todd - and i'm sitting next to nbc's political director, this is the moderator of meet the press, and i am nobody - and i'm watching it, and i just - i couldn't believe how angry he actually was. he was seething. he never smiled. he was glaring at me the whole time. it was very clear that he had anticipated a much easier interview.
davies: was it a turning point because of its success or because of your own kind of craft and connections?
gross: all right, if you're just joining us, my guest is jane mayer, and she's a washington correspondent for the new yorker. her piece - her new piece is called the president pence delusion. going to take a short break, then we'll be right back. this is fresh air.
mb: i think our differences, both in the way that we were raised and also our musical influences, even though they do intersect at some points, they completely inform how what we do turns out.
but right now, donald trump is winning about a third of the self-identified evangelical vote, which, by the way, was 51 percent of primary votes cast in 2012. so it's a very significant constituency. but still, that's about the same percentage that a republican front-runner traditionally wins in the primaries. that's what mccain won; it's what romney won. so i think when you put it in context why - number one, they don't vote primarily based on identity politics.

that will please and reward conservative groups that have supported him. at the same time, it will galvanize opposition among democrats, and potentially even some moderate republicans.

elliott: well, he's facing an impeachment push in the legislature and then multiple investigations by both state and federal authorities. so the legal questions here involve whether governor bentley misused state resources to cover up what was going on. bentley, who is 73, denies a physical affair. but he has admitted to making inappropriate remarks to his 44-year-old former senior political adviser rebekah caldwell mason. and tape recordings of those conversations have been made public. mason resigned, and ever since bentley has been under increasing pressure to resign himself.

davies: fargo is back. the fx series based on the 1996 film by joel and ethan coen is now in its third season, airing wednesday nights at 10. our guest today is the series creator, noah hawley. each season of fargo is an original story with its own characters, crafted to capture the approach and feel of the original movie. each is a violent crime story set in northern minnesota, populated by quirky homespun characters reeling off deadpan humor and getting themselves into perilous situations. hawley's first season earned 18 emmy nominations and three awards.
noah: (reading) living with my mom, i saw how she used language to cross boundaries, handle situations, navigate the world. we were in a shop once, and the shopkeeper right in front of us turned to a security guard, and he said in afrikaans, (speaking afrikaans) - follow those blacks in case they steal something. my mother turned around and said in beautiful fluent afrikaans, (speaking afrikaans) - why don't you follow these blacks so you can help them find what they're looking for? (speaking afrikaans), the man said, apologizing in afrikaans. then - and this was the funny thing - he didn't apologize for being racist. he merely apologized for aiming his racism at us. oh, i'm so sorry, he said; i thought you were like the other blacks; you know how they love to steal.

bolden: or the crew is go.
turkle: yes, i was treated like the yeshiva boy who would be sent to study and would never, you know, need to work with his hands or would never need to get a real job. i would kind of be put aside for something greater. but the greater thing that i was going to be put aside for was not particularly to marry or, you know, about my finding prince charming. it was somehow that i was going to be, you know, using my brain to (laughter), you know, like marie curie or eleanor roosevelt, i think were more the - those were the two models that i think they vacillated between. i would either be marie curie or eleanor roosevelt. i think eleanor roosevelt was more the local favorite. so my grandmother made a point, much to my later dismay, of not teaching me to cook because she thought that given all that, i would learn because of my brains, i would have a maid and she would - this maid would do the cooking and i would not need to know these things.

ellen, your family was very political. your grandmother was accused of being a communist. and she was jailed. the center, the folk music center, was started because your father was blacklisted. and he lost his job as a teacher. what was it like for you as a child to know that your grandmother had been jailed, that your father had lost his job, your family had to move as a result to start over again? and so you felt - i would imagine you felt that politics was important, and it was also risky and dangerous.

reaching these voters was a key element of trump's campaign strategy in 2016, both in the primaries and in the general election. from his earliest rallies, he focused on the non-metro americans he would later salute in his inaugural address — the forgotten man, the forgotten woman.
conan: but given your research and the degree to which parents can help out given their affluence, aren't you beginning to see an even wider gap between the relatively well-off and the relatively not so well-off?
diamond: it was a surreal moment. i think it came at the end of about 10 days of our stories publishing. we'd published five big stories and a bunch of smaller updates in between. so i don't think we really processed it in the moment. and really, the story that we immediately started writing was, what's next? the thousand hours came from not just the source-building, not just camping out at airports and the building of databases about his trips. but we were calling around. i remember we figured out he'd gone to nashville - couldn't figure out what he was doing in nashville. he was only on the ground there for a few hours.
monk-payton: it's an interesting question. i think that it's both, and i'm very cynical about this. and so i believe that the vetting process is what they say it is. i believe that they do vet contestants. but i also think that there is a little bit of a sense that there will be controversial characters, and these cast members will express themselves or have behavior that will be on camera, and you can get a money shot, right? like, you can get, you know, a sort of dramatic scene. you can get a reveal or an exposure that is highly lucrative for the entire franchise in terms of audience attention.
davies: you were different, though, right? i mean, you had an interest in the outside world. you know, it's interesting that when you look at williamsburg - i mean, it's right there on the edge of the east river, and you can look across and see the skyline of manhattan. and it's really striking to me that, you know, thousands of people can grow up in a fairly socially isolated way in this city, which is the largest and maybe the most diverse city in the united states. you were kind of more outward-looking, weren't you?

gorsuch came down pretty strongly against any sort of assistance in dying, any sort of, you know, the medical help in dying. and i think that is a very good proxy for his views on abortion, that the government cannot sanction anything related to the taking of human life. so i think one of the surest bets about justice gorsuch's judicial philosophy will be, like justice alito, like justice thomas, he will be against any sort of a constitutional right of a woman to choose abortion.

itzkoff: well, lewy body disease - or sometimes lewy body dementia - it's somewhat analogous to parkinson's in that both diseases result from a buildup of proteins in the brain. and normally, it's a useful protein. but in both of these conditions, it is built up in excess and then actually starts attacking parts of the brain. so in parkinson's, that only happens in the sort of motor part of the brain - obviously the part that controls movement. and so you'll see symptoms with parkinson's sufferers - where you'll see things like what they call clockwork rigidity, where an arm just kind of only stops at fixed points of movement. they become stooped or hunched.

the exclusion came as a shock. after lange was told by anthem blue cross and blue shield that her insurance would cover gender-confirmation surgery — and had her new york city-based surgeon confirm it — she traveled to manhattan last november for a consultation. shortly after she returned, she received a letter informing her that her employer's plan would not, in fact, cover her procedure.
itzkoff: i think he really found it interesting to delve into that side of himself and bring out a darker shade that didn't - certainly didn't come through in all of his comedy. and, you know, he really would commit himself to the exploration of the psychology of these characters, certainly for films like one hour photo and insomnia. i mean, he really spent time, for example, looking at, like, interviews with actual serial killers to try to figure out what made them tick and to try to just get their kind of speech patterns down. i mean, that's a really deep level. i mean, i think a lot of people would almost recoil at that kind of research, but he - it really interested him.

the government has dumped tremendous amounts of money into entertainment. and so you have, you know, concerts coming, and you have, you know, music festivals now going on. you've had, you know, yanni coming to perform, the backstreet boys. you've had sort of monster truck rallies. they've got this deal with wwe, where they have these big, you know, sort of really dramatic wrestling events. i think it was late last year they had a heavyweight boxing tournament that they were trying to bill as sort of one of the most significant events in international boxing since the rumble in the jungle between muhammad ali and george foreman. i mean, they're really - the amount of, you know, sort of money that they've put into this is really massive.

boudin: it was a pretty emotionally intense period. i was actually on a visit in my father's prison when i got the news that my mother had been physically released. we knew she'd been granted parole, but we didn't know the exact date. and i wanted to visit my father one last time before heading off to oxford. and so i was with him in the moment when my mother was released. i left immediately my father's prison and went back to new york city where my mother had been paroled to.

the fugees struck gold in the late 1990s with albums like the score, a feat that also made their resident wordsmith, lauryn hill, a household name. but when hill went out on her own two years later and dropped her debut, the neo-soul masterpiece the miseducation of lauryn hill, she schooled everyone all over again in new and necessary ways. in it, hill refuses to shy away from topics often left unspoken, injecting classroom love lesson interludes and hard-hitting lyrics about how money changes people in the banger lost ones. then there's the cautionary tale doo wop (that thing), a bold song that unpacked sexual politics and not only scored hill two grammys, but also earned her the distinction of becoming the first woman since debbie gibson (with 1988's foolish beat) to have a song that she simultaneously wrote, recorded and produced soar to the top of the billboard charts. and that's just one song on the miseducation of lauryn hill. the album, rife with hill's biting rhymes and sharp turns of phrase, is a wonder from start to finish, from her smoldering duet with fellow r&b superstar mary j. blige i used to love him to the unapologetic, plucky to zion, in which hill details how people discouraged her from having a child in order to further her career: everybody told me to be smart / look at your career, they said / lauryn baby use your head / but instead i chose to use my heart.

diamond: dr. redfield emerged in the 1980s and 1990s during the aids epidemic, and he was seen in some corners as a very important figure in fighting the aids epidemic for his willingness to attack this problem as a scientist at a moment when some conservatives were turning away. but he did highlight abstinence as the best preventive measure, saying that the best way to avoid aids was holding off on sex until marriage. he wrote the introduction to a book about 30 years ago called christians in the age of aids, where he conflated the public health problem of spreading aids and hiv with living in a biblical way and the need to, i quote, reject false prophets who were suggesting that americans should use condoms and free needles.

the power notebooks deserves positive attention. roiphe's exploration of women's complicated relationship with power — including her own — is sharp, smart, and literate. she clearly has a penchant for the unsettled and the unorthodox, and this book helps clarify not just her fierce and often irritating stands on sexual abuse, but also her attraction to subjects like the unconventional literary marriages she parsed in uncommon arrangements (2007) and the cultural idiosyncracies she celebrated in her essay collection, in praise of messy lives (2012). in fact, the power notebooks is, at heart, roiphe's audacious assessment of her own messy life.

so one of the facts of his youth that everyone should know is that he was, in essence, an orphan. he never knew his father, and he never saw his mother after the age of 6. and he had to practically invent images of her. he had very little memory of her. so as a child, he's essentially a - not altogether abandoned, but he's left without parents. and then he grows up for 20 years as a slave - about 11 of them on the eastern shore, and about nine of those years in baltimore, which, in fact, the city has everything to do with the fact that he would ever be able to escape.
and he's doing that in 1967, but it was done in 1867. and barack obama did it in 2008. and it's - that is the strongest affront to white supremacy. and i believe there's still some people who can't accept that idea of a multi-racial politics where a lot of different people have voice.

the doctors blackwell is very much the story of elizabeth's zeal for institution building. in 1857, elizabeth and emily opened the first hospital staffed by women, the new york infirmary for indigent women and children. elizabeth kept sharp watch on her place in history. her conviction that women doctors would inspire women with higher objects — loftier aspirations — to teach them there is a strength of woman as well as of man, took precedence over any interest in medicine. this, despite the desperate need for women physicians who understood women's physiology and could provide alternatives to the brutality of birthing techniques, fatal abortions, and poorly understood female diseases.
moore: just that she was going to be a wife, a television wife. and that really had its classical parameters and dimensions, and they were established and they hardly ever varied, except as to whether or not the wife was the star of the show, in which case she was the funny one. or if she were the straight man for the male star and she was then totally supportive. but all these wives were kind of obedient and, you know, a representative of the vows to love, honor and obey. they hardly varied from that. and with carl reiner's character the way she was written, laura actually had opinions of her own. and while she was asserting herself, she also didn't make dick van dyke look like a dummy. it was a matter of two people. i mean, society's expectations at that point still said, hey, wait a minute, lady. you only go so far here.

wagelin: (as vincent) sure. but you trust them?
mr. sharlet: well, i think the bombshell comes from doug hampton himself, who in describing this whole process, went to the family thinking that he could trust the - what they say about accountability, what they say they exist for, for holding congressmen accountable. what his relationship with john ensign through the family was supposed to be about. and he attempted to work through them. they told him to, as he put it, be cool, in other words to keep the whole thing quiet. and he took their word for it. and last night he finally sort of came out and said look, this isn't - c street, the family, it's not what they say it is. and if i can just quote him, he puts it very succinctly: he says they - the c street group, the family - they think the consequences don't apply. those need to be dealt with differently, because of the responsibility, because of the pressure. meaning that congressmen have sort of special rules for them, because of the work that needs to be done. this is about preserving john, preserving the republican party. this is about preserving c street. these men care about themselves and their own political careers, period.

so i'm a huge fan of period romances, especially british ones, you know, set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, which is why i devoured the new netflix series bridgerton from executive producer shonda rhimes. what's immediately different about this period drama is the cast. racially diverse characters populate all classes of british society, including the highest echelons. and the most eligible bachelor in all of england is a black man - the duke of hastings, who's played by rege-jean page.

feldman: well, english was forbidden. so i wouldn't have been told much about english except that it was, like all things, not part of our community, evil and threatening. it could hurt me. but on the other hand, you know, in school, we would get this very minimal, rudimentary english lesson. and so i was exposed to just enough of the foundation to build on it. and so if i did sneak out and get myself a book in english, i was able to make sense of it and, you know, improve my vocabulary and my reading skills independently. and because there were no books available for me in yiddish, and certainly not in hebrew because women weren't really given real access to the holy tongue and the books written in the holy tongue, i essentially had no choice but to turn to secular books.

trump, on the other hand, has no such personal testimony. he has an ancestral association with the presbyterians but has never been known as a churchman. indeed, he has made his way in the worldliest of worldly occupations and appeared on the cover of playboy. his three marriages and serial sexual episodes are scarcely the stuff of sunday school lessons.

when i think about whitney houston with babyface and toni braxton with babyface and janet jackson with jimmy jam and terry lewis and beyoncé with swizz beatz and the-dream and ciara with jazze pha and mariah carey with jermaine dupri, i am reaffirmed in my belief that reciprocal respect makes for the most transcendent art. that the pygmalion model — if it ever widely existed beyond making women creators palatable to a male-genius-loving cultural machine — is usually a more balanced alliance.
the multiple points of view don't help matters much, as we get to hear the thoughts of the dangerous stepdaughter and the inner woe of a serial killer who is really quite dull. surprise! mom is to blame for his issues; she was made of cold wire, and had poked him all over his body. a mother who was beautiful, but cold and cruel. i wonder if we have norman bates to thank for enshrining the terrible mother in pop culture, but mrs. bates had gothic horror chops aplenty and psycho was a box of lurid candy.

tur: yeah, that was very early on. that was when they were just starting. and, you know, looking back on it now, is it something that i would have done? no. but that was the beginning of this explosion of paparazzi news-gathering.
it's hard to imagine two men with more different personalities and backgrounds. trump — with his brand name and background in real estate — was an unconventional candidate from the beginning. pence, meanwhile, is a far more recognizable republican, who is known for introducing himself as a basic guy and a christian, a conservative and a republican, in that order.
and, you know, after the reagan and bush administrations had filled the courts with people who weren't exactly - they certainly were very different from the warren court - and what chief justice warren was - the direction he was steering. they were moving toward this sort of colorblind, constitutionalism jurisprudence. so i, you know, went home to alabama after clerking for him, thinking, well, the way - what we really need to do is be involved in politics, right?

but at the same time, these decisions that they make and how they identify themselves materially affect their lives — whether it's the job that they have, or who they marry, or what happens to their kids and the opportunities their kids are afforded. it really affects so much of their material lives, even though the idea of race and these categories are so flimsy.

i'll give you a crude analysis. i mean, if we had hour upon hours, i could get into much more depth and specificity. but here's my take on it: over the last 10 years in our country, at least, we've seen an incredible amount of change — the great recession, the term great depression was already taken. but in america, then and today, people are literally walking around with the proverbial tin cup. economic upheaval like we have not seen in generations. people lost their homes, they lost their jobs, many of whom will never be able to buy a home or have a permanent job again. people are reading about the browning of america and the immigrants are coming. and we had barack obama as president and then we had a women running as president and we had a jew running for president and gay people can marry and: oh my god, oh my god. and then you talk about the impact of technology and automation ...
and some defenders say that hhs is right to establish a new division. it's not really a change in policy, it's just strengthening the policy in place. there's some truth to that, but i think it lacks context. the office of civil rights at hhs already had a team devoted to protecting all civil rights which included religious freedom. what this move is essentially doing is carving out an entire new team just focused on religious freedom that is co-equal to the team devoted to all other civil rights issues like age, disability, race, gender. and historically, there have been so many more complaints about those kinds of issues and discrimination than just religious freedom.
those laws often defined religious belief quite broadly. supporters of such bills could argue — as douglas laycock of the university of virginia did last year, talking to npr's jennifer ludden — that religious freedom laws have a range of applications.

relationship expectations are at an all-time high. we want everything that we expected in traditional marriage in terms of companionship and economic support and family life and social status; and then we also want what the romantic marriage brought us, which was a sense of belonging and connection and intimacy and a best friend and a trusted confidant and a passionate lover. and then we now also want self-fulfillment in our relationships and we want to find a soul mate, a word that for most of history was reserved to god.

this issue doesn't go away. black people have always known about police brutality and things in our community. it's just now everyone is getting a glimpse at how frequently those things happen. you see it, so you can't run away from it. now everyone's asking, okay. then what's the issue and how do we fix it? everyone has different ideas and opinions. so i have seen light in that sense. but i think, for me, i've seen light in myself. going down this path has affirmed my faith more than it has made me lose faith, regardless of people, how they feel about me. i know who i am, and i think that is what i've benefited the most from in this season, and i've been able to take people along on that journey with me.
looking back, i think the balance of women and men in the writer's room helped make women characters more compelling and complete. mary, and her friends rhoda, phyllis, and sue ann, all made their own way in life.
martin: i want to praise you for being open with that. but nevertheless, this is a romance through and through, and it's been super successful. does this mean that if we think of romance as a genre, that it's going to get more - i don't know - attention, that it's going to be really successful? because it's been, i mean, fairly dismissed as a frivolous pursuit by, you know, those in the entertainment industry.
america has changed over the years, obama said. but these values that my grandparents taught me — they haven't gone anywhere. they're as strong as ever; still cherished by people of every party, every race, every faith. they live on in each of us.
presumptive gop nominee donald trump appeared today for the first time with his vice presidential running mate, indiana gov. mike pence. pence brings a popularity with the base that could help trump.
cuban hip-hop trio orishas' latest single, ojalá phase, reinterprets the iconic 1978 song ojalá by silvio rodríguez, one of the island's most prolific nueva trova protest musicians. it's also the first song by orishas that explicitly criticizes economic and political conditions in cuba.

chang: you know, another thing that made simon basset, the duke, quite different from other regency-era romantic leads - and perhaps what ultimately makes him a modern character - is that even though he is a man struggling with his demons, he seems vulnerable. there's something different about his masculinity than you see in many male leads in other historical romances. they don't seem to wear their pain the way that simon does. can you talk about that?
but the bigger issue, exacerbated by the timeline choices but not entirely the result of them, is that the series as a whole lacks narrative purpose. it treats these women's lives as a series of disconnected emotional vignettes — someone's wedding, someone's professional disappointment, someone's new romantic entanglement — and many of those scenes are lovely and, in isolation, effective. but over the course of the ten-episode season, none of the emotional stakes that emerge in those moments stick. they lack consequences that reverberate from one episode to another, one decade to another, or one scene to another. tully and kate are always there for each other through thick and thin is not a story, in and of itself. it's the emotional atmosphere in which the story happens.
but the informant appears to have been a fraud. and he has since vanished. even so, he inspired an investigation by the times not of epstein, but of one of the country's most famous lawyers. in a 5,400-word expose published on nov. 30 and an hourlong television show, the times placed boies at the center of a narrative that insinuates deceit and greed inside a morally corrupt legal system.

evans: well, it was certainly a very unusual event. as you say, we went to the consulate. we interviewed the consul general, who repeated what saudi arabia has always said - that jamal khashoggi went in on tuesday and left shortly afterwards. he then showed us around the consulate. he said this was an extremely unusual move. they've never done this before, but they were trying to show that jamal khashoggi was not being held in the consulate. so they took us from the top to the bottom. and they even opened the cupboards and the air-conditioning vents.

if you look at what people ate in america in the late 19th century or even the early 20th century, it was very heavy in animal fats, often cured meats. so they're very salty, a lot of sugar. you would have for breakfast, potatoes that were fried in the congealed fat from the night before. a lot of alcohol and caffeine [were] consumed, a lot of carbohydrates.
lavalle: well, here's the funny thing - so i didn't realize it when i was 10 or 11 reading these stories. and i read pretty much all of them. and in some of them, he's pretty blatant about his particular hatred - particularly of black people. when i was 10 or 11 and i read these stories, i read them only for the wild and outlandish plots and the large cosmic dread sort of thing. and in a way, i was naive and i could overlook what should have been blatant clues about the uglier sides of h.p. lovecraft's personality and his ideas. like, for instance, the story where he has a cat named [expletive] man, and he calls him that 19 times in this really short story and takes great pleasure in talking about kicking this cat and all this stuff. and then he has other things other things - he has a poem that's pretty famous. he has a longer story - the case of charles dexter ward - that gets into some ugly stuff. and when i was, like, 10 or 11, i just didn't even see it. i think i just couldn't have processed it. and then when i was about 15 or 16, i started being like what is this dude - what did he just say? and it was the kind of thing that you would say, like - if you were walking down the street and somebody said that, you'd smack them in the mouth.

while the obama administration sent all its potential nominees to the american bar association for rating as to qualifications, the trump administration has refused to do that prior to nomination. and at the senate judiciary committee, where traditionally appeals court nominees were considered on their own at a hearing, they now are routinely considered with several other judicial nominees, and senators have to pick and choose who they will question in the five or ten minutes allotted.

d rushfield: you know, in the jewish religion, you're supposed to have the funeral within 48 hours. and i know that my mom didn't want to go through another valentine's day without my father. when he died, her alzheimer's was definitely progressing. half the time she knew what had happened, and half the time she didn't. but she was so lonely without him, and there was such a huge piece of her missing. it was unbearable. and now they will never be apart on valentine's day ever again - ever again.
there's a seaminess in reading it, too, in satisfying some impulse of prurience or fantasy or grief. rodham is not fan fiction, however. in it, hillary does leave bill and therefore achieves an absolution lacking in real life: if i was no longer his girlfriend, and never his wife, i was not responsible for his behavior, not even by extension, she thinks. but she makes other moral compromises (donald trump appears in this novel as an unlikely ally).
gross: so let's first talk about the family's role in how this scandal has played out. first, again until a couple of weeks ago, john ensign lived at the family-owned c street residence, and also he went to c street - to see c street people for advice. coburn, who - senator coburn, who lives at c street, was the chief advisor, it seems, judging from what doug hampton said last night. so what was the advice that hampton says ensign got from c street?

but everything is richer and more fluid in this second season. fleabag's family takes on a new emotional solidity, with even claire's cartoonishly noxious husband (brett gelman) developing some shading. and waller-bridge has found her perfect foil in scott. with his oddball timing and slightly intoxicated affect, his priest does for fleabag what his moriarty did for benedict cumberbatch's sherlock holmes. he knocks her out of her comfort zone.
morgan: i hope that it's - that weight - and it's the responsibility that all dramatists would feel when tackling real-life figures, you know? there came a moment after the film that i wrote the queen had come out where tony blair was asked about his audience with the queen. and in his book - in his autobiography, which, of course, came many years after we made the film the queen, tony blair, when referring back to that critical period in the aftermath of diana's death, used a number of expressions and quotations that seemed to me to be very familiar because they sounded like my dialogue.

the three nominees who have withdrawn are not the only ones who could have problems. damien schiff, nominated for the court of federal claims, wrote a blog post that called supreme court justice anthony kennedy a judicial prostitute. another, thomas farr, has been accused of lying about his role in suppressing the black vote in north carolina. both have been approved by the senate judiciary committee, and are awaiting confirmation.
elliott: i think generally there's a sense of embarrassment, although each of these politicians certainly have their own supporters. but it is remarkable to have the top three elected officials all under scrutiny at the same time.
gross: ...particularly, as you're going from one experience to another and, you know, it doesn't have that coherence that a narrative has in book form. and i'm wondering, you know, you've written two memoirs. did your life take on a shapeliness in book form that it didn't seem to have in real life? what was the difference between your life in that shapely form of the book and your life as it felt like as you lived the parts that you later wrote about?
and thompson appreciates what she calls christie's ordinary magic as a writer: her innate grasp of human nature and her natural quality of translucency — the plainness of style that accounts for why christie is still critically underrated.

in these unsettled, unsettling times, some of us look to things like horror movies and dystopian novels as a means to keep things in perspective. things are bad, these people think, as they delight in characters meeting various grisly ends, or huddling around barrel-fires in fishnet stockings and fingerless gloves, but they're not this bad.
chris darden is a meteorologist at the national weather service in birmingham. surveying the damage on monday, he said any loss of life is regrettable — but with a tornado this powerful, it was almost inevitable.
wu: no, i'll say that, you know, here i'd been trying to explain this to the public for 10 years or more. and, you know, fast lane, slow lane, and he came up with this, i think, on the air. we - public broadcasting we can't use obscenities, but he basically said it's very clear what this is. this is cable company f-ery. i'll skip the obscenity. and i was like, wow, he really kind of captured it there, and he was like if you want to change this, you really need to write to the fcc. and he made it very clear.

socarides recalls a story that obama liked to tell about franklin roosevelt. after meeting with labor activists in the 1930s, roosevelt supposedly told them, i agree with you. now, make me do it.
gross: so since the federalist society and its executive vice president, leonard leo, seem to have such sway in who republican presidents choose as supreme court nominees, when you describe the federalist society as a conservative judicial group, like, where do they fit in the spectrum of conservatism? are the members kind of varied across the spectrum of conservative beliefs, or are they more in the middle or more to the right?
minhaj: i say we tell them to go back to where they came from. that's just me. he's like, hasan, you can't say that. we're family. we're all that we have. i'm like, no, that's on you and mom.
simon: let me turn to my producer. dana...
turkle: yes. and they're talking about when i put a little piece of my mind - i remember talking to one 13-year-old girl who said, when i'm programming, i'm putting a little piece of my mind into the computer's mind. and i come to see myself differently. and she goes on to talk about how she's having problems with smoking and drinking actually, this 13-year-old. she's sneaking alcohol. but when she thinks about programming, it's a way to think about controlling herself. she's talking about the computer as a way to think about changing her life. but when i go back to mit and i tell this story to my colleagues at mit, they say, oh, come on, the computer is just a tool. and i'm thinking, no, they are not thinking about really the depth and the emotional meaning of what they're making.

whitehead: anyone talking about todd marcus eventually gets around was other life as a west baltimore community activist. that job calls for focus and long-term stick-to-itiveness (ph), which are also good qualities if you're mastering a difficult horn. working with diverse allies for two decades gave him the skills to get six local and out-of-town musicians heard in six combinations to make music that hangs together as an album. trio+ is crisp and tight and varied and has more good melodies than we can dip into, plus a lot of very good bass clarinet playing.
mayer: well, and that's according to a study by a group called the checks and balances program. and you can count them. you can see it online. they're - that's in the white house. there are also many, many people who've worked for the kochs in the government at large, in the cabinet, in the other departments. and a tremendous number of people who work with and for pence have gone in and out of working for the kochs to the point that you had politico saying - they quoted a republican operative saying that the koch operation really was the shadow campaign for pence for president.

two important supreme court decisions set the foundation for their arguments. the first was price waterhouse vs. hopkins in 1989. ann hopkins was not promoted to partner at the firm because those in charge thought her too aggressive and not feminine enough.

dafoe: oh, god, that's part of the pleasure. i mean, listen; i saw robert eggers' first film the witch, and wow. the thing that i responded to so much in the witch was his ability to not only capture a period film without pointing at it, without overstating it, but also, he creates a world that's so complete. and i knew he would do it with this juicy lighthouse location.

bianculli: when - i didn't like its structure originally, but i liked some of the things. and then i didn't like stuff, so i would say i was mixed on it. it was not, by any means, the worst of the reality shows, but i couldn't make sense of a lot of his capricious decisions. so there you go.

now, there is a lot of cynicism - this is a house of cards marriage of political convenience. i think you saw a husband who was proud of his wife who talked about her lovingly. and i think that can only help with her likability. and also i think people don't really know some of those parts of her biography, the work that she did with children, the work she did in arkansas, and so to remind them of that.
dp: for me, the touring piece is kinda just now taking off. like 2015, it was just literally whoever would listen — open mics, it didn't matter. now that we have a platform where we can kinda choose where we want to press into, whether we want to press more into the church market or the neutral venues.

last year, the british critic and memoirist olivia laing wrote in a review of after kathy acker that acker's punk novels, her body of work, were impossible to imitate. radical and uncanny, laing wrote, entirely inimitable, a smash and grab on the history of literature. the review came out in the guardian last august, when laing was in the middle of writing her exceptional first novel crudo, a what-i-did-last-summer in kathy acker's voice.

and what is the issue, again, it's this lack of understanding of what this alliance is about. it is not somebody coming to rent hotel rooms to see if they can get the best price or - it is not transactional. it is something that is basic to our system. and so i think one of the parts, though, terry, is that he's gone back on certain things. so that - he generally has now said that he's supportive of nato. so one of the parts that's a little bit confusing - what is he really for, what is he against? is it one of those things where the last person that speaks to him has all the influence?
gross: were you traumatized by that as a kid? did you have nightmares about prison?
i had been looking at all this huge network of lawyers, silver-greenberg tells npr, not only in the defense attorneys who were representing epstein, but also the attorneys that had represented the victims.

kander: i am trying to - i'm trying to remember exactly what was going on. i know that the moment when sally makes a decision to have an abortion was a moment which, i think, had not yet been properly musicalized. i'm just trying to remember this now. i don't know if it's all correct. but we wrote a song which did exactly that. it was a song which starts out very jaunty and nasty and cheerful all at the same time, sung by a girl who's just been insulted by her lover and who's found out that she's pregnant and is in - actually is in misery. and in the middle of the song, our intention, without tipping it lyrically, was that she make her decision to get rid of the baby. i think it works really well on the stage. the interesting element in that song is that all the sort of popular versions of it - most of those performances are of a very jaunty, cheerful, hey mate, come in from the rain and let's have a good time. and, of course, that's the opposite of the intention of the song.

while a news outlet might pass on giving space and airtime to legitimizing a figure like spencer, it's much harder to ignore the president of the united states, by definition the most mainstream political figure in the country. trump was restrained after the skirmishes between unite the right rallygoers and counterprotesters turned deadly. he characterized what was happening in charlottesville as an egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence, on many sides. whatever his motive, ku klux klan members and neo-nazis — the kind of villains that it takes virtually no political instincts or particular ideology for a mainstream figure to condemn — escaped even a token condemnation from the president. the white supremacist treated instead as just one of any number of unruly partisan hordes and not especially worthy of rebuke. it was a remarkable moment. it seemed almost as if something in the country had shifted.

he devoted much of his speech instead to other issues important to conservative christians, from religious liberty to abortion. he praised vice president pence's wife, karen, for teaching at a conservative christian school that requires its staff to declare a belief in marriage as the uniting of one man and one woman, and he pledged support for a government-funded catholic adoption agency in michigan that faces an aclu lawsuit over its refusal to place children with same-sex couples.

he points out that biden and the pope share the same detractors among american catholic leaders — the united states conference of catholic bishops, which he says is dominated by ultraconservative catholic bishops whose political sympathies lie very clearly with the republican party, and not just on the abortion issue.

shalhoub's nominated for an emmy this year for his supporting role in the amazon comedy series the marvelous mrs. maisel. the story revolves around midge maisel, a young, affluent, married woman in new york in the late '50s. when her husband announces one night he's leaving the marriage, she gets drunk and ends up at a comedy club, where she improvises a set and discovers that she has a gift for stand-up. tony shalhoub plays her father abe weissman, a jewish-american math professor who has pretty conventional views about gender roles. in this scene, midge, played by rachel brosnahan, has just told her parents her husband's left. while her mother wails in the background, her father tells midge, it's really all her fault.
davis: absolutely, yes. i knew i wanted to be in movies, as opposed to theater. i decided that i would try becoming a model first because, at that time, christie brinkley and lauren hutton were being offered parts in movies. and i thought, ok, well, i'll just become a model, and then they'll just offer me parts because obviously it's so much easier to become a supermodel (laughter). but that was my plan. and it turned out i...

steve: the sexual stuff is symptomatic. the real problem is that he's a compulsive liar. and the first big lie is to himself. you know him as this put-together guy who's compassionate and thoughtful, and that's who he has made himself into. but underneath that are a whole bunch of traumatic, complicated experiences that he hasn't resolved and worked through.
now, of course, congress is not an administrative agency. they don't have the resources, the knowledge, the time to evaluate each chemical that might be harmful. they simply say, regulate harmful chemicals. this is what - limiting the power of administrative agencies in the environmental area is a classic demonstration of how the nondelegation doctrine, how these structural arguments could work.

the kushner family was sent to die, to board trucks bound for mass graves. but then, before they could board the trucks, they were asked, is anybody here a furrier? and the kushners said they were, and the germans pulled them out of the line because they wanted them to make hats and coats for the german army. and this is what they did. they basically lived inside a ghetto, had very little to eat and had to work as enslaved people for the nazis, and the nazis kept killing more and more people as they decided they were superfluous. there were a few hundred survivors in the summer of 1943, and they realized they had to escape. they knew that there was a band of partisan jews in the forest. and if they could get out there, they had a chance of living. so they began to dig a tunnel, and they had to hide the bags of dirt that they were excavating underneath beds and inside walls so the nazis wouldn't find them. but they did build this tunnel and crawled out of it. it was 2 feet across. [jared's grandmother] rae kushner and her father, naum kushner, and her sister, lisa, made it out of the tunnel alive and into the forest. their brother chanon, when he got out of the tunnel, became disoriented, ran in the wrong direction and was ultimately shot by the nazis.

takano: i think that's - i think there's some truth in that. i believe - i came to believe that all of our remaining candidates on the debate stage, last time there were six or seven on the debate stage, could beat donald trump. they all could beat donald trump. and if you believe that, then you don't need to make the safe choice. this safe choice distinction, i think, is really overly done.
elving: he has - he has made a couple of new bffs in the people he calls chuck and nancy - chuck schumer, the democratic leader in the senate, and nancy pelosi, the democratic leader in the house - on the subject of the debt ceiling and on the subject of the fiscal cliff that we were facing back in september. now we pushed it off to december. it was a big shock to the republicans when the president made the deal with democrats. and he has threatened to do something similar with them with respect to the dreamers, the u.s. residents who were brought here by - when they were still children. and this could be the next one of his big moves, if you could call it a move, to the left, perhaps. but really what he's doing is he's maneuvering to put the republican leadership in congress in the crosshairs.
that story in and of itself might not be a big deal except for what it says about what is happening inside the health department, where different parts of the team are not talking to each other. and it also reveals what the priorities are. after i started reporting the story, i was told that seema verma got really upset not just about my report but that she had lost control of her emails and, in the middle of this crisis, was negotiating with the white house, trying to get the white house to intervene on giving her her email back. i'm not sure that these are the things that we want our senior health officials to spend time on as they're trying to fight coronavirus. and that's one of several examples i could give you from the past few weeks.

that's very different from today. we begin to see marked racial differences in marriage rates starting around the 1940s, but especially around the 1960s and '70s, till we get to, you know, sort of the late in the 20th century and the early 21st century, where we see a complete reversal of previous patterns. so, while in the earlier period, we see african-americans marrying in large numbers, now we see the reverse. so it's hard to blame what's happening today on slavery, given that in, you know, the many decades following slavery up, at least through the 1940s and perhaps into the 1960s, we see, you know, the largest numbers of african-americans marrying and remarrying over and over again.

martin: before i let you go, there are, i think, some interesting things in this book that will be of interest to people whose children are not on that spectrum, some of the things that you learned about how to be a dad. i got a kick out of this one section on discipline where you said, you know, i'm the parent, you know, these people - you see these people trying to reason with their kid in the supermarket who's having a tantrum. you say, oh, these wimps. you know, i'm the parent.
but she tries to convince us that she's not as self-assured as she comes across in print; the ferocious persona is a vehicle, a tank for conveying her ideas. (that tank is, typically, a perfect word choice.) she explains, for me, authority, which is the form power takes on the page, is a fiction. it's not mine but something i dreamed up because i would like to have it. she adds, somewhat alarmingly, i write my opinions as a fictional character, a me who is more certain, more flashy, more fearless, less polite, less concerned with approval, less afraid of risk.
davis: in a league of their own, yeah. so i had a lot of training. and very quickly, the coaches were saying, you know, you have a lot of untapped athletic ability. and so i learned at 36 that i actually was coordinated.
in san francisco, i am proud to say that one of my first mandates as district attorney was that my staff would never ask the court to impose money bail. if we believe someone is too dangerous to be released, then it doesn't matter how wealthy they are - we should ask the court to detain them. and if we believe that someone can safely be released to their community, then we should ask the court for whatever conditions or orders are necessary to ensure public safety with that person being released, consistent with the presumption of innocence, consistent with the supreme court mandate that liberty is the norm.
trumps reversal of obama's transgender student guidance was just the first warning shot, buchert says, that the courtship of lgbtq voters ended with the campaign, and as president, trump planned to move aggressively to roll back lgbtq protections.
the odd thing is it actually did mean something to me. and i remember having a kind of nervous breakdown the morning of my bar mitzvah, just as, like, all the relatives and out-of-town relatives and friends and secondary and tertiary friends were starting to fill the synagogue at adas israel in washington, d.c. i just freaked out and started crying, ended up being taken into the rabbi's office, an experience i'd never had before. usually, you get sent to the rabbi's office when you do something really bad. but i spent, i don't know, 20 minutes there, 30 minutes there. and there are probably a lot of ways to explain that breakdown that i had. one obvious one is that the experience meant something to me.
on white wedding veils and the importance of virginity
roiphe draws connections between her uncharacteristically cowering, frozen response to her first husband's angry shouting and mary mccarthy's humiliating relationship with the second of her four husbands, edmund wilson. she pores over simone de beauvoir's pining letters to her longtime, free-ranging partner, jean-paul sartre, and notes that she drops everything for him, every time. but, she adds, on the other hand, this is what she wanted, the sometimes pain of a strong emotion over the muffled comfort of an easier one.
m chester: that is a really good point, john, i think, too, because any time we slip into a space where eradication is the answer, we are almost always in a losing battle.
sagal: stanton, va. - where is that?
sagal: oh, i see. did the fact that you were named christian - i mean, was this some sort of, like, teenage rebellion? like, oh, you named me christian, mom and dad. i'm going to go devote my life to jewish studies. so there.
davies: you know, what's kind of remarkable when you look at all of this together is that you have mohammed bin salman, who is now, i think, 34, right? and, you know, most politicians with some experience learn that there are limits to their power and influence. they can't simply order things to be done.
and i think it really works for netflix because it's not network television. there, you know, aren't the same kind of restrictions around what can be said, and there's a lot more edginess that is allowed on netflix. and i think it's going to be really a fresh addition to the reality competition landscape.
kallman and ferorelli say they don't want to tell anyone what to do. in fact, neither is ready to rule out children herself.
liasson: so trump, for a change, seemed a little bit rattled. he took a lot more attacks from more candidates than in any other debate last night. and at one point, he was asked by the moderator about his use of profanity on the stump, and he said he wouldn't do it again. it was almost as if he was made to sit in the corner by the teacher. so a slightly contrite trump is not something we've seen before.
ronan: (as jo march) well, i suppose marriage has always been an economic proposition, even in fiction.
but now we're in a landscape where, i think, there are so many different outlets for marginalized voices that just didn't exist before. and because of that, we're being able to prove ourselves and show that our ideas are creatively exciting and also can sell really well.

sitting outside a student center on the university of delaware's campus, cahlil evans of smyrna, del., 20, says while he doesn't need a gun, he can understand why people would want hunting rifles and handguns. he draws the line, though, for assault-style rifles.

my first thought, when i heard about hbo's docuseries allen v. farrow, was that this moment was inevitable.
garcia-navarro: we often hear about child marriage in the context of other countries. but it's also a huge problem here in the united states. sherry johnson was forced to marry in 1971 at the age of 11. she'd been raped by several members of her mother's pentecostal church. and she had a baby.
but proponents say the shaming approach is justified by the enormous health costs of open defecation. if my neighbors defecate outside and the chickens eat it and walk in it, they come over and infect my house too, says shanta bahadur tamang. the 69-year-old, who built a toilet at his house, was frustrated seeing open stool during the walk around his village. if clts works the way it's supposed to, he'll channel his anger to pressure the 582 households in jiling without toilets to use their own resources to build them, meeting the village's goal of being open-defecation free by september.
she's a professor of constitutional law and race in american law at georgetown university. she clerked for thurgood marshall, the first african-american supreme court justice. she says she wrote the book from a personal perspective as the daughter of civil-rights activists and a descendant of slaves and slave holders. we'll talk about how her parents' activism affected her childhood a little later. first, we'll talk about the loving decision, which overturned what were known as anti-miscegenation laws.
and along those lines, i thought, well, if it's going to be more realistic, then let's use [expletive] and [expletive]. and the trouble is that the rest of the script doesn't - it's not in that style. when the dialogue is going on, they never use four-letter words. therefore, for the lyrics to have used four-letter words would have been completely out of style and a sort of showing-off for its own sake. if i had my choice, we would have used it just once in the original, just on [expletive] you, instead of krup you, and everything else would have remained the same. i wanted it to be sort of just the one shock moment. but as i say, we couldn't have shipped the record across state lines in those days.
and trump really didn't know mike pence very well, and he knew chris christie very well, and he really liked chris christie very much. they had known each other for years. and i actually talked to trump about it during this period when he was trying to make up his mind. and he seemed to be sort of leaning towards christie and saying, you know, he's been so loyal, and we've been friends for so long, but everybody's telling me i need to pick someone who has good relationships with congress.

rott: mike ming is in charge of cal fire's employee support services, which focuses on the mental and physical health of the state's roughly 8,000 firefighters. and while he's hesitant to fully blame climate change for worsening fires in his state, he says there's no doubt that the physical, mental and emotional challenges that firefighters face year to year are only growing. statistics are hard to come by, but a 2018 study out of florida state university found that far more wildland firefighters have suicidal thoughts than even their urban counterparts.

owens, like other palliative care specialists in covid-19 hot spots around the country, has seen his professional duties transformed by the deadly virus. patients and their families face abrupt decisions about the kind of care they want, and time for sensitive deliberation is scarce. conversations once held in-person are now over the phone, with all the nuances of nonverbal communication lost. the comfort of family at the bedside of the dying is all but gone.
the best parts of nanaville are the charming vignettes of quindlen's solo time with her grandson — undercut somewhat by the pedantic lessons learned she appends to each new adventure in childcare. a particularly funny episode has her pulling an all-nighter after realizing that, according to current wisdom, she should have put baby arthur on his back and not his stomach to sleep. she notes that by the time she had her third child, pragmatism was my middle name. if she'd wanted to sleep upside down like a bat, i would have put a bar on the ceiling above the crib. whatever gets you through the night.
i don't see anything different with them being here versus children from the outside, roberts says. although i do notice, and some moms have commented, that their bond with the child who is here with them is stronger than bonds with their children on the outside because they are essentially forced to be with their child almost 24-7, building a strong attachment with their baby.

we are, in this current cultural moment, slogging through a long overdue re-examination of past pop culture scandals, reassessing them with fresh sensibilities. after learning tough lessons on the structural nature of racism and sexism — and the ability of powerful, charismatic celebrities to shape their own narrative and avoid consequences — journalists have returned to the stories of bill cosby, r. kelly, harvey weinstein and britney spears with new, sharper insights.
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. when writer victor lavalle was growing up in queens, he loved reading the horror stories of h.p. lovecraft. it was only when he got older that lavalle recognized the racism in lovecraft's fiction, poetry and letters, which particularly stung because lavalle is african-american. lavalle's new novella is both a tribute to and criticism of h.p. lovecraft. it's dedication reads - for h.p. lovecraft, with all my conflicted feelings. lovecraft wrote stories for pulp magazines in the early 20th century but was largely unsuccessful and died young and penniless, achieving fame posthumously. one of lovecraft's most xenophobic stories the horror at red hook is the jumping-off point for lavalle's new book the ballad of black tom. the book takes place in 1924 and follows the story of a young black man from harlem named tommy tester as he negotiates racism, police brutality and cosmic terror. lavalle's other books include the devil in silver and big machine, which won the shirley jackson award for best novel in 2009. he spoke with fresh air producer sam briger. they started with a reading from the beginning of lavalle's new book.

there's some evidence — and history — around the idea of scent signaling the presence of a disease, says richard doty, the director of the smell and taste center at the university of pennsylvania's perelman school of medicine. it used to be that physicians did use breath odor and other odors to signify certain disorders. but that's not really invoked presently, because we have so much better ways of [diagnosing] things. he also says that smell is an imperfect biomarker because confounding factors could influence people's odors, such as diet and age.

albright: my concerns are that he has been an outspoken person for the use of force, for the absence of diplomacy, for tearing up the iran nuclear deal, for thinking that force is possible with north korea. and frankly, part of the problem is from what we've been saying about president trump and what one reads all the time, is that he listens to the last person who has talked to him. and the national security adviser is most often the last person. so i am concerned about that.
moore: yeah. and instead, what's so odd from a morality point of view is that they found it acceptable that i had lived with this doctor, never married him. and then the relationship broke up. and i went off to start my new life. so i don't know. morality, i guess, is a very personal thing.

in one sense, the story is a basic romantic drama involving a divorced single mom and a couple that's been married for 10 years. but nothing in behind her eyes is that basic, not even the geometry of its romantic triangle. and what begins almost as a romantic comedy finds itself flirting with different genres as it progresses — a bit revenge thriller here, and something else entirely a little later. think of movies that stunned you by pulling the rug out from under you, movies with key central shocks like the sixth sense, the usual suspects, the crying game and se7en. behind her eyes is right up there — and also connects, at one point literally, with alice in wonderland.

around 2000, however, came a stark and dramatic reversal of that trend, one documented in the disturbing book deaths of despair and the future of capitalism, by the husband-and-wife team of anne case and angus deaton, who won the 2015 nobel prize for economics. for white americans between 45 and 54, average life expectancy was no longer increasing; in fact, it was actually declining — in a pattern seen almost nowhere else on earth. if increases in life expectancy had continued at the same rate, some 600,000 more americans would now be alive, case and deaton write.

if this impersonation feels uncanny, even parasitic, it is. (it is also not the first time sittenfeld has done it: the protagonist of 2008's american wife was modeled on laura bush.) at the same time, it feels less exploitative than some of the ostensible nonfiction written about clinton. she has been so fictionalized, warped and weaponized by pundits and journalists to fit their chosen narratives that straightforward fiction is almost reassuring in its aims: only one of these mediums acknowledges its own artifice. it's something like the difference between an oil portrait and a misleading photograph — professional politicians know to never glance down when being photographed, lest newspaper editors file the image for use under defeat, resignation.
and so i decided to write a series of short musical lines so she wouldn't have to sustain notes, and that suggested questions, little phrases. and then i wanted not to have any open vowel sounds at the end of the opening line so that it wouldn't seem like she couldn't sing. but you take a word like rich, it cuts itself off and has a short vowel sound. so if somebody sings, isn't it rich, you don't expect them to sing, isn't it rich, whereas if it's an open vowel sound - you know, isn't it love - if she went, isn't it love, you could accept it, but you also know that it could be sustained. rich can't be sustained without ruining the word, so it sounds like it fits the short phrase, and it fits her voice. so it was tailoring it that way.

the repertoire on which reba mcentire built her nashville fame, before all her big-screen, small-screen and broadway work, had its share of melodramatic ballads whose protagonists grieved the ways their cheating lovers had wrecked their domestic stability. her singles were fixtures on country radio for an extraordinarily long stretch of time, from the 1980s through the '90s and into the '00s, while several generations of less-durable stars emerged and receded from view. even when the hits slowed, mcentire still displayed a desire and ability to adapt to a trend toward exuberantly empowered, anthemic female expression, and brought swelling melancholy and impatience to a song made famous by beyoncé.

for all the theatrics on both sides, the debate over documents fizzled by thursday afternoon, once it became clear their release had been authorized by bush's attorney overnight.
hawley: you know, we - in the writers' room, we used to have a jar that every time you used the accent, you had to put a dollar in it. but it does - you know, it's written in a kind of vernacular that lends itself to the accent, certainly. i'm always amused because no two actors ever do the same version of it. and some of them are really pronounced. and people like carrie coon, who's you know, from ohio and went to college in wisconsin - she's spot on.
toobin: you said it shorter than i did, terry, but that's exactly what he did. i mean - and i think if you listened to conservatives throughout the fall, a lot of whom had a great deal of distaste for trump personally, they you know, his political history was checkered to say the least, his personal history was more than checkered. but you often heard it - i mean, i heard paul ryan say it many times - well, you know, i'm confident that trump will appoint the right people to the supreme court. and they made that bet on trump. trump got enormous support in the republican party - basically the same or better than mitt romney got four years earlier. and i think the fact that he was committed to appointing conservatives to the supreme court was a big factor in that. so i think it was a very clever strategy on trump's part and of course on leonard leo's part in essentially being the person who made the list that the president drew from.
and i give you my word, if i am elected president, no serviceman or servicewoman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men and women will feel the full force and fury of the united states of america, cruz said.

martin: it's been my understanding that people in - who've been living in this particular area have faced danger for some time. i mean, they faced kidnapping. they faced a lot of challenges because, you know, parts of northern mexico are understood to be dangerous because the drug cartels have been operating there - and also just because these are remote areas where people are, you know, separated, and it's not easy to get the authorities to intervene. so i just wondered if it has been understood that these areas were dangerous. and how have the families that lived there coped with that in recent years?

yet there's a moment where they're running in kobani in this battle, which is the first time isis faces real defeat. they are running low on ammunition. they're running low on people. they're running low on food. but what they have is spirit and motivation. and actually, one of the women commanders now is saying: 'know what they think of you, show them what you can do, show them that women have value, that women cannot be enslaved, that this is not what is going to stand.' and i think that sense that they were not doing this simply for themselves, but for women around the across the region and beyond, ran through everything they said to me.
so i remember being very attracted to it then and having a friend of mine who grew up orthodox telling me that i could easily get the german passport because i had german-jewish ancestors. and, immediately, i also felt that the language was so familiar. you know, yiddish is basically a variant of middle-high german, and i just could so easily transition into the language, which felt both new and old at the same time. and then there was this factor of how important holocaust remembrance is here and how it's something that everyone is involved in all the time. and it felt like, finally, i was in a place where i wasn't the only one carrying memory into my heart, you know, that i wasn't alone with it because in america, i did feel like it wasn't something people were much preoccupied with, whereas in germany and in berlin, it's omnipresent.

foer: i wish my therapists were sitting beside me. he'd be better equipped to answer that question. you'd frankly be better equipped to answer that question than i would. i thought it was so - you know, at that age and still but more at that age, i wanted to make things special. i hate, you know - the ordinary was my enemy. and i thought - i think mistakenly that a kind of flamboyance was the antidote to ordinariness which is wrong.

liasson: george conway is a lawyer with impeccable conservative credentials. he was offered a job in the trump justice department. he's a member in good standing of the federalist society. and a long time ago, he was a behind-the-scenes lawyer in the clinton scandals. he worked on the paula jones legal team. but now he's an ardent anti-trump conservative.

moore: the original premise was not too different from the one that we ended up pursuing. but i was to be divorced from a doctor. and rather than having - as we ended up doing - having me live with this doctor through medical school and internship and residency and then been dumped, cbs felt that having been divorced was unacceptable from a societal point of view - that people would see nothing humorous in divorce. how could you possibly laugh at a woman who had a broken marriage in her past? and not only that - but, my god, they would think you were divorced from dick van dyke, the world's most wonderful, adorable person.

greene: oh, yeah. i'll have to see this movie.
in the early days, there was a big belief that this was going to be kind of a democratizer of information, that, you know, saudis could then go and they could hear about dissenting views and things like that. and it didn't really work out that way because the saudi government became so effective at manipulating the conversations that were taking place in saudi arabia. they used automated accounts. they used accounts that we have every reason to believe are actually run by people paid by the saudi government to intervene in conversations that were taking place and to basically steer them in the direction that the government wanted them to go in. at the same time, you have huge amounts of money invested in hacking technologies. and the information on this has come out more slowly. but the picture, looking back over the last few years, is quite clear that they bought some of the best kind of off-the-shelf hacking technology that you can buy. and they deployed it against a number of saudi dissidents. they employed it against, you know, many other people just because they wanted to get inside their devices, find out who they were talking to, what they were talking about. and, you know, this was all kind of part of the package of how mbs was going to make sure that there was no challenge to his rule as he was consolidating his power.
what happens is that men and women wind up living more independently in the world for more years, and both of them wind up accruing skills. ... it's much more likely that the woman knows how to use a drill and do the laundry and that the man she may be meeting and partnering with also knows how to do his laundry and feed himself and use a drill, and that they both are earners and they both have careers. i think that goes a considerable distance toward leveling the playing field when it comes to domestic labor, though it certainly hasn't fixed things, as time-use surveys show us. women are still doing the lion's share of the domestic work, but it is changing slowly.

bialik: thank you. i appreciate that.
davis: yeah, it's very centering and focusing. it's a lonely sport because you're out there for hours every day shooting by yourself. but i loved it. and i was so shocked when my coach said after just a few months, well, now you've got to start competing. and i'm like, oh, my god, no. he said no, that's the whole point is competing. it's really fun and incredibly challenging. and that's when you really are tested with your mental abilities because once you have a really good shot, your job is to recreate it exactly and - every time. and everything gets in the way of that, every possible thought you have, every different circumstance. like competing - if you're nervous, your shot's going to be off. and so it's just a battle with yourself the whole time.
i was 35 years old. i had just published or was about to publish my first book, which was about women in the 2008 election. i had a career that i was extremely committed to, that was at its most robust point at that time. i had just given up the apartment that i had rented and where i had lived by myself for five blissful years of living by myself in a relatively small studio apartment; and i was so keenly aware of how different this transition in my life — from being a single person to a married person — was for me than, i believe, it had been for my mother.
so there's no real difference between the techniques used. and hitler, as you said, had this understanding that you speak to people's deepest, darkest emotions and give them voice that can be incredibly effective. so what do we see in politics? that's - and i want to be clear i'm not associating anyone with hitler themselves - what do we see in contemporary politics that might be said to follow from these lessons?

wu: yeah. you know, trolling is an ancient problem. it's been around as long as there has been media. there's always people - it doesn't take many - who have a different psychological makeup than most of us who really get joy out of provoking. they don't always believe the things they say, they just like to watch people go crazy. you know, i knew people like that in elementary school - bullies of one kind or another. so there is this inherent human instinct that the usual way you control trolling is you force people to use their real identities. so there's less trolling on facebook, for example.

sagal: ...shaving, very good. after years of doping scandals and parading men around wearing spandex shorts, professional cycling has an image problem. and it got worse this week when cyclist peter sagan, a world champion, competed in a race with hairy, unshaven legs - big no-no in the high-stakes world of grown-up people riding bicycles. says tour de france-winner stephen roche, quote, sagan owes it to be respectful and clean and presentable. lance armstrong said, i shaved every day, including the thick pelt in my tongue after the testosterone injections got out of hand.

parkinson's begins slowly, taking years or maybe even decades before symptoms such as tremors appear, kunath says. imagine a society where you could detect such a devastating condition before it's causing problems and then prevent the problems from even occurring, he adds. combined with potential therapies to prevent or mitigate parkinson's, a molecular test that identified parkinson's would be a powerful tool.

just as vexing are the cultural questions, especially among the staff and faculty who work with lgbt students on a daily basis. all colleges and universities receiving federal aid are required to have a title ix coordinator responsible for working with students who feel they have been subject to discrimination because of their sex. whether gay or transgender students are entitled to title ix protection is unresolved, so title ix coordinators find themselves having to judge on their own how to respond to those students who seek their help.
the americans is the kind of show you should never have watched in the hopes that the ending would spring up like a jack-in-the-box, justifying six seasons of slow-burn spy drama and marital evolution with some grand finale that tied everything together. you should never have watched it expecting some explosive ending to come galloping out with 12 minutes to go, the way it would happen on a lot of shows.
chozick: well, i mean, one of the things about the clinton campaign - they've been criticized for having no real message. you know, what are they doing? are they continuing obama or are they change? and so when selina meyer runs - remember, her slogan is continuity with change.

netanyahu will likely have a few weeks to put together this coalition. centrist leaders have vowed not to join his government (and netanyahu hasn't offered). so he's looking to the right-wing parties in his outgoing government and he'll have to give their leaders cabinet ministries and assure them he will look out for their issues.

the law is not a broad religious-protections law, such as many recent controversial state laws. as we reported last week, the mississippi legislation protects only three beliefs or convictions: that marriage is between a man and a woman, that sex is properly reserved to such a marriage, and that words like male and female are objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at birth.

more than anything else, what's starting to define our political parties is less the left or right spectrum and more a response to the changing demographics in the country — whether it's going to make the country stronger or whether it's, basically, a threat. the republican party has basically doubled down on that change being a threat, and the democratic party is trying to find that way to embrace that and make it a strength. but that's a pretty big divide in worldview.
goldman: yeah. well, it's - you know, it's what comes with having one of the most athletic and violent golf swings in the history of the game. and he just recently had a fifth back surgery and was rehabbing that in hopes of playing in this year's masters in april.

the tweets poke fun at the candidates, at religion, and often both. for example, this tweet expertly uses the bible to take aim at trump's famous locks:
feldman: well, i think prior to being outward-looking, i was certainly lonely and unhappy. i was already different by virtue of my circumstances, being raised by my grandparents instead of by my parents, having parents that were divorced, having a mother that had disappeared. i mean, there was so many strikes against me from the beginning.
itzkoff: i think it was something that he sought in probably every professional role or almost every professional role that he had. and you certainly see it in his early work. things like mork & mindy and first films like popeye and the world according to garp where, you know, he's trying to take that kind of control over his part. certainly, on mork & mindy, he was given a lot of latitude to do that, almost to the point where - again, this is where one of the urban myths kind of emerges, that - this perception that he's just making things up on the fly and the writers would just have passages in the scripts where it says - you know, there's not even anything written. it just says, robin does his thing.
the opening scene is archetypal: an ex-con named nick mason walks out of a maximum-security prison into a waiting limousine. nick doesn't know why or how he's been released decades early from his 25-years-to-life sentence for his role in a caper that resulted in a cop's death, but he knows that a crime kingpin named darius cole — who's still inside the prison — is responsible.

the fact that moore is seen as a champion on social issues is nothing new. it's what propelled him to national political stardom — and into plenty of controversy. in 2003 he was first removed from the state bench when he had a statue of the ten commandments erected in the alabama judicial building and refused to remove it even when ordered to do so by a federal court. he was elected again in 2012 but then subsequently suspended when he ordered state judges to defy the u.s. supreme court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide under the federal constitution.
cashin: right. so you couldn't even vote for lyndon johnson in 1964 because the party of george wallace wouldn't put him on the ballot. and so my father and other liberals, white and black liberals, in the state were incensed. and so they figured out that you can charter your own party and not only vote for the national democratic candidates but also run people for office in these counties in the state that were predominantly black.

but she pushes back against the idea that grandparenthood is the payoff for the thankless job of raising kids. i really liked raising my own children, and my reward for that is them, she writes somewhat humorlessly. she expressed this more movingly in candles, when she wrote of marveling at the results of all those years of the scut work of childcare: it's as though we were working long repetitive shifts on an assembly line, and in the end we had the sistine chapel.
the next challenge [for researchers and development workers] will be to figure out how to lessen the shame and still get results. sanjaya devkota says nepal was making progress on its goal of eliminating open defecation by 2017 until last year's earthquake made shelter a much more pressing concern. but he hopes that those who were already convinced to invest in toilets will continue to do so. even if the motivational methods might seem a little harsh.
words and stories are maps. they leave footprints. williams shows the damage done all across her music and her face, where the world can see her past, her mistakes, her triumph. the cover of petals for armor finds her with little black squares crawling up from her fingers and around her eyes – the squares on her hands are what remained when she covered up tattoos of her ex-husband's initials, and she's not hiding those scars anymore. they made her who she is.

sleep it off, recorded at the peak of the new wave boom, embraced the aesthetics of glossy, peppy '80s pop while retaining her sardonic tone. the proto-electroclash album opener, what's a girl to do, contrasts an extremely perky melody and bright arrangement with cristina's bleak tale, sung from the perspective of a filthy, hedonistic and drug-addled young party girl with a theatrically flat and abrasively adenoidal tone that recalls the sex pistols' johnny rotten.
frayer: devi describes how three local men beat up her husband and then held her down while two others raped her in an open field. devi's case went all the way to the supreme court and led to india's first workplace sexual harassment guidelines in 1997. but most sexual assault in india is still perpetrated by relatives and neighbors, not co-workers or bosses.

some critics noted, however, that the orlando resolution made no mention of lgbt rights or the fact that many of the victims appear to have been targeted because of their sexuality. the constitution of the southern baptist convention explicitly states that churches that affirm, approve, or endorse homosexual behavior are not in cooperation with the organization as a whole, and the organization has repeatedly passed resolutions condemning homosexuality. this year, a new resolution reiterated the belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.

albright: well, i think that one of the most interesting parts of our government - and has been for a long time - is the relationship between the defense department and the state department. and historically, it has been very interesting. what i find particularly interesting now is that secretary mattis has said that he would prefer to have more money for the state department, otherwise he has to buy more ammunition - and a real understanding that the state department is needed in terms of cooperation on all those issues.

in this case, as in so many others, justice kennedy's vote is likely to be pivotal. in a case testing partisan gerrymandering in 2004, kennedy said he was amenable to the idea of a limit on partisan gerrymandering, but he couldn't figure out a neutral test to gauge how much is too much. now, in a case from wisconsin, some progressive groups contend they have come up with a test that would work. the outcome will assuredly determine how our democracy functions in the years to come.

typical fake-relationship stakes range from relatively low (fooling immediate family) to higher but still singular (daphne bridgerton's virginal reputation). but it's not just kiem's pride, or jainan's diplomatic immunity, riding on them convincing everyone they're in love: their marriage reaffirms the treaty between iskat and thea, with the unfortunate timing of the human-yet-alien auditors also overseeing how stable iskat's dominion is in relation to the larger resolution with other galactic powers. the fate of an entire interstellar empire hinges on their ability to convince the dispassionate auditors, plus kiem's bloodthirsty detractors in the press, that this isn't a colossal mismatch.

diamond: evangelicals haven't supported trump at quite the level that they did during the election. some of the polling has fallen off. but overall, christian conservatives are very happy. there was an interview that tony perkins, the head of the family research council, just did with my colleague at politico, isaac dovere, where he said, and i quote, from a policy standpoint, he has delivered more than any other president in my lifetime. he's talking about donald trump. and tony perkins is 54, so you can do the math. he is saying that donald trump has done more for religious leaders than both bushes, than reagan, than nixon and ford.

gross: and are there other meanings to that word, other translations of it?
bernstein: well, i think it is the way trump used his bully pulpit, which he promised he wouldn't, to promote his properties - the way he would constantly patronize his own golf resorts, the way he would host world leaders at his resorts, the way he even touted his own properties at events like the infamous press conference he held after the events in charlottesville in 2017. he talked about - that he had a winery near charlottesville. and there was actually a proposal floated from the white house to hold the g-7 summit at his resort in dural. it was at that point that some republicans said no. but it shows you how far gone we moved under the trump administration, where this very quickly seemed normal for the president to be using the white house to help out his business and his brand.

lucy ives has a mind well-suited to short-story writing, though her recent collection, cosmogony, is her first. she combines an experimental spirit with roving curiosity, which perhaps explains why her prior body of work is so wide-ranging: in the past 12 years, she's published two novels, several books of poetry, and a significant quantity of art criticism. all, i am pleased to report, are good. so is cosmogony. ives — this is a compliment — is a real literary weirdo, and her stories are strange without ever performing their strangeness. their plots and mechanisms can be baffling, and yet each one is emotionally precise in the extreme. often, i was moved without knowing what had moved me — a rare feeling in art as in life, and an absolute treat.

moore has underscored that major divide frequently at his campaign events, where he has continued to deny the accusations against him but also refused to answer questions from the media about the swirling scandal. multiple women have accused the former alabama supreme court chief justice of pursuing them romantically decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, and one woman has said he initiated sexual contact with her when she was just 14.
but i want to take the responsibility in being able to move forward and understand that i'm only in control of my side of the street. so i'm just interested in my role in why it took me so long to find my way back to music, and i've really made peace with that. and i'm also a big believer in things happening for a reason, and perhaps i wasn't ready to make music until now, until i found myself in the right situation and i had the right creative partners. and this just feels like the perfect time in my life to be revisiting this.

but in those days, many churches were not receptive to having poor people in them, and they either shooed them away or stuck them in the back. so, booth realized that many of the people who he did convert needed a church for them. in fact, the army was called at first a church of the black sheep for this very reason. so out of necessity, the army became a church, and it is considered a christian protestant denomination.
owusu's memoir is a classic search for identity story, one that's complicated by the fact that the ground beneath owusu's feet is so unstable. owusu's out-of-the-picture mother is white and armenian american; her beloved father is black from ghana. his work with the united nations gave nadia and her siblings a cosmopolitan upbringing — italy, england, ghana, ethiopia, uganda — but no fixed sense of home.

stories like kate and tully's are potentially deep and satisfying sources of meaning in real life — not the kind of meaning that comes from moonshot life events most people will never experience, but the kind that flames up from the apparently ordinary. it's regrettable, then, that this high-profile entry that adapts a successful book by a successful writer doesn't make for satisfying television.

unorthodox is an uncommonly seductive show because, for both good and ill, it feels like pure hollywood. on the bad side, it ignores or fudges every hard question about esty's motivations or religious practice; and its swooning portrait of attractive, multicultural berlin — director maria schrader is german — could have been commissioned by that city's tourist board. yet, like a good hollywood movie, unorthodox moves along so briskly, boasts such terrific acting and offers enough surprises that you sink easily into its upbeat tale of a woman who escapes into a glorious new future.
j chester: it was a conventionally run (ph) lemon farm, monocrop more or less. there were some avocados as well. but it had been extractive-ly (ph) farmed for 45 years; meaning that in order to grow the food cheaply, they were taking out the nutrients from the soil and not generating them. and that - you know, that's kind of the basis for conventional ag. it's not looking at the whole system. it's not regenerating soil, necessarily. so we essentially had just convinced our partners to purchase a bankrupt piece of land. and we had to figure out a way to jumpstart that flywheel system of the soil through these regenerative practices.

the argument moore intends to make seems to focus on the influence an anti-moore group called project birmingham had on the election. the washington post broke the story about some of the group's controversial tactics, which included creation of fake accounts to deliver misleading messages on facebook to help buoy jones. it was similar to tactics russians used to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, but this time it was americans behind such a scheme, bankrolled by an internet billionaire. jones has decried the group's tactics and called for a federal investigation into them.

senator coburn a little more candid about what he's doing, he described going to lebanon - this country torn by religious war for years - and attempting to set up christian prayer cells in the lebanese government. senator james inhofe of oklahoma was the most blunt about this. speaking in an interview with a religious right organization, he said he has taken about 20 missionary trips around the world: africa, middle east, eastern europe. he doesn't actually travel on the family's dime. he travels on your dime. he uses money from the senate armed forces committee - travels over to these countries, and especially uganda, which he says he's adopted. uganda has a very special role for him. and he says what he's there to do is to, quote, promote the political philosophy of jesus as taught to him by doug coe. it's about as candid as can be.
years went by, we both evolved in our thinking. we talked about these things a lot in our marriage — this was something that was an ongoing conversation. and i think that by the time ... the second woman in the book worked for us, i feel like we were sort of reversed where, i think, i became more transactional with her in a way. and tom, my husband, was much more ... he had really this huge soft spot for her and was much more defensive of her. and, so, i think we went through different things at different times with different personalities — and just where we were in our own understanding of what we were doing.
so how did it turn around? how did you all get out of that space? i think a lot of couples would not have survived that.

in general, there is probably no greater example of kennedy's approach to the law, and how it will almost certainly differ from trump's nominee, than the question of how to interpret the constitution: whether the founding fathers intended their creation as a static document, bound by the literal meaning of its words, or whether those words represent concepts of liberty to be interpreted over time.

as happens often, cosmogony's title story is its best. i found it nearly perfect. it is at once a philosophical argument — enlightenment secularism: good or bad? — and a cosmic reframing of the female-friendship tug-of-wars dramatized in books like my brilliant friend or conversations with friends. in cosmogony, as in the others, the issue at hand is worldview. the narrator's friend is marrying a demon; the narrator herself, perhaps in retaliation, begins dating an actual angel. predictably, this creates troubles between the two women. it also disturbs the narrator's belief that she lives in a post-enlightenment secular zone. sure, there might be devils and angels and true believers, but what did that really matter, now that we had the news? that question — how much does the cosmic matter? — animates the rest of the story, and of the collection. over and over, ives asks the reader, in sly and extremely funny ways, to trouble their enlightenment-inheriting belief that humans are at the center of existence, or even know, at any given time, what's going on.

many people say in fact that they're puzzled about the appeal of donald trump, especially to professing christians. the fact is, he has racked up many votes and endorsements from leaders. for example, on super tuesday, every state that trump won, he received the majority of the evangelical vote. what do you think the appeal is?
itzkoff: it's hard to know exactly when, you know, he would have started showing the symptoms of what we now know is the lewy body disease. but even as late as, you know, 2013, he was a star in a network sitcom and a very short-lived cbs show called the crazy ones that was sort of developed for him. but even once that show came down, there was a lot of opportunity for him. not on the scale that he had once experienced, but if he wanted to, you know, take a role in an indie movie, he could do that or maybe a supporting part in a studio comedy. you know, for example, one of the very last films that he did was the third entry in the night at the museum franchise. so he could keep working if he wanted to. and he often did want to. he often chose to. and i think that was difficult for other people in his life who wanted him to kind of take a pause and try to figure out, you know, what all these symptoms were that were manifesting - that wanted him to take a break. he very much wouldn't allow himself to do that.
sloan: that's a song reference, right?

taylor: well, the conversation goes on. death is really powerless to end the conversation like that. and when i dream about philip, he's always in his prime and full of joy. and in waking life, it's when something's funny that i find myself telling - when something crosses my path that i know philip would like, i inwardly tell him about it. i think everybody does that with the dead. that's one of the things we do with the beloved dead.
monk-payton: it's fascinating. i mean, as a black woman who considers herself to be part of the bachelor nation fandom, i think i've actually always had an ambivalent relationship to the franchise and its overwhelming whiteness. it has historically never spoken to me in terms of its representation of romance - and not only that, but also who gets to be an object of desire. and there is still something, however contrived, about the kind of fantasy of being romanced in a spectacular way that allures and also endures.
trump, though, seems more focused on the view of those conservative christians who see this step as fulfilling a key biblical prophecy. in this view, jerusalem needs to be available as the site of the third temple, a necessary precondition for the end times or last things that are essential to many fundamentalist christians' faith.

cornish: we have talked about you being the longest-running senior adviser, but it didn't come easy. you talk about rahm emanuel not wanting you to have a job with the white house. later on, people talk about you being the obama whisperer. there was this nickname floating around out there, the night stalker, like this idea that you had the ear of the obamas in after hours and that gave you undue influence. how do you think about that now?
i think that at least for me the way that i write is: i have this sort of foggy idea of the ending. i need to have something that i'm working towards, right? but i don't want it to be too sharp, actually, in my mind because then i might write towards it at all costs, and i might miss something along the way. and actually, this book ended slightly before i had planned. so i had this kind of idea. and then when i reached the place where the book does end now, i thought: you know, i think that's the end.

under most circumstances, seonkyeong would be a highly sympathetic protagonist. her annoying husband essentially dumps a traumatized, perhaps dangerous, child in her hands, after all. but once again, the prose and structure of the novel prevent the reader from feeling much for our protagonist, especially because she hardly seems to act like an adult. rather than a criminal psychologist who also happens to be a teacher, you'd think seonkyeong is a first year university student.

deggans: sure. so when you look at bridgerton, you see several key characters, including members of the aristocracy, are people of color. they're not white. but there also seems to be this unacknowledged hierarchy to the people of color. a lot of the key characters and people who have the most status are light-skinned black people. arguably, the show's biggest villain, the duke of hastings' abusive father, is one of the darkest actors on the show. and the show seems ambivalent about race. you know, while a lot of the characters don't talk about race that much and seem to act as if race doesn't matter, there is this moment where the duke of hastings, who's the, you know, most eligible bachelor in this era - he's a person of color. he's talking to the woman who raised him. her name is lady danbury. she's a woman of color as well. and their discussion kind of explains why we're seeing black people in the aristocracy in this world. let's check it out.

 'well, what you could also say is that, as the owner of the pageant, it's your obligation to do that,' trump said, before discussing how he got away with going backstage when the contestants were naked.  'well, i'll tell you the funniest is that before a show, i'll go backstage and everyone's getting dressed, and everything else, and you know, no men are anywhere, and i'm allowed to go in because i'm the owner of the pageant and therefore i'm inspecting it,' trump said. 'you know, i'm inspecting because i want to make sure that everything is good.'  'you know, the dresses. 'is everyone okay?' you know, they're standing there with no clothes. 'is everybody okay?' and you see these incredible looking women, and so, i sort of get away with things like that. but no, i've been very good,' he added.

vander plaats: well, first of all, we won't demand a message of anybody. i mean, that's going to be up to them what message they want to cast at the summit because it's their candidacy. it's not our candidacy. now, we have invited vice president pence to attend. if president trump said that he wanted to attend, obviously, as president of the united states, we'd allow him. we would not demand anything, as you might suggest.

when reviewing books in translation, there's always that nagging question: how much of the prose on display is the result of the translator making changes versus the author's original intention? i admit this question nagged me to a startling degree while reading the only child by mi-ae seo, translated from the korean by yewon jung.

cristina retired from music not long after sleep it off was released in 1984, partly out of a sense of guilt, feeling as though her husband had bought her a career (though she did contribute vocals to the producer ursula 1000's single urgent/anxious in 2006). in the second half of her life she focused on her critical writing, being a mother and coping with what she told time out new york was a debilitating ms-like ailment.

one of the other things you found was that among white republicans, the belief that black people faced discrimination in american life was low — about 30 percent. that number was pretty consistent, regardless of where in the country they lived. but for white democrats, the belief that blacks face discrimination is much higher: 74 percent overall. but there are big regional differences: about 80 percent in the northeast, 80 percent on the west coast, but only about 60 percent felt that way in the south.

sagal: president trump decided to ratchet up the tension with north korea by sending an aircraft carrier strike group to the korean coast. and when it came out he was completely wrong and the ships were actually 3,000 miles away going in the other direction, well, that is our president's strategic genius. he was sneaking up on kim jong un by going the long way around.

other trump allies blamed mcconnell for not working to help moore. a headline on breitbart news proclaimed that republican saboteurs flip seat to dems.
diamond: i think it's been a shame for public health writ large, and i think it's been horribly concerning for local leaders. we are flying blind, as the coronavirus threatens the united states. if there is an outbreak, if hundreds of people are infected in a certain city, it's been nearly impossible until recent days for officials to get a handle on that, and that means it's hard to make decisions about whether schools should be canceled or classes pushed off at a local college or conferences delayed.
davies: you know, the other interesting thing about this series is that it's different from - i don't know - an awful lot of plots in tv and film in that the story is really driven by the women.
dafoe: yes. and we were sitting in the lighting setup, and someone next to me told me a joke, and i laughed out loud.

akhavan: i remember this so well because emily had read a draft, and we wrote that scene. like, that scene was mostly fabricated. but then i think it ended with, i don't think of myself as anything. and emily wrote back, or we spoke on the phone about it and she was like, no, dr. marsh would say, you should think of yourself as a christian. so that was a real collaboration between the two of us. if i remember correctly, that was...
trump reignites gop firestorm with tweet challenging freedom caucus
so [my husband is] trying to work all the time and [this combined with everything else] is a lot of pressure. i think when he was in that mode he was seeing [our first nanny], the woman who was working in our home, in a very transactional way. it was sort of like she's here so that you can get your work done. i can get my work done and everything has to function smoothly and to the extent that she can do that, that's great. and if she can't then, you know, maybe we should just replace her.
john mulaney: i'm very happily married now. i'm very happily married. my wife is jewish, and i was raised catholic, which you can all tell from the moment i walked out. that's not a big deal - getting married if you're jewish and catholic. only a couple people asked about it. and they were my parents. before we got married, my mother asked me if my wife was going to convert to catholicism.
it just sounds undemocratic, said gabe roth, executive director of an advocacy group called fix the court, about the lifetime court appointments. there's definitely concern about the justices being out of touch. there have been a number of cases with modern technology, whether it be smartphones or bulk data collection or different types of ways of getting tv over the airwaves or over the internet.

disney's animated films based on fairy tales tend to scrub the darker stuff away, which makes them a comparatively thin gruel, narratively, but they are sources of unalloyed happiness — and you can't deny they look great; many also sport catchy tunes, which, bonus.
davies: and that is allison janney and our guest tony shalhoub from the 1996 film big night. you're speaking there in the accent of an italian immigrant who's still kind of learning english. and before i want to talk about the language and dialect, i want to play another quick clip. and this is later in the film. the two brothers are very angry at each other. at night, they're on a beach. and they get into a sort of an argument and a physical fight. and this is just a little bit of your character primo yelling at your brother. and i'm not going to translate. i just want people to hear you yelling at your brother here in italian. let's listen.

conan: frank furstenberg, thanks very much for your time today. we appreciate it.
akrami: death of a salesman was a popular play before the revolution. and i remember the movie a place in the sun, the movie that george stevens made based on theodore dreiser's an american tragedy, was also quite popular because they're all about the american dream and how it turns into a nightmare. and you can see a parallel in this movie between how an american dream turned into nightmare is played on the stage and at the same time, you see this real-life couple and the dissolution and disintegration of their dream as a married couple.
moore: it was 11 years ago, yeah. i guess that was the mid-'80s, yes. '86.
one of the most startling statistics is that today only 20 percent of americans aged 18 to 29 are married, and that compares to 60 percent in 1960. the other figure that i find very startling, in part because it was so resilient for so long, is the median age of first marriage for women. from the time they started recording it — which was 1890 — until 1980, that median age of first marriage for women fluctuated only between 20 and 22. ... in 1990 it jumped to over 23, which is a huge jump from having been in that small range for so long. today, for women, it is over 27. so if you're just looking at the sort of historical picture, there's this relatively flat line for almost 100 years and now there's not just a jump over that line, but way over that line.
garcia-navarro: yeah, so that's green card, spouses waiting for visas, naturalization. a look on the government's citizenship and naturalization website shows wait times have jumped. so to become a citizen, it's gone from five months to 10 months. immigrants married to u.s. citizens to get their green cards went from five months to 15 months. entrepreneur visas have gone from 11 to 22 months. does that sound consistent with what you're seeing?

if you're an administration that lives by the executive order, than you're going to die by the executive order, too, said stephen moore, an economic adviser to trump. he expects trump would act almost immediately to reverse the power plant rules at the heart of obama's climate agenda, as well as obama's orders governing immigration enforcement and overtime pay.
diamond: that's right. the president famously axed a team in the white house about two years ago that was focused specifically on pandemic preparedness. he cut funding for a program that predicted when viruses could jump from animals to humans basically around the same time that this new coronavirus appears to have jumped from animals to humans in china. and there are big parts of the bureaucracy that he has either tried to cut or otherwise alienated and driven people away. i do think, terry, it's possible that some of these moves have been overly emphasized. several officials pointed out to me that the white house pandemic preparedness team was made up of just three or four people. and if that's the dividing line between a pandemic or not, the united states is perhaps more vulnerable than we realize. and we still have career scientists like tony fauci, who's clearly a star, working to fight this outbreak. but it does come back to the president bigger picture. he's chased off experts when we need them most, and he's claimed that he can get scientists back when he needs them, which is just not true.
pitts is what the family calls a core member. they have a very unusual theology in the sense that they think that christ had one message for an inner circle and then a kind of different message for a sort of slightly more outer circle. and then the rest of us, christ told us little stories because, frankly, we couldn't handle the truth. and the core members are those they think are getting the real deal. pitts is part of that core of the family that has been steering it and setting its agenda, if you want to put it like that, for many years.

and also, you know, one of the things about liberals is that they have never taken the same interest in judicial selection that conservatives have. you know, i spoke to caroline fredrickson, who is the current president of the american constitution society. and he said, you know, democrats love to mobilize against an attorney general nominee. jeff sessions - you know, they were calling their congressman. but they were not engaged on the neil gorsuch nomination.
right now, a majority of americans live in just nine states and so are entitled to just 18 senators (less than one-fifth of the total), according to 2019 census bureau estimates. at the same time, about 18% of the population is spread out over 27 of the least populous states. so less than one-fifth of the nation's population has a 54-seat majority in the senate.

cruz press secretary catherine frazier told npr she believes new york conservatives know exactly what ted cruz was talking about. what he's talking about are the liberal values of new york politicians who have embraced gun control; they haven't respected those who have the values of pro-life. this is about the politics and the values of the politicians that run the state, and we think republicans in new york realize that, and i think that is something they can absolutely get behind.
diamond: valerie huber is someone who believes in abstinence, which is an interesting role for someone now in charge of family planning and contraception awards. she is the new leader of this office. she replaced someone named teresa manning who abruptly left in the past 10 days. and teresa manning had said that contraception didn't work. so even though there has been some turnover, it's a sign of just how deep now the bench goes among anti-abortion folks and anti-contraception folks at hhs. and there's a lot of scrutiny right now, terry, on that office. it's running well behind when it normally would issue applications. there is a sense that there might be an effort to steer money away from planned parenthood, which has historically been a very big grantee providing not just abortion help but also sexual education, contraception, other emergency care, and instead steer that money towards federally qualified health centers around the country. so that's one reason why valerie huber and that office, again, another office in this giant administration, may have a very significant role depending on the regulations that she's shaping.

kurtzleben: well, she shares that she was shocked, like a lot of americans, that trump won. she, of course, had been, you know, stumping for hillary clinton. but she also denounces, you know, trump's birther campaign. she talks about things well beyond election night. she makes it pretty clear - very clear - that she has heavy contempt for the current occupant of the oval office. she talks about how not only was she offended by the birther campaign, where she - where president trump suggested that, you know, her husband was not born in america but also that she saw it as a threat to her family, that it was enabling, as she says, wingnuts and kooks, that she was afraid that people could come after her children. she was genuinely scared.

absolutely — and that's where the title of my book stems from. my grandmother would tell this to me often — i would say, well how come i can't do so-and-so? why can't i do what a man can do? and she'd say, because. you can't do this because you're not a man. and the further i began thinking and writing about this, and the more i realized that women are also no equal to men in that they are responsible for so many things — maintaining family relationships, making sure that they are enlightening their children and instilling them with values — and so, they are actually more resilient and stronger than men. and so i wanted to take that title and make sure that it's seen in both ways: in the oppressive, limiting way that we use, but also in the ways to make sure that women understand their resiliency and their strength.

the empire state's demographics are less favorable for cruz in comparison, for example, with iowa and wisconsin. and it's home turf for trump, who is way ahead in the polls. while rural and suburban areas may be friendlier to a candidate like cruz, he has to win over a majority of new york republicans. nearly 53 percent live in the new york city metro area, according to current voter registration data.

and at the end, a reporter said this was great, madam first lady. can we do this regularly? and she said, well, you know, eleanor roosevelt held weekly press conferences. then again, eleanor roosevelt had an all-female press corps. well, flash forward to 2016, hillary clinton has almost an entirely female press corps, and yet, she talks and engages us very little.

it was a very friendly conversation, in which the two leaders discussed the concerns of the association of southeast asian nations (asean) regarding regional security, including the threat posed by north korea. they also discussed the fact that the philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world. president trump enjoyed the conversation and said that he is looking forward to visiting the philippines in november to participate in the east asia summit and the u.s.-asean summit. president trump also invited president duterte to the white house to discuss the importance of the united states-philippines alliance, which is now heading in a very positive direction.

the documentary evolved into a pioneering social experiment. every seven years, the filmmakers checked in with the children as they aged. over nine episodes, the subjects — originally 14 of them — found careers, experienced heartbreak and success, got married and divorced and in some cases, died. after the first episode, apted directed every single one of the up series. the most recent one, 63 up, came out in 2019. not every subject stayed with the project, and some became unhappy with it.

shay's insecurities about navigating millennial adulthood have roots in my experience, too. this was my first book for adults after writing several for teens, and it became a catharsis i wasn't expecting, a way of processing all these things i thought i was supposed to have figured out before i turned thirty — career, marriage, home ownership, friendships. and yes, shay's disaster of a rescue dog, steve (full name: steve rogers goldstein) is based on my own chihuahua mix!

bianculli: nothing else mary tyler moore did in her career matched the popularity and the impact of those two sitcom roles. but to embody a decade, a gender and a generation not once but twice is plenty for any one lifetime. terry gross spoke with mary tyler moore in 1995. she asked her about her first big break, playing the happy hotpoint elf for hotpoint appliance commercials broadcast during the adventures of ozzie and harriet tv show.

and i think if - that if more parents and students realizedthat and really think about: is all this debt going to really be worth it five, 10 years out? because that's how - people carrying this debt 10, 20, 30 years, it's going to make it very difficult to buy a house, to afford health insurance, and do some of the other basic things that you need in life to be a full adult.
this is fresh air. our film critic david edelstein has a review of the new movie, jason bourne. the character was created by robert ludlum who wrote a series of bourne novels. bourne is a cia assassin who goes rogue after losing and regaining his memory in the first book of the series, the bourne identity.
elliott: right. if you remember back in 2003, moore was removed as chief justice then when he refused to abide by a federal court order to remove this giant ten commandments monument that he had put in the state judicial building. then he was later re-elected as chief justice.
hubbard: well, there's every reason to believe that he wasn't happy about it, that this was not the saudi arabia that he wanted to live in and that he wanted his generation to live in. so he basically announced, in vision 2030, that we realized that our people don't have the entertainment opportunities that go along with our standard of living, and we're going to change it. at the time, we didn't really know what that meant, and we thought that the conservatives were going to push back and were going to sort of make trouble about it and whatever. and it started, you know. they basically - you know, once the religious police were out of the way, they started bringing in different kinds of entertainment activities, and it's really just sort of skyrocketed since then.

those acts include kidnapping, hijacking and murder, prosecutors say.
and the other thing that he did was he waged an extraordinarily negative campaign against the democrat, whose name was phil sharp, and sort of put on these hokey ads that accused sharp of being a tool of arab oil interests. and they had some actor dressed up as an arab sheik in sunglasses, you know, saying that he'd bought off phil sharp. and it wasn't true. anyway, altogether, it was kind of a fiasco. and at the end of the whole thing, pence did something interesting though. he wrote an essay after that 1990 campaign. and he - it's called confessions of a negative campaigner. and he said he didn't have any intention of going back into politics at that point, but if he ever did, he would never run a negative campaign again. he felt that it kind of besmirched himself.

gross: why do you think the majority of the reporters covering hillary are women?
toobin: that's right. and he's very open about that and very proud of that. and, you know - and he says, look, this is what we want to do. we want you, when you're a law student, to go to federalist society events, listen to our guest speakers. we want you to then clerk for a judge who had been a federalist society member. and then after you've been practicing for a few years, maybe one of your colleagues will get a job in government and he or she will bring you in. and then ultimately, we will, you know, have a president who will be sympathetic, and that president may appoint you to the bench. and, you know, the pipeline is a very evocative metaphor because leo wants to basically take a young conservative in law school and groom that person throughout his or her career so that they may wind up to be neil gorsuch. and if they don't wind up to be neil gorsuch, they'll wind up to be some judge on the 10th circuit or a district court judge or a member of congress or a member of the city council in their town. they are a full service pipeline of taking conservative law students and turning them into public figures and public servants. and, you know, but there's nothing secretive about it.

cuomo has been giving daily press briefings as coronavirus cases in the state and especially new york city rapidly rise. he announced a stay-at-home order on friday. on saturday, he said the state was sending 1 million n95 masks to new york city. on sunday he said he approved four sites for the army corps of engineers to build temporary hospitals.
president trump has pledged to nominate a replacement who will almost certainly vote differently on many of these issues, putting some landmark decisions in jeopardy — from roe v. wade to the legalization of same-sex marriage.
pence has been a strong advocate of free trade, endorsing every trade agreement that's come before him, including the trans-pacific partnership specifically opposed by trump.
a few days later, davis was chosen as provisional president of the confederacy. on feb. 18, 1861, he was inaugurated. he sent a peace mission to washington, but president lincoln refused to see his emissaries. a month later, davis sent gen. p.g.t. beauregard to fort sumter, s.c., and the civil war began in earnest.

there is certainly a legitimate religious liberty principle that religious gatherings cannot be treated worse under the law than similar gatherings, says holly hollman, general counsel for the baptist joint committee for religious liberty. this is more complicated, because of the changing nature of the threat that the government is trying to protect against.

goldman: yeah, let's start with his condition. we know his injuries were serious but not life-threatening and, obviously, a huge relief. but it was a really scary crash, a single-car accident. authorities said woods was driving on a sweeping downhill curve in a hilly area. his car swerved across the road, hit a median, hit a curb and rolled several times. also, there were no skid marks. now, this afternoon, we heard from la county sheriff and fire department officials, including deputy carlos gonzalez. he was first on the scene a little after 7 a.m. pacific time. and he said woods was seated in the driver's seat, and gonzalez spoke to tiger.

so you know, my parents, as part of a strategy to bring attention to their movement - there had been a news blackout. huntsville news just decided if we don't cover this, it's not happening. and so they came up with this idea - an eight-month pregnant woman, some - dr. hereford - mrs. martha hereford, a black doctor's wife, and my mother, black dentist wife with a 4-month-old baby went along with these college students in the protest and got themselves arrested. well, that got news (laughter). and that's what my parents were like (laughter).
j chester: well, after we had shot the one coyote, there was a coyote that ran into the fence of the garden, and it had paralyzed itself. and i had to actually now, you know, euthanize this coyote. it was still alive, but it couldn't move. but when i asked, why is this coyote in the garden? i looked around and it had been digging holes in the garden. it was eating gophers. it was chasing rabbits. it was actually helping to balance another problem. and so i thought, there's got to be another way. and we finally found one of our guardian dogs didn't eat chickens.

3. my brain is becoming mush. yes, you forget the name of your colleague. yes, you can't remember that telephone number long enough to dial it. but actually, your brain is operating at its peak at midlife. your processing speed and your fluid intelligence — the ability to solve novel problems — begin decreasing in your late 20s. but your crystallized intelligence — your knowledge, expertise, wisdom, your ability to navigate your workplace and personal life — continue to grow into your 70s. so, if you're given a choice between a 30-year-old surgeon and a 50-year-old, pick the middle-aged doctor. he may not be fast, but he's smart and experienced.
and it was also - there was another factor in all of this, which was money. nobody had any cash. you couldn't afford to have two cars or two lives or two flats or two houses. you stayed together because it's cheaper to run a family, right? it's cheaper to run one family under one roof than it is to run two.
ben taylor once told his friend philip roth, there's too much of you, philip. all your emotions are outsize. and the famed novelist told him, i've written in order not to die. benjamin taylor's here we are is a prose poem to a friendship between an aging lion of literature who gave voice to portnoy's complaint, when she was good, the human stain, american pastoral, the plot against america, and more than 20 other novels and the younger critic who could make him laugh, think, and sometimes take a fresh look at himself. ben taylor, one of the great proust biographers, a professor at the new school and columbia, and author of the award-winning memoir the hue and cry at our house, joins us from new york. ben, thanks so much for being with us.

he did not, however, attempt to defend the described sexual encounter with a 14-year-old, which would have been a criminal act under alabama law at the time.
jennings: (as peter bessell) i'm not sure. it's an easy mistake to make. he's effeminate. therefore, we think he's weak. but that man sits in pubs and clubs and houses and hotels telling all the world about his homosexuality - out loud, all day long. it doesn't bother him who's listening - priests or housewives or landlords or anyone. he tells the truth and doesn't care. no one else does that, jeremy - no one, certainly not us. in this whole land, there is norman and norman alone. to be blunt, he amazes me. i think he's one of the strongest men in the world.

open defecation is directly connected with the incidence of diarrheal diseases, as flies that land on feces transmit bacteria to food and drinking water. persistent diarrhea can stunt a young child's development and kills some 500,000 children a year. open defecation also puts girls and women at risk of sexual assault while relieving themselves outside after dark.

while most americans don't pay much attention to nominations to the federal courts, wheeler notes that a strong part of the republican party base, more so than the democratic base, are tuned into judges. there is a small group of people for whom this means an awful lot, he observes.
the dilemma for voters is not dissimilar from the one some republicans faced in last year's presidential election. even if they disliked trump or thought that the sexual assault allegations that had been levied against him were true, for many the abortion issue and the possibility of appointing anti-abortion judges to the supreme court was a major deciding factor.

i don't think she did it to spite ray or to get back at him at all, although i do know that during the course of their marriage, she said she suppressed her politics and her interests in some ways because she didn't want to seem untoward. and yet, that doesn't square up with the fact that she started this alcoholism education charity while ray was clearly afflicted. so the dichotomy or the juxtaposition of all these odd facts with joan is what makes her so interesting to me. she was a very complicated person.

one long ago st. patrick's day, i wandered into an irish book festival and picked up colm tóibín's essay collection, love in a dark time: gay lives from wilde to almodóvar. the book made a deep impression about the dangers of gayness, loneliness that stems from the queer community's inability to hear or read its own stories, and literary codes that developed to signal queerness between the lines.

and, you know, he would fly down into the black belt. or, sometimes, we would drive down there. but it felt like we went to every black church in the black belt of alabama. and it's called the black belt because it's the central part of the state where the soil is very dark, farmland where the plantation economy reigned supreme a hundred years before. and so these descendants of slaves were now a political majority in these counties.

feldman: well, like all religions we know today and all orthodox jewish groups, the rules begin by focusing to an extreme extent on the dress, comportment and behavior of women. so when i was younger, what was very obvious was all of the rules surrounding how i was to dress, which colors i was allowed to wear, what kind of fabrics, what kind of cuts and styles, how long my skirts had to be, how long my sleeves, how i was supposed to wear my hair, how loud i was allowed to talk or laugh, how should i behave if i were to walk on the street and another man would be walking in my direction, you know, how to step aside - so it was very much designed to make me as inconspicuous as possible. and you spend your entire childhood very aware of this - of the problematic nature of your female presence and of the necessity to negate it and to cover it up.

striking similarities emerge among dean's chosen ten. seven were at least part jewish (including mccarthy, through her maternal grandmother). four were born abroad, four in california. four studied philosophy. six had multiple marriages (mccarthy leading the pack with four husbands). several, including susan sontag, gave birth at a young age or raised only children as single mothers. another common driver: five lost their fathers early. when west's dissolute dad left his wife and three adolescent daughters broke, it taught her an unforgettable lesson about the necessity of self-sufficiency, dean writes. you could not depend on men.

the novel feels breakneck, a bit of a smash and grab itself. raw, per the title. the plot is bare-bones and barely relevant: kathy — i'm still calling her kathy — goes on vacation, then gets married. meanwhile, donald trump bickers with kim jong-un, neo-nazis march in charlottesville, and britain prepares for its exit from the european union.

mr. furstenberg: well, it was very short up through the period after world war ii. and beginning in the late '60s, early '70s, it began to reverse course and become longer. and in the '80s, it picked up the pace. and now we have, on average, about a period of five years more in the transitions that make up what we commonly refer to as adulthood.

steve: i think the larger crisis that's underneath all this is that your life is in chaos right now. and it feels deeply disrupted by the end of the marriage, by your feelings of responsibility, by your desire to be back with this person, and not incidentally, by your life as a freelancer. so in asking him, you need to be sure you're not further casting yourself into the role of somebody who's living a provisional, disrupted life. because it sounds like that anxiety disorder you speak of is exacerbated by this feeling that you don't really have a stable base at home or at work.

2. my midlife doldrums will last forever. while midlife crisis is rare, midlife ennui is nearly universal. andrew oswald at the university of warwick and other researchers have detected a u-shaped happiness curve that seems to afflict people across the globe. (the low point in the u.s. is the mid-40s.) however, almost inevitably you become cheerier in your 50s and continue to grow happier through your 70s. why? one theory is people reconcile themselves to the fact that they will not be ceo or a supreme court justice and begin to appreciate their lives — and the people in their lives. also, brain studies show that your brain simply becomes happier after 50, as it ignores unhappy news and focuses on the positive.

legend: so there's just fewer - kind of a more narrow outlet for r&b, whereas i think when i first started out, i think r&b and hip-hop were more on closer to equal footing. and when i was growing up, in the '90s particularly, that was definitely the case. now i feel like in the competition for kind of black music ears, hip-hop is more dominant. and so it kind of limits the opportunities for r&b to be as prominent and dominant in the zeitgeist.

this 2018 article uses the fiftieth anniversary of loving v. virginia to juxtapose the public legal posture of lgbt litigants with the private practices of racial discrimination in intimate relationships, or 'sexual racism.' the authors argue that some white people's aversion to dating and forming relationships with people of color is a form of racism, and this sexual racism is inconsistent with the spirit of loving.

it's common to dismiss the very subject matter of a project like this as slight or trivial and to blame its failure to satisfy on its fundamental women's-fiction-ness, as if spending all this time with these characters was doomed to be dull. but the problem isn't in the idea or the genre; it's in the execution, and especially the writing. a story that's as full of events as this one (births! deaths! divorces!), perhaps counterintuitively, needs a pretty robust structure, because otherwise, those events become a bunch of scenes pinned to a corkboard, and even if they're compelling, they just kind of ... sit there.
and i think there's a broader question of what is happening in the united states with life expectancy, which has been going down. there has been a rise in suicides. a lot of that is tied to the opioid epidemic. but it is a historic change, and the health department is on the front lines of trying to arrest that. is the trump administration up to that challenge? what will they be doing? who will they be putting into office? and alex azar, as the looming leader, is going to have that challenge on his plate, too.

for burshtein faith is paramount, and she's not messing around — she means religious faith. for much of the wedding plan we can choose to get on board for that part or not, because michal's god helps those who help themselves. near the end of the wedding plan, as suspense builds over whether a groom will appear at the eleventh hour, the bride-to-be makes a decision that leaves no room for doubt about who she believes holds sway over her life. it's a tribute to this open-hearted, humane film that you can follow along and enjoy while reserving judgment on that score.

at the same time, roney was an artist of granite resolve, exacting standards and his own unswerving compass. critic stanley crouch once pronounced him one of the best bandleaders in the music, in spite of any comparisons to davis. what one hears is a manipulation of the simple and the complex as well as a conception of improvising in which forms and approaches can be reordered on the spot, crouch added, in a feature for the new york times.
it didn't take long for a photo of a throng of torch-wielding white supremacists to go viral. the picture from friday night captured the faces of young (mostly) men who had descended onto the university of virginia's campus to protest the pending removal of a nearby statue of robert e. lee and as part of a planned rally in charlottesville for white supremacists called unite the right. that the young men in the picture looked so smug and unashamed only made their troll-job more effective. don't they know they should be embarrassed by the things they're saying?
more so than on previous albums, which could feel like stolen glimpses of someone's journal, lp3 is openly padded with hard-to-swallow personal reflections, such as explorations of intergenerational trauma, and karma. uncomfortably numb acts as a careful rumination of marriage and parenthood. where kinsella sings of parental shortcomings (i blamed my father in my youth / now as a father / i blame the booze, and i used to struggle in my youth / now i'm used to struggling / for two), paramore's hayley williams weaves an almost whispered response, perhaps from a partner, possibly from one's own inner monologue: now whenever i try to be clear with you / i only end up feeling see through ... / comatose, / like father like son.
and then he turns that into a lyric for the song and it's kind of, like, you get the sense that the character is kind of processing what's happening through the music but kind of escaping through the music as well.

loving avoids these potholes by simply and elegantly flying far, far over them. loving isn't a movie about a landmark civil rights case; it's a movie about two people who fall in love, get married, start a family and just want to do all that in their rural virginia hometown. loving is as much about the contrast between the quiet pastoral — beautifully rendered in 35 mm by cinematographer adam stone — and the loud and chaotic urban landscape of washington, d.c., to which this reserved family is exiled.
there are a lot of outright falsehoods in the trump family biography, and in what trump says about himself, and in what his father said about himself. fred trump's father came from germany and his mother came from germany and they actually spoke german at home. and he, during the war, was building — in virginia — federally subsidized housing. and he didn't want people to know of his german roots, so he said he was swedish.
you've got to be free from that, i think, and particularly when you're dealing with language that's very elevated. one of your big, you know, jobs is to root it, not to make a show out of it - to really find the beautiful images and use them as normal speech. so that's really the challenge.

i — yeah, i mean, i see it as sort of the jazz of our time. you know, what happens for a lot of people who are in the rock 'n' roll community — there's a bit of a head scratching, you know, where do we belong thing. and i think with the grammys as well, there's some head scratching. for a long time, the rock category was just sort of a catch-all for when things weren't quite alternative or weren't quite pop and nobody else knew what to do with them. and i think there has been a bit of a turn of events for me creatively, because i really wanted to stake my claim as a rock 'n' roll musician. it is the most natural medium with which i am able to process things. i like the muscular, powerful, intense, peculiar energy of rock 'n' roll. and the fact that it is sort of the ugly duckling or strange outsider now, as alice cooper said, i love that.
this isn't one of those things.

mr. mike zmuda (director, business development, nec display solutions of america, inc.): well, i think we're close in some areas and probably never will get there in some other areas.
so the theory there was that, like, that's what he wants. he wants to hear about something relevant to him, but who wants to hear an advertisement for funeral homes when you're dying? you know, that's how the model backfired. and i think we're kind of trapped in this thing. look, there's always going to be merchants who need to get their message out, but things have gone way too far. and the companies themselves are trapped in this, and that's why i'm saying we need to find a new way. and as i said, take back the web because it is a situation that really isn't working for anyone.
rapace: (as bianca lind) you put a spoon of butter into the pan and heat it up until it gets brown.
toobin: (laughter) it's pretty amazing to me. i mean, i - you know, i was only sort of midway through my reporting on the piece and i said to myself, oh, my god. this guy has - is, like, responsible for a third of the supreme court. there's no president at the moment who's responsible for a third of the supreme court. the most any recent president has had is two nominations. i mean, to me, it was just extraordinary that a person, much less someone who never worked for the government, could claim this.
jonas: thank you so much for having me, scott. this was lovely.
gross: and you talk about how you decided then that you'd better really get to know him as a person better.
mayer: well, they actually had a slightly strained history together. pence had gone to ask for a campaign donation from trump at trump tower, and this is a few years earlier. and trump had started gossiping with pence about the marriage of the current governor of indiana at the time, mitch daniels, and there was sort of - a lot of sort of gossip going on about his rocky marriage. and pence sort of stiffened and was very kind of prim about it, and they were not on the same wavelength whatsoever.
and so a part of the new credit card law would require parents to cosign for their kids if their kids can't show they have enough income to carry the credit card. that's a great part of the law because just think about it. if they don't have enough income to qualify on their own, they don't need a credit card.
after allegations of a toxic workplace culture that discriminates against women and people of color, the southern poverty law center is trying to emerge and chart a way forward. turmoil in the civil rights organization last month resulted in the firing of its famous founder and the resignations of its longtime president and legal director.

some girls want to take some leave from their jobs, said the first doctor. others lie to a man, saying 'i'm pregnant' to get a sum of money.
the last decade delivered a double-whammy to babymaking. the 2008 recession scarred millennials. burdened with student debt, dimmer job opportunities and skyrocketing housing costs, they are less interested in splurging on kids. then came the affordable care act — also known as obamacare — which expanded access to contraception.
that was a time in which it was a binary. there were white spaces and there were colored spaces. and you had to kind of shoehorn yourself into one of those spaces. so what does it mean to not exist in either?
noah: unfounded allegations, wild internet outbursts and lying - sounds like sarah sanders is just reading from president trump's daily schedule. it's just...

reading from his teleprompter, trump made one significant gaffe. saying people of faith were behind many of the nation's greatest accomplishments, he included among those achievements the abolition of civil rights. he did not correct himself.
thomas jonathan stonewall jackson, another of virginia's native sons, was a graduate of west point and fought for the u.s. in the mexican-american war. he left the army to teach at the virginia military institute, but when the civil war broke out, jackson joined the confederate army and became a colonel for the virginia militia. he earned his nickname of stonewall in the battle of first manassas, also known as the battle of bull run.
but he went back. he met auld with great publicity. he had press in tow. and he went to auld's bed, and they met for about 20 or 25 minutes. douglass tells us they both shed tears. it was a - kind of a meeting of epics and eras. by then, auld, of course, knew how famous douglass was. but douglass quite directly appears to have asked auld, are you my father? or in some way he asked him. he's trying to find out his birth, his paternity, his roots and so on. but auld did not say, yes, i'm your father. maybe he couldn't. i don't know. my own guess is that auld is probably not his father, but that's a pure guess - educated guess, i guess (laughter).
sanders: chrissy, she seems extremely comfortable in that medium, and she makes it work for herself very well. she's just, like, really good at twitter.
on why he framed the story around shakespeare's henry iv, a play he performed in 2003
baker: you know, this is kind of a frightening story. we've had policies in place - speaking first and foremost of the u.s., but i think you could also look to the u.k., you can look to europe - that have tended to redistribute income upwards. and you're seeing a backlash from the victims. and that backlash very often takes, you know, racist, xenophobic forms and that's really awful. but to my view, you know, i'm not going to condone the racism. and i'm not going to condone xenophobia.
conway: yes, it was - my mother thought i could do two years in one, and she told the correspondence school that, but they thought there were two children on the place, so they sent the first lesson of the first grade and the first lesson of the second grade and continued in installments all the way through the year. it wasn't - it wasn't clear to me that it was work of a different degree of difficulty. so we didn't know until the end of the year.
faith salie: a marriage proposal is such a dramatic moment that it really ought to be captured on film. luckily, when brandon thompson got down on one knee for his girlfriend leandria keith, all the romance was recorded on the body cam of one of the police officers who was arresting him. cops in muskogee, okla. came to thompson's mother's house with six felony warrants and spied him hiding behind a grill the family had fired up to celebrate his birthday.
and so i'll be honest. you know, i'm passionate about these issues. but i also have this thing about security, you know? and i think that when you experience - i experience - we went from living in this beautiful, big house on a hill, you know the father who flew a plane. at one point, he had a rolls royce. it was an antique, but still, you know.
joel kim booster: we've all heard it before - ask and you shall receive. sure, that seems sensible enough. but unfortunately, for two readers of the charlotte observer, whoever came up with that idiom should have been more specific. the kerfuffle centered around the paper's longstanding advice column, ask aunt alice (ph). but after 30 years of no complaints, alice's record was blighted on april 27 by a careless features editor who inadvertently swapped advice for two unlucky letter writers.
toobin: you know, i don't know a lot about his religious views. he was raised a catholic, as i understand it. but he married a british woman, who belonged to the church of england, anglican church. and as a result, they now go to an episcopal church in boulder, colo. i think more significant or in addition to his religious views, you know, the book he wrote about - which was about assisted suicide and the moral dilemmas surrounding right to die laws and the whole issues surrounding, you know, end of life care.

consumer groups argue the trump plan could backfire, because those who tend to wait until the last minute to sign up are actually often the youngest and healthiest — and they may miss the enrollment window if it is shorter. additionally, the deadline falls around the holidays, when money and time are often tight, which could have a chilling effect on insurance sign-ups.
gross: so did michael douglas, when he sent you the book, did he know that his father had sent it to you 10 years before?

i know that gov. pence did do some important work with the administration to expand medicaid in his state, earnest said. that's something president obama has been encouraging democratic and republican governors across the country to do.
kate spade: kate & andy spade : how i built this with guy raz we're hard at work planning our next live show, so we bring you this favorite from the last year: kate spade. a 1991 conversation at a mexican restaurant led kate & andy spade to ask, what's missing in designer handbags? kate's answer was a simple modern-shaped handbag that launched the iconic fashion brand. plus for our postscript how you built that, we check back with dennis darnell and his line of garbage can fly traps.

and the whole evening kind of went like that. it was a big circus sort of a show. you know, phil had a couple of bodyguards with him all the time. your drink never got past - lower than half full. and these guys - one looked like a swarthy, sort of skinny guy. and the other guy looked like chewbacca. and they were with him everywhere. and phil had a three-piece suit on with a shoulder holster. all of them were carrying pistols, you know? and it was a pretty crazy evening.
all of which puts me in mind of nietzsche's famous declaration: a common error: having the courage of one's convictions. rather, it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on one's convictions. sharp is a wonderful celebration of some truly gutsy, brilliant women.
davies: so you're living with five people in this one-bedroom apartment, and you felt loved by all of these people and supported. and it's interesting - i think you write that your grandmother kind of made a point of not teaching you to cook because you were a kid of whom big things were expected, right?
she's brushing her three little teeth she's got and we do that every morning, kimp says.
kahn: one of her friends chose to go to a wedding in a beautiful locale instead of going to a beach weekend where the other friends were going to be. and instead of enjoying the wedding that she was at, she was looking at facebook and looking at the activities of her friends at this beach weekend, which was a routine thing. it wasn't a special occasion at all.

and finally, love is in the air, and not just because it's valentine's day. a tumultuous year has some people reevaluating priorities, like perhaps getting married. yes, amid all the uncertainty during this pandemic, some couples are becoming more certain of each other. screenwriter marty abby schneider from los angeles, calif., proposed to his girlfriend, rebecca meier, this month.
there is a family i wrote about in minnesota, with a sweet boy who waited for four years to get a service dog for his autism. he was not able to go to restaurants. the family, therefore, couldn't go to restaurants. he couldn't travel. he could barely leave the house. he did go to school, but that was tough, too. and so they waited four years. they tried to get a regular pet dog in the meantime, thinking, oh well, you know, it's a dog. it'll work. but it was a disaster. it did not work at all as a service dog.
gross: vice president pence not only is now leading the task force against the coronavirus, he also has close ties to several people in key health positions right now. seema verma, who is the head of medicare and medicaid, was his health care consultant when he was the governor of indiana. jerome adams, who is the surgeon general, was in the pence administration. when alex azar was in indiana as a senior executive at the pharmaceutical company eli lilly, he became connected to mike pence.
the clinton people don't want to do it because they don't want to alienate the sanders voters who they want to come into their tent, assuming that she wins the nomination. and the republicans don't want to do it because they're thrilled to have sanders still in the race and taking down hillary clinton every day. so he has had - he has been totally unscathed in terms of his own record.

the role of parental consent has been a sticking point in kentucky and in other states. conservative lawmakers and organizations such as the kentucky family foundation say parents, not courts, should have the final say in whether a minor child is permitted to marry, and they have successfully pushed back against legislation that did not include provisions for a parent's consent. opponents of child marriage counter that blanket minimum-age requirements may be necessary to protect minors from parental coercion.

sarah mccammon, byline: for the better part of a generation, republicans have had the white evangelical christian vote mostly locked down. that did not change in 2016, despite donald trump's personal behavior and rough language, like this infamous attack on the late senator john mccain's military service.
steinem: no. and i don't think i am the leading intellectual. movements are by their nature huge and circular and mutually supportive. i became whatever it is i am by being a journalist writing about the movement. and there were various places asking me to speak about it. and i discovered exactly how deep and widespread the needs and also enthusiasms about a movement truly were from being on the road.

based a novel by elliott colla, baghdad central takes a well-worn scenario — an honorable cop caught in deadly circumstances — and uses it to show us something new. uprooting stereotypes, it explores how the occupation was experienced by its supposed beneficiaries. as khafaji travels around baghdad, the series depicts things we haven't seen: the way daily life became nearly impossible in occupied iraq, the reason some iraqis collaborated while others did not, and how the coalition bungled things so badly that iraqis thought of americans as fools and incompetents, not liberators. for his part, khafaji has a clear plan: find his vanished daughter, get the other one healthy, and leave the country.

davies: this is parole officer ray stussy. he's visiting one of his parolees, a guy named maurice who's played by scoot mcnairy, because maurice has failed a urine test. and ray, the parole officer, played by ewan mcgregor, is going to ask this parolee maurice to break into his brother's house to steal a valuable vintage stamp that's at the center of a feud he's having with his brother. and then maybe he'll let them off of the failed urine test. so they're in this bar. we're going to hear the parole officer, ray, speak first.
sagal: weirdly enough, that is actually one of the things. it's out in the woods, and you have to unplug.
what are the rules for traveling and gathering?
sagal: lockdowns across the country are sending bean sales skyrocketing, giving everyone good nutrients and a reason to use up all the toilet paper. like pasta and rice, beans last a long time, can be purchased in bulk. and their side effects help with social distancing.
mcewan: actually, i did. it was never - it was one of those stories completely generated by the press. i mentioned in an interview that i proved to myself that the stones do get smaller as you're walking on the beach. i walked a 5-mile stretch of it, and i had about six pebbles on my - bits of shingle on my mantlepiece. a journalist then phoned the local council and said, are you allowed to take the pebbles from the beach? and they said, no. and what's the fine? two-thousand pounds.
you know, i think it's - i think it's actually one of the smarter things that mbs has managed to do is that he - as soon as trump won the election, they basically went and courted him. they sent a whole delegation to the east coast. they talked to some of trump's business associates, some of his political associates. they met with jared kushner.
what do i do? should i put my hands up in the air? wrap it around me?
davies: you said you felt insecure. do you still feel insecure?
gross: so if hillary is elected president, it will make history in two ways. she'll be the first woman president. and bill clinton, he'll be the first man and the first former president to return to the white house in the capacity of spouse. she's hinted a little bit about what his role might be, but just a little bit. do you have any sense of what his role might be if she wins?
gross: so how have the anti-abortion, anti-lgbtq rights views of the new leadership of hhs been reflected in new policy?
elliott: this is about whether speaker mike hubbard used his office for personal gain. he is facing 23 felony ethics charges, a bit ironic because this is under an ethics law that he championed shortly after he orchestrated the republican supermajority in the alabama state house.
davies: when you were growing up, were you a mimic? did you - i don't know - did you think about them as characters in some way? i mean, you're - obviously, they're your family. they're not characters. but kind of think about what they (unintelligible).
but the thing now is that nobody is forcing it on you the way that they were before. there have also been big changes in the ability of men and women to socialize in public, which, again, is a major, major societal change. you know, you have at these entertainment events men and women, you know, going together and sitting together and sometimes even dancing together, which is something that you never would have seen before.

what's open, and what's restricted or closed?
i think it's only right, sounwave says. the movie's not set in 1910, or the 1960s when black panther first came out — it's set in today. there's 'today' moments happening in the movie, so we want the whole soundtrack to sound like that too. i think it was a perfect marriage for us to blend the two worlds.
for me, this new music feels like waking up from a dream and entering into this very candid realization of what has happened in such a personal story, says becca mancari. and yes, that story is unique to hayley, but it's even bigger then that. i feel like she invites us in to observe ourselves, our own stories, our own awakenings.

and then, the second moment of peril of the episode comes, almost all the way to the canadian border. there's minimal dialogue, and the music fades away. when the train stops at a station, officers carrying fbi bulletins on philip and elizabeth board and begin checking passports. one more time, philip's wig gets him out of a jam. one more time, elizabeth hides behind her big glasses. they are safe. they are actually safe. they will get out of the country.
so, i mean, these are major changes in society that, if they stick, you know, they're going to mean that saudi arabia is a very different place going forward than it has been during the rest of its modern history.
the trump administration has also launched a plan to end the hiv epidemic — a commitment that, when achieved, will save lgbt lives across the country, deere says.
montagne: well, let's talk about the democrats for a few minutes now. who ever would've thought, really, that this would be the second nominating contest to be decided this year after the republicans? but as paul ryan points out, speaker of the house, bernie sanders keeps winning primaries, as bernie sanders would point out as well. he also is making the argument that he would do better with clinton against trump in a national election. does he - is there something to that, cokie?

by 1999, white was divorced from lewis. her mother vivian passed away near the same time. i believe, she said in 2012, that i became depressed, and didn't want to sing. white moved from minneapolis back to california, began work in real estate and didn't record again professionally for decades. i'm really good at goals, and focusing, she's said. like if it's, i wanna be singer, a dancer, whatever it is, i'm really great at that. but i didn't feel like i could do it all, great. be a mother, be a wife, be an entertainer. it was kind of strange, but ... i stepped back.
feldman: he says that the matchmaker is resentful because she didn't get paid enough. and i think this sounds strange to you because it's so foreign, but actually, where i come from, there are all these superstitious ideas that, you know, people can put the evil eye on you, which is something you find in a lot of traditional cultures. and so one of the first things a kabbalist will always look for when there's a problem is who could possibly cast an evil eye on you.
the death of basketball icon kobe bryant, his teenage daughter and 9 others in a helicopter crash over the weekend has seen an outpouring of grief from his fans. reaggaeton musician bad bunny offered a heartfelt, two-minute tribute to bryant that contains this line (performed in spanish): you won six rings / five with the nba and one in a marriage that gave you your daughters / thinking that one of them left with you, got me outta control / but nah, it's so you don't play ball alone in heaven. as a father myself, that last line is almost unbearable. —felix contreras

the trump administration's proposal, corlette said, is nibbling away at the margins.
mayer: yes. i mean, and so in particular, some of the trade deals they were against. and in particular, one of the things that they objected to most strenuously was an idea that the trump administration was pushing early on along with paul ryan, which was to impose a border adjustment tax. this was going to be a tax on items that are imported into america, and the aim of it was to try to get americans to buy more american goods and try to get american companies to - manufacturers to use american-produced, you know, items.

they could not have been what they are without the help of the taxpayers in a whole variety of ways through infrastructure programs, through tax abatement programs, which allowed them to avoid paying taxes in certain instances. and they also benefited by what the new york times called outright fraud. they just simply didn't pay the taxes they were supposed to. so they were in this position of getting help from the government and getting help from government programs, at the same time actively trying not to pay money back to the taxpayers.
dibango's death was announced on social media by his representatives, who said that he died tuesday at age 86 due to the coronavirus; they had also announced last wednesday that he had been hospitalized due to the pandemic. a public memorial will be organized when possible, the announcement said.
the thing that i kind of told him - and, you know, he said the same thing about me. why would you keep all these things from me? i kept - i had the same reasoning with him and mom. i didn't tell them about sneaking out of the house or falling in love or kissing a girl or trying to go to a prom - all of those things because i didn't want them to worry. but everybody's worrying about what other people will think. the truth is still the truth, and it's the most powerful thing you can share with a person that you love. so it wasn't until, you know, my dad and my family seeing death that we had to be like, all right, we got to be on the same page, and we got to talk about this stuff.
aubrey: sure. well, we do have a preliminary snapshot of cases in the u.s. from the cdc. and the picture so far is similar to what was documented in china. coronavirus hits oldest people - older people the hardest. the cdc analysis found that about half of the people who've ended up in intensive care are 65 and older; the highest percentage of deaths in the u.s. has been among those 85 and older. now this is based on an analysis of about 500 patients admitted to the hospital in the u.s. - so not all of the cases. but here's something to be aware of - younger adults can be vulnerable too; about 20% of people hospitalized were in their 40s and 50s. and this may come as a surprise - about 20% were younger. so some millennials and gen xers have gotten seriously ill.
the language was stricken. baptist press reported that the resolution passed by a wide margin.
sex was added to title vii — the part of the law that prohibits employment discrimination — in an amendment put forward in late stages of debate of the bill that became the civil rights act. the group behind the amendment was what bagenstos calls a weird coalition of southern conservatives (who believed the word would be a poison pill that would doom the whole bill) and women's rights advocates (who thought it was an important and necessary protection).
this isn't hawke's first novel — early in his writing career he tried to steer away from autobiographical fiction, and was frustrated when reviewers kept trying to break down the smokescreen.
biden's election was welcomed by the vatican — but without mention of his support for abortion rights, says villanova university theology professor massimo faggioli.
toobin: well, i think there are a combination of reasons. in part, he is an originalist. he - in the mold of justice scalia and in simple terms, he thinks that the constitution should be interpreted as the meaning of the words were by the framers of the constitution so that if the - james madison didn't think he was establishing a woman's right to choose an abortion and if the authors of the 14th amendment didn't think they were - the meaning of the words then did not establish a right to an abortion, the constitution should never recognize it and the constitution should be frozen in amber in that way. and so in that respect, i think leo believes that the constitution simply does not recognize the right to an abortion.
the second amendment is not an option; it's not a suggestion, rubio said to cheers. it's a constitutional right of every american to be able to protect themselves. i am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in america he would. i am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the second amendment he would.
e harper: it was - yes. i think it was sending a message.
so before i knew it, i had a wonderful, light-hearted silly season press storm on my hands. and then i had dorset county council phoning me to thank me because 60,000 extra people had come to spend money on the dorset coast following this press storm. and then the council were begging me to come down to the beach and give a reading on chesil beach itself. so it was a sort of metafiction of the story. it was a piece of summer silliness, but all in good heart.

boudin: i was 14 months old, and i was at the babysitter when this happened. i couldn't even talk. i had no idea, of course, what my parents were doing that day. but let me first start by saying that i condemn the crime my parents participated in. i mourn the loss of life that that crime caused. and i know and think about all the time the fact that the three families that lost their husband, their father, their loved one, will never, ever be made whole. nothing i can do or my parents can do will ever bring those three men back.

lost wisdom pt. 2, released last year, is more than a continuation of a beloved collaboration; the sparsely decorated, deeply felt album meditates on a heart still breaking and mutating, but also gently reckons with a younger version of himself. that refrain on belief — performed here with only an electric guitar and a nylon-string acoustic bought in stockholm during that scandinavian trip many years ago — not only references the cathartic singalong but also flaming home from 2008's lost wisdom.
akhavan: it's so hard because i think growing up in america makes - or it made me very - i don't know if self-indulgent is the right word. i put myself first, and i see it in my brother. he does not put himself first. he puts other people first. he is much more about other people's comfort, and he's a surgeon. he's a doctor, and he helps people for a living. and i am much more selfish, and i see the iranians around me see themselves as part of a unit and part of a family and that their actions have consequences. and they want to make sure that everyone else around them is comfortable, and that never was my top priority. and it felt like breathing to be myself, and to be honest about who i was felt like breathing. but i knew that it hurt the people around me and that's sort of - it's weird to bring it back to the film conveniently here. that's why i wanted to make this film. that's what drew me to this - that these kids - they're suffering if they're not themselves. and that to try to brainwash them out of being themselves will damage them. and...

the book is not just about his own quest to find love and societal acceptance. it's also an account of the activism of india's marginalized sex workers and lgbt community as they battled violations of their human rights in the earliest days of the aids epidemic — having blood drawn without consent, for example.
perhaps of even greater significance is the finding that providing this coverage is cost-effective. untreated gender dysphoria leads to high rates of adverse — and expensive – outcomes, including hiv infection, depression, suicidality and drug abuse. the cost of accepting these outcomes outweighs the cost of treating their cause.

freshman sen. jennifer branning, a republican from philadelphia [miss.], presented the bill. she said it only has one goal: 'this bill in no way allows for discrimination by one person against another. what it does is it prohibits your government from discriminating against you with regard to your religious beliefs. that's the bottom line.' in all, debate lasted a little more than three hours, with many democrats arguing the bill was discriminatory against the lgbt community in mississippi. many drew distinct parallels between this bill and jim crow laws. sen. john horne of jackson says mississippi's history does not need to repeat itself. ... 'we don't need to put another stain on mississippi.'

tinker: well, morale was one. everybody was just very sick of losing. and so we addressed that by having a bunch of company meetings, you know, in person and connected by satellite to all the other locations, just letting people blow off steam, ask questions, make complaints and so on. and we began to, i think, get back on sort of a family feeling that i remembered at nbc in earlier days. and then we began - at first, by the way, the first couple of years, we didn't do much at all. we neatened it up and maybe cut some losses, but we didn't - our programs weren't that successful.

philip leaves stan with one more thing: he suspects that stan's new wife, renee, is a russian spy. but he is not sure. and then he gets in the car, and stan steps aside, and the family drives away. they have humiliated stan one last time on their way out of town, proving that he isn't faithful enough to his job to arrest, or to shoot, a family of russian spies if the family happens to be one he cares about. and they've planted an explosive inside his marriage that may or may not ever go off, but he will always know it's there.

and it's not only the inability to be indifferent. it's the inability not to feel awe or to feel wonder. and the whispering that max is talking about is just an expression of that wonder, that awe, the sort of revelatory moment of, i am much smaller than i thought. things are much bigger than i thought. so, you know, i do not belong to a synagogue. i, sort of like jacob, maintain a religious identity largely through double negatives. but as i've gotten older, i find myself doing that - different versions of that kind of whispering more and more often.

but anyway, here's the little letter (reading) sir, as the more than proud father of one shining person who happens to be a member of the lgbt community, i will be voting yes in the coming referendum. in that sense, it is a personal matter. i have read quite a bit in the papers about our new more tolerant society and that may be so, and, of course, it is a solid point of view from which to vote yes, but i don't see it as a matter of tolerance so much as apology, apology for all the hatred, violence, suspicion, patronization, ignorance, murder, maiming, hunting, intimidation, terrorizing, shaming, diminishment, discrimination, destruction, then yes intolerance visited upon a section of humanity for god knows how many hundreds of years if not millennia. my child will be just shy of 18 when the votes are cast, and therefore cannot vote himself. by voting yes, i will be engaging in the simple task of honoring the majesty, radiance and promise of his human soul.

marriage cases - you know, if it wasn't a real marriage case, they would have never been approved under any administration. so i wouldn't say at the interview level, it's harder. it's just delaying things. and frankly, it's really impacting people who want to work. so work authorizations are now taking between five and seven months - both the family and employment-based realm. so people who have jobs can't work. if they need to travel for emergency reasons or, you know, family events overseas, they can't do that.

doty centers his book around whitman's iconic poetry collection, leaves of grass. whitman anonymously self-published in 1855, revising and re-publishing the collection many times thereafter. grass is printer-speak for dummy pages that test the set and centering of text on a page. this pun adds a wonderful wrinkle to whitman's re-invention of poetry — his overflowing lines that lack rhyme and predictable meter, his use of white space where none had been before.

legend: oh, yeah. she definitely gets worse comments as a woman. and i think she's gotten more savvy at it over the years because she understands, you know, if she wants to deal with those kinds of responses, she knows when they'll come and what kind of things she could say that would either make those responses more likely or make them less likely. and so i think she's able to kind of decide for herself how much she wants to stir things up and how much she wants to just leave it alone. she doesn't let it get to her too much.

so he liked hanging out with her brothers. he had negro or colored friends. his two best friends - they drag-raced cars together. he worked. his father worked for one of the largest negro - i'm using the term that was, you know, the term used for black people at the time - the largest negro landowners in the county. and so they were used to mixing despite virulent jim-crow segregation that forced mildred to go to very inferior, colored schools. and richard went to the better-resourced white schools.
but eventually, he speaks. and it turns out he's quite nice. there's really - there's nothing about him that would make me skeptical or fearful. he's relatively attractive. he seems intelligent. he seems kind, sensible. like, i only notice, with relief, with tremendous relief, that he has good qualities. and, you know, you're thinking the whole time, it could be so much worse. it could be someone who's so fundamentalist, they won't even look at you even though they're supposed to be looking at you to decide if they're going to marry you. you could be with someone who is selfish or who is pigheaded or diffident. i mean, there's so many ways that things could go wrong. so in that moment, i'm just thinking, well, there is nothing i can pinpoint that's bad.

turkle: my grandfather was the manager of a times square movie theater. but really being the manager of a times square movie theater meant that you were a bouncer. during the war, he had worked at the docks in brooklyn and then at the navy pier, i think. and then after the war, he'd again worked on the docks. and then he went through a very troubled time where he couldn't find work. and my aunt found him a job as the manager of one of the branch theaters in times square. it was one of those theaters where he called them his bums used to kind of live. so these were men who were pretty much homeless, but they came into the theater at kind of 8 o'clock in the morning and they stayed until it closed, maybe at 3 o'clock in the morning. so they - the theater was open maybe 19 out of the 24 hours a day. and then these men would be on the street, and then they'd come back in the theater and it was their home. and my grandfather was a very strict disciplinarian in this theater, but he kind of took care of these men. and he had respect for them if they, you know, didn't take drugs and didn't drink in the theater. and he had a kind of caretaking relationship with them.
gross: and i thought that was particularly funny because, you know, all those years you were playing mary tyler moore you had no idea what it was like to be single.

remi's talk about the tangles of creative partnership coincided with the recent instagram live verzuz battle between producers kenneth babyface edmonds and teddy riley. i tend to think more often about babyface than riley because, either by himself or with partners antonio l.a. reid and darryl simmons, babyface has created hits with (among others) the whispers, pebbles, whitney houston, johnny gill, boyz ii men, tevin campbell and tlc — these artists are beacons in my life. plus, babyface as performing artist has always been a favorite. the sunglasses, brown skin and high cheekbones. his turns of phrase, the relaxed way he plays guitar — all of it appeals.
feldman: i was about, i would say, 8 or 9 at that point. prior to that, i had lived with an aunt and uncle about four blocks away. and i wanted to move in with my grandparents. i asked for that. i don't think it was ever the plan. i think the plan was to always keep me going from aunt to aunt - and i had many aunts, and i had many cousins - because everyone felt my grandmother was too old and that she had already raised her 11 children and sort of deserved the rest. but we had something, my grandmother and i. we had a very interesting, unique relationship that i think no one else really understood.

foer: oh, absolutely, yeah. you know, i sometimes can't remember what's in my books and what's in my life. i think in this book, there's a moment when the grandfather - isaac, the great-grandfather - refers to his offspring as his revenge against the germans. and i remember my grandmother saying that to me. you know, she would say, like, other people have diamonds and pearls. you're my diamonds and pearls. you're my revenge. her happiness - this gets back to the idea of different definitions of happiness and the ways that the definition itself can preclude the having of it - her definition of happiness was completely bound up in response to what had happened to her family. and, you know, her joy was her revenge.

this story is totally false and ridiculous. the picture is one of thousands taken out of respect for people asking to have their picture taken with mr. trump. mr. trump does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her. this is just another attempt by the clinton campaign to defame a candidate who just today is number one in three different polls. anyone who would pay thugs to incite violence at a rally against american citizens, as was released on video, will stop at nothing. just another example of the clinton campaign trying to rig the election.

but many trump affiliates benefited in ways that are perfectly legal. attorney william s. consovoy, who argued before an appeals court last fall that trump could shoot someone on fifth avenue and be shielded from all consequences (the judges were unpersuaded), brought in $2 million from the rnc and trump-campaign committees. others sought the ultimate benefit: freedom. roger stone, who would not turn on trump despite the threat of jail time, was one of many trump loyalists and allies to receive clemency from the president. to be sure, a lot of people found ways to benefit from trump's time in office: journalists, progressive nonprofits, high earners — trump donors or not. but trump profiteers went far beyond what used to count as standard-issue washington swampiness. new york partnered with wnyc's trump, inc. podcast to identify 51 such insiders, whose unprecedented ability to gain from the trump presidency will go down in history. their schemes became ever more brazen these past four years, even as their goals shifted. the initial grifts tended to be strictly transactional on the model of the trump organization itself, through which the trump name could be had by nearly anyone for the right price. later on, not just money but power became the president's currency. the quids became subtler: shielding trump from legal consequences, investigating a political opponent, providing an intellectual rationale for understanding the presidency as trump sees it — not as a civic duty but as a business.

manzoor: there is. it's this expectation that a woman is supposed to be pure, untouched, so that she's worthy of a man. that being why a woman is worthy, to me, it just diminishes us as human beings. so whether it's being covered in a veil or whether it's wearing a white dress because you're saying my virginity is the most important thing about me, that's oppressive, just inherently.

so you never expected to be covering the trump campaign. you were an nbc correspondent based in london. you'd come to the u.s. because you were asked by a teenager through the make-a-wish foundation to shadow you for a day. so you generously came to the states so that, you know, you could see him, he could shadow you. how did that lead to covering the trump campaign?

and a case that tests whether there is a constitutional limit to the practice of partisan gerrymandering. at issue is whether the party in power can perpetuate and increase its influence by packing its opponents into a small number of legislative districts, or carefully dispersing its opponents into so many different districts that the opposing party has little to no chance of winning in most districts. partisan gerrymandering has existed since the founding of the republic, but with the advent of high-powered computers, the practice has become so refined — and effective — that increasingly, congressional districts and state legislative districts have been all but walled off from competition.

this is also a series that seems to reveal some challenges with the netflix model, and with the way it's been applied to this adaptation. a saga has a beginning, middle and end; this first season is made up of a little bit of beginning and then a great deal of middle, with ultimately no end at all. if there is no second season, it will be a very odd artifact. novels can be adapted into series, to be sure, but this isn't the right way to do it.

the 23-year-old alto saxophonist immanuel wilkins's stunning debut album works to sonically illustrate the perils of systemic violence geared towards black america through evocatively titled songs like ferguson - an american tradition and an homage to mary turner, who was killed in 1918 by a white mob while eight months pregnant after a white plantation owner was killed by a disenfranchised black worker, setting off lynch mobs of angry white citizens in valdosta, ga. despite the rumination on violence, wilkins' debut offering is sensual, with light touches of free-jazz that don't overwhelm the senses. his music is sensitive and embodies visceral imagination with balanced tonality amongst his band and conscious undertones of searing beauty in the midst of his exploration of such powerful themes. –jordannah elizabeth

having this self-awareness — otherwise known as mindfulness — which is what's developed through the process of seeing your distractions and then beginning again (gently over and over and over again), that is a game-changing skill. because ... this nonstop conversation ... is a central feature of your life — whether you know it or not, we're all walking around with this inner narrator that if we broadcast loud, you would be locked up. and when you're unaware of this cacophony internally, it's owning you all the time. and what we're doing in meditation is dragging all of this nonsense out of the shadows and into the light.

simon: i mean, you've got to ask. they have a majority in the house of representatives, and there's probably never been greater public attention to some of the issues being raised about immigration than ever before. why can't they get it passed?

mcinerny started her podcast, which deals with grief and how to cope, after she endured her own unimaginable losses: she had a miscarriage and lost her father and husband to cancer all within several weeks in 2014. she says she hasn't set her hopes too high for 2021, and that's alright, because 2020 taught her a very important lesson. it has taught me the joy of being ok. a good day is not a 10. a good day is a 5. a 10 is exceptional, she says.

given the completeness with which the lovings won their historical moment — and their victory's symbolic impact not just on race, but as a harbinger for the same-sex marriage battle decades later — a cinematic portrayal of the events risks the potential potholes of recreating recent history. it's a story in which the opposition has already been thoroughly discredited by time, and the outcome of the characters' lives assured by history.
toobin: well, that's really the story that i wrote in the new yorker is how leonard leo, this really - this person who has never held government office, who's never been a law professor, who doesn't give speeches, who doesn't, you know, write books, how he of all people in the world became, in effect, the guy who picked supreme court justices for republican presidents. and it's really the story of the growth of the federalist society, which is, you know, it's interesting. a lot of democrats, when they talk about the federalist society, they make it sound like it's something out of the da vinci code, like it's some secret cabal. there's nothing secret about the federalist society. it is a group that - it was originally started by law students who felt that there was too much liberal influence on law school campuses and faculties. so they started holding meetings, and they started bringing in guest speakers. and it expanded dramatically in the '80s under the reagan presidency.
conway: well, you know, i had grown up with a neurotic family, and the thing that i think that gave me was the capacity to live through other people's moods and keep my own balance. i wouldn't recommend that as a good training for anyone, but it turned out to stand me in very good stead. and my husband was so open and direct about facing the problems he had to deal with very deep mood swings that when he came out of them, we would always be able to analyze what had happened. and i gradually learned that at those points, i just had to wait for him to reappear as his usual, positive and constructive self. but, you know, we all manage to live with somebody with acute physical ailments, and those problems of emotional swings are no different.

minhaj: my younger sister ayesha was born in the states. and then at - two months after her birth, she went to go live with my grandparents and be raised there. so i didn't officially, officially, you know, get a chance to really meet her until i was 8. you know, and so that, i think, you know, the tough thing was, again, a lot of immigrant households when you come to the states, you don't have the sort of bandwidth and setup to accommodate a lot of things.
it's very hard to describe it after that except to say that we improvise together at the same time, in the same room. it's a kind of unique way of working for us. most people do not work that way. either somebody hands somebody a melody or - and - or somebody hands somebody a lyric. we - that never happens to us or almost never. and for the 26 or so years that we've been together, that's always been the way we work.
this 2015 study investigates the differences in racial preferences between white gay and straight online daters--the first to analyze the racial preferences of gays and lesbians in the mate selection process by directly observing online behavioral dynamics rather than stated preference. the authors note that white lesbians and straight men show the weakest same-race preference, followed by gay men, while straight women show the strongest same-race preference. our results indicate that white gay men's higher rates of interracial cohabitation are driven more by constrained dating markets, while lesbians' appear to be driven by more open racial preferences.
in such a world, marriages break up, and social bonds fray. the institutions that once provided ballast to working-class life — unions and mainstream churches — have proven largely ineffectual against the tectonic forces now reshaping the global economy.
negin farsad: leslie tarpot, a topeka, kan., native, may be the first person to ever pop the question in a confessional. it all started innocently 20 years ago with her going to sunday mass at the sacred heart catholic church at topeka to hear father stevens deliver his sermons. she found herself daydreaming about stevens' message, how he made transubstantiation sound so sultry and seductive but, like, in a god-fearing way.
giese: yes, title vii, which was written into law in 1964 by president johnson. and i started to do research. i went down to the downtown la courthouse, and i found that six very courageous women in the directors guild in 1979 had got the dga, our union, to file a class action lawsuit against several major studios. and that action alone sent the numbers skyrocketing from 0.5% to 16% in just 10 years from 1985 to 1995. so i knew the way to move the numbers and to make real significant change was through legal action. and that's what i set my mind to do.
conway: yes. you know, it's always interested me, so many families where there were young children, and a very highly educated wife would say to me, janie can't afford to work. by the time we replaced her work in the house and bought the clothes that she'll need to have a professional life, she won't be earning any money. and i was always fascinated that it was assumed that the woman alone was responsible for replacing her domestic labor.

there are 20 songs in total on the album, some of them informal sketches and others that feel as sturdily and carefully built as an old chest of drawers. what comes after certainty is an intoxicating love song, its message sounding a universal chord even as callahan gets specific with his lyrics (and, significantly, name-checks willie nelson). circles is set at a hospital deathbed; it leads into when we let go, an openhearted elegy. in fact, the album's running threads of domesticity and devotion can hardly be unwoven from its ruminations on mortality.
i do think that they do have a say-so on your finances. if you're coming back home, they ought to see that you're saving. they ought to see that you're trying to make a way to get out of debt, if that's why you came back home. because once you come back into my house, i want to see everything. i want to see a budget. i want to see a plan. and i think they have a right to see that.

in addition, access to food, access to any other kinds of activities within the prison require moving, usually in large groups, from one place to another. and so it's for those reasons, among others, that medical professionals have been pointing out the extreme risks that jails and prisons pose not just to the people who are incarcerated there, like my father, but also to all of the correctional officers, sheriff's deputies, public health officials and staff who work in jails and prisons.
so it seems that pence was in the room and knew better and that when he came out and gave that misleading statement to the public that it could be construed as a cover-up, and it could be construed that he was involved in some kind of obstruction of justice for participating in a meeting about firing comey because of the investigation.
what trump has said about him: if he says great things about me, i'm going to say great things about him. i've already said, he is really very much of a leader. i mean, you can say, oh, isn't that a terrible thing — the man has very strong control over a country. now, it's a very different system, and i don't happen to like the system. but certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader. ... he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters....

this view of kids, becker argued, is a modern development. in the old agricultural economy, parents viewed their babies as profitable investments that could help them out on the farm and care for them in old age. that, and the fact that raising kids was relatively cheap, was an incentive to have lots of them. when kids morphed from little servants into expensive luxuries, it made sense to have fewer of them. in the 1960s, birth control began empowering people to do this more effectively.

book: less, by andrew sean greer
this convention is interesting in that what they need to do is help the country like hillary clinton. a majority of americans say they don't like her. nearly 70 percent say they don't trust her. even those who say they'll vote for her don't trust her. and so i think trust, likability, what are her real motivations - those are the main goals of the campaign going into this convention.
but when the nazis came to power, suddenly this man, of course, was somehow humiliated that he worked for some czechs, which is, you know, not a race or nation, which is, you know, up to the nazis or german statute (ph). and by sheer coincidence, this man ended up in the gestapo in corleen (ph), which was the town under which - chanslaff (ph), a little town in the middle of bohemia was under. and when he got all these names, and he saw the names of my parents - first my father and then my mother - he just slammed the paper with a stamp which said the return undesirable, and that's it. and then they perished.
chozick: yes, absolutely, not only has there been sort of embarrassing information, but there's been a lot about the donor relationship, private information about how the sort of wheels are greased. and, frankly, all of that has given fuel to the bernie sanders movement, not just that it showed that the democratic national committee was helping get hillary clinton elected, but it just showed the influence of money in politics and i think a way, a very crass way, that people are already uncomfortable with and sort of assumed existed.
mr. sharlet: yeah. there's something wrong with it. a lot of that kind of travel is illegal under the 2007 open government act, which was passed in response to the abramoff scandal, especially when you look at some of these trips that would be sponsored by one nonprofit entity under the family's umbrella, but taken at the behest of another organization like christian embassy, another sort of christian right ministry in washington for elites.

it was just intense. you know, fox news and some of the conservative media kind of ran with it. you know, these things take on a life of their own. and so you can write and think, this is a balanced story and then not really know where it goes from there. but, i mean, even, you know, even stories that are positive can spark a backlash.

the wedding sparked a backlash and nomination challenge from bob good that may cost riggleman his seat when local republicans members meet this weekend for a convention to ratify their party's candidates this fall's election. for good, a born-again evangelical christian and former liberty university athletics director, riggleman's laissez-faire approach to same-sex marriage is emblematic of failings that make him unfit for office.

dean's literary bash is as stimulating and insightful as its roster of guests. she not only encapsulates their biographies and achievements with remarkable concision, but also connects the dots between them. her survey charts a through-line between these trailblazing writers who openly defied gendered expectations and came up in a world that was not eager to hear women's opinions about anything. she flags intriguing points of connection and friction in their attitudes towards feminism, communism, and various male artists, including j.d. salinger and woody allen. revisiting the ugly lawsuit between lillian hellman and mary mccarthy, she provides a contrast with the uncommonly close friendship between mccarthy and arendt. several notable contemporaries — like zora neale hurston, elizabeth hardwick, and doris lessing — don't get their due, but dean manages to shoehorn in a few mentions.
it turns out — and you would never know this from the way political debates go in this country — but more than 6 in 10 americans support the first option: allowing them a path to citizenship. we first started polling on this question in 2012, and we have seen consistently across the board, there's been almost no movement on this question since 2012.
we're witnessing an astonishing demographic shift, buckles says. for the first time in american history, women aged 30-34 have the highest fertility rate of all age brackets. younger women are having far fewer unintended pregnancies, accounting for about a third of the overall decline in births since 2007. buckles believes the remaining two-thirds of the decline is the product of a generation deciding they're not ready for marriage and kids.

a little after 8 a.m., he left the apartment in his gray flannel suit. the slacks were cuffed but scuffed and the sleeves conspicuously short - fine fabric but frayed. this gave charles a certain look, like a gentleman without a gentleman's bank account. he picked the brown leather brogues with nicked toes, then the seal brown trooper hat instead of the fedora. the trooper hat's brim showed its age and wear, and this was good for his hustle, too. last, he took the guitar case, essential to complete the look. he left the guitar itself at home with his bedridden father. inside, he carried only a yellow book, not much larger than a pack of cards. in the apartment, charles thomas tester went by charles. but on the street, everyone knew him as tommy - tommy tester, always carrying a guitar case. this wasn't because he aspired to be a musician. in fact, he could barely remember a handful of songs, and his singing voice might be described kindly as wobbly. his father, who had made a living as a bricklayer, and his mother, who spent her life working as a domestic, had loved music. dad played guitar and mother could really stroll on a piano. it was only natural that tommy tester ended up drawn to performing. the only tragedy being that he lacked talent. he thought of himself as an entertainer. there were others who would have called him a scammer, a swindler, a con.

he received a standing ovation and then launched into an impassioned defense of hillary clinton and the united states.
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. we're going to talk about what it's like to cover hillary clinton, who last night became the first woman to be nominated for president by a major party. my guest, amy chozick, is a national political reporter for the new york times. she's written extensively about the clintons since 2007 when she started reporting on the presidential campaign for the wall street journal. she covered hillary clinton's primary run against barack obama. and when obama became the democratic nominee, chozick covered him. i spoke with chozick this morning in philadelphia, where she's reporting on the democratic national convention.

albright: i think that he is the most anti-democratic president that we have had in modern history and that his instincts are really in that direction. and i think that that's what worries him. and the passage that you read really does show that what he's trying to do is undermine the press and has disdain for the judiciary and the electoral process and minorities. and i think that his instincts are not ones that are democratic. and he is interested basically in, i think, exacerbating those divisions that i talked about. and so i am very concerned. and basically, this is - you know, i'd written the book because i have picked up that phrase, see something, say something. and i am seeing some things that are the kinds of things that we've seen in other countries. and so i'm saying not only should we say something, but we have to do something about it.

donald trump, when he became a real estate developer, worked particularly aggressive to develop his government ties. when he was running for president, he talked about this openly. he said, i contribute to people, and when i call them, they give to me. he understood a transactional relationship with government - that government was there to help along private businesses and to help his family's business interests. when you have wealthy people controlling government over democratic processes, you are approaching an oligarchy. and that is where we are now in america.
diamond: ...while also watching price's plane come in for a landing at dulles. but i guess the backstory is at politico, we believe in covering every agency like it's a mini-white house. i'm a health care reporter, so that means digging into key leaders of the health department - hhs - just like white house reporters dug into michael flynn or steve bannon or gary cohn. so tom price, obviously, someone that we're going to track and follow - it was actually very hard to track him in his early months because his staff did not put out his schedule and often wouldn't tell people where he was or what he was doing until a few days after it happened.

from my point of view, hayley being a woman has never been the point, says paramore's taylor york. it's something to celebrate, but not in a way that makes it seem as though she's joined some sort of elite club that is allowed to run with the boys. i've seen her outshine man after man over the years, but what's important isn't that she outshined men, although it's always so badass to witness, it's that she is a phenomenal singer, writer, and artist, and she deserves recognition for those things. i'll never understand why these societal paths to recognition and equality for women, or anyone who identifies otherwise, are at all different from that of men.
minhaj: they are very similar. when i got to college, that's when i was first exposed to stand-up comedy. again, i had never - i didn't know what it was. my - you know, my parents didn't let us have cable television. so i thought stand-up comedy was the stuff that seinfeld did before seinfeld where he's just like, like, hey, you ever notice - like what's the deal with laundry? and i was always like, oh, i hate that part of seinfeld.

parker: yeah, i agree with what cokie has said. i mean, none of your business is never the right answer if you're running for president because as she says, everything is your business. but of course, the reason donald trump doesn't want to have anyone look as his tax returns is because one, he probably does not have as much money as he says he does, doesn't - that's - most people on the republican side who are not trump supporters think that's the case. and then also his tax rate - at least he was honest about that. he doesn't pay enough taxes in the view of people who are looking very closely at raising tax rates on the rich.

in a previous life, i worked for a hospital consulting firm, and hospitals used to have many more beds than they do now. they very aggressively have cut back on their capacity because they didn't want to have a lot of empty wards that they weren't using. that may make sense at normal times, but in a crisis moment, it means there's only so many beds to go around. health officials don't want a crunch of people rushing to the hospital at the same time. it's bad for coronavirus patients, and it's just as bad for everyone else if doctors are spread thin and worn down.
moore: yes. i don't remember exactly what year it was. i think it might have been the second year or the - maybe no. i think it was the first year. and he was so successful. i mean, he was a unique character. no one had ever seen anybody like him as a continuing role in a series. and people were mistaking him for the character he played, which is so often true for those of us in television. and they would - and of course both their - the first name was the same ted, ted. and they were calling him stupid and, oh, you're the funniest dumbbell we ever met. and, boy, are you dumb and stupid, and somebody called him a dumb schmuck. and he came in to jim brooks and allan burns' office. actually it was only allan in the office this day. and he was unable to speak.

the band's 1999 self-titled debut plays like a love letter to the summer's end, soaked in the sticky complexity of teenage emotion. with songs like i'll see you when we're both not so emotional and the now-iconic never meant, the timing of the album's september release made it the perfect antidote to a long, humid months of anticipating goodbyes. while the band garnered success on college radio, the least anticipated farewell was that of the band itself, which disbanded shortly after the album's release.

for a thoroughly charming read, don't miss love at first by kate clayborn. everything changed for will sterling at the age of 16, when his mother, seemingly inexplicably, dragged him to visit his previously unknown uncle donny – for reasons that turned out to be very traumatic. the only bright spot was the blurry image of a girl on the balcony upstairs and the sweet sound of her voice. years later, he's doctor will sterling, his vision corrected with glasses, and he's inherited his uncle's apartment, which he plans to renovate for short term rentals and then sell. the only problem is the girl. she's still there. and she's not a fan of his plans.

gaines-cirelli: my heart has been broken for years now as we have been in this struggle. and i have to say that 2019's general conference was particularly painful for me, personally. i had worked hard. foundry united methodist church and so many other partners had worked very, very hard to try to find a way for us to do something that felt like we could stay together as a family, even in the midst of such painful disagreement. so in this moment, i feel both that same pain because we've gotten to this point, but i'm also feeling hopeful because i've begun to come around to a place of resolve, you know?

nick bogner: something that's really clear throughout history is that we are really afraid of the unknown. and in a time like this, when we are dealing with so much of the unknown and so much unpredictability, i think marriage really symbolizes a sense of permanency and stability and reliability to a lot of people.
in dept. of speculation, offill's narrator is called a truth bomb and a person about whom no one has ever said ... you make it look so easy. the same might be said for sympathetic lizzie, who again deploys sharp wit (plus a series of corny jokes forwarded from her boss) to deflect anxiety. this is what she has to say, for example, about coming down from a flirtation that was like a wartime romance. minus the war. minus the sex: and then it is another day and another and another but i will not go on about this because no doubt you too have experienced time.

and the reason those emails crashed was because seema verma's part of the department had run this massive email test at the exact same time without telling anyone, and it took down the system. this was the latest in a series of different it decisions that seema verma and her team had made. it led to frustration in the moment and some bad feelings to the point that the career it division of the health department - so these are not trump appointees; these are people who have worked in the government for years - made the call to just take away email responsibility from seema verma and assign it to a different part of hhs.

so she sent me out of the line. and then everyone went inside. she closed the door. and i was standing there looking at the door. i was wearing my most beloved pink raincoat and red galoshes. and it's drizzling rain. and i looked at that big door, and i thought, i am never wearing this raincoat again. it was pink. and that was that literal 7-year-old mind. so then to go home and try to tell my parents what a horrible day it was and to hear an ideological argument about why i have to get over it was not - it was not something that i could - that brain, that age of brain, could really absorb. so to me, it felt like, suddenly, nobody liked me anymore, something was wrong with me. and it took a few years to overcome that.

we didn't always just do terrible things and terrible things weren't only done to us. and if he had said it to me maybe right when the book came out, i think i would've been too raw and defensive, you know? but with some years' distance, i realized that on some level what he was saying was if all you do is wallow in this kind of urban misery, it turns into a kind of, like, urban misery porn that can do quite well - if you write well and you write black misery with some literary flair, there is an avenue for that and there are writers from earlier generations who did that with true genius and were bringing news to the world about something fresh and interesting, but i felt like what my friend was saying was, you didn't bring all the news from our time, you just brought the news that in some way you knew people wanted to hear, and that's not the job of an artist.

and, by the same token, recognizing that we do not do nearly enough for crime victims - focusing on punishment and retribution is not healing the harm that victims have suffered, and it's also failing to rehabilitate people who commit crimes. and that's why we have such high recidivism rates, and it's why we have such high dissatisfaction rates with people in communities that are impacted by crime. those realizations for me have and will always be intimate, personal.

after nearly fifty years, blue remains the clearest and most animated musical map to the new world that women traced, sometimes invisibly, within their daily lives in the aftermath of the utopian, dream-crushing 1960s. it is a record full of love songs, of sad songs; but more than that, it is a compendium of reasonable demands that too many men in too many women's lives heard, in 1971, as pipe dreams or outrageous follies. all i really, really want our love to do, is to bring out the best in me and in you, too, mitchell sang to an elusive partner on the album's first track. that line, like so many of the melodic and lyrical gestures throughout blue, is simple, but so radical. with the counterculture collapsing under the weight of its machismo-driven mythologies, women pushed forward with calls to imagine genuine equality in real life — in the private places where love and art is made. blue articulates that demand and its effects more clearly than any other work of art. musically, it reflects mitchell's belief in what she's called the feminine appetite for intimacy, with her nearly naked guitar playing, appalachian dulcimer and occasional piano dominating the mix. yet its rhythms and unexpected flights of melody also reveal mitchell's movement toward the deeper improvisational waters of jazz, a sonic illustration for her love of crossing lines, the white lines of the highway or the generic ones of the recording studio.

chozick: well, i think the best symbol of that is that, you know, in 2008, we all rode on the same plane as you do covering a candidate. we rode on the same plane, and she would come back with a glass of wine or she would come back to talk to us. i'm not saying the access was ever as good as we wanted, but we saw her regularly, especially when she started to lose. she sort of let it go a little bit more, talked to reporters, especially the reporters who covered her, who she knew. at one point, on valentine's day, she called our significant others to apologize for keeping us away from them. this time she flies in her own plane. the press is in a separate plane with no aides, and she is in a private plane with her aides, you know, somewhere in the clouds in front of us. and so to me, that is sort of a symbol of how the access has changed. she hasn't done a real press conference in months. and i'm not sure she's going to, frankly. she doesn't like that format. she doesn't feel like it, you know, is fair to her. and so she's been very - she's been very inaccessible. she does - of course, her aides say she does interviews all the time, which she does.

dp: right. that's why i became a fan of him, was because of that introspection. but he would like get there, and then it would turn left to some wild devaluing of the woman. specifically i was like, i wanna do this without devaluing women, or devaluing other guys. it's a thing of status if i'm sleeping with your girl. ... over on the christian side, i feel like it's like, we just don't talk about relationships, especially not the ups and downs. and if we do, we make one platitude-filled, base-level, almost obligatory song about marriage.
after a painful scalp reduction surgery to remove a bald spot, donald trump confronted his then-wife, who had previously used the same plastic surgeon.  'your f[******] doctor has ruined me!' trump cried. what followed was a 'violent assault,' according to lost tycoon. donald held back ivana's arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. he tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.  'then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. ivana is terrified... it is a violent assault,' hurt writes. 'according to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, 'he raped me.' following the incident, ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there 'crying for the rest of night.' when she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there. as she looks in horror at the ripped-out hair scattered all over the bed, he glares at her and asks with menacing casualness: 'does it hurt?' hurt writes.

and i'm very worried about this kind of haphazard approach to this where on one day, president trump is talking about a rocket man and doing his kind of normal gross language about things. and then all of a sudden, he's prepared to meet. and these meetings, you really have to be prepared for the meetings themselves. we have no ambassador in south korea. the main person that was doing the korean - the main person that was really working on korea in the state department has resigned. and so it's a combination of lack of preparation, lack of personnel and a president who is kind of going in a different direction every other day. so i think it is a dangerous situation. it's a dangerous situation if we don't have diplomatic talks. but it's also dangerous in terms of the back and forth.

the fundamentalist group the family has operated secretively with the help of influential congressmen and senators who are members of the group to promote their anti-gay, anti-abortion, pro-free-market ideas in america and other parts of the world, but two sex scandals involving people connected with the family -nevada senator john ensign and south carolina governor mark sanford - have brought public attention to the group.
bill kurtis: paula and hari have two. amy has three.
turkle: well, we've missed each other. we've missed that full embrace of the human because we've spent so much time on zoom. when you're on zoom, you give the other person the impression of eye contact by staring at a green light when you're really not seeing anything at all. so to give somebody the impression of empathy, you end up looking at nothing, and that's pretend empathy and that's not where real empathy is born. so i think we've missed - we've had an experience where we've really missed each other in a very profound way. and i think we can't wait to get back to each other. on the other hand, there's a great danger because the thing that being on screens does for us, whether in a pandemic or not in a pandemic, is it makes us feel less vulnerable. and we become accustomed to enjoying that lack of vulnerability by doing so much of our personal business and our business business hidden behind a screen. and i think that there's a danger that we will allow that to carry over to our post pandemic life more than we should.

but then many, michel, are talking about their faith and how their faith motivates them, how it drives them. and our leadership summits have always been about principle over politics. we want to get to know about a person's faith. we want to get to know about what motivates a person, what drives them. and then how does that translate into policy and politics and governmental leadership? so we invited the top seven as it was polling right now - former vice president biden, senator sanders, senator warren, cory booker, kamala harris, beto o'rourke and mayor pete buttigieg. we'd love it if all seven would say yes.

and, finally, aol was one of the pioneers of the advertising business model later in their history. they started claiming billions of dollars of revenue. later on, it turned out that most of that revenue, one way or another, was fabricated, that they were booking the same line of revenue twice or doing all sorts of other things. eventually, the securities and exchange commission went after them, and the company got in a lot of trouble. but, by then, most of the founders and the early executives were gone. so aol sort of introduced our present in this sense of moving the internet and the web into something that was social advertising driven and, you know, we're sort of living in that reality right now.

giese: well, that was the thing. you know, what we tend to do when we don't succeed is to blame ourselves, and women were so siloed off in this industry we really didn't have any means of communication. but what i did, also as geena, was start looking at the numbers, and i started to notice that only 4% of studio features were directed by women, and only 13% of episodic tv shows were directed by women. and i couldn't get the numbers on women in commercials, which is the most lucrative category of directing, but i spoke to some big executives in the commercial world who told me that the number was less than 1%.

a famous young actor's marriage to a pop mega-star is crumbling. to get away from the real-life drama, william harding immerses himself in the role of hotspur in glittering broadway production of shakespeare's henry iv.
conway: yes, i do. i think that it is, in many ways, the form of narrative that is most gripping to contemporary readers. i think we read it the way 19th century people read dickens or hardy or somebody like that. and i think it's because it's in writing memoirs that we are obliged to say what the total constellation of all our roles means to us. and that's the real dilemma of the modern consciousness. we have this sense of an inner core of being which is us, which looks out and comments on life and experience - and which is part of, but not subsumed by all the roles that we play.
of course, i had wanted - in the jet song, to be when the [expletive] hits the fan, not when the spit hits the fan. and on the whole mother-loving, mother-[expletive] street. and - but the audience understood exactly what we were saying. it did kind of make it a little kidlike. and then when we did the revival this last year and arthur decided to utilize spanish for the sharks, sometimes to speak - that they would speak to each other in spanish, he wanted to make it more, quote, realistic. and that's what led to that.
but i think it deepened the portrayal of men, too. gruff lou grant got heart-sick to tears when his wife walked out of their long marriage. you could see, in ted baxter's silver-haired bluster, the bombast of a man who was scared he couldn't measure up to his own 8 x 10 glossy image. the mary tyler moore show was a sitcom that showed women who were on their own, and happy, and men who could tell them how being on your own didn't always make you as happy as you'd hoped.
he says he's innocent, and i think you have to remember that, trump said.
but it's - they've been moving apart from each other for 15 years, basically since they started. the title of the book here i am refers to a passage in genesis, the binding of isaac which begins and then god put abraham to the test. he said abraham. abraham said here i am, and then god said i need you to sacrifice your beloved son. and then a few sentences later, he's leading isaac up mt. moriah. and isaac begins to sense that something is odd. here we have all of the makings of a sacrifice without the crucial ingredient of the animal to sacrifice. and he says, my father, and abraham says, here i am, a direct echo. and it's a very poignant moment.

roiphe's personal revelations in the power notebooks are part self-defense, part risky exposure to further attacks. just don't call them apologies: she has learned that there are things you can't apologize for... apologies themselves can turn into elaborate narcissistic performances, into self-justifications. she acknowledges that her first husband — with whom she remains close — may well have an entirely different take on their failed marriage.
williams has taken a lot of bullets, though, throughout the band's existence. whenever paramore had internal turmoil – not something uncommon when you gather a group of fiercely creative, fiercely independent people together, and ask that creativity to also be commerce – the public blame always seemed to paint williams as the villain, the most impossible one, the one with an ulterior motive. none of this synched with reality, but it's exactly where we often situate a powerful, central female force: they must be looking for something else, something more, her actions the whims of a drama queen.

some of her narrators at first seem befuddled simply by themselves or their social worlds. the friends in scary sites are parsing art-world dating after #metoo; christine, the narrator of recognition of this world is not the invention of it, is attempting to work out whether she wants to continue in her marriage, or her life. always, though, a philosophical question lurks beneath ives's stories' surfaces. both christine and the friends in scary sites are confronting the fundamental, immoral fact that, as christine puts it, [t]he way things work is, everything is possible and everything is permitted. if that's true, how is a person in a secular world supposed to know how to act?

dm: ...when mike brown was killed in st louis, i remember being like, yo, this is messed up. all of the sudden, i started getting people saying, i'm never gonna listen to your music again. ...that was kind of a shocker, because i never thought that christian people... regardless of what you feel one side or another [politically], there's still a way that you talk to people and treat people and sympathize and empathize with people. it's crazy when you think about how christianity has almost married itself to politics and power. when you look at it, it's almost like, we'll find any way of making more money and having more power, or keeping money and keeping power—we'll find any way to make that godly. so i've been on this journey just kind of trying to figure out where do i live within that? on one end i am a christian. i love god. on the other end, the things that's evangelicals, specifically white evangelicals, have said about african-americans, i don't reflect those things, and most of the people i'm around don't reflect those things. just hearing how people will talk, i'm like, you're a christian! i performed at your church! i know your family! how could you say that about people that look like me?

lloyd has opposed contraception. he's been involved in broader issues related to ending life. he had worked with terri schiavo's parents, if your listeners remember that case - terri schiavo, who was essentially brain dead and the issue of whether or not to end her life. but lloyd had gotten involved in that fight too. what is interesting, terry, is he's running this office about refugee resettlement, but up until this point, he had no expertise in refugee resettlement. he was really more known for his cultural beliefs and work in health care around what advocates would say are pro-life issues.
albright: well, i think that - there are several things that i'm hearing. one is that people have no idea what trump is actually trying to do to really terrific confusion about that in terms of how democracies have supported each other in the past and that the united states has really been, as we have all spoken about it, is the beacon of freedom and hope. and all of a sudden, we are not viewed as that. and, in fact, the opposite, which is that trump supports and praises people like orban or kuczynski in poland and then he goes, for instance, to poland and stands next to the leader and is very happy that they have in fact lowered the role of their judiciary or are speaking against the press.

the cdc, the centers for disease control, recognized that and promised that new tests would be distributed soon. but one day turned into two days turned into three days turned into several weeks, and in the meantime, we know now coronavirus was silently spreading in different communities, like seattle. by the time that the trump administration made a decision to allow new tests to be developed by hospitals by clinical laboratories, it was a step that was seen as multiple weeks late. and now as we talk in march, there are concerns that maybe there aren't enough materials to keep producing tests down the line - so a series of planning failures and missed opportunities to really get ahead of a problem.

trump had backed strange then, too, but steve bannon — his former chief strategist who has since returned to lead breitbart news — supported moore and rallied with him in the closing days. bannon had long touted moore as part of the war he had promised to wage on the gop establishment, backing challengers to sitting incumbents who would take on mcconnell and support trump's agenda. but other national strategists warned bannon's civil war would cost them winnable seats — something that came to fruition on tuesday night.

if confirmed by the senate, price would likely have a central role in the republicans' stated plans to dismantle the affordable care act and design a replacement. he has repeatedly introduced legislation to repeal and replace the aca and is one of hundreds of republicans who have voted dozens of times to repeal the federal health care law since it was enacted in 2010. those efforts either didn't make it to president obama's desk or were vetoed by him.
he invited the brutal philippine leader, rodrigo duterte, to the white house during a very friendly phone call sunday. on tuesday, trump has another call — this one with russian president vladimir putin.

king: last question for you - does joe biden need the support of bernie sanders supporters if he's to win in november? does he need them?
so if they ran a restaurant and they felt that they were religious and that their views were anti-gay, they could say to gay customers, i'm sorry, you can't eat here. and when that bill passed, there was just a political explosion in indiana. and it backfired hugely on pence. he had signed the legislation, backed it. and people hadn't paid that much attention until they looked at the signing ceremony. and there in a closed ceremony, a picture sort of leaked out that showed pence standing there with the most virulently anti-gay activists in the state.
legend: and so that's when i knew - that's when i knew i was on the album. and i got a little $500 check. and i was on everything is everything, which was part of, you know, what was the most important album of that year and one of the most important albums in hip-hop history, really.
foer: sure. (reading) jacob never knew how to answer the question - are you religious? he'd never not belonged to a synagogue, never not made some gesture toward kashrut, never not assumed not even in his moments of greatest frustration with israel or his father or american jewry or god's absence that he would raise his children with some degree of jewish literacy in practice. but double negatives never sustained a religion, or as sam's brother max would put it in his bar mitzvah speech three years later, you only get to keep what you refuse to let go of. and as much as jacob wanted the continuity of history, culture, thought and values, as much as he wanted to believe that there was a deeper meaning available, not only to him, but to his children and their children, light shone between his fingers.
elverum remembers himself as a young man who begged the sky for some calamity to challenge my foundation. we then become the greek chorus, witness to the unfolding tragedy: first, the death of his wife and mother to their child, the musician and illustrator geneviève castrée, in 2016; then the marriage to actor michelle williams in 2018 and their divorce less than a year later. 'the world always goes on,' doiron sings in answer, quoting a joanne kyger poem, 'breaking us with its changes / until our form, exhausted, runs true.'
her life's work is to change the culture of silicon valley — a place she feels has gone backward in time. there are far fewer women in computer science today than in the 1980s. blacks and latinos are missing too. kapor klein faults the investor class, which holds on to the myth of meritocracy, that they are the hyper-rational conduits of capital and it so just happens that white men are the most worthy.

the poll, conducted earlier this year, looked not only at violence and harassment but also at a wide range of discrimination experiences. we asked about discrimination in employment, education, in their interactions with police and the courts and in their everyday lives in their own neighborhoods. we're breaking out the results by race, ethnicity and identity. you can find what we've released so far on our series page you, me and them: experiencing discrimination in america.

and this was one of those rallies where i felt like it was good to keep a lower profile. so i sat down on the stage - not the stage, the press riser. i wasn't standing up in front of my camera. i wasn't easily seen. i was just sitting, taking notes as he was talking. and we're waiting for him to announce the muslim ban. he doesn't get to it yet in the rally. and suddenly, just like the first rally, i hear my name - katy tur. she's back there. little katy, what a lie it was. what a lie she told. and he's pointing at me in the crowd. the entire place turns, and they roar as one. i write like a giant, you know, unchained animal. and i just see men standing on their chairs and yelling at me. the only person, the only friendly face in the crowd that i could find, was this older lady who was right up pressed against the press pen who looked at me horrified, looked at me horrified for my safety. and i just remember thinking, smile and wave because if you smile at them and you wave, i had learned up to this point, then you diminish the tension. you diffuse the situation. you mitigate it, because if you look intimidated, if you look scared, people will take advantage, and people will push harder.
of the 11 women who said they don't remember trump coming into the changing room, some said it was possible that it happened while they weren't in the room or that they didn't notice. but most were dubious or dismissed the possibility out of hand.
the counterargument from the trump administration and its allies is that someone's sex refers to whether they are a man or a woman, and that even if discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is unjust, it's not sex discrimination — and is currently not legally protected.

prof. winston: in 1893 in san francisco, joe mcphee(ph), who worked for the army, wanted to have a christmas banquet. but he didn't have a lot of money. so, he was on the docks and he saw the fishermen in their kettles, and he had a great idea. he grabbed a kettle, he put it on a tripod, and he started ringing a bell and saying, keep the pot boiling, keep the pot boiling. and the idea just took off.

pence did suspend the resettlement of syrian refugees to indiana after the paris attacks last fall, but a spokesman for pence defended the act, saying there is a difference between a total ban on muslims and suspending syrian refugees when it comes to security issues when members of the obama administration's intelligence community have said that isis has attempted to gain entry into the united states via the syrian refugee program.

alongside them, the law has evolved to forbid discrimination against trans americans. section 1557 of the affordable care act prohibits entities that receive federal funding for health coverage from denying coverage based on sex, gender identity and sex stereotyping. and the americans with disabilities act and title vii of the civil rights act have also been broadly interpreted by courts to protect transgender individuals from discrimination.

chozick: that's - i think it's very hard to extrapolate the two. i mean, i think that when you see her as being a cautious candidate, it is largely because she has been scarred in the past - i mean, so scarred. i think of some of the speeches that she gave early as first lady, and she was just absolutely ridiculed by both sides. and she's become much more cautious.

this is fresh air. the nashville-based singer-songwriter nora jane struthers has a new album called champion. rock critic ken tucker says the collection is her most personal and accessible to date.
gross: that's a very funny passage in a lot of ways because you're basically saying that, you know, a lot of holocaust survivors and probably a lot of people who survived war in general when they get to the buffet at the all-you-can-eat kind of buffet, they're, like, packing away sandwiches and filling up three plates as if, like, there might never be food again (laughter). so was that true of your grandmother, and did you always feel like there was something absurd about her relationship with food that you also completely understood?
this entire article is fiction, and for the new york times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against mr. trump on a topic like this is dangerous. to reach back decades in an attempt to smear mr. trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election. it is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all. further, the times story buries the pro-clinton financial and social media activity on behalf of hillary clinton's candidacy, reinforcing that this truly is nothing more than a political attack. this is a sad day for the times.

the new analysis argues there's another reason that abstinence until marriage is increasingly unrealistic: americans are marrying later, on average, and some are not marrying at all, but they're not waiting longer to begin having sex. the average age for initiating sexual activity has remained around 17 or 18 since the early 1990s. the net effect, the report concludes, is a substantial increase in premarital sex.

feldman: yes, because it's already clear - by the time that you're told that you're going to see this man, it's already clear by seeing him you are engaged to him because the consequences would be so drastic if you weren't to become engaged. you would lose so much value on the market that whatever would come next would be much worse, certainly, than whatever it is that could be bad about this person. so you know even before that it's going to be engagement. and that's why you feel such intense relief in this moment when you realize your partner isn't obviously terrible. and, yes, there is that look and the nod. but it's just perfunctory. everything has already been prepared. you know, the alcohol is already on the table. and as soon as the meeting is done, there is a verbal agreement. and we all drink to it. and it's over. there's no going back.
being poor did not dent the dreams of this seemingly indefatigable young woman. nor did the fact that she only had a 7th grade education. since childhood she had a knack for sports, high-hurdling over her grandmother's bushes. neetu recalls astonished neighbors seeing her, a small girl, haul home heavy iron canisters of gas for cooking.
davies: you know, one of the things that's striking when you look at the picture you paint of him as a leader is the contrast between these really, very significant reforms in terms of, you know, social mores and rules for, you know, religious restrictions and some economic change on the one hand and then this tendency towards autocracy on the other. do you see any - is there a framework that puts these together, a model?

and since i had told him about the problems in the beginning of our marriage, even though at that point i was already pregnant, he said to me, you know, all of your problems are probably because the woman who arranged your marriage is angry that you didn't give enough money. and it turned out in this case to be true (laughter). but, you know, at the time, i was grasping for straws. i would have loved to believe that it was that simple. it wasn't that simple. we ended up giving the matchmaker more money. it didn't fix any problems. but of course, there is this superstitious belief that if you can just - if you can make somebody happy and you can kind of get rid of the evil eye, everything will be, you know, a-ok. it wasn't.

but this struck me very deeply that we're training kids from the beginning, from minute one of absorbing popular culture, that women and girls are not as important as men and boys, and they're not as valuable to our society as men and boys. and it seemed that, in the 21st century, this was a horrible message to be sending and very shocking.

their lawyers argue that the text of japan's constitution was intended to prevent forced marriages, rather than explicitly prohibit same-sex marriage, as npr has reported.
it's - i mean when you take your personal religious convictions or political convictions, even, and claim to represent the united states, but, in fact, are representing an organization like the family as senator coburn was in lebanon, as senator ensign has in jordan and israel, as senator inhofe has in uganda, you are steering foreign policy away from democratic accountability.
bianculli: we're listening back to our 1995 interview with mary tyler moore as part of our tribute to pioneering tv executive grant tinker who died last month at the age of 90. we'll hear more of terry's interview with mary tyler moore and a review of the new film la la land, starring ryan gosling and emma stone, after a break. i'm david bianculli, and this is fresh air.
one of the dogs i learned about was placed with a soldier who had been to iraq twice. he had ptsd and his life was falling apart. his marriage, his health, everything. he was on a cocktail of drugs. it made him a zombie. he hated that feeling. and one day someone told him about doctor dogs for ptsd.

mccammon: now, i should note that hillary clinton has been very open about her methodist faith. later trump stressed his love for his family and promised the large group of several hundred evangelicals that he would protect their religious freedom.

the two have long been complimentary of one another. last fall she was floated as a possible energy secretary for trump. and palin praised trump late last year on fox news, calling him the best thing to happen to the permanent political class since, oh i guess, the beauty of the tea party genuine movement rose up and shined a light on crony capitalism and then pulled the rug right out from under status quo politicians who just kind of embraced that political class.

entitled and arrogant — she's been compared to jane austen's emma woodhouse — gina feels like a prisoner. she instantly runs afoul of her fellow students, suffers the disapproval of the gorgeous but strict sister susanna and plots her escape back to her adored father.
we did a podcast episode that featured this couple from montana. they were both retirement age, so they weren't working anymore, and the town they lived in was 96 percent white. and the biggest voting issue for them was immigration — even though they weren't competing with anyone for jobs and they lived in a place where there were no immigrants.
he ended up getting one. now if he's feeling anxious, he'll say, like, snuggle and the dog will just come in for a big hug, or another of various commands. his life changed dramatically for the better. his marriage is really good now. he's a stable dad and he's working. he's down to only one or two meds.
over the course of its four seasons, rob delaney wanted catastrophe — the amazon series he created with sharon horgan — to show a more nuanced portrait of marriage than is typically shown on tv.
so again, he's using the skill he's got as a talker. he's great at messaging. he is very much far to the right of the mainstream republicans at that point, but he's big on the circuit of all the big funders - the nra, the heritage foundation, all the various donor groups, pro-israel groups. he's out there speaking at the banquets. and he is helping set the message for the republican party in the house.
morrell: as i got older, i realized there were people just like me. and so [joey svendsen, matt carter and i] ended up doing this podcast just because we wanted to represent, what is it like for three friends to get together and just be as brutally honest as we can?
wu: it's amazingly (laughter), you know, that we've got this great scientific invention, the web and the internet, and then it's come to this point where using it reminds me of swatting mosquitoes. honestly, i think you spend 50 percent of your mental energy trying to defeat ad systems. and, you know, i - there could be a better way. i just - i also think it's inherent to the business model. it's very driven with the need to grow, to get more clicks and clicks and clicks.

[the] question i think really has to do with how do we harness this technology in a way that allows a multiplicity of voices, allows a diversity of views, but doesn't lead to a balkanization of our society, but rather continues to promote ways of finding common ground, obama says. i'm not sure government can legislate that, but what i do believe is that all of us in leadership have to find ways in which we can re-create common space on the internet.

we're returning now to puerto rico's efforts to recover from hurricane maria. while the focus on immediate needs is still there, now the u.s. territory's leaders have also decided that a new push for statehood should be part of the recovery effort. this week, a bipartisan shadow congressional delegation comprised of distinguished former officials went to capitol hill to lobby congress to make puerto rico the 51st state.
moore: you know, there was another thing that won them over. it wasn't just the fact that he was pomposity to the nth degree, but that there was a vulnerability and a sweetness to ted. we found out later that ted, who was a more out-of-work than in-work actor, had gone out and bought himself a blue blazer and a crest and had it sewn on the pocket so that he would look the part. and everybody just thought that was, you know, real throat-clenching stuff. and, you know, if there had been any doubt about whether or not he was the right one, that clinched it.
sagal: aunt alice screws up her advice for a dog and a marriage. your next story of a news no-no comes from amy dickinson, an actual advice columnist.
it did shock me, she says, that this was one of the first things they decided they needed to move on. before president trump came into office, he seemed to be moving in a different direction on these issues — vowing to protect our lgbtq citizens in his convention speech, and posing with a rainbow flag while campaigning.
it's just a - you would never have predicted this from the language during the campaign when you had supposedly the kochs at war with trump and vice versa, but there's this huge rapprochement going on. and as sheldon whitehouse, a democratic senator from rhode island, said to me, what you see then is the sort of the agenda items of the kochs are moving up one by one. and the things they complained about about trump are being jettisoned.
gross: so that traffic was the real thing.
carrie fisher shared her approach to life in her one-woman show wishful drinking, which was later turned into a book.
you say the character [of leo bloom] was meek and insecure, and you could've been describing me as well. i was a very shy person in those days, and working with zero, who was bigger than life, helped me grow. zero was a strong influence on me.
and so, in response to that, post-slavery defenders argue that, you know, slave-holding households themselves were like families and that they actually did encourage african-americans to marry, to adopt western christian notions of marriage rather than so-called heathen practices from their past. so, essentially, slave masters learned that it was to their advantage to promote marriage and families, in part because it made economic sense. it mollified the slaves. it kept them reasonably content. it gave them incentives to remain on their plantations, as opposed to running away.
democrats were quick to point to the reversal by the rnc to renew support for moore and indicated they would use it as fodder heading into the 2018 campaign.

the woman had stayed in a maine maternity home while waiting for the child to be born, and decades later, she's contacted by another resident of the home, who tells her something shocking about the facility where they once lived. hempel tracks the character's near-breakdown obliquely; the woman becomes fixated on the disrepair of her rental house and the threat of climate change, only sometimes allowing herself to speculate about the fate of the daughter she gave up years before. it's a gutsy, brave and unrelentingly painful story; it's also possibly the best one hempel has ever written.

elving: you know, the liveliest speculation game in washington right now is playing rexit (ph), guessing the day that rex tillerson exits the cabinet. he was first suggested to bush - suggested by bush officials. he was not a trump crony. and the bush officials had little use for trump. and tillerson was accepted by trump despite the fact that he had little use for former bush officials. so this was not a marriage made in heaven. and at the moment, it promises to be a mercifully brief marriage.

richard spencer, the white nationalist leader and university of virginia alum who coined the term alt-right, would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. if you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs, spencer told the atlantic last year, not long after the election. by 2015, gay marriage is popular. what is possible has shifted. that's what the alt-right is doing. it's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.

prof. winston: in their early days in new york, the army would parade around town. they would make a lot of hoopla. there was one man and seven women. and in those days, you didn't see a lot of women preaching on the streets. so immediately, they caused quite a stir. often, this was in the lower east side which was, at the time, a haunt for the poor and for sailors. so you had people of all races, colors, backgrounds dropping in. and the new york times just felt this was a horrendous display of christianity because it was kind of wild and crazy.

gailey is an ace at constructing clean, clear plots, and the echo wife is no exception. the concept behind it is bracingly simple: evelyn caldwell is a famed genetic researcher, and she shares a tense, complicated relationship with her husband nathan. as it turns out, nathan has used evelyn's scientific breakthrough — the caldwell method — to clone evelyn herself. martine is this replica's name, and she does more than resemble evelyn physically; she's actually become nathan's lover. when nathan announces that he's going to leave evelyn in favor of the pliant, submissive martine, the cracks in their marriage blow open. but that's nothing compared to the next shocker: nathan winds up murdered, which leads evelyn and martine — sisters in their own way — to uncover the secrets in their lives. they then must decide how they're going to move forward as individuals. or something more than individuals. or something less.

so the idea to play someone, a middle-aged woman who is unapologetic about her sexuality, was very exciting to me. but to do that for months - and some people in the business said, you don't have to really do that. have them get you a fat suit. i was like, i'm doing real love scenes, and i actually want to go for this. and i want people to see that because i want to have that conversation. but in my real life, walking around for the many, many months - i think it was about a year, really, with all of this, even longer - it was hard. it was physically hard, and then people treated you really crappy. people treat you different.

the comments came nearly two weeks after the allegations against moore first came to light. trump had avoided answering reporters' questions about moore since that time.

shalhoub: exactly. i was at dinner with a friend the other night. and she said - she referenced that same thing. she said what really hooked her was there was a scene - i can't remember which episode - but one of the middle episodes in the first season where midge and susie, played by alex borstein, her manager, they're sitting at a bar. it's after-hours at this club. and they're sitting at a bar, pounding back shots and talking for - it's a really long scene. and there isn't one mention of a man, a relationship, the marriage. you know what i mean? and she just found that so refreshing. and so it's sort of almost groundbreaking, you know, for a series. and that was where, you know, the hook was really set.

forman: all the introductions had to - you know, i was always trying to show on the television films which had some, you know, which were not just the propaganda films. but then of course you had to present them in the way which the communists would accept. if it was filmed from france, for example, if, i don't know. children of paradise - beautiful, romantic film. but you had to stress that this film is showing the cruelty of bourgeoisie, how it's suppressing the working-class people, you know?
sagal: all right. four to tie; five to win.
people quote franz rosenzweig answering the question, are you religious? and he says, not yet. and, you know, those two words - i almost named the novel not yet, in fact. those two words imply both a present failure, but also an optimism or a hope or maybe even a kind of dedication. one could - you know, one could hear that ironically - not yet, yes, yes, yes, yes, one day, five years from now, 10 years from now, but never - or as a kind of something a little bit more humble and a little more hopeful.
until recently, the two had mostly avoided criticizing each other. but once cruz began closing the polling gap and even leapfrogging trump in iowa, the gloves came off.

to begin, this was a new scientific discovery, but also, joy had smelled the disease on les more than a decade before his symptoms got severe enough for them to seek medical help. if joy could predict parkinson's before its well-known symptoms, such as shaking and sleep disruption, even started to appear, maybe she could work with researchers. it might lead to a breakthrough.
new york times columnist nicholas kristof recently wrote about her story. johnson spoke to us earlier this week.
her dad, evie allows, might have tried his best, or close to it, but he too frequently fell victim to his own demons, most of which were substance related. despite the success of his strain of weed, there was never enough money from the drugs, because he gave them away, lost some, flushed some, or smoked and snorted it all himself.

ringhand: when we look at these transcripts over time, what we see is that the issues in cases that nominees are willing to talk about change. so when you look back at potter stewart's hearing just a few years after brown was decided, he dances around brown v. board of education the way later nominees dance around roe. he simply wasn't going to give a firm opinion on that case.

davies: well, that's what i wanted to get to.
joan rivers, certainly. i think a lot of midge's sense of humor is very similar to joan's – the kinds of taboo subject matter that they explore. but the comedy comes from a very different place. obviously, midge's comes from the fact that her whole life has fallen apart, and joan rivers' came from the fact that she felt like she never fit in – she felt like an ugly duckling. midge, meanwhile, fit in better than everyone else. so they arrive at similar subject matter from very different places.
it was this centrist streak that made his vote the key in many deeply divisive cases — so many, in fact, that kennedy earned himself a reputation as the court's quintessential swing vote.

the 2008 campaign: from no, ma'am to sarah palin and barack obama
mayer: very early as the tea party opposition to obama was brewing, what you've got is mike pence out there. he had a reputation for being kind of more soft-spoken than many republicans and for being kind of, as i said earlier, more affable. but when the tea party rises, he really finds a more aggressive voice. and he's out there at their rallies yelling that the government should be shut down unless planned parenthood is defunded.

scientists warn that a catastrophic tipping point is possible in the next few decades. by midcentury, possibly before, the average global temperature is projected to rise by more than 2 degrees celsius, the point scientists and world leaders agree would trigger cataclysmic consequences. last year's historic paris climate agreement falls short of preventing that, so more drastic cuts in carbon emissions are needed.
albright: well, that's exactly because one of the reasons that i wrote the book was to show the different ways that fascism has penetrated a lot of our societies now. and each one is a little bit different. and certainly eras are different. and so one has to look at what some of the signs are but not expected total replication, that everything is exactly the same - because both the situations in the country, the international situation, what is happening with technology, how people see their lives. so it's very hard. and frankly, terry, the hardest part in the book was really coming up with exact definitions because it's always slightly different.
on top of that, buttigieg is still new on the scene and, until recently, has lacked a national profile. theodore johnson, a senior fellow at the brennan center for justice, thinks that could hurt buttigieg among african-americans, who he says tend to be notoriously pragmatic.
i got the idea for the book from a conversation i had with my mother, who told me very offhandedly one day about a town she remembered from her louisiana childhood, where everyone sort of intermarried so that their children would get lighter with each generation. i wanted to kind of explore the idea of a place like this. and i was able to draw on some research from similar creole communities that were similarly sort of insular and organized around people having light skin. ...

and while we've managed to get legislation introduced in many different states, these laws have been either defeated - bills, i'm sorry, have been defeated. or they've been watered down, amended to a point where they just don't really protect children anymore. or legislators will say, well, you know, you're right. maybe 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed to get married. but what's so bad about marriage at 17 or 16 or 15?
trump has said he wants to repeal the affordable care act, including the medicaid expansion. as modern healthcare reports, pence could now be in the position of calling for repeal of his own medicaid expansion.
folkenflik: on nratv, loesch depicted thomas & friends in the white hoods of the kkk to mock the very idea of diversity among toy trains.
hesse: i think that this is a problem and a discussion we've had for a while in society - that when we talk about coming-of-age novels about young men like lord of the flies or a separate peace or catcher in the rye or charles dickens' works, we think, well, those are universal stories. they are about young men, but they're really universal. and then when we have coming-of-age stories about young women, we think that they're civil war-era chick flicks. we think that it's just literature for women.
garcia-navarro: fraidy reiss is the founder of unchained at last. thank you so much.
dafoe: yeah, sorry. oops. and that's exactly what it was. and he was under a lot of pressure. he turned around and said, willem, step out. and then once he did that, you know, i think you heard this audible (gasping) from all my colleagues.
i think there are ways that institutions are unavoidably formative, but ultimately when members come to think of congress as a platform for themselves, it becomes much harder for them to see how working within the institution cooperating and bargaining is really what congress is for. and it's intended to create a venue for a kind of accommodation that, ultimately, the politics of a free society hasn't had to advance. that's just much harder to see when what happens in most congressional hearings now is basically a bunch of individuals producing youtube clips to use later in campaigns.
the president also has taken multiple opportunities at press conferences to riff on things that frankly have no relevance to the coronavirus fight. the press conference he gave about a week ago at the centers for disease control was so rambling and wide-ranging that sen. elizabeth warren and sen. ed markey are asking mike pence to explain what the president was even talking about when the president, at one point, appeared to compare cdc's response to the coronavirus outbreak to how the media and democrats treated his impeachment, a comparison that doesn't make a lot of sense both in reflection and also in the moment. he has also created an environment where his aides have been afraid to tell him bad news, and that has skewed what the trump administration ends up pursuing. if the president is only willing to look at the most optimistic scenario, it makes it very hard to do worst-case planning.

the twist here is that, like the movie's writer-director rama burshtein, michal is an orthodox jew by choice. in burshtein's beautiful and beguiling 2013 first feature, fill the void — about a young ultra-orthodox woman in tel aviv who must decide whether or not to marry her dead sister's husband — the director is more interested in conveying the feel of her milieu from within than in making a case for it to the non-religious world. in the wedding plan, too, it's taken casually for granted that michal's dates come brokered by a matchmaker. which may make her marriage prospects look like a cakewalk to most secular women who are on their own when it comes to finding mr. right.
lily anne welty tamai, curator of history at the japanese american national museum (and a friend of mine), explained where these stereotypes about asian women come from. the trope of puccini's 1904 madama butterfly paved the way for american incarnations of a tragic love story between an american soldier and asian woman in the mid-20th century, when american soldiers brought home war stories — and sometimes brides — from asia, where women were often part of the conquest. popular narratives included the 1957 film sayonara and the 1989 musical miss saigon. (i guess they just never got around to making the korea version, tamai said.)

turkle: yes, because we have some wisdom now. if a school system comes to a parent now and says, oh, my god, do i have a system for you? here's a technological system on a screen that can really measure your child's work and deliver this educational thing, you know, on this computer program, after this experience, a parent is not going to be wowed. this parent is going to say, excuse me, my child needs a mentor. my child needs a teacher. my child needs a relationship. my child has had a screen for a year. i now understand that my child needs to be with some people who will nurture him or her. there's opportunities to assert ourselves in a deliberate way about the balance we need. and i think that this experience, you know, of the pandemic, it's what the great anthropologist victor turner called a liminal time. it's like a time out of time. it's a time betwixt and between where you get a chance - the rules are broken and you get a chance to reassess what you really need. and i think that's what we have now. we have a chance to come back and not be wowed by technology and reassess the virtue of the human and relationships and to act more deliberately in our relationship with them.

hadleigh is shocked by her advances (some of which do verge into forced seduction territory), but not immune to them. but with his dark and twisty past, including opium addiction and loads of family tragedy, he's determined not to ruin her or their friendship. complications ensue when olivia and her friends, the brilliantly named willflowers, join lady charlotte's society of angels — a charity on the surface, but secretly a society of lady detectives. their first mission involves a murderous opium dealer and hadleigh, for personal reasons, is chasing the same villain. as their paths keep colliding in the most scandalous and dangerous circumstances, they are forced to confront their desire and deep feelings for each other. this is a very hot and perfectly paced page turner, all the way to happily ever after.

o'riordan is not an isolated case. irish visa overstayers have been swept up in the administration's nationwide immigration dragnet. under strict new rules, anyone here illegally is a target — whether they're convicted of a crime or not. in 2017, ice deported 34 undocumented irish, up from 26 the year before. the numbers are tiny compared with the 128,765 mexicans ejected from the country last year, but in boston's closeknit irish community the wave of arrests is big news.

tur: so my parents covered police pursuits, and it was in many ways, you know, the beginnings of reality-show tv in this captivating story that was a lot of flash but not all that much substance. and so when they popularized it and they made it must-see television in the '90s, you couldn't tear yourself away from a police pursuit. there was, you know, cheeky talk, which obviously had a grain of truth to it, that they were responsible for diminishing the seriousness of the nightly broadcast of news. i have mixed feelings about it now because they covered a lot of really serious stories. the reginald denny beating exposed how the lapd had just abandoned the city, and they were risking their lives covering it. they were risking their lives covering fires. they were risking their lives covering - i think my parents, they would search for hours on end for missing planes that had crashed into the santa monica mountains to find and rescue people. so they did - they did a combination of the two.
after college, they got married and set off on happily-ever-after. les became a doctor, joy became a nurse, and they had three boys. joy says that as a couple they were so easy together — they rarely fought: we disagreed about things now and again, but we didn't fight, fight.

little sister represents the dark side of the dream. she didn't have many skills, struggled and went into illicit work. when she tried to turn her life around, it seems she couldn't escape her past. for all the many success stories here, china can be tough and unforgiving. some people just don't make it.
it's not just about white working class. i'm not saying you stop talking to white working class; i'm saying that we are a diverse party, said karine jean-pierre, chief public affairs officer at moveon, a progressive political action committee. i don't think the democratic party has been doing enough to talk to another segment of their base, which is african-american voters, and so i think there's been this push in particularly in the last two years to do that.
sunday was the final round of the 2019 masters golf tournament. but watching what happened, you could not help feeling like some sort of time traveler - right? - maybe going back 15 or so years when tiger woods ruled the game. well, turns out he's the ruler again. woods won the masters yesterday for the fifth time. it's the first major championship in nearly 11 years, his first masters victory in 14, and it completes really one of the most dramatic comebacks in sports history. and joining me now is npr sports correspondent tom goldman. hi, tom.
now, of course, it's a musical, so it's never real in a musical, but you can get - you know, west side story does not say that at the beginning. it's meant - it's attempting to tell the audience yes, it's a musical, but we want you to take this as if it were a serious story that can actually be happening on the streets of new york right now. two gangs are at war, and murders and deaths occur as a result. and - whereas sweeney todd is strictly about, in a sense, cartoon figures. i - at the end of the chapter, what i say is, what sweeney todd really is is a movie.

and i also have to do very, very boring things like separate the recycling from the regular garbage and so on. and the conflict of the wrestling match between those two ideas - life is precious and i live in the world - fuel the book. they're the energy and the friction that sort of heats this novel up. and they're also what i think was kind of releasing that final sentiment that sendak said of live your life that - i think that that sentence is actually able to contain both of those ideas. life is precious, and you live in the world.

oh, absolutely — that was one of the main struggles that i had while writing a woman is no man. one of those struggles was confirming stereotypes about arab people and the arab community, stereotypes that include oppression, domestic abuse, terrorism. and so that kind of hindered my ability to express myself freely, without fear, in the beginning when i was writing the novel. and it took me a long time to overcome those fears and realize that in order for me to speak on behalf of women who are abused and oppressed, and to tell their stories — especially those women who are afraid to tell their own stories, because they're ashamed, and because they feel like someone will come and retaliate, that i had to overcome that fear and tell this very authentic story.
i wanted, in this book, to tell a story about the unappreciated beauty and life of that place, even when it's a story about loss and unjust circumstances, he said onstage. for me, it was extremely important to pay homage to the beauty, creativity, resilience of young men who feel seen by people outside the communities as threats, but who are braving every day great acts of tenderness and love.

so how do you persuade millions or billions of people around the world to sacrifice that? to avert climate disaster, the fertility rate would have to fall much faster than it has been. it would require more than educating women and expanding access to contraception, as aid agencies have been doing for decades.

they used to be sort of marked off very distinctly. their color has gotten paler, so it looks more like the regular results. and overall, everything has been done to sort of crowd it and make it as much as possible like the true results. and i think it's been an unfortunate development. i don't think anyone at google feels happy about it, but they've been in some sense, you know, enslaved to their business model, and so they have to satisfy their advertisers.

but cuomo still had his eye on new york. he ran for governor in 2002 but failed to win the democratic nomination after remarking that the governor at the time, george pataki, held the leader's coat — that leader being new york city mayor rudy giuliani. cuomo became a pariah, as the new york daily news described it. not long after that he went through a separation from his wife that became fodder for tabloids in 2003.
i wonder, i mean, that kind of emotion when it happens, it can bring people together in this really intimate space. you weren't originally going to bring that idea to the group. do you think it helped, even in that strange zoom call setting, but to have these women open up and be so vulnerable with their own grief?
if i would have known, i would have taken him to the doctor, to the hospital myself, he said.
people involved in that selection process say that the president intends to expand that list a bit now. he might add judge brett kavanaugh from the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit, and possibly former solicitor general paul clement, a highly regarded supreme court advocate who served in the george w. bush administration. clement's main drawback in the president's mind, though, is said to be that he has no judicial track record to examine.
neal brennan: you can't see it, but during that entire applause i was waving.
we see on an all-too-common basis that racism still exists in the united states of america, kavanaugh said. our long march to racial equality is not over.
being biracial intensifies owusu's apartness. and, then, there are the abandonments that fracture her life. her mother's unexplained departure when nadia is 4 is followed by the death of her father when she's 13 and, almost simultaneously, the refusal of her mother to take in owusu and her sister. instead, owusu lives, tempestuously, with her stepmother until she leaves for college in new york where, not surprisingly, in her late 20s she experiences a breakdown.

montanaro: look. they know that they have to try to work with trump, and they know how popular he is in their districts. for example, he won them by an average of 26 points. but look. these aren't the kinds of people that are just going to wilt. and just today, justin amash of the freedom caucus from michigan - congressman - he came out and tweeted that it didn't take long for the swamp to drain trump.

bernstein: i thought a lot about offering hope. and i didn't want to say i feel falsely hopeful, but i do think that i would not do what i do if i didn't have some fundamental sense of hope that telling the story would create a record that would, in some ways, be prophylactic against further bad consequences. and that's what jared kushner's grandmother rae said, also. she said she was telling this story because she wanted people to watch who came up on top of their government, and she had seen the horrible consequences. and i thought a lot about that message that she had said - you need to document what's happening; you need to tell the story. and i became - to truly believe that telling the story is an act of hope.

it isn't all so grim, though. saw lightning, originally released as a single back in april, sounds like the most logical combination of beck and pharrell's aesthetics: a jumpy rap-folk hybrid supercharged by pharrell's drum programming and backing vocals, which zooms up in intensity on the chorus when the bass drops in. there's a frantic but thrilling feeling to the song, like the fight-or-flight instinct triggered when a catastrophe beyond your control lands in your life. though it matches the rest of the songs in tone, in this case the crisis is external, as beck reckons with environmental disaster with a steely decisiveness that's far removed from the more complex emotional grappling he's doing elsewhere. (it can be a lot easier to deal with the messes you weren't directly involved in making.)

so i get asked a lot, you know, why not just leave west virginia? you know, or why would a character like jodi go back to west virginia? and i think that for those of us who love places that are sometimes difficult to love, we love them with this extra fierceness ... but there's so much that's so interesting and beautiful, both in the people and the landscape. ...
utah's 1973 fornication law designated sex outside of marriage as a class b misdemeanor. the act carried a possible penalty of up to six months in jail or a maximum fine of $1,000.
that being said, yes, i was raising three black male children in a white area. ben, i don't know if you remember this, but one time i was - we were - i don't know where i was driving, somewhere. and i had the three boys in the back of the car. and i got pulled over. the cop comes up to the window, and he said, do you know what you did? i said, no, i don't. he said, well, you rolled a stop sign. and meanwhile, the kids in the back seat - they're really little, maybe 3, 5 and 7 - saying, mom, what is the policeman - what is the policeman asking? mom, what - and he leans in the window, and he looks at the kids in the back. and he says, yeah, it's policeman now, but it'll be pig pretty soon.
but one of the things i found out was that his father had died young of a heart attack. i was so worried that i would slip up and somehow that this information would come out as i was talking about my close relationship with my aging father, that it really made me hesitate in our conversations in a way that that was not helpful to the work we were doing. ...
gross: so is there a decision, for better or worse, that redfield was largely responsible for that has changed the course of the epidemic in the u.s. for better or worse?
warren: that's right. we may see a replay of what happened in march, which was the white house essentially pushing, pushing, pushing. and house leadership - speaker ryan, kevin mccarthy, the majority leader, saying, we don't have the votes. we don't have the votes. now i think house leadership is in a bit of a stronger position to say - look, do you want a repeat of all the embarrassing coverage, particularly with all this somewhat arbitrary but still significant 100-day marker here? i think this is sort of a lot of noise, a lot of pr, not a lot of meat on these bones. i don't think there's going to be a vote.

hepburn herself attended bryn mawr college, one of the main line institutions i was adjunct teaching at to cobble together a living. at the end of a work day, i'd ride back to philadelphia aboard the commuter train, staring through the always grimy windows at all the charming houses and landscaped gardens passing by. i envied the folks who lived inside those houses and what i saw as their legacy of ease and beauty. janny scott lets me know i was nothing but a stranger in a strange land, incapable of decoding the more intricate stories flickering before my eyes.

educational institutions can currently apply for an exemption from the nondiscrimination provisions of title vii by demonstrating that those provisions contradict their religious beliefs, but opinions vary on whether those exemptions will protect christian colleges that seek to maintain strict student and employee policies relating to sexual orientation.
prof. winston: i think the army has an iconic spot on the american landscape. i mean, they've been there long enough that you can watch a movie from the 1910s, the 1940s, 1980s, and if they want to evoke a sense of christmas, you will see a salvation army bell ringer. i mean, that's the way - that's a symbol for the holidays. and so i think they've managed to create an image amidst all the clutter because they've kept it simple.

and, you know, some of this book is about the history, and we often say that ratings kind of ruined television in the 1950s. well, the quest for ratings looks dignified in comparison for the quest for clicks. i mean, so much engineering talent and ability has gone in to trying to make people click on things that i think we've sort of almost lost the last five years of development.

in some of those interviews, apted was reluctant to discuss the future of the up series. he told wnyc's on the media in 2013, i hope to do 84 up when i'll be 99. and then we'll cut it quits.
mayer: so, as you say, he runs for governor. people who i interviewed said that very much in the back of mike pence's mind, he wanted to be president. i mean, he's wanted - he's talked about wanting to be president since he was in high school. so he's coming from the house of representatives. and it's very hard to run for the presidency as a congressman. so his thought was, according to people working with him and also people - opponents in politics who i've talked to, was that he would go become governor, check that box, learn some - show some executive experience and be a big success in indiana.
from the time i first met my husband, he has wanted to leave everything early: movies, parties, trips. on one of our first dates we drove two hours to a historic town outside of washington, d.c. where we lived at the time. upon arrival, as we looked for a parking space, we turned to each other and knew that we really weren't interested in getting out of the car, so we turned around and drove home. we couldn't have been happier. part of that sense of always wanting to leave early made us feel bonded — neither of us are joiners and we often feel most connected when we are escaping something we don't want to be at — but it's also such a huge symptom of our general ambivalence of being part of the world. it's so much easier to take yourself out of things, to disengage, to dissociate. being present requires energy, and passion, and a kind of faith in life: it assumes that you believe your effort at engagement will be rewarded, with friendship or love or a sense of belonging.

it's really striking, when we've had screenings for the film, how the youngest part of the audience, in their late teens and early 20s, really respond. and i had that when, i think, when the novel was published - loads of letters from 17-, 18-year-olds. so naivete comes in all forms. that's, i think, what i want to say.

so how america responds to the coronavirus is in the hands of people most americans don't know much about. so let's take a look at who are some of our health policy leaders right now, what their backgrounds are and what they're doing. let's start with alex azar, who's the head of health and human services. he took over after tom price was forced out, and he was forced out in large part because of an investigative article that you did showing that he'd used government funds for a private jet.
sagal: she had worked for bernie sanders, but...
roberts: yeah, i could've, should've, would've started. maybe i'd be stephen king now. who knows?
and so at the beginning of the slope, right until you get to the top of the curve, the anxiety and fear that we may be feeling in the face of this pandemic or anything really, makes sense. it motivates us to act. but then it starts to go downhill. and that's when we tip into not very helpful panic, where we constrict and the physiological response is enfeebling and we're not able to make good decisions. that's when we hoard toilet paper or we're nasty to our neighbors or we spread misinformation on twitter, whatever it may be. so what we want is to be at the top of the yerkes-dodson curve with the appropriate amount of anxiety without tipping in to panic. that is where i feel mindfulness meditation — the kind of meditation with which most people are familiar — that's one of the areas where mindfulness meditation can be really helpful.

tinker: i met her when we did the pilot of the van dyke show. laura petrie had, you know, nobody had really thought too much about that because, you know, the star was going to be rob petrie. and mary was cast as laura petrie just almost by a lucky accident. danny thomas had once read her to play his daughter. and she didn't get the part because danny said no one would believe she's my daughter with a nose like that - hers being quite different from his. and when sheldon and carl were looking for and not finding laura petrie, danny happened into the office one day and said, what about that girl with the three names?
the contrary view expressed in where i am, however, accorded closely with the views of franklin graham, who wrote the foreword to the book and handled all the publicity for it. when asked by npr about the suspicion he had written the book under his father's name, franklin graham airily dismissed the idea.

obergefell v. hodges, the landmark 2015 supreme court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, would have been unthinkable just a generation ago. the public perception of queer people had shifted dramatically: in 1994, most americans thought homosexuality should not be accepted. by 2017, about 70% felt it should.
sagal: so yeah, over the years on this show we've done a number of stories about surprising things that people are making beer out of, including bacteria from hipster beards, chemically treated wastewater and female private parts. that is all true.
pressed on that email by sen. dianne feinstein, d-calif., on thursday, kavanaugh explained he was simply summarizing views of legal scholars and not offering his own view.

hubbard: well, i think it can be hard for people in the west to kind of see these two things happening at the same time, but they are. i mean, i think that the social changes are real. i think they're significant. i think he's pushing them through. i also think that he's an autocrat, and he doesn't really want checks and balances on his power. he doesn't really want anybody to tell him what he can or can't do. and, you know, these things are proceeding at the same time.
toobin: well, because i think the appointment of a supreme court justice is among the very most important jobs that any president does. and why shouldn't the public know the kind of people that the president is considering? and so, you know, i'm not saying the president should identify the single nominee, but 20 names, as trump produced, i think was a good idea.
i whispered in my son's ear to use the coronavirus crisis to save money, especially because i don't have work anymore, sami masoud, the groom's father, said.
martin: well, one of the things that you point out in writing about this topic is that many couples did marry under slavery, but i think we understand that one of the horrors of slavery is that these marriages had no official recognition, that husbands and wives and children could all be separated at any time at the whim of an owner.

tests are available to individuals regardless of symptoms and at no out-of-pocket cost at certain pop-up sites through the state's walk-up/drive-up testing initiative.
now, what does this mean in practical terms? what it means is that the courts are going to limit the power of government in efforts to address problems. the most obvious, dramatic were the obamacare lawsuits. remember, there was one lawsuit that said congress did not have the power under the commerce clause to establish the individual mandate, the requirement that people buy insurance. there was another lawsuit that said the text of the obamacare law didn't allow for the marketplaces to - the insurance marketplaces to work. both of those were very structural arguments that said unless the constitution specifically authorizes the government to do something, the government can't do it. and unless a law specifically authorizes the government to take a certain action, the government can't do it. all of that, traditionally, the courts had said, look, we want to give the government, congress, the executive branch, leeway to operate. we want to give them leeway to address the problems in the society.

but wait, consumer groups and the national association of insurance commissioners warned in their comment letters: there might be legitimate reasons people stop paying premiums — billing errors that are not the fault of the consumer, for example, or the loss of a job. by making such a change, the groups argue, the trump administration violates a key part of the health law that requires insurers to offer coverage to just about everyone who applies.
sebastian barry: (reading) chapter one. the method of laying out a corpse in missouri sure took the proverbial cake, like decking out our poor lost troopers for marriage rather than death. all their uniforms brushed down with lamp oil into a state never seen when they were alive. their faces clean shaved, as if the embalmers sure didn't like no whiskers showing. no one that knew him could have recognized trooper watchorn because those famous dundrearies was gone. anyway, death likes to make a stranger of your face. true enough their boxes weren't, but that was not the point. you lift one of those boxes, and the body makes a big sag in it. wood cut so thin at the mill, it was more a wafer than a plank. but dead boys don't mind things like that. the point was, we were glad to see them so well turned out. i am talking now about the finale of my first engagement in the business of war. 1851 it was most likely. since the bloom was gone off me, i had volunteered aged 17 in missouri. if you had all your limbs, they took you. if you were a one-eyed boy, they might take you, too, even so. the only pay worse than the worst pay in america was army pay. and they fed you queer stuff till you just stank. but you were glad to get work because if you didn't work for the few dollars in america, you hungered.

controversy over the billy graham legacy was stirred anew with the 2015 publication of a book said to be graham's final chapter. titled where i am: heaven, eternity, and our life beyond, the book had billy graham's name on the cover, as the author, but skeptics questioned whether he had actually written it. despite the title, the book dealt less with heaven than with hell, describing it as a place of wailing and a furnace of fire; a place of torment, a place of outer darkness, a place where people scream for mercy; ... where many will spend eternity.
and, you know, the legion character is a spinoff from the x-men and the full title of the x-men is the uncanny x-men. and that word uncanny is very specific, and it's something that sigmund freud wrote a whole essay about, this idea of the uncanny. the best way to describe it is when familiar things act in unfamiliar ways and why that's so frightening to us. you know, the perfect example is a haunted house. right? your house isn't supposed to do that. and, therefore, that becomes - it's sort of more horrifying than things that we don't know what to expect from. and i wanted to play with that all as a filmmaker, the sense of disorientation not to confuse you, but more to put you into his state of mind and to say at this moment in the first hour you know as much as he does, and you're seeing things as he's seeing them. and they're very frightening and unsettling. and then as we go and he gets more clarity, we will also get clarity.

this season, more perfect is taking its camera lens off the supreme court and zooming in on the words of the people: the 27 amendments that we the people have made to our constitution. we're taking on these 27 amendments both in song and in story. this episode is best listened to alongside 27: the most perfect album, an entire album (an album!) and digital experience of original music and art inspired by the 27 amendments. think of these episodes as the audio liner notes. in more perfect's final episode of the season, listen to liner notes for two amendments that contemplate the still-unfinished status of our constitution. 27 is an album that marks a particular point in our history: this moment when we have 27 amendments to our constitution. what will be the 28th? maybe it will address our nation's capital. the capital has been a bit of a constitutional anomaly for much of our nation's history — it's at the heart of the democracy, but because it's not a state, people in washington d.c. have been disenfranchised almost by accident. the 23rd amendment solved some of the problem — it gave d.c. the right to vote for president. but it left much of d.c.'s representation questions unanswered. d.c. still does not have voting representation in congress. instead, d.c. sends a non-voting delegate to congress. for this liner note, more perfect profiles that delegate, congresswoman eleanor holmes norton, and her unique approach to fighting for power in a virtually powerless role.

mason: yeah, it's really gone up and down over the decades. i mean, the whole reason why these families went down there was so they could live in peace. that became pretty tenuous early in the 20th century, largely because of the mexican revolution. and a number of families and others left. but for most of the 20th century, these families have lived in peace. and they've done pretty well. they've prospered within these rural areas. these are really distant from major population centers. in recent years, you're exactly right. with the rise of the cartel violence, there aren't very many places in mexico that are escaping this kind of violence.

but the more i looked at the game of bridge, the more fascinating it became because it really is a hugely complicated game that touches on elements of quantum mechanics. and there are 58 octillion possible deals and all of these very - you know, that she refers to the murray appelbaum discovery play. the language of bridge is really fascinating and fun as well. and i wanted the sense that nikki, that mary winstead's character, is really the brains of the operation and that she's a strategist. and bridge is a huge game for strategy. and so it just became this sort of perfect marriage of something that i thought was kind of funny that then the more that i read about it, the more it seemed to really tell you something about her and him and a perfect marriage of meaning and comedy for me.
hubbard: well, this has been a major social change that i think - it's probably hard for people who've never spent time in saudi arabia to understand. but i hear it all the time from friends of mine and from people who visit saudi arabia and who knew saudi arabia before. it used to be that women in public places had to wear abayas. and an abaya is basically a large piece of billowy fabric, usually black, which completely covers the woman's form. you can't see hips. you can't see - i guess you can see shoulders. but completely - it's sort of like a tent that you wear when you walk around.

one of rock's most misunderstood artists, janis joplin was often portrayed as victim, a dysfunctional mess who only fronted a band, who didn't have the power to call the shots. until pearl. in 1971, with monterey pop, woodstock, and festival express behind her, the vision of blues, rock and soul coming together with a band that could follow her was realized. it was her high point, and tragically, she didn't live to see it. janis had put the band together — saying it's my band, it's finally my band — and approved all the songs. (it was unusual at the time for a female artist to actually have that control, the very reason we need this list.) she wrote the opening track move over and the a cappella mercedes benz, which was recorded just days before her passing. janis once said, none of us are who we started out as. she was a good girl as a texas kid, in a stable home full of music, with her mom's broadway musicals like porgy and bess as her favorites. bad skin and some extra weight brought the usual social problems once she hit high school, and she drifted toward the creative crowd. once she made it to san francisco, she discovered how her heroes, like bessie smith, could inspire her voice. she became known as pearl — sassy, fearless, sexy, uninhibited, not one to ever hold her tongue. she was fast and free with her sexuality, like bessie. and she called the shots.

anne bowers, a sociologist, recently conducted a study showing that many people behave exactly like her husband. she presented people with three scenarios describing identical rings that came from different sources—a store, a happy marriage, and a divorce. she found people were much less willing to pay for engagement rings that were tainted by a previous owner in a failed relationship.

simon: so you grew up watching this couple from a distance. what was it like to step into their royal shoes?
simon: john, let me ask you about the open senate seat. i mean this seriously, there's all this speculation that attorney general sessions isn't going to last in that job, either leave by mutual consent, his own decision or president trump's decision. any chance he would return and run for his own seat again?
gross: and, therefore, they're not smart.
hader: yeah. i just am like - i'm - and i mean this. it's hard to talk about this without, like, sounding, like, you know, you're being modest or - i'm quoting alec on this. alec is always like - he said, you're the only performer, writer that i know that can't write for himself. i'm - i write best for sally, noho hank, cousineau, fuches. but as far as the barry stuff is concerned, we're always coming around to barry kind of last.
martin: you point out that, in fact, that many - after slavery, many enslaved americans went on a real - a search to find spouses from whom they had been separated. why was that so important?
wendle: terri hollingsworth is the circuit and county court clerk in pulaski county, ark., which includes little rock. her office saw a huge spike the week of st. patrick's day, with more couples coming in than did the week of valentine's day. and despite being closed to the public, her office continues to issue marriage licenses through a plexiglass window.
gross: what did joe pitts do to put abortion on the family's agenda?
and i've been thinking about that for - well, nigh on 50 years. and what that means - and when i first heard it, i thought, well, i know what that means aged 8 because i've been to all the cowboy films up in the adelphi cinema in dun laoghaire. so surely i do know what he's talking about. and that was a very exciting idea. but later, you wonder then about the sadness and the sorrow - historical sorrow of an irish person, himself essentially a native person, an aboriginal person, by a great trauma having to go to america, joining an army that was engaged in the destruction, erasure and removal of a people, the native american people, not unlike himself. so that was one of the things. so my task was to follow, and in this instance, follow a person like that to america. but i have to say, it was a joyful undertaking.
foer: (reading) isaac bloch was not the last of his kind. but once gone, his kind will be gone forever. we know them. we've lived among them. they've shaped us as jews and americans, as sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters. but our time of knowing them is nearly complete. and then they will be gone forever, and we will only remember them until we don't. we know them. we know them with tears for their suffering, with silence for all that cannot be said, with song for their unprecedented resilience. there will be no more old jews who interpret a spot of good news as the guarantee of imminent apocalypse, who treat buffets like grocery stores before blizzards, who touch a finger to the bottom lip before turning a page of their people's maxwell house epic.

sagal: all those things correlate with happy marriages. first of all, men tend to be happier in marriages than women, which makes sense because most women have to be married to men.
gross: yeah. and then i - we have les moonves, the head of cbs, forced out. and, you know, a lot of other people who - you know, people will remember having been forced out in the recent past. how do you think that's affecting, like, the world of television, not just from a viewing point of view but in terms of what's happening in the world of television production and television executives, television power?

you know, basically, slavery really complicated family relationships in ways that took many decades for them to recover. so after the civil war, you see marriage being one of the very first civil rights that african-americans are able to exercise. and they do that with a great deal of enthusiasm, to the point of overwhelming the union army, making it very difficult for them to handle the numbers of people trying to get married.

jonathan safran foer: such a really good question. it is a concept i'm familiar with. like a lot of jewish concepts, i have a kind of cocktail party familiarity, and i wouldn't want to pretend i know more than i do. but i think there's two ways of looking at or describing the book. one is it's about things falling apart, the dissolution of a family, global crisis that creates this massive fracture, not only in the middle east but between america and israel, between europe and israel, between american jews and israeli jews. the distances seem to be widening wherever you look.

in her debut novel, miranda popkey explores the kinds of raw and vulnerable conversations that happen between women in private - conversations over a cup of coffee, a bottle of wine or on a long car ride, discussions we don't always know how to start that sometimes take an unexpected turn. popkey's story follows an unnamed woman over 17 years as she opens up about topics like love and infidelity, desire and power. so it's fitting her book is called topics of conversation. miranda popkey says she was thinking about the kinds of messages women often absorb about how to think about those topics.

about superwoman though, white has been known for modesty. that was my blessing, she said of the song in 2012. they could've given that song to anybody. everybody wanted to work with them ... so for them to see in me that strength, that i could ... carry that song, was brilliant. besides, babyface is one of the most prolific writers of the century. for him to have that sensibility of what a woman really feels — he just gets it.
dafoe: ok, but there's other ones, too. yes, it's pretty good. it's good.

analysis: does netanyahu's win maintain status quo or push israel further right?
adams: that's right. so it protects you as far as employment and as far as having a place to live, having housing. at the same token, which was the great thing that legislative action can do that a court ruling can't do is, a court ruling can give those protections to the lgbt community. but it can't finesse those. so as we gave those protections, we actually exempted out religious schools.
thank you, bill. thank you, everybody.
and to our surprise and delight, ethel could act. but the song we wrote, everything's coming up roses, is an absolutely imitation, blow, gabriel, blow, cole porter kind of - or irving berlin or any of those brassy songs that they wrote for ethel to sing. it's a real ethel merman song. it requires no acting.
at the new hampshire meeting, 67-year-old nancy nolan tells two younger women that people didn't know about climate change in the 1980s when she had her kids. once her children were grown, i said to them, 'i hope you never have children,' which is an awful thing to say, nolan says, her voice wavering. it can bring me to tears easily.
and basically what they do, the federalist society, they have funding from all the sort of usual suspects of conservative foundations and sources - the koch brothers, the bradley and olin foundations. and they hold meetings. they bring in speakers to law schools. they have practice groups in bigger cities. every november, they have a convention at the mayflower hotel in washington. and in part, the purpose is to hold panel discussions, often including liberals, or usually one liberal, to give an opposing point of view. but they give an opportunity for conservatives to network with each other and talk to each other and meet each other and check each other out. and it is out of this informal collaboration more than the formal aspects of the meetings that there becomes known a conservative network of lawyers. and neil gorsuch is part of it. john roberts was part of it samuel alito was part of it. whether you're actually a member of the society doesn't really matter that much. there are only about 70,000 members. but you don't have to be a member to speak there. you don't have to be a member to go to the meetings. and this network, this conservative network that the federalist society has cultivated - largely through the work of leonard leo - has been a remarkable success in transforming american law.
gross: i spoke with trevor noah in november 2016 after the publication of his memoir born a crime. and he literally was. he's south african, the son of a black mother and white father. when noah was born in 1984, during the apartheid era, it was illegal for a black person and a white person to have sexual relations. as you can imagine, this led to complications for noah and for his mother, who he lived with. a film adaptation of the memoir is being made starring lupita nyong'o as the young trevor noah's mother. trevor noah speaks six different languages, including several african languages. his mother speaks several languages, too. i asked him to read a passage from his memoir about how he and his mother used language to navigate difficult situations.
netanyahu will be under major pressure to give in to their demands. his expected government would only have a narrow parliamentary majority and defectors could prompt a new election.
harrell: that's john f. williams of the memphis crime analysis unit ruining my premise. since 2006, the police there have been using predictive analytic software, something they call blue crush. they compiled years of data about crime in their city, everything from addresses and ages to times of day and weather patterns at the times of the offenses.
gross: so you can't blame all of these countries turning to fascism or authoritarianism. you can't blame it all on immigration. you can say immigrants are the scapegoats in some eastern european countries and in europe but, you know, not in china, not in venezuela. so when you look at the sweep of nations that you've just mentioned, is there any kind of overarching explanation you could give why so many parts of the world are moving toward or have already moved to authoritarianism?
foer: well, i think both of the characters jacob and julia bloch, i should say, are the sort of two heroes of the book, and they're a married couple. they're in their very early 40s. and the sort of domestic crisis that precipitates some of this - like the question of whether or not to stay in the marriage is a discovered cellphone which reveals an affair.
sagal: i've heard of effingham. i've never been there. i have always assumed, being from this part of illinois, that it got named when somebody said, that place - that effing (ph) ham.

let's go back to 1973 in stockholm, sweden. the country is gripped by a bank-heist-turned-hostage standoff. it's not just the crime that captivates the public but the surprising behavior of the victims. the hostages start to sympathize with their captors over the course of the six-day ordeal. the incident would later give rise to the term stockholm syndrome. the story behind that expression is the basis of the new movie stockholm, starring swedish actress noomi rapace. she plays bianca, one of the bank clerks. and here she is in the film, talking to a tv reporter after being taken hostage.
santoro remembers what francis said as he admired the palazzo's interior: 'beauty heals.' that is to say that the beauty of this house is very useful for them just to recuperate. so that's our first aim, just to help them.
jesmer: i would just suggest to you that winning a primary contest is a lot different than winning a general election contest. and look, he still did spend - like i said, i think it's been $40 to $45 million - so he was outspent, but not in the proportion that he is currently on track to be outspent. if you think about not only the cash on hand - so i think, you know, secretary clinton had 42 million, and he had 1 million. and then you look at their super pacs. she had 55 million, and the super pac for donald trump had 500,000. so if - you know, we're almost on track to a-hundred-to-one spending, and that is just unsustainable.

danforth: oh, absolutely. absolutely. i mean, i think - it's so strange for me now to look back because even by junior, senior year, that was not my peer group. but i absolutely kind of went right in to what was like the danger zone. i mean, i was like, let me carry a bible around high school with me. and let me meet with you in the mornings to pray before class and adopt, really, this whole sort of lifestyle that was not - it wasn't in my house. it was my friends with this sense that they're going to keep me from being true to myself essentially, and that's safer.

that's a great question. journalism is a popular career for women in romantic comedies, especially in the late 90s and early 2000s — how to lose a guy in 10 days, never been kissed, the devil wears prada. i've always found this fascinating. there are many reasons for this trend, and at the top of the list is that there's clear conflict when the love interest is a rival/source/boss. sometimes i wonder whether watching so many of those movies as a kid paved the way for my own journalism career. (if so, i'm not complaining!)
and we very sensibly, in my view - the american voters take a look and say look, i don't know what's going to happen in the next four years. i don't know that the twin towers are going to be attacked. i don't know that the berlin wall's going to come down. but i'm going to vote for the person that i trust most to handle whatever comes up in the next four years or at least trust more than the other person. and therefore, i need to know everything about that person.

dm: well i'm from that [reality], so it was personal. ...i'll never forget this: when i was recording minorville, i'm in my studio, and it was in a storage unit. ...usually 11 o'clock was the cutoff period, and i was about 10:45, maybe 11:15, a little late. but the lady [managing the office] comes down and she's like, cut it off! you're done! ...she's yelling at the top of her lungs. and then she says, and i have a gun and if you want to come back and retaliate, we can handle this. i don't deal with thugs. and i'm like, i am a christian rapper! ...when i would hear those things, i'm like, wow, my skin makes me a thug for a lot of people. ...all they have is what they hear from politicians—the dog whistles they hear from politicians—or what they hear on the news or whatever. it was like, nah i'm gonna tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help me god, with conviction.
prof. hunter: well, i think they were able to develop that concept in part because of their traditions from west africa, but also from the importance of the family. and knowing that family connections were really important to them, they were able to then create meaningful relationships, despite the fact that these relationships were not legal. so they understood the importance of family to their own survival and also to developing, you know, meaningful relationships that stretched across generations.

except they weren't. some rank-and-file troops did defect, as they have in previous instances, and they did fire bullets at maduro forces along with the rocks the street protesters threw. but not whole units — and certainly not the chiefs who command those units, who matched rubio tweet for tweet with declarations of loyalty to maduro.
sondheim: no, but i set up a rhyme scheme there of inner rhymes because i wanted the song to speed along, and inner rhymes help speed lines. so the knitting and sitting becomes a pattern for the song. so no, but the image itself, sure, you try to imagine what does an angry lady who wants to get out of a small town feel about the small-town life around her? and what would her image of inert, conventional people be?
the question, terry, is, was this new division necessary? i talked to folks inside hhs. and one lawyer who's worked on civil rights issues told me this was essentially a solution in search of a problem. there really hadn't been that many objections about religious liberty in health care, that workers weren't able to express their religious liberty which is protected. that has not been controversial that there should be protections if someone wants to opt out of an abortion because of his or her moral religious beliefs, that had been ok.

remember, emails were the one thing that he could really ding her on that had legs during the campaign that people didn't want to let go of. and i raise my hand and eventually just started calling out questions. and he looked at me, and i said, doesn't it give you pause? doesn't it give you any pause to ask a foreign government to interfere in our election, to get into the emails of any citizen in this country, let alone hillary clinton? doesn't that give you pause? and he tried to steamroll me and not answer the question, and i kept pushing. and he eventually said, be quiet, i know you're trying to save her - in reference to hillary clinton. and i remember it rolling off me because this is donald trump, and i had dealt with him so much by this point.
when james ehnes won a grammy earlier this year for his recording of barber, korngold, and walton violin concertos, the win was touted by one critic as a triumph of excellence over hype.
reading this, i was prepared to send copies of nanaville to every newly minted grandparent i know. i mean, who wouldn't want to be placed on a par with ice cream and shoe sales as a source of delight? but not so fast. quindlen's book isn't all cuddles and nursery rhymes. it comes with a stern warning and veers toward the preachy: grandparents, know thy place — you're not in charge anymore.
davies: this is fresh air. and we're speaking with sherry turkle. she's a professor at mit who's known for her studies of the impact of digital technology on our lives and culture. she has a new memoir called the empathy diaries.
kurtis: allen bush of bethlehem, pa.
amy, the wall street journal reports that chuchu tv is a youtube channel, and it's having tremendous success making something a lot less upsetting for kids. what is it?
gross: william barr, attorney general, has expanded early release of inmates in prisons that have large outbreaks in louisiana, connecticut and ohio. but he also wrote, the last thing our massively overburdened police forces need right now is the indiscriminate release of thousands of prisoners into the streets without any verification that those prisoners will follow the laws when released. do you share his concerns?
i think that so many times what we're listening to is the music under the lyrics. so the lyrics might be i'm here because of a breakup. i'm here because of something in my marriage or something with my child or with my job. but what's the music under that? what is what got you into this situation in the first place? is there some pattern or struggle that led you to this place? and that's what's really going to help them not only get over the thing that they came in for, but help them just relate better in the world.
steinem: no, because by that time, the marriage laws were equal. secondly, i - we were in love, david bale and i, and we wanted to be together. and so we were on our way anyway to oklahoma to the cherokee national reunion. and wilma mankiller, who's the chief of the cherokee nation - a dear friend - and she offered us a cherokee ceremony, so who could resist that?
foy: really good - just good enough.
hillary's early life is the same: the suburban upbringing, wellesley college, law school at yale. there she meets the same bill: charming and unfaithful with, eventually, credible assault allegations against him. but here the story changes: she leaves.
sagal: you're going to go with spinner - that's mo's story about the service that places those facebook ads.
cornish: what has catholicvote said about this when you reached out to them?
sondheim: no, i really don't. over a period of time, of course, that's become less true. there is much less contention about it now because it's been - it sort of has settled into the canon of musicals, and it's been done a number of times, and then a movie has been made of it. so it has been sort of accepted. but when it came out - well, i've had that with a number of - i had that same reaction from assassins. you know, there are certainly musicals that audiences get put off by on first seeing, usually because of the subject matter.
bianculli: and then, from the mary tyler moore show, there's one of the best pieces of acting she ever did and without hardly any dialogue. it's at the funeral of a colleague, the children's show tv host known as chuckles the clown. mary had spent most of the episode berating her colleagues for making tasteless jokes all week at the weird way the clown died. if you don't know, find the episode, which is called chuckles bites the dust. she doesn't find their humor the least bit funny, but at the service itself, as the reverend - played by john harkins - gives his eulogy for chuckles, mary - and mary alone - starts giggling and laughing until the reverend singles her out. it's hilarious, and it's all built on character.
among the issues facing the court will be:

sloan: what's one of his songs that i would know?
trump supporters on the religious right sometimes point to trump antecedents in the bible, where the lord used one imperfect vessel after another to work his will. one was the persian conqueror cyrus, who allowed some of the judeans captive in his country to return home and rebuild the temple of solomon around the year 500 b.c. (check out the old testament book of ezra for more details.)

gross: let's get to your show follies, which is about a reunion of middle-aged men and women who performed in the follies or the people who were the girlfriends, boyfriends, spouses of those people who performed in the follies. and so they're now middle-aged, and it's part set in the present and part set in the past, in the follies era. and some of the songs you wrote for the show are reminiscent of the shows that come out of those revues of the '30s and '40s, probably the '20s, too. was it fun, in a way, to write in a style that wasn't yours?

cohen has said that he paid clifford out of his own pocket and that he was never reimbursed by the trump campaign or the trump organization. however, he has refused to explain why he paid clifford the generous sum.
cornish: i want to move on to the issue of race. you write a lot about how it played out in the 2008 campaign for barack obama. he famously gave a speech on race, and you write about the idea that you didn't think the country would suddenly become post-racial but that his campaign helped us reckon with it in some way. do you look around the current environment and feel like we have reckoned with some of the ideas he talked about?
kurtis: she got seven out of eight.
i think most of all, i'll take the brunt of responsibility and say that it really did boil down to a lot of self doubt. i think i found myself in an unhealthy personal situation and relationship, and that definitely didn't help matters. editor's note: mandy moore has spoken openly about her marriage to the musician ryan adams. i think finding myself in a situation personally with someone that i held in such high regard, and working on things musically in a creative fashion and none of that ever coming to fruition also further instills the sense of self doubt and negativity. i was writing songs [that] never got released; a lot of songs were written during what i thought was a very fruitful time.

archibald: yeah. my colleague kyle whitmire calls it the alabamafication (ph) of america. i prefer to think of it as neobama (ph). but, i mean, we've tried a lot of these - a lot of the things that are being discussed now, whether it's immigration, whether it's welfare, whether it's incarceration, whether it's corruption. and it hasn't always worked quite the way we hoped it would.
diamond: well, it's interesting you bring that up because the theme that has been raised over and over again is that this administration has focused so much on the objections of doctors and workers who say we have religious objections to treating these patients, whereas the vulnerable patients who maybe haven't been able to access an abortion because the patient lives in a rural community and there's only one provider in that community who performs abortions and maybe this provider doesn't want to - has moral objections. so the patient is further locked out. or trans patients who historically were discriminated against and now are looking at the possibility of a rollback in regulations put by the obama administration.

but even in america, do you know if you were a group of sioux people who decided to submit to the government and try and do what they were being asked to do, you know, first of all - the rations given to you were disgusting more often than not. but if they didn't arrive, you and your people were going to start starving out there on the plains. and that - you know, the word hunger - because thomas has lost his family who have died on the stone floor of his house. his mother and his sister and his father have all died of hunger. so he knows what hunger is, so he notices hunger. and i was noticing hunger, as you say.

kander: the interesting thing is that i listened to everybody but kurt weill because i knew that was a dangerous area to be walking into. i listened to lots and lots and lots of german jazz and german vaudeville music of the '20s. but i stayed away zealously from listening to weill at all. what i think happened is that the kind of kurt weill musical pieces that we hear in our heads were influenced by the same thing that i was sort of digging into. his early music and more serious music is in many ways in a totally different style and quite wonderful and slightly academic. when he comes to writing to his musicals or operas, if you will, he's reflecting the sounds of those vaudeville houses and german jazz and that sort of sleazy world that i was trying to reflect, also. but the actual influence of weill's music itself was nonexistent.

as for donuts: you can find mentions of fried cakes in the bible, and pretty much every culture has their own beloved take on batter or dough hitting hot fat (not surprising, given that heating a cauldron of oil is a bit easier than rigging up an oven). something resembling modern donuts has probably been a part of american history since the early dutch settlers, and the treat got a big boost during world war i, thanks to the tasty outreach of the salvation army. but back stateside, donuts weren't as widespread as they are today — namely because making them was a fairly labor-intensive process.
gross: i have such ambivalence about some of these things 'cause i really believe people should be paid for the work that they do. and it bothers me when people, say, you know, write for, you know, a web publication and get paid little or nothing or, you know, expecting to, like, read the best newspapers in the world and not pay a cent for it. those newspapers need money in order to operate.

scott, who was an award-winning reporter for the new york times, has written a vivid and penetrating memoir, called the beneficiary, about her own illustrious main line family and the hefty emotional weight of inheritance. to give you a quick sense of her pedigree, scott's great-great-grandfather was a railroad baron and mentor to andrew carnegie; her daring and glamorous grandmother, helen hope montgomery scott, was said to be the inspiration for the hepburn character in the philadelphia story. growing up, scott and her siblings (along with four generations of relatives) lived in houses scattered over an 800-acre main line estate, which also boasted stables, a dairy farm, swimming pools, and a couple of one room schoolhouses.

as for grant, few actors have ever seemed happier to shake off the persona that made them famous. having escaped the rom-com prison on notting hill, he's begun to soar as the unexpectedly tender husband of meryl streep's florence foster jenkins and the hammy villain in paddington 2 - whose teddy bear hero, incidentally, is voiced by whishaw. here, grant brilliantly gives us the inner thorpe in his kaleidoscopic emptiness - from campy bonhomie to soiled ruthlessness to - surprise - his own occasional feelings of love.

the study finds one of the biggest bites to a country's budget results from the link between child marriage and population growth. the report estimates that a girl marrying at 13 will have an average of 26 percent more children over her lifetime than if she were married at 18 or older. and across the countries studied, ending child marriage would reduce total fertility rates by an average of 11 percent. take niger, where more than three-fourths of women are married before age 18 — the highest proportion in the world. the study finds that ending child marriage would slow population growth by 5 percent by 2030.
it was clear where his grandparents were from. but it became a family myth, because it was better business to be swedish than it was to be german during the war. and donald trump seems to have attached to the glamour of swedish [people]. he refers in his own book on several occasions to swedish models. so it's something that he seems to view as aspirational, as a good place to be from. you might remember when he made his comments about countries giving us immigrants, he said, why can't we get people from norway? so he seems to have a fixation on scandinavia as being a desirable place to be from.

kander: it's a hard - hard thing to answer. we had been together for so long that it seemed - sometimes, things like somebody's death seems unlikely because for years and years or years, that person has been alive and part of your life. one of the main things i think that helped me out was that we had three shows which were incomplete. one was scottsboro. one was the visit and one was curtains. and so for the next few years, finishing those shows felt like working with fred so that it wasn't that kind of sudden break-off of a - of an artistic relationship.
just in christian music in general, you can go to most of the record labels, you can go to most of the booking agents, you won't see people of color there. hip-hop is very diverse, but at the end of the day, it usually thrives within urban contexts. so when most people look at mainstream christian music and they see what is celebrated, they think that that's what christian hip-hop is.

loving doesn't waste time giving a history of the unions and marriages of african- and european-americans going back to the 17th century. in fact, the entire discussion of race in the film is pushed out of the room for as long as it can be, mirroring the choices of the couple themselves. it's a non-issue until it comes back for both the characters and the viewer, in an unavoidable fog seeping in under the door.

later, katja smokes a cigarette outside the courthouse across from the principal suspect's father, who is actually the one who alerted the police when he found fertilizer and bomb ingredients in his son's garage. kruger's face conveys anger, pity, distrust and gratitude, all of which resolve themselves into hopelessness. katja has no words. the title in the fade comes from a song by the rock band queens of the stone age. disappearing in the fade is how a departing lover describes himself. the band's leader, josh homme, also wrote the movie's score, which in the climax, features a sort of screechy clang that gave me shivers. it comes when katja is alone in another country in search of answers and when in the fade becomes, broadly speaking, a vigilante movie and a gripping one.

but as the series finale opens, it has all caught up with them. they are busted — or about to be busted — and it's time to run while there's still time. things move fast: five minutes into the episode, philip and elizabeth argue over whether to take their teenage son, henry — who has no idea they are spies — with them when they bolt for canada, or to leave him behind. they will take their older daughter, paige, who has already been brought into the family business. but they decide to leave henry. he deserves to keep his american life, they decide, because while they began it for him fraudulently, he has now built it for himself legitimately. it means losing him, probably forever. elizabeth fights it at first, but she knows philip is right. henry has a right to his identity. he has the right to remain the person he has become. and elizabeth is the one who wasn't ready. she may be the brutal realist in her own mind, the one who understands what unthinkable deeds may be required of her. but she has been fooling herself that when she had to, she would be able to leave her american identity and keep her american children.

foer: well, it's not - it's a moving fit, you know? the way that i feel about my jewish identity has been really radically changed by events in life, like becoming a writer is one, having children is another and getting older and watching, you know, my parents and grandparents get older has been another, the seasons of - being witness to the seasons of life and wanting to have some kind of infrastructure to deal with it, to cope with them. ritual has become more important to me as i've gotten older. it's not always religious ritual but it often borrows from judaism.

(speaking zulu) - let's get this white guy. you go to his left, and i'll come up behind him.
j chester: i think the other way to ask that question is, if we don't start working with our land in a more regenerative way, can the planet feed us? you know, just in the last 260 years, we've destroyed more than a third of the topsoil. we've deforested 46% of the trees. we've doubled co2 from 260 to 400 parts per million. we are an incredible force of nature, humans. and we've done all of that unconsciously. and just imagine with consciousness for the infinite possibilities of collaboration with nature. imagine what we could do with that.

jane mayer: well, it's really hard to tell. he is - as joel goldstein, a specialist in the vice presidency, told me, he calls him the sycophant in chief because when you do see him, he's usually acting as an emcee to trump or kind of echoing trump and praising trump. so his public role is really fawning. behind the scenes, though, according to newt gingrich, he's 1 of the 3 people who have the most power in the trump administration along with the chief of staff, john kelly, and trump himself.

lauren krenzel and heidi saman produced and edited the audio of this interview. bridget bentz, molly seavy-nesper and nicole cohen adapted it for the web.
there have always been two parts to the republican party's message: conservative social issues for its white, blue-collar, evangelical base (think school prayer, abortion, same-sex marriage, immigration and crime) and a supply-side, trickle-down economic message for the rich and corporations. trump has taken this two-pronged approach and put it on steroids.
there's a moment in the book when jacob - this is a flash forward - he takes his young - his middle son, max, to marfa, texas. and max has a kind of budding curiosity in astronomy. and jacob is the kind of parent who will, like, cling to any such thing and try to encourage it, probably until he kills the interest. but he takes him to marfa to an observatory. and at night, they're sitting on the roof of their airbnb and looking up at the stars and having a conversation. and max said, hey, you know, i wonder - why do you think it is that people whisper when they look at stars? and that's the end of the scene.
of course, these are the very things the alt-right wants to roll back. and just as it was in other ideological movements, the rancor among alt-right types — who can disagree over tactics, priorities and objectives — might serve the useful function of carving out more political room for their various revanchist factions to maneuver. the radicals often pull the movement in their ideological direction, but they also draw away fire and opprobrium from folks who less combative approaches to the same ends. that's partly how spencer, who makes a show of being well-mannered, name-dropping novelists and wearing ties, ended up a regular presence in the mainstream news media. his life's goal may be to cleave out of the united states a separate nation meant solely for white people, but at least he doesn't shout.

one of the things that makes statistical analysis of the oscars, and especially the best picture race, so difficult is that they completely changed the best picture field beginning with the awards handed out in 2010, doubling the number of nominees from five to ten. two years later, they changed it again, so there would be between five and ten nominees, depending on nomination voting. while the purpose of the expanded field was originally understood to be a desire to recognize high-quality popular films and maybe boost tv ratings for the ceremony (the dark knight was the spurned film most often mentioned as a potential beneficiary), what's happened certainly seems to be that smaller films have wiggled their way in. (that may be why there was a recent attempt to create a separate best popular film category — an idea that was quickly dumped.)

that emphasis on craft was, for me, one of the most beautiful, small aspects of the show. a big part of my job as a scientist is teaching graduate students who are trying to climb their own ladder to excellence. from a distance, science can be one of those places where full-fledged practitioners just seem to exist in a state of grace, of fully accomplished understanding. but, in truth, the ladder is made of a thousand small steps — and missteps. so often we only see people who are great in their fields as finished products. but teachers (and now the viewers of mrs. maisel) get to watch the difficult, and yet astonishing process, of the students assembling themselves into accomplishment.

disale hadn't always planned to be a teacher. he was studying to be an engineer but dropped out because of bullying by his peers. he enrolled in a teacher training course on his father's suggestion and was posted to paritewadi in 2009 for his first assignment.
gross: i didn't know this until we started talking today - after we'd set up the interview and after i had prepared - but your father has applied for clemency. so what grounds is he asking for clemency on, and is it connected at all to covid-19?

gross: this is fresh air. let's get back to my interview with sheryll cashin. she's the author of the new book loving: interracial intimacy and the threat to white supremacy. it's about the supreme court decision loving v. virginia that overturned state laws banning marriage between whites and people of color. june 12 marks the 50th anniversary of the decision.
u.s. diplomats had announced the decision to foreign delegations in july, saying the move is intended to render department policy consistent between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. previously, under a policy instituted in 2009 under then-secretary of state hillary clinton, domestic partners were considered members of the family — and thus eligible for a g-4 visa.

corbett claimed that her ex-husband ran a car over her foot, put out a cigarette on her hand, threw her into a wall and grasped her menacingly by her hair while they were alone on their boat in remote waters off maine's coast, an incident she said left her fearing for her life. she also provided the post with text messages and emails in which sorensen berated her and showed the newspaper a photo of a scar from the alleged cigarette burn.
davies: well, what we were talking about - the very young queen elizabeth inheriting the throne at the age of 25 and adjusting to the demands of it. and one of the things that we see in here is the effect on her marriage with her husband philip. and he finds it difficult, you know, the constraints of living in a palace and all of the demands on her and being kind of second to her.
gross: (laughter). so you played yourself in what turned out to be the final episode of pete holmes' hbo series crashing. you play, like, a well-known comic yourself - john mulaney. and your assistant tells pete holmes that you want pete holmes to open for you. and he's just, like, amazed. like, he's just left the christian circuit. now he's got this opportunity.
that is painfully familiar to ed coambs. he met ann 15 years ago at a party he hosted when they were living at opposite ends of houston. at 23, ed already had his finances in order.
one of the most recent projects to be part of our new canon, lemonade is a masterful excursion through terrains at once visually fantastical and emotionally all too real, exploring shattered trust in a broken relationship; the singular pain borne by the mothers of men like trayvon martin, eric garner and michael brown; the battering down of black women throughout history; the scars of all of these kinds of trauma; white-hot rage and hopeful, though not blind, reconciliation. the inventive, stunning lemonade film — credited to seven directors, with each dream-like scene lapped atop the next — has already generated a thousand points of exegesis (was that yellow dress and gushing water in honor of the cuban orisha oshun? was it coincidence that while wearing that dress, bey smashes a closed-circuit tv with her baseball bat?). but those visual shifts also provide sinew and shape to the hugely varied sonic palette that beyoncé employs as she flits between genres with everyone from jack white to the weeknd. lemonade is as much a pastiche musically as it is visually, but taken in totality, it is so artfully constructed that it feels right. pop music has only very rarely sprung from the mind or talent of a single auteur, but few solo artists have conceived of collaboration in as wide-ranging, or as dimension-shifting, a way as beyoncé has on this project — and she is the one most definitely in command. —anastasia tsioulcas (npr music)

when rumors of infidelity emerge during a five-month diplomatic trip philip takes without the queen, he can only focus on how the officials who run the royal household boss him around.
prof. hunter: well, i think it's more of a matter of emphasis - much of the existing literature tended to focus more on family forms and structures in response to some longstanding debates, even going back to the moynihan reports. but i was more interested in some of the internal dynamics of black marriages and families. and so many of those documents really spoke to those issues from the perspective of former slaves themselves.

moore's allies have also doubled down on the abortion issue in the race's final stretch. america first pac, a pro-president trump superpac supporting moore in the race, released an ad this week calling jones' position on abortion unforgivable, showing an ultrasound and a heartbeat that then flatlines.
president donald trump: i know that we're all going to make a deal on health care. that's such an easy one.
i think what's tricky, terry, is historically, the strategic plan was more of a symbolic document than a practical one. but we are watching as this administration is finding new ways, whether it's the office of refugee resettlement, the office of civil rights, some other things that have happened around the agency - finding new ways to use the regulatory structure to support this agenda of anti-abortion moves.
abigail is beloved in hungary — where it even became a musical — and it's easy to see why. like huckleberry finn, it tells the story of a frivolous young person who gains moral awareness by encountering painful truths. during her months of confinement in the school, gina learns the fallibility of her own judgment, the worthiness of other people and the existence of a historical world outside the bubble she's been living in.

and so - but we've seen this kind of whole raft of hugely ambitious initiatives. so, you know, this goes from his vision 2030, which was his big plan to sort of reformat both saudi society and the saudi economy. and it's this huge, ambitious plan that goes through, you know, trying to get more saudis into the private sector, trying to get more women saudis into the workforce. it goes all the way down into, you know, changing society so that saudis have more access to entertainment. it goes into trying to encourage more saudis to exercise on a regular basis. i mean, it's this huge, kind of sprawling document about all the things that he would like to see change in saudi society.

and i had always been a big fan of nanette fabray who worked with carl reiner and sid caesar on the show of shows. and i loved her humor. i loved the way she cried, and so when i was called upon to bring forth the tears in my scene, i'm not sure how much of it was out and out stolen from miss fabray and how much of it was just a matter of influence. but there was definitely a cracking in the voice and an inability to maintain a tone and a certain amount of verbal yodeling that took place and from that came, oh, rob.

sanders also pointed back to an earlier statement from trump, saying that moore should step aside if the allegations are true. the president still firmly believes that, sanders said thursday. but other gop leaders who had made similar statements last week have since dropped that qualifier as allegations against moore mount.
ronan: (as jo march) no. it isn't the right ending.
feldman: well, i mean, i don't know if what i had in those first few years could rightly be called a life. i mean, i would call it survival or hanging on to the very edge of survival. i left on faith. i think it's important to say that because where i come from, faith is everything. and when you leave this community, you also leave on faith 'cause that's how you've been trained to take risks. i sold my jewelry. i sold a book proposal. i had enough money to make a start. and i got very creative later, when the money ran out. i would sublet my apartment for a few weeks and go stay with friends. i donated my eggs at some point to survive.

many felt the movie furthered the government's pro-toilet campaign. one reviewer called it actor akshay's paean to prime minister narendra modi and his efforts to install more toilets in india:
bw: one of the first things we did was sit down and come with a framework for what kinds of stuff we would write about. ... we just wrote down a bunch of [key] words. we wanted it to be fun. we wanted it to be empowering. we wanted it to be danceable and rock and roll. catchy.
gross: this is fresh air, and if you're just joining us, my guest is tim wu. and his new book is called the attention merchants: the epic scramble to get inside our heads, and it's the history of advertising on media from radio and tv through, of course, the internet.
and so i was talking about his tone, and i guess i came off as relatively generous toward donald trump compared to my previous reporting because donald trump walks in and he barrels in and the first thing he sees is me standing off to the side. and he comes right up to me, and he kisses me on the cheek, just puts his hands on my shoulders and pulls me in before i could do anything. i was powerless. i just stood there frozen thinking, oh, my god, what is this man doing? he's not my friend. he's not my business partner. he's not a social acquaintance. he's not a family member of mine. this is somebody i am covering. this is a presidential candidate. i am the reporter assigned to this beat. that is just - it crosses a huge line. it's so unprofessional and so inappropriate given the circumstances.
he cites trump's belittling of women and people with disabilities, among other people, and his constant name-calling. he says such comments wouldn't be acceptable even for a middle school student body election ... but for the oval office? his essay, also published in the washington post, has now been shared millions of times.

mulaney: i think pete wrote me into that episode and one previously because, as he would say, we're very close friends. and i try to be a very nice person. but someone like pete knows that i can be extremely mean to him in order to make him laugh. so that was always our dynamic as friends was to make fun of the most sensitive things in his life to him, or when he was nervous, try to make it worse in order to make him laugh. but he thought that that would be a good use of me would be to play a tremendous bastard.
i think they've, you know, a lot of young women have grown up seeing barack obama in the white house, so they think of course we're going to have a woman. why does it have to be that woman? and so that's been very interesting, and i think some of her advisers looked at kind of the women's movement video as is this going to bring more men in? is this going to bring young women in? maybe we need something a little less, you know, rooted in that.

diamond: i don't use this word lightly, terry, but i'd say that this testing failure and the broader response to the coronavirus has been a catastrophe. the reasons it is a catastrophe, some are on the trump administration itself; some are simply bureaucratic breakdowns. and if i'm apportioning blame - in the middle of a crisis, it's hard to tell at all times who made what decision when, but certainly, the trump administration failed to plan for this moment. there were leadership failures, like failing to think through the implications of not having a testing strategy in place. there were leadership failures in allowing feuds to fester for months and months that - in the middle of a crisis, those cracks have widened and caused delays in making simple decisions.
while pence eventually pushed the right measures, the fact that it took him weeks to do so was really concerning at the time. and when he was named to lead the coronavirus task force, a lot of people rightly seized on that episode as an example of an epidemic, an outbreak that he did too little to stop.

mr. boies and mr. pottinger would go from toasting kessler as their 'whistle-blower' and 'informant' to torching him as a 'fraudster' and a 'spy.' kessler was a liar, and he wouldn't expose any sexual abuse. but he would reveal something else: the extraordinary, at times deceitful measures elite lawyers deployed in an effort to get evidence that could be used to win lucrative settlements — and keep misconduct hidden, allowing perpetrators to abuse again. mr. boies has publicly decried such deals as 'rich man's justice,' a way that powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy. this is how it works.

if history is any guide republicans will abandon — as they have before — traditional protections for the minority party, meaning that the views of opposition party senators will not be considered in the appointment of judges, even from states where both senators are democrats. senate democrats, even when they controlled the senate, did honor those gop views, but republicans have forsaken that traditional accommodation in recent times.

boudin: the transition back to the community after incarceration is always challenging, and it was challenging for my mother. but i never had a doubt in my mind about her ability to succeed. she's a hard worker. she's someone rooted in community, ambitious and optimistic and deeply committed to the people in her community and around her.
and he took that speech on the road in the summer of 1866. he's still giving it in 1867. and it has so many modern echoes today, especially the line where he says - it is all well and good, our constitution and our laws are all well and good when a good man is president, but what do we do with our laws and our constitution when a bad man is president? he was, of course, referring to andrew johnson.
boies says he represented his first alleged epstein victim in 2015, before theranos became a scandal, and added others subsequently.
chozick: well, i think that's a really good point because in every convention, you see this creation myth. you know, president obama had his biracial upbringing with his distant father and his single mother. and that very much kind of wove into the message of his campaign. as did bill clinton - he came into the convention, the man from hope, pulled himself up by his bootstraps from a working class family and wanted to help every american do the same.
gross: was there pornography when you were growing up in czechoslovakia?
legend: and i'm fine with that. it's ok.
vedantam: so states that did not expand medicaid, david, effectively became a control group. slusky he and his colleague donna ginther decided to look at what the effect of the medicaid expansion was on the divorce rate.
sanders: like, they would just go more places musically. and, like, yeah, when r&b becomes more hip-hop, there's less space for all of that stuff. and you end up hearing songs with fewer chords, fewer movements, you know.

siddharth dube came of age as a gay man in india in the 1990s — a time when a law dating back to 1864, section 377, criminalized homosexuality, calling it an unnatural offense. (the law was struck down by india's supreme court in september 2018.)
just pick yourself up and if it didn't happen this time, then the next time you experiment, maybe it will. it was a wonderfully supportive, creative environment. and dick van dyke was the most generous and supportive human being that i have ever worked with. and he very strongly influenced my life and my standards when i went out on my own later on.
gross: ok. so he marries your mother without meeting her.

but the tax bill ended up instead being traditionally republican in its focus on cutting taxes for the well-to-do but barely touching the working class and not helping the middle class to a significant degree.
minhaj: well, you think he's going to be nicer to muslims?
simon: justice maye often seems reserved. and arguably, she has to be. how does a great actress play someone who is reserved?
itzkoff: i think that she meant that he was somebody who was just turned on by, i think, everything that you can experience as a human being. we certainly know, you know, from his upbringing and even by the way that he conducted himself in his adult life - i mean, he was somebody who definitely needed affirmation from other people. and stand-up and live performance and acting were all ways that you could receive that. but certainly, by the time he became ensconced in hollywood and by the time his stand-up career started to take off, and mork & mindy became a hit, there were a lot of other kinds of temptations that were offered to him readily available and which he happily took advantage of. and that included a lot of drinking and drug abuse and cocaine use. and certainly in his marriage to valerie, there was infidelity - that you know, he had access to other women and indulged in that.
irish broadcaster rte's exit poll of friday's vote indicates that about 69 percent of voters were for repealing the 1983 amendment, and an exit poll from the irish times indicated a similar response, projecting that 68 percent of the vote was in favor of repeal.
at the time, there was little evidence to suggest abstinence programs work. randomized-control trials in the u.s. had shown that abstinence education programs didn't prevent teenage pregnancies or decrease high-risk sexual behavior.

mr. furstenberg: well, they're less orderly than they once were. marriage used to be the mainspring of the transition to adulthood. it accompanied leaving home and for men, was followed shortly after entering the workforce. but no longer. now, marriage lags the work transitions and the school transitions and leaving home by - often by a matter of some years.

moore has long been a divisive figure in alabama, even before the 2017 race. he had only narrowly won his judicial elections before and had been twice removed from the bench, first for refusing to remove a statue of the ten commandments he'd had erected in the state judiciary building. later, he was reelected to the court, but then suspended after he ordered alabama judges to ignore the u.s. supreme court's 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.

legend: right now, timing-wise, we've got one thing that we produce that i'm very excited about, which is called rhythm + flow. it's a new competition show that will be on netflix, and it starts in october. it's a hip-hop reality competition show. so think of all the shows you watch where all the singers are competing but for hip-hop. and with hip-hop, it's different because they're not covering songs. they're creating their own raps and competing for the judges and for the audiences. and our judges are cardi b, t.i. and chance the rapper. we've got some really great guest judges and producers and djs and collaborators - people like snoop dogg, people like jhene aiko. and it's going to be a really fun season.

the statement issued by buckingham palace on behalf of her majesty the queen read in its entirety:
the miami herald's julie k. brown broke the story open in november 2018 by chronicling accusations against epstein and the failures of major institutions to hold him accountable. brown says the press is among those institutions. boies cites the press' failings too.
we warned everybody to wear seersucker and some light fabric, lecounte said. and some folks didn't didn't listen to us and you could tell how they wish they had.
(soundbite of song, let's get the day started right)
and i certainly hope that that kind of thing would happen if i win. but for me, this is the album that needs to be recognized. if i'm never recognized ever again for anything, this is that moment. this is that record. this is the most terrifying journey i've ever been on, and so wouldn't it be nice to see it through and just, you know, wrap it up with a little ribbon?
turkle: i knew nothing. the first time i saw my name written out, i was 3 years old and i was kind of looking at old papers in a closet where my grandfather and grandmother kept, you know, old papers and old books. and i saw the name sherry zimmerman inscribed in a book. and i sort of knew that i had never seen that before. but instinctively i sort of knew it was mine. we never spoke about my biological father. we never mentioned his name. i knew not to mention his name. it was just a taboo in our family.
deggans: so i just liked seeing a different side of idris elba. as you can tell, he's not necessarily cracking jokes. he's playing this character pretty much the way he would play any character. but because the situation is so absurd, there's a humor that comes through. and i particularly like the characters.
on the other hand, some religious groups are exempted. churches and religious schools and charities get the right to employ only those people who adhere to their religious beliefs. does that sound contradictory? tyler deaton of the american unity fund, who identifies as a gay conservative, tries to explain.
in the new mexico case, the church argued that religious institutions should not be subject to more restrictions than those imposed on essential businesses. in an order handed down friday evening, the court denied the church's motion. the public's interest in limiting the covid-19 outbreak in the state, a compelling interest, outweighs the right to gather, the court concluded.
mark janus argued he should not be responsible for any collective bargaining fees if he has opted out of the union — and the high court's majority, including kennedy and the conservative justices, agreed.
gross: mike pompeo is president trump's choice to be secretary of state to succeed rex tillerson. pompeo has been the cia director in the trump administration. and i'm wondering if you think having a cia director in a diplomatic position will - if it has the possibility of raising suspicion in foreign countries where all americans there are seen as somehow being spies for the cia? (laughter) do you know what i mean? that's a kind of running theme.

this is the kind of book you may not want to read in public, because you'll be too tempted to share offill's tart observations with anyone not wearing earbuds. lizzie, whose worries keep her awake, is aware of the dangers of over-zealous self-medicating from her brother: i remind myself (as i often do) never to become so addicted to drugs or alcohol that i'm not allowed to use them, she writes. still, one thing good about being addicted to sleeping pills is that they don't call it addicted they call it habituated. even the family dog is a pro at self-soothing, with a thousand rounds of slobber frog fetch.

it's majority mormon, majority republican and deeply conservative. when the federal government said schools must let transgender kids use the bathrooms they choose, utah was one of 11 states that sued. yet a utah state senator says he'd rather the state itself find some compromise.
and i realized at that moment that i had a lot to try to teach these kids that i hadn't really realized. i mean, it was a real - a dawning of me on what this meant. and i said something to the cop about - you know, i've raised my children to respect the police. and he said, well, i'm going to let you go with a warning. but it was real - i don't know if you want to say come-to-jesus moment, but kind of that for me.
gross: ok. if you're just joining us, my guest is katy tur. she is a reporter for nbc and msnbc, and she covered the trump campaign for both. she has a new memoir. it's called unbelievable: my front-row seat to the craziest campaign in american history. we'll be right back after a break. this is fresh air.
diamond: matthew had been a major player in the legal fight to weaken or overturn the birth control protections in the affordable care act. the obama administration had included birth control as one of the preventive measures that insurers had to cover as part of the aca that immediately produced legal fights. religious groups said, we don't want to provide contraception to our employees. it went all the way to the supreme court. there was a compromise hashed out that some groups could decide to object to allowing birth control for religious reasons. with matthew bowman and some of the other hhs leaders in charge now, the trump administration a few months ago dramatically broadened that exception, allowing virtually any employer or organization to say, we don't want to provide contraception to our employees. so it's an interesting flip. the guy who fought this policy all the way to the supreme court is now on the inside working to roll it back.
forman: no. no, there was not pornography. you know, that's the funny thing. you know, it's - probably for this, you know, sentiment, you know, moralists who are calling for censorship, the - you know, the totalitarian regime would be ideal. because for 40 years, you wouldn't see any pornography on czech television or in czech movies or on the magazines' racks. you wouldn't see any, you know, violence, anything like that.
napoli: she lived large, and she gave large. she felt this almost-burden with the money that she had. and saying she hit the lotto isn't really fair. but - she had this money at her disposal, and she felt obligated to use it in a constructive way. but that's not to say she was ascetic or like a monk. she lived very, very lavishly as well.
wilson: i often question whether we are being judged because we are an interracial couple or because we're gay.

film director michael apted died thursday at his home in los angeles, according to his agent, roy ashton. no details of his death were given. at 79, apted left behind a body of work ranging from biopics to a james bond movie to a celebrated documentary series that established apted as a pioneering longitudinal filmmaker.

emanuel: evelyn reilly of the massachusetts family institute is now retired and still strongly opposes same-sex marriage. she says she's counting on president trump's judicial appointees to undo the changes of the past 15 years. lawyer mary bonauto thinks same-sex marriage is here to stay, but she says as a student of history, even the most celebrated victories have to be protected.
multiple analyses of home loans initiated during the housing boom have found that black and latino borrowers were more likely to receive high-risk loans than whites with similar incomes and credit scores. and once they had the subprime loans, blacks and hispanics were often charged higher interest rates than were white subprime borrowers with similar credit scores, according to a study by the center for responsible lending, a nonprofit research group.
movie theaters have reopened. saudi women can now drive cars and attend sports events. the kingdom says it has made it easier for women to enter the workplace.
there isn't a state-wide anti-discrimination law that protected lgbtq people [at that time], kreis says. there's no relationship recognition for same sex couples. and trans people are targeted — because many municipalities had anti cross-dressing laws.
the crisis led goodell to issue tougher league rules concerning domestic violence, including the six-game suspension penalty.
tur: you know, i do. and i do miss being out in the field reporting. i would be lying if i said that i didn't. i like being out there and talking to people and traveling and seeing the country and trying new places to eat especially. but i do like this new challenge of being in the anchor chair. and i'm able to really press politicians on what policies they're proposing or the inconsistencies that they've put out. i really enjoy that. and i think you can have nicer, fuller conversations on msnbc with this hour than you can have sometimes when you're doing a prepackaged report for nightly news or the today show or for any network broadcast for that matter 'cause you're so constrained within the limits of time there. so in some ways i miss it, in other ways i don't. but i also - yeah, i can have a life here.
bialik: correct. in neuroscience. and then i had my first son.
the pew report comes about a month before the 50th anniversary of the u.s. supreme court ruling in loving v. virginia. mildred loving, a part-native american, part-black woman, and richard loving, a white man, landed in a virginia county jail for getting married. today, one in six newlyweds marry someone outside their race, which appears to allude to a more accepting society.

that milesian association was both a proud feature and a persistent bug for roney, who led a succession of dynamic small groups and released some 20 albums as a leader — the most recent being blue dawn-blue nights, issued on highnote records last year. in the dark gleam of his tone and the slithery tensions in his phrasing, roney could often evoke his hero unreservedly. he won his lone grammy award alongside the surviving members of the miles davis quintet, for a 1994 album called a tribute to miles.
bodden: oh, they didn't get fema.
once american women got the right to vote in 1920, they started lobbying lawmakers, pushing them to recognize that their citizenship should not be tethered to that of a husband. there's a big scramble in those first two years for members of congress to get on the good side of women and to get women to join their constituency, kerber said. eventually rep. john cable, of ohio, introduced a bill to address the disparity. he may have been motivated by a nearing bid for re-election.
the show's premise: is it possible to fall in love with someone without ever seeing them?
but kathy is happy. she's thrilled to get married, looking at her husband over the registrar's book and thinking, no one could possibly be so nice. (to american readers, nice is a flat, dumb little word, but in england, there could be no fuller, warmer praise.) crudo's moments of pure love are like this: matter-of-fact, prosaic, perfect. my favorite is a day kathy and her husband decide to see no one. their new table arrives, that was exciting, they sat on the sofa waiting for it like people in line for a movie. later, they exchange new vows: i vow to wash up more, i vow to be less of a dick.
the mindset is that if women will participate in sports they will become more and more confident, she explains. and then men fear they will be losing their control over these women.

the police also came to sun's house, he told china's global times, saying, the officer kept emphasizing that it is important to have a child to carry on one's family name, but i can't abide by people imposing their values on me.
davies: tony shalhoub in big night - the scene at the end of big night, where you are fighting with your brother, kind of evokes classic italian films, like la strada. were you thinking about any of those films when you were preparing for that role - for that scene?
montanaro: you know, here's what's funny about this. trump himself has seemed to flirt with this idea. friday right after the bill was pulled, he said that he thinks he could get something done with democrats, and just two nights ago before a bipartisan group of senators at the white house, he said this.
chuck holton: if you think about it, they have so much in common - the liberals in america and isis.
six men lifted a white, wooden box and placed it over mrs. otto's casket, covering it completely. this way of laying people to rest has slowed the swamp's expansion — though it's not clear if it's stopped it.
so let's talk about how mike pence got into politics. he ran for congress for the first time in 1987 when he was 29. he won the primary, lost the general, then lost again in 1990. and i think it was during this time that the press found that he'd used donations - campaign donations - toward personal expenses like mortgage payments and groceries. so how did that affect his political career?
gross: this is fresh air. and if you're just joining us, my guest is katy tur, and she covered the donald trump campaign for nbc and msnbc. now she continues to report for nbc, and she has a show on msnbc. so she's an anchor for msnbc. her memoir about covering the trump campaign has just been published. it's called unbelievable.
and what happened was the kochs just attacked it with their entire machinery. they have a great political machine in 36 states. and they went at it. and eventually trump abandoned it. and so that border adjustment tax is gone. and in its place, we've got this new kind of tax reform proposal which since it doesn't include new taxes such as the border adjustment taxes, it instead is projecting a tremendous deficit - $1-and-a-half trillion over the next 10 years.
jamie manson, president of catholics for choice, said she hopes for what she describes as a better dialogue between church leaders and some rank-and-file catholics who disagree with aspects of the church's teachings.

mr. sharlet: i think he came in with a passion for it and was a terrific organizer. joe pitts, you know, not a well-known congressmen. he's a sort of avuncular character from amish country in pennsylvania, and i think - he's a former gym teacher. people sort of don't really see in him the canny legislator that he is. he was an organizer for abortion causes, was willing to bring with him into the family connections to a lot of state legislators. and that's a little bit how the family works. they want to have those relationships in case those guys step up to the next level of congress, and then they have those relationships there, as well. pitts simply lobbied hard for it within the group. and as the family puts it, they have a very organic model for decision-making. sam brownback, explaining the process to me - he says one man grows desirous of taking an action, and the others pull in behind. he was actually explaining that in relationship to a piece of legislation he had worked on with joe pitts in foreign affairs, but that applies as much to, i think, the stupak-pitts amendment on abortion.
let me put this a different way, cruz said. not a lot of conservatives come out of manhattan — alluding to trump's attack on the campaign trail that not a lot of evangelicals come out of cuba.

schlumpf: some people are upset about the general lack of privacy. a number of people have already accepted that that's going to happen, but again, found it problematic that it's being used in churches. now, it's important to note that the churches themselves were not aware and had not consented in any way that the data of their worship attendees was being collected.
simon: philip roth announced his retirement from writing when he was 80. i want to play a clip from an interview we were fortunate to do with him a few years ago. and he told us that he was making all kinds of new discoveries, like naps.
sagal: ...just for teenage boys to use while texting girls.
e harper: no, i wasn't. and i think leonard and i both knew what we were facing when we made that choice and that there would be hard times. but that's not - interestingly enough, it wasn't about color or racism that brought the marriage down. it was addiction.
where can i learn about resources and relief?
max lucado: kind of the bottom line for me, i don't think people come to the church where i preach to hear my view on politics. i'd like to think i'm going upriver in talking about world-view topics rather than particular political or controversial topics. so i've just stayed away from it through the years, which is funny because there was a time i wanted to go into politics. and so all of a sudden, here i am, i guess. i'm in the thick of it.
mb: and i'm the youngest of four.
smith: yes, i concur, a wonderful privilege.
and we talked about hungary. there's no question that the role that putin has played in giving kind of advice and being a role model for orban - that's important. then they have, in fact, undertaken a lot of propaganda and false information throughout europe. there are even those who think that they were involved in the brexit vote and, clearly, the kinds of things that they're now doing in terms of using chemical ways of getting rid of people they don't like. so as the secretary of state, what you try to do is to look at, what are the effects of russia's behavior among our friends and allies? who needs help? how do we share intelligence? and what do we do to make sure that our democracies are not undermined? and that's the role of the secretary of state.
(soundbite of tv show, a very english scandal)
i feel like when she reemerged as a candidate in 2016, she was a little bit more detached. i've seen her kind of overcome that a little bit. but she almost seems more distant, more detached than she did in her 2008 campaign. that said, she has hired people who understand the delegate process, who understood the caucus process, who have an excellent sort of data grassroots operation that, of course, the obama campaign had in 2008 and she - and her campaign did not.
gross: my understanding is that the defense budget has grown while the president wanted to seriously shrink the state department budget. what is the relationship between the state department and the defense department when it comes to countries like iran or russia or north korea?

anyone who has covid-19 symptoms or was in close contact with an infected person should get tested, according to state health officials. more information about testing is here, and a community test site locator is here.
arguably, the worst impact was the deadening sense of fear we all lived in. i remember the utter terror i felt when i was arrested with my long-term partner in delhi one night in 1988, merely because we lived openly together. the only reason we weren't persecuted further was because of my family's privileged position. few other indians had that kind of protection, and so the wiser course in those dangerous times for most gay indian men and women was to be invisible, to deny themselves normal, fulfilled lives.

ms. winston: the army is an evangelical church and basically, booth believed that you had to convert people and win them to christ, but he also realized you couldn't do that if they were physically hungry, if they were homeless, if they were really down and out. and that's how the social service aspect became so important.
briger: so your main character, tommy tester, is a young man. you describe him, i think, as a hustler. he's dedicated to providing for his sick father and he carries around this guitar with him all the time even he's not a very good musician. in fact, you say that he's kicked out of a rent party by no one other than willie the lion smith because he was so bad. why do you have him carrying around this guitar even though he's not very good on it?
gross: like, that's such a hideous thing to do.
rabbi adam scheier, an orthodox rabbi in montreal who accompanied canadian prime minister justin trudeau to the auschwitz concentration camp memorial in poland, said he does not know why his name appears on the israeli chief rabbinate's rejects list. he said he does not consider it a high-level decision to reject his standing as a jewish leader, but rather the evaluation of one government clerk without transparency.

gross: so your book is about all the demands on the internet for our attention, but you focus on ads, which are always demanding our attention. i mean, i find - i have to match wits with the ads. like, there's pop-ups that, like, move around and you have to chase them like it was a video game or something. and then there's ads where, like, you know, the x to, like, close the ad screen is so kind of small that you can't find it and you have to actually go looking for it. and so i spend all my energy - instead of, like, absorbing what the advertiser wants to communicate to me, i spend my energy trying to figure out how to defeat the ad.
pusha t: me and my brother are known for lyric-driven hip-hop. the hip-hop that we grew up on basically told the stories of what was going on outside at the time. that's how we learned, and those are the rules that we followed. you know, when you talk about the, you know, late-'80s, early-'90s, mid-'90s in virginia, you know, beautiful place, but there was also a pretty big drug culture there as well.
from that point on, the balance between craft, technique and inspiration that lies at the root of genius becomes a theme of the show. myerson takes maisel on as her manager, setting her on a path to learn the basics of the stand-up trade. at one point myerson, for example, sets maisel up to bomb so she can understand what that means.
in today's statement, the white house says, the president is proud to have been the first ever gop nominee to mention the lgbtq community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression.
gross: thank you so much for coming back to fresh air.

conan: there is bank accounts is another issue. should parents subsidize their kid's bank account?
elizabeth blackwell comes across as highly disciplined and anti-social. she held strong and sometimes unappealing beliefs. in addition to opposing women's suffrage, she was condescending and viewed herself as a deity. she found slavery abhorrent, but rescued an irish orphan girl in new york city, kept her as a lifelong servant, and declined to grant her any freedoms in adulthood.
shalhoub: i am. i mean, i have - i think, you know, people that know me - and especially my wife - would tell you that i'm very, very obsessive. i don't see myself that way. but i have to say that the show did - it did have somewhat of an impact, doing it for so long. you know, i started to think about things that hadn't really bothered me before...
cashin: oh, well, the year i clerked for him, there was a school desegregation case in which the court retreated. basically, it was a court where it was the beginning of the retreat from policing school desegregation. you know, basically saying to the extent that neighborhoods are segregated. it's not the school's fault, so they shouldn't have to overcome basically people's preferences and where to live. and then that was the beginning of the end - right? - of having vigorous enforcement of the ideals of brown. and i'll be honest, you know, i saw his heart breaking with that case. it was hard for me to watch. it was hard for him to watch. and that was part of the reason why i didn't go to become a civil-rights lawyer at that time. it was 1990, 1991. i would look at the courts.
sagal: bill, did paula's team do well enough to win?
when he did not show up a week later, i thought, 'well, this guy's a crackpot or, you know, a fabulist,' somebody who just likes to spin stories and just wasted our time, says winchester star reporter evan goodenow. and so i kind of dismissed it.

the unfolding controversy made what should have been a safe gop race anything but. it's the first democratic senate victory in the state in 25 years and now gives republicans an even narrower, 51-49 senate majority that could imperil gop legislative priorities in 2018. jones will be up for re-election to a full term in 2020.
burbank: i mean, i'm glad you're doing it. i'm really proud of you. i know you moved all the stuff out of the garage so you could set up your workstation. i'm sure the beer is great. but can we just all not talk about it anymore, please?
gross: except you never really know, do you?

washington: yeah, movie version was a soldier's story. the play was an off-broadway play in new york. and they came to new york reading actors for this tv series st. elsewhere. i never really wanted to do television because i wanted to do plays and movies, and i didn't want to become well-known for television. but this was an interesting script with many characters, so my agent thought, well, you know, you could get lost amongst the other characters. and so to make a long story long, they chose two actors, i believe, from new york, myself and david morse.

klein: and the emotional mic is very emotional.
it's not that this couldn't work; it's just that it doesn't work. at a micro level, there's considerable wit in how the transitions are done, so that a cut from a scene in the '80s to a scene in 2003 will put the characters' earlier and later iterations in conversation with each other. but the series lacks momentum, in part because just as a story starts to become interesting, we jump from that decade to somewhere else. it inevitably takes time for your viewing mind to first remember the details of what's going on in that timeline and then reenter that narrative emotionally. and just as you get situated? whoosh, buckle up, we're off to a different year.
martin: before we let you go, i do want to ask a sticky question, which is there are those who argue and will say that they think that the hesitation to address this issue, both with puerto rico and the district of columbia, is that these are predominately non-white and that's what the objection is?
there are procedures that trans patients might be seeking that aren't necessarily emergency care - hormonal therapy, fertility treatment, whatever it might be that could be seen as more elective. and those are things that advocacy groups had fought very hard to win and protect. and the trump administration is already backing away from those protections, which is a major blow for trans folks.
simon: did he leave a different impression the next day in las vegas?
but the nfl says molly brown declined to speak with league investigators, and thus they had insufficient information to corroborate her allegations.
baldonado: so you shot in the school that you went to when you were in high school. what was that like, shooting back there?
but i think part of it was also just fear of whatever reaction they might get from the audience. and having to be mainstream, having to appeal to as broad of an audience as possible, i think it psyched a lot of these networks out and made them afraid to take risks.
kahn: but when you see it on your phone, and you're just observing that your friends are doing something and you're not there, that's something you didn't get to see before.
if they're really not a fit for what you want in your life, then why pursue it just because they're attractive? she says. i say, don't settle, stick to your guns and really go after your 'fairytale.' because honestly, i do feel that there's somebody out there for everybody.
moore, who died wed. at the age of 80, played a single professional woman on the 1970s show named after her, and became beloved for her role on the dick van dyke show. originally broadcast in 1995.
that's like saying, 'that ax murderer out there, he's a great painter,'  biden told an audience of fraternity and sorority students in indianapolis. is there any other crime — and it's a crime — where there would be an explanation that the reason why we shouldn't pay attention to the transgression is because they're good at something?
that morning, i was assigned donald trump full time. and i sped up there from new york to new hampshire, driving there when a normal person - any political pro - would've flown. i just make it to this rally. it is raining. it is an awkward, curious event. and i'm standing there, writing down what he's saying on my phone, tweeting some of the things that he's saying as well, when suddenly, i hear my name. and i don't look up because i presume he's not talking about me, and my producer nudges me hard in the side. and there he is. he's pointing at me, looking at me, and so is the entire crowd and all the other reporters. and he says, katy, you're not paying attention. and i looked at him, and i yelled back out, i'm tweeting what you're saying, to which he seemed happy to hear. and that was the beginning of my interaction and my relationship with donald trump.
what he's accused of: attempting to consolidate power in the face of political opposition. a referendum last month gives him the green light to create a muscular presidency, with powers to personally appoint or dismiss ministers, select judges and rule by decree if he deems it necessary, bbc notes. ... he has jailed opponents and critics, including a 16-year-old, who insulted him and a miss turkey who shared a poem criticizing him. ... more than 50,000 people have been detained since a thwarted coup. ...
ten years ago, a slow-moving disaster shook the entire country: a financial meltdown that did not leave a single state untouched.

again, great question, says rieder, but the answer is still no. first, the chances are slim. more to the point, he says, valuing children as a means to an end — be it to cure climate change or, say, provide soldiers for the state — is ethically problematic.

the determination would have to be made as to whether or not the decisions they are making are connected to their religious teachings and to their core function as a religious organization, he says, or is it a pretext to discriminate?
the protests by lgbtq activists that followed stonewall remade the movement, known as the gay movement at the time. it spurred more lesbian, gay and bisexual americans to come out to their families, their communities and actively push for lgbtq civil rights. lgbtq historian lillian faderman points to the formation of the gay liberation front shortly after the uprising, and pride parades a year later to commemorate the protests. those parades now span cities across the country and the world.

this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. it's difficult or impossible to practice social distancing in an overcrowded prison, which is dangerous not only for the people who are incarcerated but also for the guards and other prison staff and for the families and communities they return home to. this is an issue of special concern for my guest, san francisco's new da chesa boudin. he's concerned about the health of prisoners in san francisco jails and about the health of his 75-year-old father david gilbert, who's in prison in new york. in 1981, gilbert and chesa's mother, kathy boudin, who were radical leftists, were arrested for driving the getaway car in a botched armed robbery of a brink's truck. two police officers and a guard were shot to death.
that's a real question of what is within bounds for an official. that's led to repeated legal challenges from the aclu and others who went all the way to the supreme court. my colleague based in texas, renuka rayasam, has covered this very closely. it's an area where there was no expectation that this would be one of the places where abortion would be hashed out and fought over. but the trump administration has been looking for ways to pull back the government's role. and where patients who maybe in the past had been able to seek abortions, now they're running into new barriers.
losing palin's support wasn't the only blow cruz suffered on tuesday. longtime iowa republican gov. terry branstad said he would like to see the texas senator lose, citing his opposition to the renewable fuel standard — important to the state's ethanol industry.
gross: yes, well let me stop you there. let's hear what he said on morning joe. so here is candidate donald trump on morning joe.
i learned to sew just by unstitching old suits and restitching them back together. i couldn't afford training. i had no money, she says.
shalhoub: (as primo) oh, i take you someday then. i mean, you like cream?
yeah. it's amazing. we don't know what the dogs are smelling, but the trainers are training the dogs on the scent of hypoglycemia and also hyperglycemia. the dogs are somehow able to put it together and tell the person 15 or maybe 20 minutes before the person's devices even say, 'hey, you're going into the low range!' because the dogs detect this in real time. so the person has an extra bit of time to do what they need to do, take glucose or whatever.

so it's really a lesson for me personally to hear people tell stories that i really, really feel and understand and may have shared with other people. but, you know, like courtney telling me that story was the first time i'd ever heard somebody relating that same story to me. and it was very, very powerful.

for the past half-century, until justice scalia's death, the supreme court has had a majority of republican-nominated justices, with a 5-to-4 conservative majority prevailing for decades in the majority of closely divided cases. a conservative filling the scalia vacancy would return the court to that narrow, 5-to-4 conservative domination. but with as many as three more vacancies possible in the next four years, that conservative domination could become overwhelming for generations to come.

cornish: do you mind if i bring it back to you? because i think that this is, like, this moment where we are getting to understand who you are outside of the obamas. and in the book, you wrote about how even you and your mother had a heart-to-heart about this moment, and you had an area of disagreement. can you talk about that?
albright: well, it matters because diplomacy, as i said, is the way that we deal with issues with other countries where we might have some disagreements. by the way, i teach at georgetown, and i say foreign policy is just trying to get some country to do what you want. that's all it is. so what are the tools? and my course is called the national security toolbox, and the basic tool is diplomacy. it's either carried on bilaterally between two countries or multilaterally at nato and the u.n. and you require diplomats to do that.
sanders: yeah. do you think that the rise of streaming and the ways that we've changed how we listen to music - has it forced you to change your songwriting? like, there's little things that we don't even notice. like, because spotify's algorithms look at whether or not people play the entire song all the way through, we now have artists making pop songs that are incredibly shorter than they were 10 years ago - things like that.
i am not at liberty to provide any guidance to alabama probate judges on the effect of obergefell on the existing orders of the alabama supreme court, he wrote. that issue remains before the entire [alabama supreme] court which continues to deliberate on the matter.
the trump rule tweaks the formula, allowing insurers to create plans with larger variations around the average. (it exempts certain silver plans for low-income consumers from the change.) so, for example, a bronze plan might cover only 56 percent of costs and silver 66 percent. insurers say this would allow them to create plans that appeal to more customers, particularly those looking for lower premiums. but critics say the move would increase the size of deductibles.
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross back with tim wu. he's best known for coining the term net neutrality and for writing about it. wu is a professor at columbia law school. his new book the attention merchants is a history of advertising that culminates with advertising on the internet and how it's changed the experience of being online and invaded our privacy.

one such case appears to be that of liu lijun, a successful real estate magnate in the northern city of yushu, in jilin province — so successful that in 2015, liu decided to lend 28 million yuan ($4.28 million) to the chairman of an agricultural company, zhang ping.
the national prayer breakfast, an annual event first held in 1953, is traditionally a nonpartisan event that draws thousands of people from a variety of faith traditions, including diplomats, businesspeople and politicians. every president since dwight eisenhower has addressed the breakfast. the co-chairs this year were sen. james lankford, r-okla., and sen. chris coons, d-del. house speaker nancy pelosi was among the members of congress in attendance.

in any other year in the gop primary, the texas senator, who talks of his faith with ease and frequently reiterates that he will defend religious liberty, might have the state's sizable evangelical vote sewn up. the voting bloc was crucial to his win in iowa earlier this month, and religious conservatives make up an even larger share of the south carolina republican electorate.
mr. peete: and that's the reason why i titled it not my boy is because that's the way i felt when i got that diagnosis. you know, this is not happening to me. this is not my boy. i had all these expectations of what i wanted him to do. i grew up - you know, my father was a coach and he took me in the locker room and he showed me things and we hung out together, and that's what i wanted for my son.
mondello: as he did with jerry's firing, director paul dano shows us the flames at first in joe's eyes, teen actor ed oxenbould unflinching for long moments. only after the car is headed homeward does dano let us see the blaze, its fury consuming an entire mountainside. the script that he and zoe kazan based on richard ford's novel does something similar in an emotional sense. it keeps coming back to joe as his parents' marriage goes up in flames, the camera capturing the three of them singed and smarting as the boy struggles to make sense of things. in that sense, wildlife's portrait of family life is much like the director's many onscreen performances - understated, sad-eyed, deeply affecting. i'm bob mondello.
martin: so can you just remind us of what brought this to a head? i mean, the fact is, in some parts of the country, there are already lgbtq clergy. and some ministers perform same-sex marriages. others didn't. but then there are also individual ministers who are being sanctioned and even defrocked for doing the same thing. i mean, so what was the status quo? and what brought this all to a head?
mayer: well, (laughter) that's a good question - because i think he acts as the connective tissue between the trump administration and congress, between the trump administration and the - kind of the socially conservative base of the party. and most importantly, he is the connector between the trump administration and the billionaire donors in the republican party. he is the guy who does most of the fundraising and outreach to the money.
jarrett: i did insofar as i didn't like to talk about having been born in iran. and if you think about it, until carter was elected and we had the hostage crisis, most people had never heard of iran. so it was just easier not to talk about it. and i think part of what struck me the first time i met president obama and we had dinner, he started asking me, like, well, where are you from? i said chicago. where were you born? i was born in shiraz, and i braced myself for kind of a banal conversation. and he said, well, that's interesting. and he leaned in, and he started to tell me about his life in indonesia and what he learned from that experience. and then i opened up more about iran. and i think the lesson i learned in that is that our stories are important. they reflect who we are. and i spent so much time trying to pretend like i was like everyone else when where i was different is my uniqueness, and it helped make me who i am.
simon: i know what you mean. so what did you learn from being in heaven's gate?
moore: separation of church and state never meant to separate god from government. the first amendment never meant to divide our country from an acknowledgement of god. it's time to stand up and say, we have a right under our constitution to acknowledge god.
you were still working on the song, like, still tightening up stuff, phillips reminds minor. i couldn't concentrate because you were starting and stopping the beat. so i went out to your garage and wrote it, and then came in and laid it down.
i think if we do that right, it helps get around this false choice that would imply that winning back working-class voters who are white somehow means we ought to walk away from our bedrock commitments on racial and social justice, he said in an interview with npr. which i think is the exact wrong way to go.
poundstone: and it's something like - the whole - it was something like $25,000 an hour or something for that plane.
vanderwerff: so i knew i needed to get it down on paper because it would feel false to me if i suddenly was just publishing under the name emily. and there are plenty of trans journalists who were like, oh, you should just start publishing under your new name. and, yeah, i could have done that. but i also think the relationship the critic has to the reader is a very important one, so it was born out of that. and then it just gradually became, like - there is this incredible assault on trans rights in america right now. and, like, i am a now vaguely public trans person writing about these issues. like, if there was a way i could use my coming out to draw just a little bit of attention to that, it felt to me like a net good.
legend: you know, i assume that that's the natural progression of things. that doesn't i mean i don't go out and try to make the best music i can. and you know, i still believe that i can make music that's relevant and important. but i do realize that, you know, if things go according to the way they've tended to go in the past, that eventually new artists come along that young listeners are more excited about. and they'll get more radio play. they'll get more, you know, pop coverage or whatever.

lotte lenya: (as fraulein schneider, singing) with time rushing by, what would you do? with the clock running down, what would you do? the young always have the cure - being brave, being sure and free. but imagine if you were me, alone like me. and this is the only world i know, some rooms to let, the sum of a lifetime, even so. i'll take your advice. what would you do? would you pay the price? what would you do? suppose simply keeping still means you manage until the end. what would you do, my brave, young friend? grown old like me, with neither the will nor wish to run; grown tired like me, who hurries for bed when day is done; grown wise like me, who isn't at war with anyone - not anyone.

you almost expect to hear from conservatives bashing the new york times. but the bernie bros was a real thing, and they had often very misogynist undertones attacking every time you wrote something perceived as positive about hillary clinton. even in a debate, if you kind of framed it as her having an edge in a debate, just a swarm of emails, twitter messages. some people would call my phone.

good morning. i'm david greene. you know what they say. love can't wait, not even in the time of coronavirus. new york governor andrew cuomo agrees. he is issuing an executive order allowing new yorkers to get a marriage license remotely. it also lets clerks perform ceremonies over video conference, so couples can say i do in the virtual presence of friends and family. but can they fit that long meeting link on a 4.25-by-6 fancy foil-pressed wedding invite? i'm not so sure.
gross: so some of his talking points, you say, come from some of the corporate sponsors of that indiana policy review foundation. like, i think tobacco - the tobacco lobby was one of the sponsors. and one of his top - one of pence's talking points was that smoking doesn't kill. in fact, 2 out of every 3 three smokers don't die from a smoking-related illness, that a greater scourge was big government disguised as do-gooder health care rhetoric.
and now, so far, he has acted in a way that is above board. but i think what i've heard, terry, is that these are still the early days of the trump administration. we're just one year in. and in many cases, the administrators over at hhs needed some time to kind of find their footing. and now they are starting to release a series of rules, building divisions - whatever it might be - that are laying the groundwork for future efforts down the line.
walsh-peelo: (as connor) but i don't know how to write a song.
siegel: democrats did so poorly with rural votes, white rural votes in michigan that the free press, the detroit free press - their model was so thrown off they made a very, very late call on election night. since you're in charge of the messaging arm of the democratic leadership in the senate, what's the message next time to white working-class voters, voters in rural areas that can turn that vote back to the democrats?
there are flowers all across hayley williams' nashville house, both living and deceased: dried-up bouquets of shriveled and curled roses, hydrangeas the color of weathered paperback pages, vibrant pots of purple and white pansies thriving in the patio sun. at first, this was her therapist's idea, to surround herself with these blooms – she'd never really been a flower person, never felt too connected to those ideas of femininity and girliness tangled up with them. but williams started to see them differently, to collect them, and keep them long past their traditional beauty had faded.

the emotional arc of hyperspace can be exhausting, especially if it hits close to home. but for fans, it may feel more important that the record has an emotional arc at all. beck's past few records have featured many excellent songs, but lately it's been hard to shake the feeling that he's grown more interested in engaging with music on formal terms than exploring deeper feelings. on hyperspace, he's not hiding anything. we happen to know more about his personal life at the moment than usual, but we don't need to in order to connect. anyone can recognize the sound of someone trying their best to pull themselves together.
mccammon: nominating pence, a governor with experience in congress, could also help trump with the party's establishment, who frequently urged him to watch his tone. but even in this speech, the real estate developer displayed his tendency to follow no script but his own, often drifting from his prepared remarks as he praised his running mate's economic record.
bianculli: well, i don't know, but i...
diamond: he basically said that trump should get a mulligan on his previous 70 years or so. and it's a fascinating interview to listen to because the question comes up again and again - how to judge this man who has done things that - things that aren't very christian, who has used language that isn't very christian. as my colleague isaac pointed out, so much for turning the other cheek. and tony perkins said, yeah, but we only have two cheeks; it's good to see someone fighting back and standing up for our kind of beliefs, and whether that means attacking his critics in a way that would not be very biblical - christian conservatives kind of like that he is rallying to their cause.

johnson: right, right. there are two competing narratives, but i got to say i think the gorilla is out of the cage, you know? you're not going to put the toothpaste back in the tube on this issue. i feel like the national legalization of gay marriage really did so much to just sort of justify and to legitimize lgbtq relationships. and with those floodgates open, i felt in the last couple years i started to see so many stories, so many movies, with lgbt storylines. and you saw kids kind of shrugging their shoulders about it, you know, where - my own experience, i've met, you know, my friends who have young teenagers, and they're coming out of the closet in middle school. and they just have role models that i certainly didn't have. so the moment is just based on kind of what i've noticed and what i've seen and what i've felt, again especially over the last couple years.

sondheim: no, i mean, we knew we were writing for that kind of outsized personality that she's got. we assumed that she couldn't act because she had played all of her life just low comedy and brassy songs. and this would require her to act and particularly at the end of the first act, where she discovers that her daughter has left her, and she's going to make the other daughter fill the younger daughter's shoes and make her into a star. and so i thought - if she can't act that moment because it's a - you know, it's a huge moment, you know, a woman facing a horrifying crisis and bulling her way through it. it's a big, emotional moment.

moore: and then lucy and several other shows followed. but in that show, it's a little like doing theater that's captured on film. you rehearse for five days. and then on the evening of the fifth day, the audience comes in and the cameras having blocked their moves and yours lined up with them, you film it from top to bottom in continuity. so during those five days, it was - at least the first three days, it was very much a matter of rehearse and contribute and attempt things and not be afraid to fail, to make a fool of yourself.
and what you've seen with pence is that in many ways, pence has brought in a ton of people who are allied with the kochs into the government, and he's brought a lot of their policies in - so whether it's on environmental issues or tax policy now where the kochs are working very closely with the trump white house on the trump tax plan. and it is a tax plan that the kochs love, and it's a tax plan that's going to help the super-rich according to many nonpartisan analyses and not do very much for the middle class. so you're beginning to kind of see the government moving in the direction of the kochs.

but at the same time, i think when you saw her close the convention, saying, if there are any little girls out there up at night watching, i might be the first woman president, but you could be next. you know, i heard from people with daughters who were really moved by that - frankly, even people who don't like hillary clinton. and so i think that the country, even though it has very complicated and not-all-that-positive views of hillary clinton, did feel like that was a moment.

giese: i first went to the eeoc in 2013. and i could see that i was not going to make any headway with them. so i gathered all my articles and all the work that i had done, and i had even written the beginnings of a legal brief, and i brought it to the aclu, where i met melissa goodman and ariela migdal. and i explained to them why i thought that this was so significant on a global level. and they got really excited. and a little by little, i introduced them to a group of my female colleagues. and we started to have meetings with them. and they started to reach out to interview many, many women, as many women directors as they could. and then after about a year and a half, they told me they were going to pursue it. and in may 2015, the new york times published the aclu's 15-page letter to the eeoc and to other government agencies, calling for an industry-wide federal investigation into systemic discrimination against women directors. and that was an extraordinary triumph.

the policy was toughened after the ray rice scandal in 2014. nfl commissioner roger goodell wrote the following in a letter to team owners in august of that year:
arquette: they would look at you like, oh, are you still working? or, you know - or they would just ignore you. honestly, there's people who didn't know who i was at all, and they would ignore you in line or they would just push past you. you were the kind of an invisible person, which, i think, helped me with that part - her frustration of feeling invisible and wanting to be visible. but yeah, it's really weird. i think people do respond differently to people.

but i think the real answer is more fundamental and has to do with the way hope and grief struggle to coexist in the same mind. since 2016, a lot of people have taken a grim pleasure in announcing they always knew clinton would lose. that america is too sexist, too racist, too rotten at the core for it to have gone any other way. there's relief in thinking like that, in shutting the door, in closing the case. by fanning out alternate narratives, this novel strips readers of the comfortable and cynical knowingness of it had to be like this — you would have had to be stupid to think it wouldn't be like this. instead, it asks us to imagine a different world. she could have been different; we could have been different; everything could have been different. and from there, what a short — excruciating, hopeful — leap it is to: everything could be different.

what we're hearing now in the immediate aftermath of parkland might not be representative of what a whole generation feels, parker says.
kabasele hired dibango to play saxophone in his group, african jazz. as part of that group, dibango traveled to what was then congo, now zaire, to spend a month with the band. instead, he stayed two years and opened his own club, tam-tam, in what was then the city of léopoldville, now kinshasa.
goldman: yeah, 2009, when he infamously ran into a fire hydrant outside his florida home - it was the start of the infidelity scandal that ended his marriage and precipitated his years-long downfall in the world of golf. you know, then in 2017, he was arrested for driving under the influence, not alcohol but pain medication that he'd been taking for one of his many golf-related injuries and surgeries.
martin: what is going on here?
and i ended up seeing this moment as, like, an impetus to leave because i felt that god wasn't punishing me with the car accident, but rather showing me that i could survive anything. and he gave - it gave me the courage to leave the very next day. and because of this, like, him telling me this number nine and, you know, being - dying and being reborn, i ended up reading it as a prediction, that he predicted that i would leave my old life and be reborn into a new one. but maybe i'm just still very superstitious.
christie was an obsessive about murder — after all, she wrote 80 novels, most of them murder mysteries. journalist michelle mcnamara was also obsessed with murder — specifically, researching and trying to crack cold cases. she created a popular website called true crime diary and, at the time of her sudden death in her sleep at the age of 46, mcnamara was writing a book about her quest to track down the predator she dubbed the golden state killer.

like any other year, there was plenty to celebrate in 2020. people graduated from high school and college, got married and had babies. we all found ways to mark those special moments — weddings and baby showers over zoom, drive-by graduation parties and distanced pot luck thanksgivings. neighborhoods even found a way to do socially distanced trick-or-treating.
in the summer of 2018, thomas refused an assignment to call epstein on a story, citing a conflict. at his request, the financier had made a $30,000 donation to a harlem cultural center. enrich, thomas' editor, ordered him not to write about epstein again. thomas was forced to leave the paper at the start of 2019. enrich says the times should have told readers about the episode, which the paper has never done.
hi, you're on wait wait... don't tell me.
as the frontperson of grammy-winning paramore, williams has never held herself back emotionally: paramore's most recent lp, 2017's after laughter, chronicled its own stories of depression, pain and coming to understand that maybe everyone else is smiling only so you don't notice the tears. but through every step of after laugher, williams was suffering. her marriage to new found glory's chad gilbert was ending. she remembers falling asleep during the tracking sessions, so mentally worn that it was hard to keep upright. she couldn't eat, she drank too much on tour. when she finally got back to nashville and entered intensive therapy, her beloved grandmother suffered an accident that resulted in severe and permanent memory loss. it was an essential, bitter dichotomy, that, as she worked through her own trauma and tried to gain footing in her life, others she loved were losing a grip on theirs.
sagal: has anybody ever asked you to come over to their house? would you explain...
sondheim: yeah. again, simple - it seems so simple. you hear lyrics like that, and you think, oh, i could write one of those. well, you couldn't. and it's all the effort that goes into making something sound effortless, which is a kind of art that i like. not all art has to seem effortless, you know? you see guernica. it's not effortless. but - you read war and peace. it's not effortless. but i think with lyrics, popular lyrics, popular songs - by popular, i mean show songs - you should always not be aware of the writer. i think you should be aware of the character and not think of the songs as written. dorothy had a wonderful line in - what i would call simple lyrics. i mean, her lyrics are so clean and so uncluttered and so seemingly effortless. and as we all know, it takes a huge amount of work to make something seem like there was no work in it at all.
gross: i ask that because it is the internet...
the two of them remain intrigued by each other, but early on, there's another complication: in another seemingly accidental meeting, louise meets david's wife, adele. she's played by eve hewson, who happens to be the daughter of u2 lead singer bono. like the other two leads, hewson is wonderful here; adele is totally unmannered, casual and, as it turns out, inscrutable.

and then, you know, you have other actors who, you know, who don't even try on some level. in our first year, kieran culkin didn't even - i mean, that wasn't part of the job as far as he was concerned, i don't think. he created a memorable character. but i do remember jeffrey donovan saying to me at one point, like, am i the only one who's doing the accent?
cheslow: although many of the outdated laws are not enforced, there may be others still in virginia's code that could result in discrimination. the commission plans to target those next. questions about race continue to be part of life in virginia. three couples sued the state last year for the right to get a marriage license without writing their race on their applications. victor glasberg represented them and said the requirement dates back to the 1924 racial integrity act still on the books. he's cheering on the commission's work to repeal that law and others like it.
i'm my own person; i tell him what i think. i'm standing very strong on the ground on my two feet, she told cnn in february.
akhavan: i'm sorry to cut you off. but as i was co-writing the adaptation, i realized that everything about this world reminded me so much of my time in a rehabilitation center. i had spent time in an outpatient rehabilitation center for an eating disorder in my 20s, and it really changed my life in a fantastic way. it was a great experience and a really painful, difficult one. and i was really familiar with being in group therapy and the dynamics of giving yourself up wholly like to - not holy, h-o-l-y, but w-h-o - to something larger than yourself and blindly trusting other people around you.
in that post-civil rights movement era, stella is learning how to perform whiteness at a time in which whiteness itself is also changing. and the scripts that she has learned within her jim crow upbringing in louisiana are not applicable to when she becomes this sort of wealthy white woman in california. and she has to perform whiteness in a different way. so, you know, i think for stella, i was interested in the way that she is constantly running from her past and also the way in which she is constantly having to learn how to perform race in a different way — in a way that is often unacceptable to the other white people around her.

one of the pioneers of afro-funk music, the saxophonist manu dibango, has died of covid-19. he was 86 years old, and died in paris. internationally, he was best known for his 1972 song soul makossa, though his entire oeuvre could have been the soundtrack to a cooler 1970s than most people lived. but that one, funk-drenched hit, lit by dibango's burning saxophone, went on to influence the sound of american disco — and its hooky spoken intro helped power songs by michael jackson and rihanna.

when bodyguard aired in the u.k. a couple months ago, it became a national obsession. not only does the show offer more shocking twists than a tank full of electric eels but its hero is, in many ways, the male version of homeland's charismatic carrie mathison: a devoted but psychologically fraying officer who's susceptible to the allures and manipulations of those he should know better than to get entangled with.

boies says the times account is terribly unfair. i didn't do anything deceitful here, and there's no basis for that allegation, boies tells npr in december. for them to put that in the article that is about me, without making clear that they're not making that allegation about me, it is, i think, quite misleading.
nixon, you know, sort of put tommy smothers on what was an early version of what became the enemies list whereas lbj, you know, president johnson - he wrote a letter to tom smothers the year before the smothers brothers were fired. and i brought this here 'cause i thought of it after the tweets. it said, it is part of the price of leadership of this great and free nation to be the target of clever satirists. these are lbj's words. you have given the gift of laughter to our people; may we never grow so somber or self-important that we fail to appreciate the humor in our lives. so that's different than can't be legal.

holmes: it's a little drunker. it's a little looser. i suspect, you know, that the heavy week of news that we've had may sober up some of these shows a little bit. it really depends on the mood in the room. they're not particularly good oscar predictors, but they sometimes - you know, because of their position in the season, about a month ahead of the oscars, sometimes, they provide a little momentum.

gerg is the code-name that i saved my partner at the time's name in my phone, so that nobody would look through my phone and see that i was dating a man. because when someone sends you a text, the notifications come up on your phone and i didn't want it to come up with a man's name. so it was kind of the pet name that i saved him as in my phone.
and so what we're doing in san francisco is not releasing people who are committing crimes but rather people who can safely be released with the right supervision, the right support, the right structures. and we see that in the statistics on the street. compared to march of 2019, this past month has seen a decrease in crime of approximately 40%. so we're both decreasing the jail population and seeing a parallel decrease in crime rates.

thompson: indeed. no, no, no. i mean, i understand. and i think it's probably healthy that we don't take comedy quite as seriously as drama. but i take comedy much more seriously because i think it's much harder. but that's another story. and, you know, you'll find most actors say that. i was in the sketch show that i described earlier with hugh and stephen and robbie coltrane.

and i left after that. and i came back about six months later to play him - i'd recorded the song if you don't want my love for my bruised orange record, and i wanted him to hear it. so i played it for him at his house. and that night, on the way out, we did the same thing - stopped at the piano and wrote god only knows - at least half of it. and i kept meaning to finish it over the years. it'd be the first song - when i'd think about finishing an unfinished song, god only knows is the first one i'd go to over the years. and i just couldn't finish it. i didn't have - you know, it was a very simple, basic song. i think that's why i had such a hard time finishing it.

tove says she hates change, then invariably flees whatever life she's settled in. she insists she wants to be normal, but chooses a painfully unconventional path. she keeps telling us that she's passive and powerless, yet what makes the book hopeful is that she's anything but. even if writing couldn't save her from herself, it lets her soar above the world's expectations and seek the truth on her own terms.
moore: the original premise was not too different from the one that we ended up pursuing. but i was to be divorced from a doctor and - rather than having, as we ended up doing, having me live with this doctor through medical school and internship and residency and then been dumped. cbs felt that having been divorced was unacceptable from a societal point of view, that people would see nothing humorous in divorce. how could you possibly laugh at a woman who had a broken marriage in her past?
diamond: we spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the best vantage points would be. i remember calling the hotline for reporters who have legal questions about what was allowed and where. i talked to a lawyer. where could we be? could we take photos? is it within our right if we approached tom price if we saw him walking? and dulles turned out to be an interesting vantage point because the charter jet terminal is kind of off to the side - for listeners who maybe have been to the main dulles terminal, it's kind of this big retro-future building. the charter jet terminal's a few hundred feet to the side of it, and there's a side road that kind of leads up to it.
the world has no right to my heart — a line from the musical hamilton — is one of rodham's epigraphs. but the act of writing a novel imagining the inner life of the country's most revered and reviled female politician seems to assert the precise opposite: that we do have a right to her heart, that in entering public life she also in some sense entered the public domain.
and they're trying to scare off the working whites from supporting the anti - this new anti-slavery party, the party of lincoln, republicans. and then when - and, fortunately, lincoln who's very deft, was able to win and become the president despite that. and then when he's up for re-election, these guys come up with this political hoax. they come out with this pamphlet. they make up this name, miscegenation.

it's not what anyone who plans to get married soon wants to hear, but there are a million ways a wedding can go wrong. missing rings, late-delivered cakes, drunken relatives: the potential for disaster is always there, just a slip of the mind or a bad decision away. but for evie, the narrator of crissy van meter's creatures, there are two problems with her upcoming ceremony: a dead whale has washed up on the island where she lives, and the smell is less than ideal. also, her fiance, a fisherman, has gone to work on a boat in a storm, and is presently unaccounted for.

npr's will huntsberry sends us this update from the sit-in outside the arena:
a logical solution might seem to be building toilets or giving people the money to do so. but proponents of clts say financial support is not very effective. bradley says toilets built through such subsidy-based approaches often go unused because the habit of going outside hasn't been undone. traveling across india, she describes seeing household latrines used as chicken coops or sometimes even as temples. the 2014 squat survey in five indian states found that in 40 percent of households with a working latrine, someone still defecates outside. households with toilets built through government support were twice as likely to practice open defecation as people who constructed toilets themselves.

what the structure arguments mean is that the power of government is limited in a much stricter way than previous judges have seen. so what these lawyers in the federalist society are trying to do is use the court to limit not just abortion rights, not just gay rights, not just affirmative action, the traditional issues, but to limit the power of government all together to address problems. and that is potentially the most dramatic change of all. and that's where you might see neil gorsuch assert his influence in the most direct way.

the study finds that child marriage can also damage a country's overall economy because of the devastating impact that under-age marriage has on a girl's educational prospects, which, in turn determine her earning power. there's a bit of chicken-and-egg conundrum when it comes to quantifying the connection between child marriage and high school dropout rates, notes petroni. that's because in places where child marriage is common, it's also often the case that girls don't have easy access to schools. so it can be hard to determine whether a girl drops out because she's been married off, or whether she's married off because she's no longer attending school.

so before you even think about what the acceptance might mean, you know, marrying into that family, marrying the son of this woman, you just think of that rejection, the prospect of the rejection and how crushing it can be. and i think this is so clever the way that this gets set up because everything about the way the system works makes you value that arranged marriage. it makes you want it because the alternative is so much worse. and so i'm walking in the supermarket and just hoping against hope that some person that i've never met looks at me and thinks i pass muster.

madeleine albright, welcome to fresh air. this book is a very personal one in a lot of ways because you fled fascism twice. your family is from czechoslovakia, where you were born. your father was a diplomat. the family fled fascism when you were a child, first from hitler. you moved to england, and then after world war ii, you returned to czechoslovakia but fled again, when the communists were taking over, and came to america. what is the warning you want to send to americans about what is happening here?

mayer: well, there you have it. it's just - in a nutshell, what you see is that in many ways, these think tanks which were taking tobacco money are a form of lobbying, corporate lobbying, an almost sort of advertisement for the companies that are funding them. and then you've got mike pence becoming kind of the mouth piece for these sentiments. so there he is saying that smoking doesn't kill. and in many other ways, many of the other sort of positions he took were the positions that were kind of being handed down from the heritage foundation. he called himself sort of part of a - i think it was like the seed farm that was being spread by the heritage foundation.

ghati alfons says that traditionally among the kuria people, cuttings took place beginning in november, at the end of the kenyan school year. but this year, school closures that began in march left girls exposed at home, and the cuttings began much earlier. as many as 2,800 girls — some as young as 7 or 8 years old — in kuria are believed to have been cut between september and mid-october, when kenyan schools partially reopened, according to estimates from the five foundation based on reports from activists on the ground.

and i put out my hand to shake hands with him, and he took my hand [and] he pulled me up to his face, and he gave me a kiss on the lips. and all my nervousness went out the window.
population density is also political because the constitution features a low-density bias that gives disproportionate power to less populous states. the founders negotiated a deal that split congress in two, with one chamber based on population (the house of representatives) and one that was not (the senate). in the senate, with all its special powers, the less populous states would always have clout disproportionate to their size.
gross: that's very sweet to look at it together at the same time but separate.
historically, terry, this has been a nonpolitical office that does a lot of coordination with foreign policy groups. it's located inside hhs for a variety of reasons, one being that refugees often have health concerns. they have mental health issues from the challenge of migrating to the united states. they may have had a harrowing trip and have health issues because of that. sometimes the women who have come through the refugee program have been assaulted - sexually assaulted on their way to the united states.
it's a little in the weeds, but the process for putting together a government in israel can lead a prime minister as much as the prime minister might try to lead the process. to be prime minister, you have to put together a majority coalition with at least 61 seats in the 120-seat parliament.

lung cancer, what? she still is incredulous. it's a silent killer. so, yes, covid has saved my life, she says. it's just this ... crazy irony that because of this pandemic, i found out that i have this life-threatening disease. when i say this, by the way, it still sounds like i'm talking about someone else. this can't be me. my life is very, very surreal. it's surreal on top of surreal. you just gotta laugh about it.
m martin: that was professor brandy monk-payton from fordham university. we're talking about the uproar at bachelor nation.
so i kept kind of coming back to hotspur. one of my favorite things about acting is seeing yourself as your character's lawyer and defending his position. and in the novel, i have this sense that william is trying to prove to himself — that he's the good guy and he's trying to do the same thing for his character and there's something kind of wonderful about that realization.

barry: well, i couldn't have because i just wouldn't have known anything, but my lovely son, toby, just a few years ago - he was only 16, and i was just beginning the book - became very, very unhappy. and, you know, when our young men become unhappy, you know, we've got to mobilize ourselves. you've got to really try and find out. i mean, in a way, you can't ask directly because that could be more distressing. you've got to be kind of super sherlock holmes of this unhappiness - could be something tiny, could be something huge.

vander plaats: well, first of all, my response is - i'll take this from one of the independent people who responded to me saying, that's all i need to know about beto o'rourke. and this guy's out shopping for a candidate that he can support. but he said, if beto doesn't want to come and speak to a group like yours, he goes, i don't need to listen to anything more. when mayor pete buttigieg comes out and says, you know, we're definitely going to consider the invitation, i think that opens up people's minds.

in his speech to the breakfast, trump promoted his administration's record in matters of faith, such as his effort to secure the freedom of andrew brunson, an evangelical pastor who spent two years in a turkish prison. turning to brunson, who was in the audience, trump took credit for his release in october 2018.
and it's kind of what i always wanted - as a kid coming up - was to be in a band. that was sort of the dream. but at the time, actually, it was quite interesting. it was a no-brainer. the hard decision was only, oh, i'm going to be broke again.

salaam remi's words immediately make me think about the fugees and amy winehouse and nas and the art of collaboration. the sight of him makes me remember running into remi on the street in 2015 brooklyn and how normal it was to recognize a person's whole face at first glance, to embrace and catch-up without the fabric masks of plague. my brain calls up the tragedies of that time, recalls how slow-moving they felt. the weeknd's can't feel my face was a huge hit that year. little did we know.

followers of new york politics say cuomo's reputation for micromanaging and being controlling and rough around the edges has often been seen as a negative in the past — but in a moment of crisis, he has gained accolades even from some critics for taking bold action.
personally, i'm a very patient person. i tend to date people who show me a lot up front that would make people run away. i had a boyfriend get arrested a couple dates in. i had a boyfriend pee in my roommate's closet a couple dates in — actually, that's the same guy. he ended up being a wonderful, wonderful human, and we dated for two years, but it all happened within the first month.

hubbard: you know, you'll generally hear that he's very popular with young people, and i think that's generally the case. i just would caveat it and say it's very hard to tell that - you know, this is an absolute monarchy. this is a place without civil society to speak of. this is a place without any kind of public polling. and, you know, because of the arrests and the social media crackdowns and everything else, it's been very - it's been made very clear to saudi citizens that if you are on board with the changes, you can speak, and you can praise, and you can go on twitter and talk about how great everything is. and if you're a bit more reluctant or if you think that this is not the right direction, then you should just shut up. you should just be quiet and keep it to yourself.

the problem is that overthrowing autocracies is a long-haul mission. but guaidó is having to work with u.s. foreign policymakers who envision it as a swashbuckling, one-fell-swoop act of monroe doctrine heroism. one that meets the cable news cycle deadline — if not the 2020 election deadline.

in 2007, the funeral home hired aimee stephens, whose employment records identified stephens as a man. six years later, stephens told rost that stephens identified as a woman and wanted to wear women's clothing to work. rost fired stephens, because rost believed both that allowing stephens to wear women's clothes would violate the funeral home's dress code and that he would be 'violating god's commands' by allowing stephens to dress in women's clothing.
pugh: well, when i read katherine, i didn't want her to be a villain. and any - the only way that we would support her until the end was if we recognized something in her, was if we, you know, wanted to look after her, we wanted to care for her as the audience. and so i approached that by simply making her very simple, very human, quite literally just being as instinctive as she is. and i think that's probably one of the beauties about her is she's so naughty and delicious.
green: in the united states, the first amendment guarantees a right of free exercise and free expression for all religious beliefs. and we've seen in court cases and laws that this is supposed to be a very broad definition, religious liberty for all kinds of beliefs and all peoples. under the trump administration, that has not always necessarily been the case.

progressive political protest is hardly a risky proposition for americana singer-songwriters, who can trace part of their lineage back to lefty folk revivalists and long-haired folk-rockers. it can become a major talking point around a new song or album and attract enthralled press coverage. hayes carll no doubt knows all this, having straddled the texas singer-songwriter and americana scenes for the last 17 years. but he seemed to rise into the ranks of the buzziest, most acclaimed voices in his field during the late '00s without ever letting the ennoblement ascribed to his chosen vocation go to his head.
martin: that is the reverend asa lee. he's associate dean for community life at wesley theological seminary in washington. reverend lee, thank you so much for speaking with us.
this is going to be a weird year no matter what — 1917 is a solid pick for front-runner via conventional wisdom, but it would also be an unconventional winner, in that the two actors in its main cast had relatively low profiles previously and it didn't land a single sag award nomination. once upon a time in hollywood is on a lot of people's prediction ballots, but it just doesn't feel to me like it has momentum outside of brad pitt's performance, and it feels like a weird moment in industry history to go out of your way to honor such an old-fashioned, kind of retro vision of film. on the one hand, there's a long tradition of hollywood loving movies about itself (argo, the artist, and so on). but on the other, the oscars are how hollywood tells itself a story about what it values, regardless of whether its collective behavior suggests it values anything of the kind. do people really want to declare right now that what they think is most important is this particular violent fantasy?
sagal: so we'll give him a chance to fix all of your problems as soon as he fixes ours. but in the meantime, give us a call. the number is 1-888-wait-wait - that's 1-888-924-8924.
chozick: well, that they don't like her (laughter). but obviously white working-class men have been abandoning the democratic party for years. but it was one of bill clinton's proudest accomplishments to bring some of them back into the party. and that has just changed dramatically her - i think donald trump is beating her by nearly 30 percentage points among white men. she's having real problems there.

so you know, as testing expands, we're going to get this increase in cases. hard to see the progress here - it's likely going to be much, much longer before life feels like normal again, right? i mean, many schools have extended closures. there'll be lots of distance learning going on. many scientists and public health experts watching china as the country lifts its restrictions. does the virus stay under control, or does it start to spread again? we can learn a lot by watching what happens there.
but nothing in lightfoot's past resume hints at the bold vision he and erik richter strand, who directed all six episodes, pull off here, consistently and brilliantly. the music choices, the color schemes, even the camera angles — everything has a purpose, even if that purpose isn't revealed fully until the jaw-dropping conclusion.

prof. winston: well, believe it or not, considering how staid they seem now, they were seen as like sensationalists.they were seen as vulgar. the times wrote that if your daughter joins the army, she should kiss her respectability good bye.
toobin: but there are variations. but i think it is certainly on the right of the party overall, and neil gorsuch is on the right of the party. and let me give you an example because this is something that was really a revelation to me in writing the story in the new yorker, which was, you know, i was very familiar with the idea of originalism and the idea that if you follow justice scalia's views of the constitution, james madison didn't think he was recognizing gay rights, so there shouldn't be any recognition of gay rights, abortion rights. but there's something deeper that leonard leo talks about, and gorsuch talks about it a little bit, albeit in coded ways. and that's when he talks about the structure of the constitution. this has become a big buzz word in conservative circles in recent years, the structure of the constitution. and by that, he means that the different branches of government have clearly and narrowly defined roles. and if they stray outside the lines, it's the job of the courts to discipline the other branches of government.
after five years of marriage — and many more years of internal turmoil — lange had realized that despite being assigned male at birth, she'd felt female her entire life.

moore: movies were new to me. and, you know, they may have not felt as well-written and directed as the television shows that i had been involved in. but i thought, well, see, that's the difference in the medium. you know, this is a movie. and so they know what they're doing. and, as it turned out, they didn't. but (laughter) it's all right.

questioned by sen. john kennedy, r-la., petersen conceded that he had never tried a case in federal or state court, and that he had never taken a deposition on his own. as the agonizingly painful exchange continued, petersen was unable to answer even the most basic of questions about the rules of evidence for trials.
this focus on anger supersedes our ability to see the genius within these artists, too – women are rarely immune, and take years or decades to grow out of that caging.
that's not to say tallent didn't try. here's one of the many passages in her profound new memoir, scratched, in which she reflects on the onset of her writer's block and her attempts to break through:
rome's municipal- and church-run shelters for the city's thousands of homeless people tend to be spartan. but this three-story building's carved wooden ceilings, frescoed walls and tiled floors are evidence of its aristocratic origins.
i haven't really talked to any hard-core parasite-in-last-place people, even though i know they exist, and undoubtedly there will be those who simply won't vote for a foreign-language film. still, i don't get the sense that there's a significant faction dragging it down, putting it last. i don't think that will hold true for joker, or once upon a time in hollywood, or even the irishman — the latter because i suspect a chunk of voters retain a little bit of netflix resentment. again, it's all speculation. but the parasite theory would be that an academy that's ready to nominate foreign-language films two years in a row is ready to give one the win. bong joon-ho seems to be hugely well-liked, the movie is fantastic (entertaining and artful), and it just ... it feels possible. that's my thesis. my thesis is that it feels possible — although bong winning best director while something else wins best picture does, too.

it was ... the end of the gold rush era. and so people streamed northward. and it was an incredibly arduous passage to this territory in [what was] really alaska then, or, i guess, northwest canada. there was this dream of people going there. they had to carry 1,000 pounds of goods with them to make sure that they would make the trip. so it was a really hard trip, and they had to eat horse meat along the way, and there were driving mosquitoes. but when they got there, they were looking for gold.

foer: the seder always moved me, the passover seder - the story, the occasion. you know, it's like a really singular event, gathering friends and family at a table to share a meal and have a discussion about the most important themes there are, like what is it to be a stranger? what is it to be in a community? what is good? what is evil? what is collective punishment? what is redemption? and what is home? and i loved it. i loved it as a kid, and i've always loved it. i've always felt unsatisfied at the end of seders, like this singular occasion was not fulfilled. so the haggadah's like a user's manual for the night. it's literally the script, so i thought if there were a different script, might the evening be more fulfilling?
dm: there's a lot of christian artists in general that say there's hostility towards their music because it's christian. i don't think that's always the case. ...the issue for a lot of people's music is not that it's christian—it's that it's arrogant or one-dimensional or a carbon copy of someone else. ...oftentimes they wanna follow the typical christian tropes that'll get them christian bookings, and they get frustrated that that doesn't work outside of that bubble. ... so if i say, you dumb drug dealers, get your life together! if a drug dealer hears that, how does that impact them? so then why do i get frustrated if drug dealers are like, i'll never listen to christian music? of course not, because you just trashed them!

david edelstein, byline: the fascinating thing about the new bourne movie, jason bourne, is how it makes the evolutionary case for multitasking. see, it's not enough that bourne, the cia pariah played by matt damon, can box, kung fu fight and drive at high speeds on the wrong side of the road. to keep from being killed, he also must hold in his brain the idea that he's being watched by a limitless number of cameras on a limitless number of screens.

the best episodes here are layered and complex; they juggle questions of whether a good marriage is possible among people in this orbit, how a family's history can shape children and their parents and how forgiveness has its limits. occasionally, they end with photos showing the actual events and people fictionalized in the series, often with poignant effect.
manson: well, there was some murmurings in germany by bishops that they were considering, how can we bless same-sex couples? so i think that put a lot of pressure on the vatican. also, the pope - there was a documentary last year - that the pope suggested support for civil unions. so i think the vatican hates confusion, and they like to clarify things when things get a bit muddy. so i think that probably prompted this.

popkey: i think, where do the desires that i don't recognize but that i have - where are those coming from? and the other question that i had was about narrative - what kinds of narratives are helpful? and what kinds of narratives are not helpful? because there certainly have been moments in my life when it was easy to tell myself a kind of narrative that allowed me to not take appropriate responsibility for my behavior. i think that that is something else that is going on in that scene at the bar that you asked me to read. the narrator is a little bit letting herself off the hook. she's saying, this is the only way i can be because this is what i learned. i think it is our responsibility also - especially those of us with the emotional capacity and the privilege and the time to be able to do so - to look for different kinds of narratives and to tell ourselves different kinds of narratives.

it's such an unusual marriage, so to speak, between pence and trump. you know, trump has been accused of sexual harassment. trump is on the record as having talked about grabbing women on those access hollywood tapes. mike pence won't even have dinner with a woman if there's alcohol served unless his wife is accompanying him. you know, he's a right-wing, evangelical christian, and trump does not seem driven by any kind of, like, religious creed. it's just hard to imagine them having any chemistry together.

mr. sharlet: yeah, i think it's always been very important to the family, going back to the beginning of the group's roots in the 1930s, when they actually formed with the idea that democracy wasn't going to work. remember, this was in the 1930s, and they're looking around the world, and they see communism as this incredibly powerful world force, and fascism is, of course, too. well, they certainly don't want to be communism. fascism they are a little more sympathetic to, and there were a lot of sort of early-american fascists in the group, but it's still a problem because it's a cult of personality. they put hitler and mussolini where jesus is.

what trump has said about him (emphasis ours): the white house issued a readout of their phone call from april 29:

i think that charge of a farm to feed the world, you know, comes, like, from post-world war ii. it's not the job of a farm to feed the world. it's the job of a farm to feed its community, and the loss of just that understanding is how we got here. our goal is to feed, you know, the area around us. and yes, is it economically possible? sure. i mean, not - our way specifically is not the way for every farm, but there's farms that are working in a regenerative way that are economically sustainable - absolutely. and it's just a decision, you know, an act and an understanding of the kinds of farms you're going to support, you know? that's probably going to give us the best chance at a change.

of course, gailey is far from the first author of speculative fiction to start out crafting strange, far-flung worlds before deciding to narrow their scope and explore the nuances of our current reality. ursula k. le guin made that lateral move, and so did kurt vonnegut. that's not to say gailey resembles either of those legends; their voice has a clarity and resonance — and pace — all its own. the echo wife is a thriller at heart, but it takes its time, building suspense gradually and allowing the cumulative mass of deceptions and consequences begin to weigh on evelyn and martine — and even the departed nathan, who might as well be an omnipresent specter who continues to pressure his two survivors from beyond the grave.

conway: i was such an anomalous person in my native australia, and i think it would have been very difficult for me to fit into a conventional australian marriage. john conway was already a professional scholar. he wasn't somebody who wanted a wife to make a comfortable domestic environment for him. he wanted a partner in sort of major intellectual tasks, and that was a relationship that i thought i could handle. i wasn't absolutely certain that i could ever settle into being the helping wife who's always typing her husband's manuscripts and managing somehow or another to create the right environment for somebody else to blossom in.

this campaign is going after organized obstructions to party rule from alternative power bases, says jeremy daum, a legal scholar at yale university's paul tsai china center who reviewed several cases with npr. this campaign is trying to root out the people who aren't faithfully implementing the direction of the party or are obstructing its implementation at the lowest levels.

gross: so i want to ask you about some of the things that hillary clinton is now most often attacked for. on the list includes her emails, her private email server, benghazi, connections to banks, speaking fees from places like goldman sachs - and there's more. on the list of things that she's most often attacked for by republicans and by democrats who oppose her, do you get a sense of which the clinton team is most concerned about?
bw: yeah, that may be why. i don't tend to reach out to people and ask them if they want to co-write, but mary asked me.

at least two said they would vote for moore even if he had committed sex crimes against a 14-year-old.
lee: yeah. so when we speak about sort of televangelism, this phenomenon of excessive wealth kind of is not unique to any one ethnic expression of televangelists. and jonathan walton, who's a professor at harvard who wrote a book in 2009 called watch this!: the ethics and aesthetics of black televangelism - and one of the things that he puts forth is just that eddie, himself, bishop long, himself - in order to establish sort of the idea of god's blessing from a prosperity perspective really use the wealth of his ministry to fund everything from multiple houses to airplanes to cars, etc. and then would use these assets, if you will, to say this is the blessing of god which is classic prosperity gospel ministry.
gross: and what are the leading issues that the family advocates?
elving: not even close. this was supposed to be a compromise written to unite the various factions of the republican majority in the house. and it was once thought to likely get over 200 votes. but instead, it got crushed - only 121 votes for more than 300 votes opposed. so for speaker paul ryan and his leadership team to lose on a bill like this, as you say, with the support of the president and half their own party members voting no - that is simply devastating.
bialik: yeah, but honestly, you know, the other kind of jobs and job opportunities that would've been available to me were other sitcoms, which no insult to sitcoms, 'cause clearly, they are how i make my living. you know, i'm the grandchild of immigrants, and i really wanted to go to college. and i wanted to be appreciated for the things inside of my head and not just sort of what i could offer people.

gross: so i know in the early days of the pandemic, you were worried about your father using the phone in prison, because there's, like, one phone for his unit. it doesn't work great, so you basically have to put your mouth really close to the phone in order to be heard. and, of course, that violates all the ways you're supposed to protect yourself against either transmitting or getting the virus. i don't know if that's even an option for him now. i mean, is the prison in lockdown? does he even have access to a phone?

hyperspace, his latest, disrupts the pattern, falling into a nebulous space between the two extremes. it is very much a breakup album, navigating themes as devastating as anything on sea change — but it is also a clear collaboration with its co-producer, pharrell williams, heavy on low-key funk and bright synthesizer tones. in sound alone, many of the songs aren't far off from the glossy bops of beck's previous album, colors, which yielded the late-career crossover hits up all night and dreams. but the often aggressive cheeriness of that album is gone, replaced by a dazed numbness most easily parsed as wow, this guy is going through something.

a couple years back, mcentire seemed gleefully aware of the options newly available to her when she put her own glossy spin on a collection of hymns, gospel spirituals and inspirational numbers. now, on stronger than the truth, she's made the inspired choice to circle back — not to her forebears, but to a crucial approach from her own recording career. the new album's polished warmth, narrative poignancy and modern honky-tonk heartache in some ways hearkens back to the 1984 set my kind of country, which helped establish her name and musical identity. the producer mcentire chose this time, buddy cannon, sang harmony on that '80s breakthrough, helmed her first album of the '00s and has become a nashville go-to for easeful, expert angles on traditionalism.
someone comes to them and says hey, let's talk about prayer. let's reach across the aisle. let's get together. this is the group that sponsors the national prayer breakfast, which a lot of congressmen mistakenly think is an ecumenical event going back to the early days of the republic. in fact, it's a private, sectarian event organized by the family as a sort of a lobbying fest. but they get involved with the best of intentions and, i think, are slowly brought into a relationship where they start moving rightward.
it begins with the ringing of a single bell, clear chimes filling the empty air, as if to call your attention to an opening or an arrival — the church doors are open, the family dog has finally come home. the bell mimics the steady ticking of a clock; but after twelve steady tolls, a second bell joins in, their complementary tones ping-ponging off of one another as more and more bells join the calculated frenzy. a deep bass begins to swell, then a bright burst of guitars swallow it all, as if time has slipped from its steady pulse into a sense of eerie calm.
hawley: ...single-handedly. you know, it's interesting. it's a song that i can't remember where i heard it the first time. but it's an italian-pop song, i believe, from the '60s.

there's not a story in sing to it that's less than brilliant, and the collection itself is even greater than the sum of its parts. hempel occasionally draws comparisons to authors like mary robison and joy williams, but she writes like nobody else — she's an irreplaceable literary treasure who has mastered the art of the short story more skillfully than just about any other writer out there. sing to it is a quiet masterpiece by a true american original.

the liar's dictionary, queasy with knowledge, is an audacious, idiosyncratic dual love story about how language and people intersect and connect, and about how far we'll go to save what we're passionate about. it's hard not to love a book in which even a broken lorgnette lens suffers a typographical crack — a small asterisk shatter, never mind one that champions winceworthliness, (n.), the value of idle pursuit, and puts a name on agrupt, (adj.), the irritation caused by having a denouement ruined. i won't do that to you. read this clever volume for yourself, from a to z.

johnson: yeah - who he loves very much and very authentically, but it gets confusing when he meets this kid elliott who he's also attracted to. and i think what is sort of at least fresh to me about the story was that alex's conflicts are not so much external. you know, he goes to a pretty progressive high school. it's not like, you know, he's going to get beat up if he comes out of the closet. so the conflict becomes internal. it becomes what am i really into? it's ok to date boys now in high school. it's ok to date girls. so it's all on me. where do i fall into all of this? and that's kind of what the movie is about.

the more explicitly upsetting songs on hyperspace are those that veer sharply away from feeling. the mid-tempo ballad chemical approaches the very concepts of love and romance with a cold scientific fatalism: i'm so high / love is a chemical / start it, start it again. other songs clustered near the record's center read like a coping mechanism set to music, drifting off into cosmic reveries that rationalize all emotion. in particular, the cloudy arrangements of stratosphere and the title track sound like dull, calm places where he's gone to hide.
the indefinite sentence is indeed lifting now for gay and trans individuals in india. but it continues for sex workers — and my motivation in writing this book was to draw attention to the terrible injustice done to them.

gross: ...in terms of tv criticism of the system.
greene: ok, shankar - a lot to take in here. so the thing that happens is if a couple gets divorced, at least on paper, their assets are split up. and so it looks like, you know, one person can get the care that they need. the other person is sort of uninvolved and can hang on to some of these assets. and so the couple, overall, has more.

george w. bush — again, a republican — followed bill clinton in the white house and seriously considered loosening restrictions on undocumented migrant workers in the united states. he met with vicente fox, then-president of mexico, to discuss the issue, which had considerable political upside on both sides of the southern border. bush envisions republican victories in 2004 and beyond if the party can boost its share of the growing latino vote; and fox believes migration is an issue that can re-energize his sagging presidency back home, robert s. leiken wrote for brookings in 2001. in a sense, they are trying to ride each other's coattails.

shortages in rural health care workforces, low rates of insurance coverage, and long distances from health care facilities have made it challenging for many americans outside urban areas to find high-quality, affordable health care. transgender people in rural areas often face particularly acute challenges when it comes to finding competent providers and obtaining health insurance.

gorsuch, thomas and alito would have let the modified trump travel ban go into effect in its entirety, while six justices, including the chief justice and kennedy, issued a compromise ruling that allowed the executive order to go into effect with certain conditions. until the court reviews the order more fully in october, the six said that the modified ban cannot be applied to foreign nationals who have a credible claim of bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states.

it's a great window into what's going on in our two political parties. the republican party has, over time, sorted itself into this sort of fairly homogeneous party. so if you took the metric white non-hispanic christian, the republican party is now 75 percent white, non-hispanic and christian. so when you get to that kind of homogeneity, regional differences kind of wash out.
justice antonin scalia, who wrote the decision, made a crucial point: male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil congress was concerned with when it enacted title vii. but statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws, rather than the principal concerns of our legislators, by which we are governed.

wu: net neutrality is the principle that the service providers who control or access, who own the pipes, should not favor some content over another. it's, you know, an even playing field for stuff on the internet, and, you know, i think it's very important to the medium that it have a rough quality among contents. everyone has their shot.
and he calls up, you know, a high-ranking official from lockheed martin and says, i think we should give them a discount. the person says, well, let me look into it and get back to you. and some of the other people in the room were just baffled because, usually, american officials are trying to look out for the interests of american companies and american arms manufacturers, and not look out for the interests of, you know, representatives of foreign governments.

mccammon: trump stood alone behind the podium at a hilton hotel in midtown manhattan. he suggested he'd chosen pence because of his reputation as a social conservative on issues like same-sex marriage and abortion.

parker: i would say zero chance of that happening. it's just not going - i don't think it's going to happen. they don't - by splitting the ticket or by bringing in a third-party candidate, they're essentially assuring that hillary clinton becomes the candidate - becomes the president. and who's going to volunteer for that job? they talk about people like ben sasse, who is somebody - you know, he's clearly a rising star and someone to watch...

it's not easy to describe the relationship that a player has with their instrument, he says. i mean, it's a professional tool in a certain sense, so — that sounds terrible, i mean, of course primarily it's this incredible work of art. but it is a tool, and we have to play it. it would do nobody any good if all the greatest instruments were locked up in a room somewhere.

ross: well, there's no denying that the bible says some pretty harsh things regarding homosexuality. there's no turning away from that. and it's - you know, it took me many nights on my knees, many nights of prayer and tears and heartache trying to process through myself what i thought that meant. so i don't - you know, i don't begrudge those who believe that it is sinful. but because of my own intimate experience with my own son, i have to then come to the conclusion that god created him to be who he was. and i think that's what we are called to do as god's children - is to read and look beyond into the heart of who god is not just the black and white words that are on the page.

the families without land or resources are, almost by definition, poor and lower or untouchable caste. clts creates a dynamic where high-caste families are shaming low-caste families publicly. this only reinforces existing structures of discrimination, which leads inevitably to conflict, ayers says. critics also say community-led efforts can spiral into witch-hunts, where people follow each other to catch someone doing the deed outside. sanjaya devkota says some communities in nepal set up systems to fine residents for open defecation with the money going to the person doing the reporting.

gross: you know, it's interesting to me you perceive the threat of like turning you into a gay conversion therapy center. you perceive the threat as coming from your peers, your fellow eighth graders, not from the adults. and that culture, i think, encouraged snitching on people you suspected were gay. did you feel like your friends were also potential snitches?
manson: well, i think that there's a really important global context here because teachings - when the vatican says things like this about same-sex love, same-sex unions, it actually has a very negative effect globally. it can promote hate speech. it can promote anti-lgbtq policies, even violence. the church is a global political power, so there will be deep ramifications. and as is so often the case with these ideological battles, the vulnerable will be the most wounded and adversely affected.

the power notebooks is a series of brief-but-potent meditations on women, autonomy, independence, and power, and more specifically on women strong in public, weak in private — including herself. in these reflective, journal-like entries, roiphe opens up, revealing the gentler person behind the polemical writer — and the accomplished literary scholar behind both. she seeks insights into her unstable affairs, breakups, and challenges as a single mother in the lives and work of such outwardly successful writers as sylvia plath, simone de beauvoir, mary mccarthy, and rebecca west, who nevertheless abdicated power in their personal lives.
diamond: you're hitting on another major victory for this administration, which is the president has appointed a supreme court justice. that was one reason why christian conservatives flocked to support him in the run up to the 2016 election. they were terrified that hillary clinton would almost surely appoint a supreme court justice who would be in favor of abortion rights, in favor of some other policies that republicans and conservatives really did not want to see. and then on the appellate level, trump had a historic year. he appointed 12 judges, more than any president has appointed in a single year. and that has led to the expectation that when these challenges come - because they will - there will be that much more support for the trump administration because the judiciary is being filled out with more judges who are sympathetic to these positions.

let me back up and explain. the aca said that if you were too poor to buy insurance but not poor enough to qualify for medicaid, you could now get coverage under an expansion of medicaid. many states signed up because the federal government promised to pick up most of the costs for this medicaid expansion. but many states, mostly states governed by republicans, did not. the political wrangling produced a research opportunity, according to david slusky, an economist i spoke to at the university of kansas.

considering how the apparent threat to their marriage dominated the first season finale, we don't see all that much of jack and rebecca in the season premiere. this is an episode spent primarily in the adulthood of the big three: kate, randall and kevin. specifically, it's their 37th birthday, one year after the birthday where we first met them. kate, who exposits that she's two sizes smaller than she was, has decided to seriously pursue singing. kevin is off shooting a movie with ron howard. randall and his wife, beth, are talking about adopting a baby.

diamond: secretary azar has had private views of being anti-abortion for years and years. i've talked to friends and colleagues who say what he has said recently in public is what he has thought in private for decades. what i think is notable, terry, is that alex azar has leaned into his anti-abortion thoughts and bona fides at a moment when his job was most at risk. secretary azar has led the health department for two years. the most significant statements he's made about the health department being the department of life, giving very effusive interviews where he praises the president's crackdown on abortion funding, for instance, that's happened a lot in the past few months because his own job was so at risk, i've been told, that he was appealing to a core group of supporters for president trump and, in doing these interviews, really trying to shore up support for his position.

while the novel's background is densely populated by supporting characters, they mostly feel underdeveloped. kiem's symbiotic, antagonistic relationship with the press has less to do with his history of high-society faux pas than it does in reporters' apparently single-minded greed to get the best scoop. an iskat professor and her thean student reveal personal ties to jainan, yet their impact on him is mostly as messengers for political intrigue. an exception is bel, kiem's dreamily competent aide, whose mysterious past could launch its own sequel and provide much-needed expansion to maxwell's universe.

diamond: the trump administration has argued that there's a surplus of tests, that anyone who wants a test can get one. and there is some truth to that. now tests have been churned out. but the sheer number of people who can run these tests, the number of labs that can perform them, right now it's still fairly limited. and even if there is raw supply for now, there are only so many labs that can do the tests and deliver results.
gross: you've said that one of the reasons why you were interested in the movie is because you're interested in freedom of expression. and you lived under two totalitarian regimes growing up in czechoslovakia, first the nazis and then the communists. and i'm wondering if some of larry flynt's uses of the right to free speech seemed trivial to you, both the pornography and things like nude photographs of jackie onassis. having been deprived of free speech, did this seem like such a trivial way of taking advantage of it?

so it was very, very exciting. and then, you know, i didn't really - i didn't know anything, you know, why it's happening. it was the most weird experience because i - this was - i remember very well polish blood is the name of the operetta. it's a very fluffy, light operetta. and this was 1944. and suddenly, in the third act during a very merry kind of a song, it was like a quartet or quintet and the ballet dancers on the stage. suddenly, the singers stopped singing and started to cry, tears running down. and the orchestra stopped, conductor stopped. the people in the theater are sitting silently, quietly, sort of upset or surprised. i just didn't know what's happening.

justified the killing of journalists. just because you're a journalist, he said, you are not exempted from assassination, if you're a son of a bitch. the philippines is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists to work — 78 journalists have been killed there since 1992, the third most of any country behind iraq and syria. (somalia is behind the philippines at no. 4.) though duterte's praised trump, he's also said: he is a bigot and i am not.

parnas and fruman wanted to build an energy business in ukraine but felt the u.s. ambassador in kiev, marie yovanovitch, stood in their way. parnas fed the president a fabrication that was sure to get his attention: that yovanovitch was an anti-trumper. she's basically walking around telling everybody, 'wait, he's going to get impeached,'  parnas told the president. trump was enraged. parnas and fruman and the t-mobile executives were pulling the same lever that night. and they all got results. t-mobile's merger was later approved, and ambassador yovanovitch was abruptly removed from the u.s. embassy in kiev. later, parnas and fruman were indicted on a -campaign-finance-violations charge (they had concealed the origins of their super-pac donation) and were arrested with one-way tickets to vienna in hand. (they have pleaded not guilty and face trial in 2021.) trump claimed he did not know them. this is the washington trump has built these past four years, where people who patronize trump businesses can expect preferential treatment, where a deputy secretary can oversee a bailout that benefits his family's company, where administration officials fly in private jets paid for by the public — and where top government officials don't bother to divest from industries whose policies they oversee. it started at the top, of course. just nine days before his inauguration, trump held his first news conference as president-elect.
jeb bush: i think it's my turn.
and of course that doesn't happen. so by the 1940s, they begin really actively recruiting and seeking out democrats. they've been sort of mostly republican, but they seek out democrats. for most of their history, those democrats were dixiecrats. strom thurmond used to file confidential reports, leaking, essentially, protected senate information to the family's leader. herman talmadge, all these guys - pat robertson's father, absalom willis robertson, a dixiecrat senator from virginia.

and, you know, it's testament to his abilities that, you know, he - not only is he acting against a stand-in basically, you know, he's - he then has to remember how he played the scene because he's sort trying to act against himself. and he was really - it was really amazing to watch him do that. one of his stand-ins - i won't say which one - was really a terrible actor.
and some of the, really the core rhetoric of the family is this idea that most of us misread the new testament, that christ's message - the bottom line of christ's message wasn't really about love or mercy or justice or forgiveness. it was about power. so doug coe, the leader of the group, tries to illustrate this, for instance, by saying, sort of posing a puzzle: name three men in the 20th century who best understood that message of the new testament. and most people are going to say someone like martin luther king, or bonhoeffer; or maybe they're more conservative, they're going to say billy graham. and coe likes to give in answer: hitler, stalin and mao, which just makes your jaw drop. and he will say - he's quick to say these are evil men, but they understood power. and that message recurs again, and again, and again in the family.

and john powell, a man we singled out in our brief, a noted pianist of his day, started taking up the darwin theory and perverting it through the theory of eugenics, the theory that applied to animals, to pigs, and hogs, and cattle. they started applying it to human beings. in taking darwinism that the negro race was a stepping stone, was that lost men we've always been looking for between the white man and the abominable snowman whoever else, they went back. and that's when the anglo-saxon club was formed in the state of virginia and that's when virginia legislature passed our present body of law. they took all these old laws. these antebellum and postbellum laws and they put them together into what we presently have.

women have also borne the brunt of many new pressures of pandemic life, from virtual school and increased responsibilities at home, even as ads and pop culture have continued to validate the idea of drinking to cope: mommy juice, rosé all day, wine down wednesdays. on top of that, eating disorders and underlying trauma from physical or sexual violence often add fuel to the fire, fanned by social isolation.

but stronger than the truth holds a sadder vignette still: a sleek, mid-tempo, hard country number titled the bar's getting lower. it's a barroom closing-time portrait of an aging woman who's haunted by the unattainable marriage-and-motherhood life script impressed upon her by her mother, and who surveys her diminished and disappointing options with crumbling confidence. the bridge is just 20 seconds long, but mcentire makes it a melodrama in miniature. she could thank him for the drink and walk away / live to love another day, she sings with fleeting conviction. then her voice flares as she begins to fret: but she's getting older / and the night's getting colder. for the final line, her delivery sinks and settles. the bar's getting lower, she observes somberly, transforming lower into a distressing, six-syllable word. in a promotional video, mcentire said she'd admired the song for a while. i hadn't [recorded] it before, she explained, because i knew it was gonna hurt. but she's up to the task of going there, with seasoned perspective and without reservation.

but on the other hand, as you said, you know, marriage was nearly universal among african-americans by 1900, for example. there are some disparities in terms of african-americans living in urban areas not being married to the same degree, but still, there was a propensity to marry in these early - by the early 20th century. that's only a few decades after slavery ends - not only to marry, but to also remarry. if they separated and divorced, they were likely to remarry again.
and so stan, devastated, is left behind to mourn the picture of himself he has held in his head for decades, while philip and elizabeth and paige burn their belongings — including the documents that were ready for henry that he won't be using — and assume new identities before they get the train to canada. oh, and the music is dire straits' brothers in arms, as it should be. they give henry a call, say goodbye without telling him it's goodbye, and then they're off. they are changing identities, too. but while they're really just trading one set of falsehoods for another, it's hard not to feel like the true philip and elizabeth jennings began, at some point, to exist. people who are so far removed from a couple of young russians who married each other for work, people who have had enough sex and children and arguments and reconciliations that now, they are real — which they realize as they abandon and bury those identities.

forman: yeah. in the film school. it was another paradox of communist society because it was the best school i could ever be going into. because after the communists took over, they purged from public life the best writers, the best filmmakers, the best artists in the country because they were not enough in creating in the vein of socialist realities for them. so they purged them. but they couldn't, you know, they couldn't kill them. they had to give them some chance to make a living. so make a meager living in teaching. so the result was that at the film school we had the best minds, the greatest artists, you know, which were teaching us, which we could talk to.
like hbo's big little lies, all we know at the start is that someone is dead. not until the end will we know the identity of the murderer or the victim. why women kill ups the ante by spreading that formula across three different stories, plotlines and timelines. each episode of the series bounces among 1963, 1984 and 2019. each era has its own story and its own female protagonist. the common denominator is the house in which they all live. it's the same lavish pasadena home renovated and redecorated for each decade.

well, i think so many listeners will know there are oftentimes that young women run into roadblocks in their families. and hers had been, i think, more significant than most. she had wanted to continue university study. her uncle said [she] couldn't do that. she had wanted to marry the person she loved and she couldn't do that. and so then she gets drawn into this world where women are really battling for their rights. and that fight merges with the fight against the islamic state. and she transforms, i think, as we see her, as readers, in the story, from this assistant who's driving a vehicle is providing ammunition when they had it, which wasn't very often, to leading men and women in battle against isis. and i think, you know, so many women have had their own journey of going from people, telling, you no to creating your own yes. and i think that's what she does.

it goes across cultural norms, says christa stewart, sexual violence program manager at equality now, a women's and girls' rights organization. it's aimed at any woman who transgresses in a societal framework — who asserts her own desire to marry on her own volition, not have a marriage imposed upon her or chooses education. in the case of baloch, she says, her transgression was clear: posting social media posts that defied cultural norms.

vedantam: well, we've known for a while that there is a relationship between medicaid and divorce. that's because medicaid traditionally has thought of families as a unit when calculating someone's eligibility for the program. slusky asked me to think about a scenario. let's say you have a middle-aged couple in their 50s. they've saved a nice amount of money for their retirement. one spouse suddenly gets diagnosed with early-stage dementia. the couple know they're going to have lots of medical costs. if the family spends down their savings on medical care until they get poor enough to qualify for medicaid, they'd have nothing left over for retirement. so a financial counselor might advise them to follow another course of action. here's slusky again.

ted cruz is ahead right now. what we're trying to do is educate the people in the state of iowa. he is the biggest opponent of renewable fuels. he actually introduced a bill in 2013 to immediately eliminate the renewable fuel standard. he's heavily financed by big oil. so we think once iowans realize that fact, they might find other things attractive but he could be very damaging to our state, branstad said at the iowa renewable fuels summit tuesday, according to the des moines register.

below are the results of npr music's 8th annual jazz critics poll (my 15th, going back to the poll's beginnings in the village voice). these are the jazz albums that lit up a dark, unsettling year. maria schneider's data lords was the critics choice — no surprise, though relative unknown sara serpa's victory in the vocal category in a year when both kurt elling and gregory porter released new albums was. a thelonious monk concert recorded at the unlikeliest of venues — a northern california high school auditorium — in 1968 was voted the year's prize rara avis (my catch-all designation for reissues and never-before-issued finds), and the 23-year-old alto saxophonist immanuel wilkins's omega ran away from the pack in debut.

i think of remi as diplomat and counselor in the way successful producers must be — or else have middling songs and short careers. that thought brings me to the randomness of timing and how both remi and nas lost their mothers in flanking years. i think about vulnerability and how pharrell convinces snoop dogg, when snoop was going through a musical reinvention, to rap from the stance of a mature man deeply in love with his wife, shante broadus. to, as snoop quotes pharrell, put that in the vein. about how snoop must have felt seen, and understood. same for when remi challenges winehouse to rise to the honor of a beat he created for nas. to be our best, some of us need to dared.

bernstein: that's right. there are two things you need for an oligarchy. you need to be able to control government officials, and you need to be able to control law enforcement. and in new york, private real estate developers have figured out how to do that particularly well, and the trump family even more so than most families.

my dad worked for a nonprofit, and part of the work that he did is he volunteered to visit women in the federal prison camp in alderson, w.va. — women who hadn't received a visit from family or friends in more than a year, she says in an interview from west virginia public radio. and i would often go along with my dad. and so as a very young child i think it was exciting to me because i got to eat candy out of the vending machines. but those experiences stuck with me. ...

behind all of these reversals is the trump administration's position that being gay or transgender is a category of identity that is different from biological sex, and therefore not protected under current law — a complete about-face from the position taken by the obama administration.

then, recently, something changed. about a month ago, i found out terrible secrets about my husband that were, to me and to everyone that knows us, completely unfathomable. i learned that my husband: first, had a deactivated profile on a dating website throughout our relationship that he reactivated on and off to message people. second, that he was posting personal ads looking for people to get drinks with on craigslist while traveling for his job. and third, the real kicker: over the past two years while we got engaged, planned a wedding, and got married, he had hired prostitutes, also while traveling for work, and left nasty, degrading reviews about them online.

the marriage between love story and space opera is strongest in the smaller, human moments: the cringingly strained contract signing that kiem and jainan both botch. the absurd layers of bureaucracy through which they must wade to negotiate something as small but vital as jainan accessing his private messages — revealing that jainan's first marriage to taam may not have been so storybook-idyllic. the utilization of a heavily-foreshadowed technology for a poignant sequence of reverse-gaslighting.

but if you were of military age as a young person, a young man, from ireland getting off the boat in america, you were immediately put into the union army if you're - if you landed in a union port, and vice versa in a confederate. this was to earn your citizenship. i mean, this was something i simply didn't know. so a person who has lost everything behind him - his future, the people who loved him, the people he loved, his whole possibility of meeting some girl someday in a, you know, a hawthorn-strewn country road and marrying her and having his babies, and all the rest of it, gone for all eternity - is then put straight into a uniform, given a musket and told to go and fight for something he didn't understand. was he even speaking english?

this is fatih akin's most cathartic film. but even with its crisp storytelling and momentous lead performance, it's a little disappointing. the outcome of the trial is the stuff of dumb melodrama. the villains are one-note. akin has always had a tragic bent, but this is the first time in a movie that his sense of helplessness borders on nihilism, the kind that views taking the law into one's own hands as the only viable way. but at least this is not the kind of vigilante movie where you're meant to pump your fist in the air and say, yes. it's the kind that leaves you sick and disgusted and wanting to live in a better world - one that doesn't need vigilante movies.

while all six episodes are good, i want to single out the third as one of the greatest episodes of television i've ever seen. juggling low comedy and high wit, it moves from a farcical gag about flatulence, to kristin scott-thomas' character's majestic speech about women's aging, to a breathtakingly intimate scene with the priest in which waller-bridge takes the convention of a character directly addressing the audience and gives it a spin so original it's thrilling. you grasp what makes him, and their relationship, so special.

the other element that doesn't help is the novel's literal invocation of the silence of the lambs, comparing its psychologist to clarice starling. when you're mentioning one of the most famous thrillers of all time, you'd better be pretty good in comparison. but seonkyeong, who essentially blushes like a teenager in the presence of a serial killer — if they had been meeting by chance somewhere else, her heart would have fluttered at that smile — does not have clarice's strength and determination. and the killer, whose gaze slides down from her face to her chest, is no cannibal genius gentleman.

dp: i'm inspired by the production, and then i just start writing or freestyling until we get the song, which is how i've seen all my heroes in the genre make their songs. but my beliefs and my faith effect everything, so i do have a different approach to thinking about how to care for the listener, considering where they are, how this can help them, making sure things are packaged in a way where i'm loving god and loving them. but that's my entire life, so i just apply what i apply to my life to the music.
but at this point, the virus is here. it's silently spreading. and locking down more borders may not help us very much and only alienate allies that we need to fight a global war on disease. as i was walking into the studio, terry, i saw the european union had put out a statement slamming the u.s. for taking this step without even informing them.

when news broke earlier this year that beck's marriage of nearly 15 years was ending, it seemed a safe bet that a certain kind of album would follow: not the surreal, up-tempo beck of odelay, midnite vultures or guero, but something melancholy and ballad-heavy — like his album of the year winner, morning phase, or his 2002 breakup opus, sea change. stylistically, beck remains a musical chameleon of remarkable range and elasticity. but in the course of 13 albums and a quarter-century, even casual listeners have come to recognize the two main modes in which he works.

as it riffs on questions of belief, season 2 pulls off the rare feat of taking a hugely successful show and making it much better — in part by revealing the limitations of the original season. where the enjoyable first season proved waller-bridges' versatility as an actress — her eyes have the animated eloquence of a silent film star's — it sometimes betrayed its origins as a one-woman theatrical show. it was a tad too eager to tickle the audience with its naughtiness, and the other characters felt less lived-in than they should. at times, the whole world seemed like an adjunct to fleabag's psyche.

e harper: that's true. i - when my father was blacklisted and called before the huac in massachusetts, i was 7 years old. and i can tell you, like, a brief story, what it was like, as a 7-year-old, to go back to school the first day after this news broke, that my father was fired for being a communist, because it was on the radio. it was in the newspaper. and it was even on the evening news, television news. and i went to school, as usual. it was a drizzly day. and when i - lining up in front of the school to go on into the building, the secretary of the school - that's what they were called at the time - asked me to step aside out of the line. and i noticed that kids were pointing and giggling and saying, you know, commie jew remarks, pinko, pinko.

one of the most misunderstood aspects of honor killings, says barr of human rights watch, is confusing them with crimes committed in flagrante delicto: the idea that you walk in on your wife having sex with the next door neighbor, and then kill them, she says. in some countries, you would get a reduced sentence because you were so angry that you weren't able to control your behavior, she continues. but this is not the way honor killings usually work.

and people began to take a closer look at it, and they realized the implications of this bill. and what was so interesting to me was among the opponents, it wasn't just the gay rights activists, though they were, of course, very involved. and it wasn't just sort of civil libertarians. and it wasn't just democrats. it was the republican business establishment in indiana just was in an uproar because this legislation was so reactionary and so discriminatory that it began to give indiana a black eye all cross the country.

davies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross. we're speaking with sherry turkle. she's a professor of the social studies of science and technology at mit, also a licensed clinical psychologist. she's chiefly known for her studies of the impact of digital technology on our culture. her most recent book on that subject is reclaiming conversation, published in 2015. her new book is a memoir. she writes about growing up in brooklyn and becoming a respected academic, also about some secrets in her family, which she came to understand more deeply when she asked questions in her 20s. her book is called the empathy diaries.

mulaney: i did. yeah. i wrote them, and a large part of them were pieces of stand-up i was doing at the time, both this year and last year. and it was very fun to do after writing so many monologues. i wrote a monologue for, i think, every host for about three years, along with the wonderful writer simon rich, who, my second show, approached me at the after-party. we really liked each other right away, and we're already working together. and he said, you and i are going to write a monologue every week because no one wants to write the monologue. so there'll always be an open spot for the monologue. and he said, and guess what? they can't cut the monologue.
vanderwerff: i have a lot of trepidation around being a public trans person. like, i'm really happy to be here. i'm so glad i'm talking to you. i'm on this show that i love. but, like, i'm also sitting here in a studio in los angeles. i - you know, you look at me. and you're like, ok. that's a transwoman. like, i'm - you know? i have all of these things about womanhood i need to learn and need to synthesize into my vision of myself and, like, how i want to be a woman in the world. and i'm sitting here talking in this voice that is, like, slight pitches higher than my male voice but also, like, a little ridiculous because of that. like, it feels like i'm trying too hard because i am because i'm training myself to, like, talk the way i want to talk. i'm training myself to look the way i want to look. and that's really hard to do in public.
right before this period of my life, i lived in new york by myself and i made a whole new collection of friends, and so i was really allowed to experiment. when i went back to london and i was dropped back into the environments and the communities that i used to be in, i think i just didn't know how they'd react. because in my experience, everyone really looked down upon people who had a same-sex orientation. i would never hear any good things about it. i didn't know what they would say, i didn't know if their opinion of me would change. but i still wanted the freedom to experiment and see where i was with all of that, because i was still discovering what it was to me.
core values in our society sometimes come into conflict. most americans, for example, believe people should not be punished for their religious beliefs, but neither for who they are. that means balancing the right to oppose same-sex marriage, a view held by some religious people, against the right of lgbtq people to be free from discrimination. here's npr's tom gjelten on the latest effort to find a compromise.

right, we can see a lot of what lgbtq americans think, and you can see this personal experience transferring across. it's not just that lgbtq people think that they themselves experience a lot of discrimination, but they're more likely than straight people to say that african-americans, immigrants, also experience a great deal of discrimination.
martin: well, let's stop right there, if you would, because that's in way, that's what the title refers to. it's like you got this diagnosis, and you thought that couldn't be right. not my kid.

foy: so other people try them on is the idea, and we always knew that. so it's quite funny that - quite a lot of people have asked that question that we're sort of surprised, like we've been sacked. i hope it's not that.
every instrument seems to hug lead singer mike kinsella's voice, molding around every soft bend and sudden lilt. on heir apparent, there is the familiar mixture of intricate instrumental parts, from several carefully finger-picked guitars to a steady, uptempo snare to an angelic collection of cascading piano licks. they weave together like a braid, around strands of introspective lyrics, as kinsella sings, almost plainly: i'm unapologetically sorry for everything. the song ends with an eerily peaceful cameo from the omaha children's choir, fading out on the lines: heir apparent to the throne / the king of all alone. despite its many moving parts, the six-minute song does not feel overwrought. you do not drown in the sea of entangled instruments; instead, you float calmly at the surface, allowing the gentle, heavy tide to guide you away from the shore.
paula poundstone: so you have a recipe that's just a grape?
bird: when it's jimbo sending me an idea, oftentimes i would write the next verse within a half an hour of getting it from him. you know, for the song poor lost souls, jimbo had already written most of it. but there was that line - look down and see the stars, look up and see the gold - and i thought that is one of the best lines i've ever heard in a song.
schools are equally progressive. in 2004, taiwan passed a law that requires all schools to teach gender equity topics. the fact that they have a national mandate is a big deal, considering most countries have no clear policy on this issue. in the u.s., sex education at public schools varies from state to state. just 24 states and the district of columbia require sex education as of this year.
itzkoff: well, that was an experience that he had with his makeup artist cheri minns on night at the museum, which is again one of the last movies that he made. by that point, you know, a lot of the symptoms of what we now understand he was going through were showing up. and, you know, cheri, as she described it - i mean, she just made this suggestion of something that she hoped would lift his spirits a little bit - that he wasn't going out at night anymore and that he was starting to have what he felt were memory problems and not remembering dialogue. and so her suggestion to him was, well, why don't you go to one of the clubs here where we're filming and just make a surprise appearance, and you'll see really how much people love you and are happy to see you. and that tore him up - that he - that's when he expressed that to her - that feeling of, you know, i can't be funny anymore. and that was, i think, devastating for both of them.
well let's hear another scene. season 3, like the original film and season 1, has a smart, likeable female cop. it's gloria burgle, who's played by carrie coon. and she's the chief of a small town police department that's being merged into the larger county force. as this is happening, she is investigating the murder of her stepfather. and in this scene, she has a tense meeting with her new boss, the sheriff, who's played by shea whigham the sheriff speaks first about the kind of shop that gloria's been running. let's listen.

in fact, her writing does carry her away from vesterbro, making her a success by her early 20s — she's even invited to dine with evelyn waugh. yet for all her literary talent, she has little gift for daily living. easily bored and fearing entrapment, tove lurches through life. she goes on drunken revels with freedom-seeking girlfriends. she quickly racks up four husbands. she raises three kids, has a christmastime abortion that haunts her, and finally, after an unnecessary surgery, gets hooked on the one thing she loves as much as writing: drugs.

sagal: so there might be one or two people out there listening who neither read eat, pray, love, nor saw the film with julia roberts. so could you describe it briefly for them?

if enforced, the sentences to the perpetrators are far less strict than for equally violent crimes — and pardons can be easily arranged. in pakistan, for example, the simple act of forgiveness can absolve the crime. in the oscar-winning documentary film a girl in the river: the price of forgiveness, saba, 18, was pressured into forgiving her uncle and father, who shot her and threw her in the river for secretly eloping. as a result, they were both released from prison.

lee: well, bishop long's ministry coincided with the rebirth of black atlanta in the early '90s. and in many respects, bishop long was a pioneer in the merging of baptists and pentecostal sort of styles of worship into a very charismatic ministry and worship experience. and that, coupled with his strong biblical preaching in african-american circles, really launched new birth into a stratospheric ministry globally.
true, the filibuster rule is still in place for supreme court nominees, requiring 60 votes to end debate — considerably more votes than republicans will have in the senate. but if there were a democratic filibuster, republicans would almost certainly would change the senate rules, just as democrats would have done if they had prevailed on election night.

the copenhagen trilogy is a story about escape — escape from menial work, escape from traditional female roles, escape from boredom, escape from reality, and escape from the heavy weight of a self that was shaped in her childhood, a time, she writes, that's long and narrow like a coffin. she has a self exploding with so many contradictions that she's like both heroines of elena ferrante's neapolitan quartet merged into one.

and looking back, this was a major, major step. i mean, this was - again, if you had got together sort of a panel of saudi experts in 2014 and said, do you think that, you know, mohammed bin salman or some son of the king can sort of snap his fingers and take the power to arrest away from the religious police? do you think he's going to get away with it? i'll bet that most of them would have said no. there was this belief that these guys were untouchable. there was this belief that they had the backing of very powerful conservative sectors of society who would have risen up and who would have gone to see the king. and in the end, it worked. and, you know, it's made it a very different place.

much of the story, in broad strokes, is familiar: tully is the rebellious and sparkling one with a past that is difficult in more visible and explicit ways; kate is the quieter and more cautious one with a past that is difficult in less obvious ways. tully's life is more focused on her career (as a television talk-show host); kate's life, although she is a tv producer, is more focused on domesticity (she ultimately has a teenage daughter). there is a man named johnny who is important to both of them, who winds up being kate's husband. they are there for each other in times good and bad, in loss and in table-dancing, in sharing their tales of both disastrous boyfriends and promising ones.

rott: eriksen has worked with firefighters both in the u.s. and her native australia, two places where wildfires are getting worse as greenhouse gas emissions from human activities warm the world. a recent study finds that climate change has pushed california's rainy season back by a month, extending the burning season. more generally, scientists say a warming world is causing wildfires to burn more frequently, more intensely in more places. that, coupled with our building habits, means that more and more property is at risk. meanwhile, society's expectations of firefighters and firefighters' expectations of themselves have not changed, eriksen says. they're still supposed to put the fires out.

while all of this makes the series gripping, it doesn't make it serious. like homeland, scandal, house of cards and their spiritual godfather, 24, bodyguard taps into big issues like terrorism and government snooping but only to keep us guessing. more concerned with being a good ride than exploring character or politics, the show is awash in a timely cynicism.
the very nature of patti smith's debut album horses rails against what many other best of albums are celebrated for — broad appeal, sonically pleasing aesthetics and hits. horses is confrontational, defiant and completely unafraid of the ugly. and so was its author, who in 1975, for arguably the first time in music, set the lyrical stage for academia and animalism to writhe together; for the sophisticated and heady virtues of capital-p poetry to crash into the visceral, bodily base of rock and roll. any beauty on horses feels like a bi-product of story — from smith's breathless bleating to wailing and warbling against collaborator lenny kaye's characteristically jagged guitar to her historic presentation on the album's cover. as photographed by robert mapplethorpe, smith's unapologetic androgyny predates a time when that was an en vogue or even available option for women, and represents a seminal moment in the reversal of the female gaze. smith is looking at you, and could care less what you think about looking at her. that was radical for a woman in 1975. it is still radical today. there are legions of artists who cite patti smith's horses as an earth-shattering influence, from courtney love to r.e.m's michael stipe to garbage's shirley manson to the smiths' johnny marr — but they don't necessarily reflect smith's influence in terms of sound so much as attitude. it was her unfiltered, fearless singularity that galvanized believers in the church of smith not to become more like her but to become more like themselves.
writer's block can be temporary — or it can be massive and long lasting. after her third short story collection, honey, came out in 1993, elizabeth tallent fell victim to a rockfall, avalanche, total-impasse-of-the-imagination writer's block and didn't publish another book for 22 years.

cheryl david: we're talking about employment-based immigration and family-based immigration. so companies sponsoring people to come in to work in the united states, people coming in on temporary visas to work or visitors, students - that's legal immigration. and, of course, family-based is when family members are sponsoring their loved ones to come and live in this country.

this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. one man is responsible to a considerable extent for choosing a third of the justices on the supreme court, including neil gorsuch, who was sworn in monday. that's what jeffrey toobin reports in his latest article in the new yorker called the conservative pipeline to the supreme court. the article is about leonard leo, who toobin says served in effect as president trump's subcontractor on the selection of gorsuch. leo also played a crucial part in the nominations of justices roberts and alito. leo is executive vice president of the federalist society, a national group of conservative lawyers, which toobin also writes about in his article. the society was co-founded by law students in 1982. one of their faculty advisers was antonin scalia, who justice gorsuch has now replaced on the court. jeffrey toobin is a staff writer for the new yorker and a senior legal analyst for cnn.

chozick: absolutely. it's interesting, i think she is running a better campaign now. but i think she is a worse candidate in a way. i think that when she was running in 2008, she had been a senator. she was a senator, and she was constantly checking in with her constituents. and she was, you know, famously sort of accessible and going to dairy farms and checking in on - you know, in new york city whether it was, you know, first responders at ground zero or anyone else that she represented. you know, you flash forward, she's been secretary of state for four years, traveling the world. she comes back, she goes to chappaqua. she lives in new york.
blount: the one chicken gave in, or...
forman: no. then we had a very, you know, sort of - it's - everything is such a paradox, you know. about a year later, suddenly we were allowed visits with our mother. me, my brother and my uncle, my mother's brother. so we went to prague. we were taken down to the catacombs of a former bank, which was now gestapo headquarters in prague. and they, you know, locked us in, closed the door. and we are sitting there - my brother, my uncle - for about two hours. and then the door opens, and in the door they brought in my mother. and from - in the first moment i realized, she didn't know why - where they are taking her. she didn't - they obviously didn't tell her that she's not going to be interrogated or whatever, that she's going to meet her family. and we had 10 minutes allowed with her.

david edelstein, byline: years ago, i got to hang out for a magazine piece with joel and ethan coen on the set of their second feature raising arizona. they were amiable and unpretentious and so was their cinematography, now a director, barry sonnenfeld who told me the brothers didn't care much about themes or stories. they just liked fooling around with movie fodder - that is, over-familiar tropes set in outlandish new contexts. i don't know if sonnenfeld's characterization was entirely fair then, but it's certainly not now. over the last decade, in no country for old men and a serious man and inside llewyn davis, the coens have proven their seriousness. they've created their own unique border world, straddling comedy and tragedy. but now, with their star-packed period comedy hail, caesar!, it's like they've regressed. the movie is wall-to-wall movie fodder, and that's all. and it feels thin. set in the 1950s, hail, caesar! centers on a hollywood studio called capital pictures and its fixer eddie mannix played by josh brolin, who functions almost like a head of production. mannix herds wayward actors, plugs casting holes and tries to keep the whole multi-ring circus from dissolving into chaos. as he wanders the backlot solving problems, the coens serve up parodies of typical postwar escapist fare, biblical epics, soft-shoe sailor musicals, water ballets, grade b westerns and drawing room romances. it sounds irresistible, and some of it is.

albright: yes. and that's what's so unfortunate about it because what we really do have are - in europe, for instance, the prime example is hungary with viktor orban, who is now talking about illiberal democracy, which is basically a way to deal with whoever is not, in his description, a hungarian so he can go after immigrants. there are - then in turkey we're seeing a problem where in fact erdogan, who was elected popularly, has accumulated a lot of power and wants to change the rules and the laws and the constitution in order to be able to be there longer. we have the fact that poland is kind of mimicking what hungary did. and then what we have in europe also - and these are friends and allies - are other countries where there is an element of those that are taking advantage of the fear factor in some way, as i said.

i have consciously tried to avoid thinking of these women in those terms because i actually think there are a lot of problems attached to that framing. i feel competent with that now because now i've read people's doctoral theses where they did all this field work — and the sort of realities of domestic labor and how these jobs are carried out. the problem is, so now i'm conscious that when you say somebody is your family member, a lot of familiarity goes along with that — and a lot of labor protections tend to kind of go out the window.

(laughter) and they're both tired, and then they go back to it. you know, it's that kind of thing 'cause real people, you know, don't punch each other in the face and ever have a boxing match. he just wanted it to feel like two brothers who really loved each other but were completely frustrated and fed up with each other. and in some ways, i see that fight when i watch it. i see that fight as a way of embracing each other because, in their lives, that's - any physical contact is kind of longed for and yearned for. and...

gross: something i found very interesting - and i'd love to hear your take on this - is that tucker carlson, who, of course, has a show weekday nights on fox news - he has been one of trump's strongest advocates. and trump seems to listen, you know, to watch tucker carlson's show. so i don't know if he said this on the air, but i was on the fox news website, and he had something in print on the website that was headlined, the coronavirus will get worse. our leaders need to stop lying about that. and that was tuesday of this week. and by our leaders, i will assume he means people in the trump administration and perhaps the president himself. what do you make of that?

but that doesn't mean to say that it wasn't true at the time i wrote it. and if i think about the second volume of my memoirs, true north, one of the things that i wanted to convey as clearly as i could was that it's possible for a professional woman to form a very deep and powerful marriage relationship and yet retain a bounded identity and a strong professional self and not experience those two things as in conflict. and i'm still close enough to that experience that i'd want to tell that story the same way.

but at the same time, secretary azar has not always given the president the worst-case scenario of what could happen. my understanding is he did not push to do aggressive additional testing in recent weeks, and that's partly because more testing might have led to more cases being discovered of coronavirus outbreak, and the president had made clear - the lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential reelection this fall.

this finding highlights how life experiences and political socialization can really shape how an individual, or a generation of people, thinks about how to create change, casey says. older generations of lgbtq people came of age at a time when legal protections were nearly unthinkable and activists agitated in mass scale social movements. but younger people have grown up in the era of gay marriage, 'don't ask, don't tell,' and employment protections, and more successfully petitioning for rights through judicial or legislative processes.

quindlen acknowledges that most grandparents are tethered but not tied, connected but not compelled, except by choice. but with this greater freedom, she reminds readers repeatedly, comes a peripheral place in the family dynamic as secondary characters, supporting actors to the new parental leads. she writes:
stephen craig paddock, the 64-year-old white man who police say carried out the worst mass shooting in modern u.s. history sunday night on the las vegas strip moved frequently, buying and selling property in several states. but the twice-divorced retiree had one vein that seems to run through the middle of his itinerant lifestyle — a love of gambling.

as a therapist in therapy, i feel like often we minimize our problems. you know, it was a breakup, not a divorce. it's kind of like people who have a miscarriage but they didn't lose a child who was 8 years old. they're these silent losses. ... i don't think there's a hierarchy of pain. ... pain is pain.
it's an entire pattern of complementarity that we see woven throughout the account of scripture, he says, from genesis 1:26-28 all the way to the book of revelation. so it's not a minor matter to suggest that the church can somehow just update its understanding of gender. this is where we must be found faithful, regardless of the cultural understanding around us.
gross: as the story is portrayed in the film, both of the prisoners have sex with her. and it makes her feel sexy and desirable to have sex with them. and she does favors for them, including eventually getting some of the tools that they need to escape. she was even supposed to drive the getaway car, but she had a panic attack at the last minute and failed to show up.

i think the industry has changed a lot, probably in the last five years, because the world has changed a lot. you don't follow people on twitter or instagram that you don't like. after a while, if they make you mad enough, you just unfollow them. ... no one's gonna really follow you, listen to your music or any of that if they don't like what you're doing, because we all are very individualized, personalized. ... so that's a good thing, but the [other] thing we benefited from early on was a lot of people were like, man, i don't necessarily wanna listen to mainstream [secular] music. i'm just gonna go listen to christian rap. and they'd just close their eyes and pick something off the shelf, because they think that that's what they should be doing. so then that's why you have such a crazy backlash when we start standing up and saying [socially and politically] this is what we believe. people start saying, wait, you were supposed to be this homogeneous thing that you think just like i think.

the other reason is society's acceptance of discrimination against women. in a 2013 cambridge university survey of 850 teenagers in jordan, a third believed that honor killings were morally right. support for honor killing is far more likely among adolescent boys who have not spent much time in school, according to the report. and in a 2009 survey from the united nations population fund (unfpa), 68 percent of young iraqi men believed that killing a girl for dishonoring the family was justifiable.
whereas, i was in the house with this woman and i was very, very — i became very close to her and i felt very dependent upon her and she, in many ways, got tangled up. i write about this in the book. she was very involved in kind of my own sort of postpartum period and the sort of sense of, you know, how i could function as a mother. and the truth is, there was a time when she worked for me and i had the baby that i thought i'm only a good mother because [my nanny] is here. and i really thought [when] she's gone, this is all going to fall apart.

those views, redfield has said more recently, are things that he has broadened from. he has walked away from some of those earlier, stricter positions. but redfield is still seen in some corners as a suboptimal leader of our public health agency, and it's not just because of these views; it's because of his lack of high-end management experience. if you're looking at some of the breakdowns in fighting the coronavirus outbreak, they may not be because dr. redfield had these views 30 years ago; they may be more likely that he is not in position to make big, sweeping and aggressive decisions in the middle of an outbreak, which is tough for anyone but certainly a career scientist who may not have been in a management role like this one.

dafoe: not really. characters are real through actions, and you've got to be there and have things happen to you and try to make things happen. what it means for an audience will be many different things. and from an actor's point of view, if you try to control that too much, i think it stifles impulse. it stifles your ability to find true behavior. and it makes you somewhere deeply a showboat and self-conscious.

sen. mazie hirono, d-hawaii, complained that the supreme court had been unduly deferential to president trump this summer when it upheld his travel ban, despite what she called the administration's obviously bogus justification. she pressed kavanaugh on when the high court should question a president's national security claims.
both proponents and opponents of the bill have focused on the impact it would have when lgbt mississippians seek to marry, raise children or receive medical and psychological services. supporters say the law protects the religious freedoms of those opposed to homosexuality; opponents say the law amounts to a state sanction of discrimination against lgbt people.

(soundbite of song, the games we play)
i was a senior in high school when i listened to my first episode of this american life: break-up, #339. my first relationship was ending, and it hit me at exactly the right time. i vividly remember spinning on the chair in my room, seventeen magazine cutouts staring back at me from the walls while headphones kept me tethered to my laptop. i'd never listened to anything on the radio except music, and while my parents' cars were usually tuned to npr, i didn't pay much attention to it.
warren and bragg have each spent years building modest, yet respectable solo careers in americana and alt-rock scenes, the former gaining notice for viscerally compelling narratives of a marriage disintegrating beneath the weight of post-traumatic stress disorder and the latter for her refined, sumptuously, melancholy take on southern storytelling with the song lucky strike.

so he sued john harvey, and then john harvey sued will. and this lawsuit, even though there were peaks and valleys and agreements and disagreements, it went for almost a decade, going all the way to the michigan state supreme court. the basic question was, who was the real kellogg? who had the right to use the name kellogg on a box of cereal?
it was just the start to a spate of films starring reynolds, who quickly became one of hollywood's most bankable stars. as the los angeles times reports, reynolds acted in more than 30 films between 1950 and 1967 — during which time she earned an oscar nomination for her acting work in 1964's the unsinkable molly brown.

basically, saudi arabia had been a huge player in lebanon for a very long time, all sort of working through hariri's family. mbs kind of looked at that setup and said, i don't like it. you know, we've been giving these guys money. we've been supporting their political party. we've been, you know, backing saad hariri and what he wants to do. and what did we get out of it? we don't have a whole lot of influence there. hezbollah, which is, you know, an iranian-backed party here - much, much more influence; much, much more power. like, something's not right, so they came up with this somewhat crazy plan. ok, we're going to get rid of hariri. they looked at trying to install one of his older brothers in his place, which didn't work because the rest of the hariri family wouldn't accept it. there was kind of this idea that this would start some sort of civil violence inside of lebanon that would sort of bog the place down and that would cause hezbollah to bring its fighters back from yemen, where - they were there fighting with the houthis, that they would come back to lebanon and so that would somehow help the saudis - i mean, it's just really, really crazy stuff; i mean, nothing that anybody who really knows much about lebanon would think is even possible.
in the end, the economic pressure pushed the indiana governor to cave, oesterle observes. pence, after pledging not to change the law, signed a so-called fix, a compromise to soften the legislation.
prof. hunter: well, i think we need to know that african-americans actually did value marriage. and i think that really goes to the point that you were making, that people assumed that this was not something that was important to african-americans. and, you know, i see this in the records, the deep love and the deep commitments that people had to their families, the lengths that people went to in order to preserve and protect those relationships at the risk of punishments, at the risk of death. so, i think that's really important for people to understand, is that african-americans made great sacrifices in order to give their relationships meaning, even though they were being disregarded by the larger society.
in this week's espn magazine, holmes dug into how a first-grader's lunch ended up as a locker room staple for professional basketballers.
in many ways, ed says, he fell into some of the typical patterns of financial infidelity. he says many people justify financial unfaithfulness because there's a disparity in income or they feel deficient. he kept his secret under wraps, all the while hoping his business would grow and he could repay the credit card debt. instead, the debt grew. even to him, it made no sense. he feared how ann — who referred to him as mr. financially responsible — might react.

danforth: one thing i want to say about the character of lydia marsh is, at least in the novel, she was very informed by a woman named doctor - a doctor is questionable - elizabeth moberly (ph), who gets a lot of dubious credit for her early theories. she coined the term reparative therapy. she was doing a lot of work in this area in the 1980s. she was essentially a self-professed psychoanalyst. and she came up with this theory of part of the reason that people are gay is that they haven't had effective homosocial bonding, homosocial love with their parent. and a lot of this traces back to elizabeth moberly. so when i was thinking of lydia, i was thinking of this woman that loomed large in 1980s and 1990s discussions of reparative or conversion therapy. that's who i was channeling.

we're living in a golden age for women's writing. the wheels of literary justice are finally giving due process to great women writers whose work has been forgotten, ignored or insufficiently appreciated.
diamond: i think they are both trying to show that they're incredibly active and aggressive in public, but some of the decisions behind the scenes haven't always reflected the best judgment of career professionals. in the case of alex azar, he did go to the president in january. he did push past resistance from the president's political aides to warn the president the new coronavirus could be a major problem. there were aides around trump - kellyanne conway had some skepticism at times that this was something that needed to be a presidential priority.
but it's not just trump that cruz has to persuade religious voters to not be swayed by — rubio, too, is making a play for a share of evangelical voters. in the final days in the palmetto state, the two campaigns have been feuding over ads from cruz's campaign that attack rubio on immigration reform. and on thursday, rubio's campaign attacked cruz after his campaign posted a digitally altered image of rubio and president obama shaking hands on a website comparing the florida senator's record to the president's.
blight: it was absolutely critical. into 1862, douglass was still hammering away at lincoln. at one point, he called him the most powerful slave catcher in the country. but after the preliminary proclamation, september '62, and of course the final proclamation, january of '63, douglass's tune on lincoln greatly changed. and then especially with the recruiting of black soldiers in the wake of the emancipation proclamation - and douglass got deeply involved personally in recruiting members of the 54th massachusetts regiment. two of his own sons were members of that regiment.
the rules governing marriage have not kept pace with changes in other areas of the law. the result is a disconnect between civil and criminal law. in some states, an unmarried pregnant 13-year-old is, by definition, a victim of statutory rape. to a prosecutor in that state, the pregnancy is proof that a crime has occurred, while to a civil judge or clerk, it could be a reason for granting a marriage license.

this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. today we're going to remember jill ker conway, who influenced many women as a feminist, memoirist, women's history scholar and the first woman president of smith college, one of the largest women's colleges in the world. she served in that position from 1975 to 85. conaway died june 1 at the age of 83. we'll hear excerpts of my three interviews with her recorded between 1989 and 1998. we talked about establishing her career at a time when many doors were closed to women, how she became a feminist, how she married historian john conway in spite of the fact she had always thought marriage would be the wrong choice for her and how she later dealt with his depression and then his death.

olsen said voters generally give their presidential choice a long leash. but if the person doesn't deliver on what they really want in the end, voters will turn against him. and then, the culture wars on twitter won't be enough.
madonna: well, i just feel like that's kind of been my journey in life. starting in high school, growing up in the midwest, not fitting in. not fitting into any socially acceptable group, deciding to become an artist, and discovering artists like frida kahlo and writers like charles bukowski and flannery o'connor. i just knew right away that there were other artists in the world and other people in the world that also didn't fit in with society and that's kind of what was the springboard for their creativity.

holmes: well, this is his fifth time hosting. there's been a lot of murmuring about he's - you know, he's so controversial and dangerous, and he doesn't care whose toes he steps on. and what's funny is that the jokes he actually makes at the golden globes tend to be pretty tired. and that's why he's hosting for the fifth time, right? you don't actually get invited back five times if you're all that daring in your comedy. but in the last few years, the - both at the globes and in particularly in a comedy special that he did, he's made a bunch of jokes and a lot of comments about transgender women in particular that are honestly also pretty tired. but somehow because they're also really cruel, he recasts them as kind of being anti-pc. and i think he's discovered, as people sometimes do, that depending on the audience you want, your jokes can be less good if they're also mean. and i think that's part of what his kind of shtick is right now.

chozick: well, one thing that they learn, i think, is that the takedowns that were so effective against jeb bush, against ted cruz, against rubio, calling jeb low-energy, calling rubio little marco, those were very effective. what was less effective that donald trump tried to do in the debates was attack carly fiorina or attack megyn kelly.
those two lackluster statewide performances is one reason moore wasn't expected to gain much steam when he first entered this senate race, but with the election of trump, a rise of political outsiders, a reigniting of the culture wars and vulnerabilities by strange, there was a perfect storm for him to finally grasp the nomination.
today, in one of the most republican states in the nation, the people of alabama chose common decency and integrity over partisan politics, democratic senatorial campaign committee chairman chris van hollen, d-md., said in a statement. donald trump and the republican national committee did the opposite, siding with a candidate who wanted to drag alabama back to the days of george wallace and faced a mountain of credible evidence that he had engaged in child sexual abuse. ... president trump, republican senate candidates and the republican national committee showed us exactly who they are by standing with roy moore — and we will make sure voters do not forget it.

to win over white voters who were beginning to defect from the democratic party, bill clinton positioned himself to the right of bush and reagan on immigration. clinton ran on cracking down on illegal immigration, and in 1996 he signed a bill into law that made it harder for people to become legal citizens while making it easier for them to be deported. deportation went from a relatively rare outcome for undocumented people to a more common one.

sondheim: no, no. but no, but that's exactly the style. you've hit exactly the right style. that's precisely the kind of thing that ira gershwin wrote. if you look through his lyrics, you'll find that because it was - the style in those days was to use kind of fancy-ass words and play with them. the playfulness of lyrics is something that's sort of gone out of - not out of fashion. there aren't very many people who can do it. and that was largely the pleasure of the songs that people went to see in the musical theater in the 1920s and '30s and even into the '40s, even after oklahoma! people did not go to be moved by songs - although occasionally, they might be - but to be delighted by the combination of playfulness in the language and invention and lightheartedness of the music.

so, you know, google is this conflicted company. i think they thought they could do this deal and keep advertising at bay, but i think, year in, year out, google is starting to get worse instead of better. i think this is happening to a lot of the web companies, is as their demand to increase the payload they deliver in ads increases, they end up degrading and corrupting their own services. and you can see it with google maps, you can see it with google directions, where somehow uber is, you know, always one of the options. and it's becoming exactly what they said was what they never wanted, which is a pay-for service where the highest bidder gets the best results.

gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to my interview with ellen and ben harper. ellen is the author of the new memoir always a song: singers, songwriters, sinners, and saints - my story of the folk music revival. in 1958, when she was 11, her parents founded the folk music center in claremont, calif., which sold and repaired banjos and guitars, and where her mother taught banjo and guitar and where ellen eventually did the same. when she was growing up, she was surrounded by folk music luminaries and was good friends with their children, like jean ritchie's daughter judy, and woody guthrie's son bill, who died in a car crash when he was in his 20s. ellen grew up in the center, spent much of her life working there, giving music lessons and repairing instruments. she runs it now. she also spent years as an education professor at cal state university in san bernardino. her son, ben harper, who is with us, too, also grew up in the folk music center and became a grammy award-winning singer, songwriter and guitarist. he wrote the foreword to ellen's new memoir.
one sunday, back home in her village, neetu wrestled with her sons in their hometown playing field, a stony lot. nothing in her surroundings lends itself to athletic glory. the streets of her village are open sewers. cattle are quartered steps from villagers' homes. the hard-scrabble reality makes her dream to be a world-class athlete, seem implausible. conservative mores made the climb steeper.

how is this for a to-do list for the coming week - one, stop the federal government from shutting down; two, overhaul health care - again? safe to say those two items are at the top of paul ryan's long to-do list for next week. the speaker of the house has until friday to help shepherd a budget bill through congress. otherwise, it's government shutdown starting one week from today. now, that would be saturday april 29, donald trump's 100th day as president.

aubrey: well, that's important to understand, and we don't have a complete picture yet of which underlying medical problems were present in how many of these younger people. but it's worth noting - an analysis from italy shows that about 99% of the people who've died in italy from the virus had at least one underlying illness or condition such as heart disease, a history of stroke, diabetes. so these certainly seem to increase the risk of death or serious illness.
ellen harper and ben harper: (singing) a house is a home even when it's dark, even when the grass is overgrown in the yard, even when the dog is too old to bark and when you're sitting at the table trying not to start. a house is a home even when we've up and gone. even when you're there alone, a house - a house is a home. a house is a home even when there's ghosts, even when you got to run from the ones who love you most. screen door's broken paint's peeling from the wood. locals whisper, when they going to leave the neighborhood? a house is a home even when we've up and gone. even when you're there alone, a house - a house is a home.
by contrast, americans with a bachelor's degree live longer, enjoy more stable families, report happier lives and abuse opioids and alcohol less often. they even vote more. once, suicide was more common among the educated; today, the reverse is true.
i want readers to finish this book with a sense of hope. that you can survive all the loss that occurs during middle age and re-emerge with a new and different life. that there is beauty in the pain and imperfections of our marriages and our friendships and our careers. almost everyone goes through the kind of rough patch that i did — a period of time when they've grieved people they've lost or a version of a themselves they once were. i was a writer who had published 4 novels and had even had a movie made from one of them — and then i wasn't.

hesse: i think that that's been the question as soon as the movie came out. early reviews were saying, women will love it; men will refuse to see it. so what i thought was interesting was how many emails i've been getting from men who have said things like, it's not that i don't want to see it. i just don't want to go and be the only man in the theater. will i go and be the only man in the theater, or can i go and enjoy this movie?

you've had other sort of very prominent clerics, people who had sort of large social media followings - a lot of them have been rounded up. some of them are on trial. some of them have been set loose. but it's just kind of been this process of people being brought in, and if the government kind of can't convince them that they need to shut up, then they just keep them. and so it's a little bit varied...
gross: so what that story - what does that story mean to you knowing that when you were 4 months old you were unknowingly, you know, a part of this protest?
in that 5-3 decision — delivered by a shorthanded court just months after justice antonin scalia's death in 2016 — justices in the majority relied on the undue burden test to strike down a texas law limiting abortion availability.
i'm currently reliant on my estranged husband's health insurance to control an intense anxiety disorder — and ironically enough, my distraught feelings about our split. while i'm not ready to give up on him, i understand that he no longer wishes to be married to me, and i want to set him free to pursue someone who can be more faithful to him and can appreciate him fully.
this spring we've been bringing you stories about sex - specifically how we talk about it, how we don't and how those conversations shape society. today our story is about not having sex - or at least waiting to - and how one couple navigated that decision. waiting until marriage is relatively rare in the u.s. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, close to 90 percent of people who've ever been married say they have had premarital sex.

when he was a swaggering cricketer, and the pakistani national team was struggling, fans would chant: who can save pakistan? it's imran khan! it's imran khan!
akrami: the iranian system is a theocracy, and in a theocracy it's always the government that prescribes the right behavior for the people. so people have to pretend all the time that they're behaving the right way. so the iranian people live a double life, a life in public, which is to the liking of the government, and a life in private, which is the one they choose to live.
and for me, as a kid, on the one hand, it was traumatic. it was anxiety-inducing. it set me back in school. it led to behavioral problems that are so common amongst children with incarcerated parents. and on the other hand, it did become normal. it became normal to go through metal detectors, to get patted down by guards, to have to go through steel gates every time i wanted to give my parents a hug. and i got to know and be friends with so many of the other children whose parents were in my parents' prisons over the years.
sagal: ...on amazon for, like, 300 bucks because there just isn't enough of the stuff. but it turns out, you'll be happy to know, that you can make it at home. you just get a bottle of aloe vera lotion and a bottle of cheap vodka. and then you drink enough of the vodka so you just don't care anymore.
roberts: his supporters probably don't, but other people do. look, this idea that it's none of your business is really not something that a presidential candidate can say. everything is our business when somebody is running for president. what we know about the vote for president is that it is for the person, not for the policies.
and i remember when she met me at the airport. and it was a pretty powerful moment for me, for us to see her wearing something other than her prison green uniform, to be able to hug her and not have anyone tell us that we should stop hugging, to be able to walk down the street with her and share so many of the little details that make up daily life in a way that i'd never ever been able to do with her in my living memory.
simon: what kind of help do people need?
hope: right. there's no men. there's no men.
diamond: charmaine yoest is the head of public affairs, essentially, at hhs. she's the top spokesperson. any messaging that the agency does, any communications - it all flows through her. and before joining hhs, charmaine was a very prominent anti-abortion advocate. she had suggested that there's a link between having abortions and breast cancer, which the american cancer society and other researchers have said there is no link, at least not scientifically proven. she had questioned whether transgender folks were mentally ill. and now she is running a $1 trillion agency with 80,000 employees, many of whom are career staff who have been there for years and work in health and science fields and may not agree with her policies. when we see the documents coming out of us that do have these subtle cues to the anti-abortion movement, the anti-lgbt folks, it's interesting to look and see how charmaine, someone who hadn't really been in a government public affairs job before, is now the person who gets to sign off on those messages.
we see video of dylan farrow, as a child, recounting the allegations. we hear audio of a phone conversation allen had with mia farrow, assuring her he is not taping their conversation — only to admit to his attorney, moments later, that he was recording it (he thought farrow couldn't hear him; the audio exists because she was also taping their telephone conversations). we watch ronan farrow allege that allen would only pay for his college education if he publicly denounced his mother and sister, which he declined to do.

gross: so you were the first and only secretary of state to meet with the head of north korea, and you were able to negotiate an agreement with kim jong il.
many of us democrats are uncomfortable talking publicly about our faith, coons said. as a result, a lot of younger americans associate christianity and public professions of faith with some of the most politically conservative and theologically conservative views. but some of the most progressive senators are actively worshiping christians. they just don't talk about it. i think that's one of the things i'm able to contribute here in washington.
mulligan: (as jeanette brinson) get out there. see what it feels like.
ronan: yeah. and, i mean, i know even for me playing that, it was frustrating 'cause you know that it can so easily be solved, or at least it can so easily be understood. and i think from florence's point of view, there's obviously a dark past there that she hasn't really confronted yet or even fully comprehended, so she doesn't really have the language to explain that to him. and, therefore, he can't understand, and they end up not being able to sort of meet in the middle. it was frustrating to play because you know that these two people really do love each other, and this is the only point in which they just can't find common ground, you know?
sagal: there's a reason we trust the news less than we used to, and it's not just because anderson cooper made certain promises he has not kept. you know what i'm talking about, silver fox. this week, we heard the story of the news doing us wrong in a whole new way. our panelists are going to tell you about it. pick the one who's telling the truth, and you'll win our prize - the wait wait-er of your choice on your voicemail. you ready to play?

manson: you know, my sense is that this will be a final blow for a number of catholics who really had been holding onto hope because of pope francis. the media had such a love affair with him, and i think people were really holding on tight to the last threads of hope. and this could be the final blow.
separation of church and state never meant to separate god from government, moore told npr at the time. the first amendment never meant to divide our country from an acknowledgement of god. it's time to stand up and say, we have a right under our constitution to acknowledge god.
so i got up after five minutes kind of disgusted and disappointed. and then the specialist got down and he started basically speaking in tongues. he started talking to her. he started responding to her. he started laughing, smiling. and afterwards, it was see, this is how it's done and this is what you have to understand of how to talk to your son.
johnson: yeah. i would think that that would have been said by my mother. but actually, my mother is the one that actually encouraged me to marry. in the church, you're considered a sinner if you are actually with someone and you are not married.
but without funding, the exchanges are likely to see an exodus of insurance companies, particularly if expensive requirements are kept in place.
prine: robert hilburn was the premiere music critic for the la times for about 35 years. and he was an early champion of my stuff. he was - like, out in the west coast, that's how i kind of developed out there as quick as i did - because of robert hilburn's columns. if he had to mention the letters j.p. or anything in any review, he would somehow - it could be about led zeppelin, and he would sneak my name into it, you know?
sophie taylor was having trouble sleeping, too. she'd been made a brigade captain on australia's south coast just months before the historic wildfires chased people in her area from mountains to beach. without the adrenaline rush, she said, you just feel flat all the time.
not so. michal's love life plays out as a kind of swipeless tinder experience, with results at least as confusing, frustrating, absurd and sometimes sad as in any rom-com today, except that the men wear side curls and big hats, the women long dresses buttoned to the neck, and sex won't be on the table for a long while yet. yet our heroine is anything but subservient or meek. actually, she's a pistol. michal may be chaste, but she's no pushover, and she won't marry just to be married. a groom has been chosen, but he's acting shifty and evasive, and michal, a stickler for honesty, pushes the immature lad to admit he doesn't love her. down but not out, the jilted bride decides to go ahead with her wedding plans and trust that god will provide a groom. this sets off alarm bells with her intensely protective family, friends and the wedding hall's owner (amos tamam), who, however baffled, agrees to help with the wedding arrangements. he's a quiet fellow but do tuck him away — he'll be back later to ruffle feathers.
gilbert: yeah. we look like that, so it works out really well.

and i think sometimes we think it's easy and that change happens on the drop of a dime. and to those who are suffering under the existing situation, it seems so unfair that change doesn't happen faster. and i just would invite everybody to recognize that if we all do our part, it will happen faster. but it does take far longer than it should.

in our new series on the art of sampling, hip-hop producers demonstrate how they find inspiration in classics, hidden gems, found sounds and other raw musical materials to create new hits. for each of the five videos in the series, npr music has asked a writer we love to do something similar. their only instruction was to watch one of the videos, pick an element that inspired them, and spin it off in a new direction — to sample it.

kristen: so i'm wondering what your advice might be.
4. my body is going to seed. you may feel as if your only remaining athletic ability is pressing the remote or slumping into your chair at the office. nothing could be further from the truth. studies show that while there is some drop in muscle mass as you age, you can slow those changes to a crawl by getting your heart rate up a few times a week. for example, some of the athletes in the national senior games (for people 50 and older) swim college-level times. moreover, exercise is almost an elixir for an aging brain. studies have found that walking three times a week increased the area of the brain associated with memory — and turned back the brain clock by at least a year.
it's actions like this that helped earn disale the title of the world's most exceptional teacher.
we outline. it takes us about four months to write a season, and we outline like crazy people. our outlines are very long and very detailed and then we write a very bad first draft, and then we polish it, and rewrite, and rewrite, and rewrite, and we read it out loud constantly.

wendle: and then one was on top of the city of tuscaloosa, ripping apart schools and churches and houses.
mason: so these are primarily agricultural communities. they're ranchers. they grow fruit. and these are family operations, but they also employ a number of local mexican workers. and so the community itself is relatively small, only a few hundred people with maybe a few hundred other workers. but these are large families. one of the victims whose funeral was this week, she was the oldest of more than 40 children. and so these are big, close, tight-knit families that work these lands.
bolden: yeah. the crew is the last persons - set of people - that say...
christian brady: hi. this is christian brady calling from lexington, ky.
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross, back with jeffrey toobin, a staff writer for the new yorker and cnn's senior legal analyst. his latest piece in the new yorker, the conservative pipeline to the supreme court, is about the federalist society, a nationwide group of conservative lawyers, and its executive vice president, leonard leo. toobin writes that leo served in effect as president trump's subcontractor on the selection of neil gorsuch to serve on the supreme court. leo also played a crucial part in the nominations of justices john roberts and samuel alito, which means, toobin says, that leo is responsible, to a considerable extent, for a third of the supreme court. when we left off, toobin was explaining why he thinks that justice gorsuch will at every opportunity vote to overturn roe v. wade.
noah: it's interesting - it's funny that you just mentioned that. i never thought of it like that before, that simpatico. i feel like it's almost fitting - isn't it? - that when there was a half-black, half-white, half-african man, he was in the white house, he was being mocked by donald trump - i think it's only fitting that now donald trump gets mocked by a half-black...
bianculli: mary tyler moore speaking to terry gross in 1995. and now we'd like to end our salute to tv executive grant tinker by hearing from someone who got his big break on a television series overseen by grant tinker. from 2008, this is denzel washington.

in office, he wants to work on solutions to make funding for public transit less dependent on transit fares. he says the bay area's public transit is so tied to the farebox that as ridership evaporated so did the funding.
mcinerny: typically, people come up to me and they say, oh, my gosh i have to tell you what happened to me (laughter). and i'm like, ok, first of all, this is target so we should keep our voices down. and also, yes, i will listen to this tragic story while i try to select some kale for my family. so typically people, when they see me, are most likely to want to tell me what they have been through.
in fact, that was the original reason i came up with the idea to write the book because my lawyer had said to me that she couldn't give me any useful legal advice, but she could give me, you know, nonlegal or extralegal advice, which was find a way to get sustained public attention because in her experience - and she had similar experiences in the '80s with other cases - she felt that the only thing the community was really afraid of, the only way to cause it to back down was to shine a spotlight for a sustained period of time on the community's actions.
fionnuala quinlan, the irish consul general in boston, says with the island's small population there's hardly a family in ireland that doesn't know of someone living illegally in the u.s.
chozick: well, when it first looked like it was going to be hillary and donald trump, i'd say probably in february when it really sort of looked like they were both solidifying as their party's nominees, i thought the first woman nominee potentially running against the first nominee who's very comfortable using sort of misogynist language and sort of how is that going to to collide. but now, certainly, you're seeing even more contrasts.
then, in january 2018, china's cabinet-like state council formally announced the start of the nationwide saohei campaign.
martin: so, tell us about how the salvation army started.
hawley: well, i knew he was her parole officer. and she was on parole for crimes that, you know, we'll get a sense of to some degree. but i also wanted them to have something positive that they were working toward. you know, they're not bad people. they have an aspiration. and i thought, well, it's interesting if they're playing cards. you know, it's a little bit of the lebowski bowling. i mean, there's no more-throwback game than bowling than bridge, really. and so that seemed really good.
the washington post, which broke the initial allegations against moore last week, reported late wednesday that moore approached gena richardson when she was a high-schooler working at sears and asked for her phone number. she declined to give it to him, and he later called her at school to ask her out. she ultimately relented, feeling both nervous and flattered, the post reports. their movie date ended with moore driving her to her car in a dark parking lot behind sears and giving her what she called an unwanted, 'forceful' kiss that left her scared.

the tax bill might not be the kind of populist piece of legislation trump promised during the campaign, but it does have a lot in it to make conservatives happy. obamacare is unraveled; there are more tax breaks for people who home-school their kids or send them to religious schools; and there are tax hikes for graduate students, university endowments and voters in high-tax states. in other words — democrats.

mulaney: it was like, these people know me. and you know, it's not that people who know you don't love you. but they know you. and so, like - you know, they can't possibly think that i should be here. they have known me since i was, you know, 25 and just standing in the hallway like an idiot, drinking dr. pepper. and i'm a fraud - which is a common feeling among all people, i think.
sagal: ...here are your choices. from hari kondabolu, the story of some vacationers from brooklyn who thought their house had been ransacked, when it turns out it was only a bunch of dogs having fun and one drunk cat. from amy dickinson, the authorities in pisa, italy, becoming concerned that their famous leaning tower would no longer lean. it turns out it was just the place where they're taking photographs from. and finally, from mo rocca, a story of a bank robbery that wasn't. it was just the employees playing hide-and-seek. which of these is the real story of an emergency that wasn't in this week's news?
justice anthony kennedy announced wednesday he would be retiring from the supreme court. with him go his three decades of experience on the bench and, more politically pressing, his moderate legal philosophy.
sagal: mr. baio got his first breakout role at the age of 15. it was the title role in that bizarre kids as gangsters movie bugsy malone. and he landed the job as an unknown with his remarkable audition. how did he nail it? a - by performing perfectly shakespeare's this sceptered isle, this england speech from richard ii; b - by simply looking at the director in his most smoldering, come-hither sexy glance...
while marriage and motherhood remain on the radar, weather swirls around amber waves of dread. offill's signature achievement here is to capture the angst specific to our particular moment in time — the rising tide of anxiety, especially in new york city, about a world threatened by climate change and the ascension of right-wing strongmen, which deepens after the 2016 election. offill astutely compares the hum in the air to the one that followed 9/11. this potent, appealing little book is about how we weather this sense of doom — with humor, incredulity, panic, disaster preparedness, or, best of all, action.
sagal: mr. trump said he was not touching his face because of what?
stories of passing are often these moralizing stories. and i didn't want to do that. i was not interested in punishing stella, i was not interested in condemning her. to me, it was not interesting to think like: is it good or bad to pass? i was really more interested in the implications of passing on this woman's life. you know, how she comes to think of herself, how this changes her relationships and her family, the choices that she's making, how they affect her marriage. i was far more interested in that than in the idea of punishing her.
b harper: in a very deep way, in a profound way. being - having access to not only my mom's instruments, but her incredible record collection that, per my memory - per memory ranged from judy collins and woody guthrie all the way to rolling stones, led zeppelin, otis redding, sam cooke - does that all sound right, mom?
the book's setting carried great meaning for duras. she was born and raised near saigon but spent 1922 to 1924 in a small town in lot-et-garonne where her deceased father owned property. duras's mother worked hard to educate her daughter at the sorbonne. duras soaked up theater in paris during the 1930s and likely wrote the first draft of the impudent ones under german occupation. literary influences included ibsen's a dollhouse and chekhov's the seagull, as well as emily brontë's wuthering heights. she convinced famed publisher gaston gallimard to read her debut novel. despite favorable comments, he turned it down in 1941. it would be two more years before the impudent ones was published.

gross: had you given the apprentice good reviews or bad reviews or mixed reviews?
blight: well, he early and often favored self-reliance for his fellow black people. virtually all black leaders in the 19th century preached a kind of self-reliance. what else could they do in a society that either enslaved them, segregated them, defined them out of the constitution and later on, of course, even used terror to eliminate them? so self-reliance was a matter of inevitable necessity in some ways.
i've noticed that music critics who don't tend to pay attention to christian music take what you're doing seriously.

curtis: and the kids don't have a clue.
bw: i didn't really find that stuff until college. in high school i didn't know that stuff. i did listen to liz phair in high school. exile in guyville is still one of my favorite records. i knew it felt awesome to hear a woman being so bad ass and vocal about her feelings and sexuality, but i also knew i couldn't listen to it around my parents. but mostly i listened to a lot of guys, and i didn't even really realize it at the time.
mccartney: i was a choir boy.

i think it sort of surprised the clinton camp that she has become this trump slayer. you saw her speak the other night. she calls him a small, insecure money grubber. it seems to really get under donald trump's skin. he's been calling her pocahontas on twitter as often as he can.
when i say the choice to not marry, that doesn't always translate into i am a woman and i am deciding that i am not going to get married, or i am rejecting marriage. the choice to not marry can also mean: i would really like to marry or to fall in love or to meet someone, but i haven't met someone who i feel is going to improve on the life that i am building and making on my own.
sagal: rescuers let them know the day before they could get to them. and they said, don't worry, we've got plenty of booze, and there's a rugby game on. bill, how did hari do on our quiz?
by the 1990s, the bgea was run by franklin graham, billy's designated successor, and franklin's views differed sharply from his father's. franklin called islam a very evil and wicked religion, something his more temperate father never would have said. at a rally in 2003, shortly after the united states invaded iraq, billy graham noted that christianity shared a middle eastern homeland with islam.

millies: well, i'm not sure he's really said all that much. he's done something far better than that. he's shown us. joe biden's public catholicism has been a part of who he's been as a senator, as vice president, really, since he came into office in 1973. and what we continue to see is the way that his public faith transmits itself into public life just by simple gestures, something as simple as the sign of the cross that he made at the tomb of the unknowns on inauguration day but also in a whole life approach to public policy. finally, though, in a very recognizably catholic way, joe biden really speaks a language of unity and reconciliation. that's always appropriate but maybe never more appropriate than it is right now.
legend: ...and great flow between the songs and making sure it feels like a cohesive unit.
kurtzleben: yes. it's really very much about telling her story, despite the fact that we all know her as the wife of the man who was the most powerful man in the country. if not the world. i mean this is a book about this very accomplished woman saying, you know, hey this is me. this is my story. so we hear about her childhood, her family, her college years. and through all that, we get this deeper sense of who she is then we all got while she was in the white house. we learn that she's driven. she's an obsessively hard worker. she's a planner. she's very type a - to her husband's, you know, sort of more loosey-goosey way of doing things.
sagal: here is your next limerick.
but the date on that pending meeting proved to be inauspicious: sept. 2, 2001. just weeks later, the bush administration would adopt a more comprehensively aggressive posture toward immigrants and foreigners in the united states as the country began the march toward wars in iraq and afghanistan. undocumented immigrants would be rounded up in the name of national security, and travel in and out of the united states became more closely policed.
[we're] really focusing time on having these conversations, and stressing the importance of [firefighters] being able to have those conversations amongst each other, ronk said.
as much as americans believe in the separation of church and state, they also seem to believe in electing presidents who go to church. but there are lurking questions in some voters' minds about the religious faith of both major parties' presumptive nominees – and the internet has helpfully spawned a pair of hashtags – #methodisthillary and #iftrumpwereevangelical.
kurtis: lillian turner (ph) of washington, d.c.
the comments may be well-intentioned, but as kallman and ferorelli see it, the threat from climate change is worse. it's not a possibility. it's happening.
gallagher: (as reverend rick) it was god, cameron. i asked for his help, and he gave it to me in the form of those allies. i was so deeply unhappy, but i didn't think i was worth saving. and i wonder if you've asked that of yourself. are you worth saving?
the attack came as the u.s. and the taliban are said to be nearing a peace deal that would include the taliban in some sort of power-sharing agreement.
callahan, who turned 53 this week, has acclimated his good listeners to a state of wary adulation; the effort to describe is an excellent stab at self-definition, but you'd be foolish to get too comfortable with it. best to follow his lead without letting down your guard, despite his roguishly disarming air. well, it's been such a long time, callahan sings on the album's overture, shepherd's welcome, in his conversational baritone. why don't you come on in?
zimmerman: i work with schools in the area and help them coordinate their field trips to the museum.
klein: bill, how did neal do on our quiz?
tur: no. i think i just put it out of my head immediately and kept going. i just chalked it up to donald trump being such a bizarre character. i mean, this is a guy who - his mood swings were wild. on, you know, on one day, he would try to introduce me to a crowd and tell them how great i was as if i was his wife or he'd call me out and say that i was doing great reporting at a rally. and then, you know, a couple days later or a couple weeks later, he would call me a liar from the stage. i mean, he just swung back and forth between these two poles that i just chalked it up as another mood swing.
health officials recommend testing for individuals showing symptoms as well as any close contacts of confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms. a testing site locator is here.
davies: let's go through some of these one at a time because i think they're interesting. i mean, he's clearly made some major changes in social life in saudi arabia. but let's - the economic projects - he had some huge, grandiose ideas for new cities rising in various places. give us a sense of some of those ideas. one of them was going to be called n-e-o-m?
she told him to lie down and rest. another day went by, and frestan told her he felt better, but castro ortez wanted him to stay hydrated and eat something. so he tried to eat an apple.
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. today is part ii of our tribute to stephen sondheim, who turned 90 last sunday. we're listening to the interview i recorded in october 2010 after the publication of his book finishing the hat, which collects his lyrics from 1954 to '81 and also includes the stories behind the songs as well as what sondheim describes as his principles, his grudges, whines and anecdotes. before we get back to the interview, let's hear another song from his 1971 show follies. this is john mcmartin.
forman: they provoked this threat so that the government can say that they have a right to ban the film. so when the government banned the film, the firemen said, all right. so now we know.
albright: well, i think the moral is that we cannot think that everybody wants to be like american women. i have - again, to go back on this survey that i did in the '90s, a lot of women that had lived under communism had basically been liberated to work twice as hard. so one of the questions that we asked in that was, do you want to have a marriage where you stay at home and take care of the children, or do you want to have a job? and i can't remember the exact numbers, but most of the women wanted to be at home with their children.
woods: it is. as long as he stays healthy and the back stays healthy, i think it is. he reminded us yesterday he's been a contender late in the last three major tournaments. he's 43. he's still in fantastic shape. you know, with the science now behind training and diet, this could go on and maybe even soon. the next two majors - next month's pga championship, june's u.s. open - are on courses where woods already has won. he's got the muscle and mental memory, so look out.
the case is commonly characterized as the first major vertical deal challenged by federal lawyers in court in more than four decades. had leon ruled in favor of the government, the consequences would have reached far beyond media, to tech, health care, finance and other major fields.
sagal: the woman - no doubt. let's give him a chicken. (imitating chicken). next question - you got that one right. next question - in 2011, when this was checked, one-third of all divorce filings in the united states contained which of these words or phrases? was it a, facebook - b, hussy or c, home brewer?
d rushfield: we played it for her many times this week. i know she could hear it.
the name shift was part of mutono's decision to come out, one made complicated by his deep roots in uganda, a country whose government has outlawed homosexuality and suppressed lbgtq activism.

montanaro: well, obviously something has to give. if the house freedom caucus is going to stick to their guns and paul ryan has indicated he's not going to work with democrats, almost nothing can get done, especially looking forward to something as difficult as the tax overhaul that they'd like to accomplish.
that episode of tal, though — it burrowed straight to my heart. when it ended, i downloaded as many episodes as my computer's dwindling memory space would allow, and then i searched out more national and local shows, read public radio blogs, subscribed to newsletters. i was an avid reader, but this form of storytelling flipped a switch in my brain. it felt so personal, so immediate. as an extreme introvert, i was always looking for ways to connect with other people, and suddenly i had this new language. radio wasn't just news or entertainment — it was community.

hawley: yeah. i mean, that's the skill that television teaches you - right? - is, you know, as a showrunner you're doing nine jobs. you're both the lead writer and, you know, you're at - any one moment you're prepping an episode, shooting an episode and editing at least two episodes. and, you know, you're also interacting with the network and the studio, and you're dealing with budget issues and production issues.
rocca: so there will be no problem.
chang: chris van dusen - he's a showrunner.
kennedy joined conservatives in the majority to hold that corporate donations to political campaigns are protected by the first amendment.
bianculli: then came another massively influential mtm production, hill street blues, which brought serialized storylines and sophisticated filming techniques to the tv cop drama. from the very start, the opening roll call scene, held by michael conrad as sergeant phil esterhaus, hill street was a study in barely controlled chaos. and most of the good tv dramas that followed, from st. elsewhere to l.a. law, tried hard to emulate an equal.
conan: michelle singletary joined us by phone from her home. and again, she's the author of the power to prosper: 21 days to financial freedom.
chozick: yes. and robby mook, the clinton campaign manager, said, you know, we don't exactly take julian assange - what he says seriously. but at the same time, people i talked to, there is this sort of sense of anxiety, and they're not sure. i mean, terry, if there's one thing that they didn't want hanging over this convention it's emails, and here we are again.
jaeger: (as rob) i beg your pardon?
sanders: how did they find you?
gross: and, you know, you're dressed in your underwear so it's even more, like, imposing and, for him, kind of embarrassing because he's a man who is finding it all very arousing, and he shouldn't be there because he's posing as a woman. anyways...

i think it's only right. the movie's not set in 1910, or the 1960s when 'black panther' first came out — it's set in today.
tom bodett: i thought - it's brilliant what's happening here. it's like if you've got - if you've ever had, like, a car deal go south on you? you know, where the dealer just hates you and you hate the dealer. years later you go back.
shalhoub: ...just look like i knew what i was doing in the kitchen. and i had a great dialect person to help me with the accent - with the italian accent speaking english. and then another person to help me with the italian and stanley, too. it's hard to imagine that was 20-plus years ago because it was such a turning point for me. i think that movie - i kind of look at things as sort of pre-big night and post-big night.
that's when a federal judge struck down alabama's ban on same-sex marriage. the state's then-chief justice roy moore told local officials they weren't bound by the federal court ruling. that threw alabama's marriage license system into chaos. some offices closed altogether.

subaru hired a new ad agency, to figure out who was buying their cars. the ad firm went out to northampton, massachusetts--a hotspot for subaru sales, according to their research. a group of subaru owners filed into a little room in a shopping mall to answer a few questions, and the researchers noticed something right away. all of them were women and many identified as lesbian.

unidentified singer: (as character, singing) fake deals in the supermarket. tvs selling what you can't get. she laughs, nowhere is as pretty as this. green cars crawling in slow lane, lost stars waiting for the dark train. she smiles, turns and blows the city the kiss. under the waves i feel her pull my body down. under the waves she takes me where i want to drown. ah, give me miles away, she calls to me. this girl is a beautiful sea.

sondheim: well, no challenge at all. i was just imitating arthur laurents' style. arthur wrote the book, and he set - he made up a style, a kind of street talk that never existed because he knew that if he used actual street argot, it would date so quickly that by the time the show got on a year or two later, it would be old-fashioned. so, you know, one of the very few pieces of actual street argot we used was the word cool, which still meant the same thing back in 1957 that had it meant to jazz musicians earlier, and that's a word that has stayed pretty much in the language, meaning approximately the same thing, although it changed a little bit. now, of course, it just means ok. but cool meant better than ok before.
his jurisprudence prominently features an abiding commitment to liberty and the personal dignity of every person, chief justice john roberts said in a statement wednesday. justice kennedy taught collegiality and civil discourse by example.
martin: but you know, that genius for marketing persists to this day. i bet you, any one of us, i could stop people on the street and they could tell you the salvation army slogan for the year, or at least name the image, these very evocative images. i'm just wondering how that's possible in this day and age when there's so much noise, so much competition for our attention.
maybe he was saying it directly to you, maybe he was saying it directly to listeners. it felt like he was saying it directly to me. what i found so resonant about it was not that he was saying live life, not that he was saying, you know, seize the day, but live your life. and that, to me, is what here i am means and what jacob and julie and sam and the others are wrestling with, how not simply to move through days, but to move through days as oneself, as an integrated person.

gross: this is fresh air. let's get back to my interview with chesa boudin, san francisco's new da who's dealing with the impact of covid-19 on the city's criminal justice system. he's also active in the movement to reform the criminal justice system. his father, who is 75 now, is in prison in new york.
foer: i guess i wanted a less ambiguous relationship. you know, having an ambiguous relationship doesn't imply that it's a place of rest, right? i don't - i don't know about you, i don't know if this, like, sentiment makes any sense but i'm not a believer. i wish i were.
but i think building community is a little bit like a marriage. you have to keep working at it to keep it strong. so we're lucky that we do have a very diverse but healthy community. and it's pandemics and issues like this that really bring us together. i was here for 9/11. i was here for hurricane sandy. you have to know you can rely on your neighbors to get through troubled times like this.

an even bigger hurdle is the sheer unlikelihood of it all. rieder has no illusions. in fact, he says, some countries that have successfully reduced fertility rates have since reversed course, afraid that falling population will hurt their economies. (he has an answer — just as controversial — to that, too. he would have nations open up immigration to allow in the expected tens of millions of climate refugees.) rieder's real hope is to change people's way of thinking about childbearing.
change came through the efforts of pioneering individuals and grassroots groups. for instance, in my book i document the life of selvi, one of the very first sex workers to be identified with hiv, back in 1986. she suffered [an] abusive marriage, years of selling sex to support herself and her young son, her hiv diagnosis and then long years of imprisonment because she was an hiv-infected sex worker.

this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. next monday marks the 50th anniversary of loving v. virginia, the supreme court decision that overturned the laws that remained in 16 states prohibiting interracial marriage. the plaintiffs were richard and mildred loving. he was white. she was black. they couldn't legally marry in their home state, virginia. so they went to washington, d.c., where it was legal, and then returned home, where they were soon arrested. here's mildred loving in a 1967 report on abc news, describing what happened in 1958 on the night the sheriff came to arrest the lovings in their home while they were sleeping.

the director of jail medical has made it very clear in writing, and repeatedly, that we need to reduce the jail population in order to avert disaster. and she's even given us a target number that she wants us to reduce the jail population to. what we've done is we've reduced the county jail population since i took office in january by nearly 40%. that has created the conditions for the jail medical team to implement some level of social distancing, to isolate people who are incarcerated who show symptoms, to find ways to actually meet the medical needs of folks who have other medical conditions besides covid-19 who are housed in the jail. and in doing so, at least to date, we have managed to avert what could be a really catastrophic outcome. no one wants short-term, pre-trial incarceration to turn into a death sentence.

itzkoff: yeah, zach was one of the people that i spoke to for this book and spent a fair amount of time with. and zach was an integral part, even though he was just a baby and didn't have direct control over this - but zach was a big reason why robin finally got sober in that era - that he wanted to be sober for the sake of his son and for the sake of being a good father and being present for everything that he needed to in his son's life. and that routine, i mean - that's what i think makes a set like live at the met so extraordinary because it is really one of the more sort of candid, open performance pieces that robin did, where he is really finally starting to talk about things that he experienced, some of his own misdeeds, understanding why they were wrong, wanting to be a better person for his son.

it may well be the best possible outcome. we don't have to apologize for moore and jones will win with less than 50% of the vote and will quickly fade into 2020, barry bennett, a former trump campaign adviser, told npr. this race wasn't about anybody other than roy moore and his past. to the extent there were bullets fired, they were by roy moore into his own feet.
foer: yeah, that's well put. it was very easy to make fun of as a kid, you know? it was very easy to be embarrassed by until i wasn't. and then i was embarrassed by my embarrassment, really ashamed of my embarrassment. she's of a generation of jews who were, you know, deformed by trauma. and that's one true way of understanding the experience, and the other is that they are kind of geniuses of resilience. i remember spending a good portion of my life thinking about how unusual the way she lived was, you know? clipping coupons for foods that would simply never be bought, protecting upholstery, arranging certain kinds of photographs in certain ways on certain surfaces and as i read, you know, treating buffets like supermarkets before blizzards, i thought how puzzling. and then later in life, i was in awe of the fact that she was a functioning human being, you know? that how few her peculiarities were, how rare her trauma seemed to express itself.

on worrying if your therapist likes you
cheryl strayed: you can't make decisions about people when you're thinking about them as categories rather than individuals. i think you should date people you like and people you find interesting and attractive and compelling, no matter what their age is. also, you say, if it worked out, i'd have to face the possibility of living the last 20 years of my life alone. that presumes your life is going to go along this course you control. you actually don't know when you will die. you don't know when your future partner will die. you don't know what sort of health you're going to be in. anything could happen at any minute. so don't over-predict your life. just go out and connect with people who spark your sense of attraction and desire and adventure and all those good things you look for when you're looking for a partner. those questions you're asking should really be asked within the context of a specific relationship.

mr. sharlet: well, it's an idea that goes back into the '70s with one of the gurus of modern christian-right thinking, a guy named francis schaeffer, but it really picked up steam with the work of a man named charles colson. chuck colson some listeners may remember as the watergate felon, nixon's sort of henchman who went to prison - was born again, as he writes in his book, through the family, through their intervention and bringing him to christ. they actually helped get him out of prison by writing letters to the parole board and everything else. and he had this idea. he's an evangelical. he had this idea that catholics and evangelicals, who historically in american life have been at each other's throats, could work together on culture war issues, that they could be co-belligerents in the culture war. and i think the family has been one of the vehicles at which that's happened at the elite level, despite the fact - and i think this is important when we look at someone like bart stupak - the family began as a virulently anti-catholic organization.
but among asian newlyweds, those with some college experience (39 percent) are more likely to marry someone of a different race or ethnicity than those with a bachelor's degree or higher (29 percent) or with a high school diploma or less (26 percent). asian newlyweds with some college are somewhat less likely to be immigrants, and this may contribute to the higher rates of intermarriage for this group, the pew report suggests. but it also notes that this trend also holds true for asian newlyweds who were not born in the u.s.

actually, i'm critical of much of what is called international development. its failures are chronic and multitudinous. the blame for these failures spans all the way from both donor- and developing-country governments to westerners who continue to think of poorer countries in damagingly sensationalistic terms, for instance as hotbeds of modern-day slavery.
the sky is pink is a film that begins in gloom. a teenage girl has died. her parents grieve as they go over artifacts of her life in her room. then you hear the voice of that daughter, aisha - her name means life - begin to tell her family's story. yes, she says, she's dead, but quote, get over it. it's quite cool actually. you'll see when you get here, which you do know you will, right? the sky is pink is a real-life story of love lived under loss and stress and the surviving devotion of aisha's parents, aditi and niren, who acquire the nicknames moose and panda.

but first, to acknowledge the actual old-world component: yes, both cider and donuts have long histories. krondl notes that in early america, hard cider was one of the primary beverages, prior to prohibition — especially in apple-growing areas like new england and the upper midwest. it was cheap, common and easier to make than beer (not to mention handy when you've got a bumper crop of fruit that would otherwise go bad).

ives's stories may be puzzling, but they aren't opaque. many writers interested in weirdness overload their stories with tangled sentences or thesaurus words; she's not into that. line to line, cosmogony is snappy, voice-driven, and immensely inviting. one story, scary sites, is a dialogue between friends, stripped of any descriptive prose. all the others — with the exception of guy, which is the collection's only miss — feel nearly as conversational. the poisoners, a crookedly sweet account of an adulterous affair gone right, gave me the vicarious thrill of a good gossip session. reading a throw of the dice and cosmogony, which are two of the collection's strongest stories, was like listening to a friend lament her mistakes. this fictional relatability is an achievement in a throw of the dice, whose unnamed protagonist is a recent college graduate struggling to set up a life in the bay area. in cosmogony, it's downright exceptional, given that the story opens with the narrator's best friend getting engaged to a blue-legged, yellow-eyed demon.

each version of this work from trumpeter nate wooley follows the same basic compositional arc, altering the instrumentation a bit with each new installment over the last decade. but the goal is always the same: forging a soaring structured improvisation reaching for the ecstatic and concluding with a cathartic denouement. seven storey mountain vi features female voices interpolating the words and melody of the staunchly feminist peggy seeger song reclaim the night, but the piece's harrowing journey also felt like a powerful and hopeful sound track for 2020. –peter margasak
diamond: well, in his remarks, the president didn't address the biggest problem - that our domestic health infrastructure is not ready for this, partly because of his administration. we're still wildly behind on testing that was botched by the centers for disease control. we don't have enough supplies, like respirators. our hospitals and doctors are almost certainly going to face real challenges as demand spikes. and i think listeners should be clear-eyed that what's happening in italy, in spain, with their hospitals and icus totally slammed, that could happen here, too, in the next two weeks.

as a romance, 'winter's orbit' delivers on its promises like a well-inked marriage contract: there will be misinterpreted touches and only one bed; they will get stranded on an icy mountain.

mcinerny: yeah, i think that there is something. there's sort of like the language of relationships or of an average family. like, there's no average family structure anymore. i read some, you know, a summary of a pew study - i didn't read the whole study. like, who am i? but i read a summary that - i mean, there is no dominant family structure anymore, but there also isn't language that reflects these families, too. so when you say it's my dad's girlfriend, that sounds pretty temporary. the big kids had come from - they had seen a marriage end, they had seen a marriage at its worst and they had seen this relationship come together. and they wanted to feel that solidity. and so did ralph. he was only four, but he would, you know, - he'd, are you married? like, first of all, who - that sounds a little judgmental from your own child, but he was going to a lutheran preschool so who knows what he was learning there. but, yeah, it was important to the kids that we got married. they were our only bridal party in our backyard wedding. and sophie drew the invitation on a piece of computer paper. and we photocopied it. and that was it. we just had doughnuts and orange juice and coffee and champagne in our backyard one day in june. it was a little surprise for everyone who came.

mcewan: i think people knew the facts of life, but still, they had to cross that line from innocence to experience. and i personally don't think we've reached any kind of commanding heights on this now. we live in a time when people in their mid-teens are faced with problems of a very different sort - not repression, but just peer pressure, social media, boys watching, you know, erotic, athletic pornographic stuff on the internet, girls being told how to look, how to feel, how to - you know, what shape they should be. i think it warps expectations because we still don't have, for all this openness about sex, much discussion about emotional truthfulness.

normally i try to steer clear of comparing books to tv shows — apples and oranges and all that — but with the echo wife, it's unavoidable. and that's a good thing. in the book's treatment of cloning, gender dynamics, moral ambiguity, and the lofty idea of the existential nature of identity, it has a passing resemblance to some great contemporary television, including killing eve, orphan black, black mirror, and westworld (specifically, the current small-screen incarnation of westworld rather than the classic movie — or even the michael crichton novel it was based on). and in fact, gailey once said in an interview, this might sound silly, but my writing is heavily influenced by television. i pay close attention to the way tv writers structure narrative beats, plot development, and character arcs. in the echo wife, it shows. from the snap of its dialogue to the torque of its twists, the story positively glows.

barry: oh, man, i tell you. there was a funny moment in philadelphia when i was doing an event with john panvel (ph) who's, of course, a great man. and i had been in a bit of trouble in ireland with a play. i don't need to go into it, but i know somebody in the audience said, well, how do you feel about your country now? you know, because there had been calls for mr. barry to - possibly to leave the country and all the rest. and i instinctively said, well, i love my country. see, i love my country because i know my country. i'm not loving unconditionally or blindly. i've tried to look into the whole matter, and i remain in love with this strange land and its people.

asian-american women today still experience the wrath of those legacies every day, said joanne rondilla, a lecturer of asian pacific american studies at arizona state university. rondilla pointed to the creepy white guys tumblr that collected offensive messages sent to asian-american women via online dating platforms. in a similar vein, last year mia matsumiya created an instagram account to post the thousand-plus messages from creeps, weirdos & fetishists she's received over the past decade. my personal favorite calling out of these dating dynamics is comedian kristina wong's incredible i'm asian american and... episode in which she collects reparations for yellow fever on dates with white men.

open enrollment this fall (for 2018 health insurance coverage) would shorten to six weeks, down from three months. while opening day would remain the same — nov. 1 — the final rule closes the marketplace on dec. 15 instead of at the end of january. that period provides sufficient time for consumers to enroll, the administration has said, and would mean all who sign up would have a full year of coverage starting jan. 1.

sagal: all right, you have two more chances. famously, as we now know, j.d. salinger became a recluse at the height of his fame. some blamed his difficulty with public attention or his experiences in world war ii. but what other trauma might have sent him fleeing from human contact? a, the x-ray specs ordered from the back of a comic book did not turn out to work; b, his girlfriend was once stolen from him by none other than charlie chaplin; or c, he once accepted an award and discovered afterwards his fly was down the whole time?
sagal: ...they fall down. well, no. i'm sorry. it was c. it was the guy in indiana jones. mr. lucas said, quote, i was in a bad mood.

but in the short term, this tax bill just might be the kind of win trump and his party need.
but he begins to talk about my early life. and he sort of drops a bombshell. and the bombshell he drops is very casually, as though it's sort of not much to say. he says that when i was little, he used to do experiments with me, kind of skinnerian-type experiments where he would not speak to me, leave me in a room by myself, not respond when i spoke, leave me in the dark. and then he went on with kind of a list of, you know, psychological experiments that he thought would make him the next skinner. and then one day, my mother found him at those experiments. and that's the day she left.
in the early days of the obama administration, bagenstos worked in the civil rights division of the justice department, and says it was a clear priority within the white house to try and see where — within existing law — they could extend more protections against discrimination to lgbt individuals.
e harper: well, as a single mother, there's plenty of challenges anyway, aside from the fact of not having any money or very much money. i did - the town, as much as it could make things difficult, could make things easy. it was a small town, knew everybody. there was a very close circle of people, and we did look out for each other. and my parents were very strong. they were always there for me and for my kids, whether they approved of me or how i was raising them or not. but they were definitely there and provided, i think, a really strong support system for the kids.

moore: exactly. he was probably going to be tall, dark and handsome. and instead, what walked through the door was ted knight - short, white-haired and handsome, yes, but not what you'd call a love interest. but the writers, the writer producers, jim and allan, were so open. and i think that's an important part of being a successful artist is being open to new ideas and input. and they saw this man and they began to think potential. all right, so it isn't our original idea but, oh, wow, look and feel and salivate over all the juicy stories we could do in another direction.

moore: and the funny thing is, you know, women liked me. they were not envious of the fact that their husbands had a crush on me. it was ok with them. they were the first to - when i would meet people, they'd say, my husband loves you so much and he thinks you're so sexy. and this was an odd thing because they were also able to identify with me as a friend, as a girlfriend. there was no resentment and no fear.

but also the border states are more supportive of immigration, which is not what you would think. so actually, it is the upper midwest and some of the southern states that have newer experience or less experience with immigration that tend to be most opposed.

frayer: poor, illiterate women sing a song about the beatings they've endured in rajasthan in northern india. this is a world away from the urban elites and their #metoo hashtags. but bhanwari devi knows their struggle. in 1992, she was working for her local municipality, and it started a campaign against child marriage. some powerful men in her village did not like it.

he used to eat off the land, go weeks without eating regular food, nuñez said. that army mentality, you know what i mean? he would put on a show — but he was a big teddy bear.
sagal: no. it grew up to be a black bear.
diamond: terry, i think there are three or four big questions that we'll be looking to see. one would be this continued administration over the affordable care act, a law that republicans have fiercely fought. it's mostly intact. what will they do to keep it running or look for ways to weaken it? a second issue is the opioid crisis. this is something that donald trump ran on. he promised effects. one year later, there's been very little done. and that is striking when we compare it to the efforts done around birth control, around establishing the new conscience office. it's interesting that there is funding and effort behind establishing a new team devoted to religious conscience, but there have been problems getting funding for the opioid epidemic.

but then shortly after that, the church itself gave up polygamy. but a number of families thought that the church was wrong to do so. and so then we saw another wave of immigration to northern mexico and the establishment of new colonies in the early 20th century. and this time, it was families - not at the direction of the church but precisely because they wanted to continue to practice polygamy even though the church no longer countenanced it.

cheslow: virginia has other outdated laws, like making it a crime to swear or spit in public. some lawmakers are working to repeal those, too. democrats and republicans are already clashing on issues like new gun control laws. but the work of repealing old, discriminatory laws may be a place for cooperation. republicans say they will easily vote to strike those laws and address the painful past.
morrell: my grandfather was a pastor, so i grew up in this church that was very conservative. they were so conservative, they split from other churches because they thought the other churches in the south were too liberal, and i was like what in the world? christianity, in general, i would say, never represented me — i always felt like i was on the outside. the only time i felt like i was represented was actually within the scripture. some terrible people were heroes in the bible. you saw some really terrible things about people's lives and personalities within the bible, but when i was growing up in church, everybody hid that. you don't do this, this, this and that makes you a christian.
jungermann: (as ingrid) we're in park slope.
now, a lot of people in the media say that donald trump goes golfing too much. you guys are always like, he goes golfing too much, which raises a very important question. why do you care? do you want to do - do you want to know what he's not doing when he's golfing? being president. let the man putt-putt. keep him distracted. teach him how to play badminton. tell him he has a great body for bobsledding. play him tic-tac-toe. the longer you keep him distracted, the longer we're not at war with north korea.
prine: i learned it, you know, verbatim.
e harper: yes, he did. my mother taught guitar and banjo lessons at hecht house, which is a community center in boston. and she took the classes over from bess hawes when bess moved to california. and pete used to come into the classes to see bess and help out. so some of the classes were huge, and he'd help out. and he would come to my mother's classes occasionally as well. and one day i think my mother just prevailed on him to come to the house for dinner because my father was really sinking under that morass of no job and not able to protect his family.
carney: my songs are the songs that i had sort of half-written. he kind of pushed incredible choruses on them or great hooks, lyrically. i can give you a good example. there's a song in the film, which is one of the first songs connor writes, and it's called the riddle of the model and the film is about a guy who sees a girl who claims she's a model, this young kid who's sort of a 16-year-old. so i wrote that name, the riddle of the model. i thought it was very pretentious and very sort of appropriate for a young kid in the '80s. and he started adding in words like, you know, she's so indefinable, she holds the key to the missing code.

and today, as in the 1960s and '70s, there are communities that do not perceive the police or law enforcement, generally, as a force for good in their neighborhoods, and that's something that i'm working hard to change. we have a lot of people, particularly people of color, who perceive the presence of police in their neighborhoods and their communities as a force for oppression, as something that holds people down, as something that targets for harassment and racial discrimination. and we know that there's racism at every single step of the criminal justice system.

turkle: yeah, he's been trying to find me and that thrill that he's been trying to find me. and then that - you know, all those times that i'd been waiting at the mailbox for a holiday card or a birthday card, all those years. and i didn't get anything. and he's been looking for me. but no, he's been advertising his disproof of einstein (laughter). and then we sit down. and he feeds me bagels and lox and cream cheese and pound cake and kind of typical jewish foods. and he eats only green things. he's kind of a raw food vegetarian. and it turns out he not only has disproved einstein, he's also written books about raw food vegetarianism and world peace. he's kind of an eccentric in many ways.

the only part of why women kill that throws me a bit initially is that it's pandering to the freer standards of cbs all access a bit too gratuitously. there are glimpses of nudity and droppings of f-bombs where they don't seem necessary. but these days, that may be the price of being on a streaming service or for persuading people to pay its monthly fee.

author rachel lynn solomon based the story partly on her own experience. shay's journey mirrors mine in a lot of ways, she tells me via email. we both studied journalism in college, and at the beginning of the book, she produces a talk show similar to the one i worked on in my early twenties. i also reported a handful of stories and produced a weekly pre-recorded show for seattle's kuow. the most exciting part of writing this book was how shay grew into someone with her own history and aspirations. while she's always dreamed of hosting her own show, i was more comfortable behind the scenes. she's also spent her whole life wanting to work in public radio because her late father loved it so much, while i didn't discover it until high school.

flowers became a simple way to remind myself of beauty and resilience, and the way we can come alive when we are taken care of, williams tells npr. she's home, of course, in nashville, talking on a video call as the tail of her dog alf pops in and out of the frame. it's been a particularly difficult few days in quarantine for the 31-year-old frontperson of paramore and now solo artist, so today she traded her house slippers and sweats for some real clothes. it helped a little, she thinks: a small gesture of self-care as fertilizer for the soul. but flowers also show, she adds, staring firmly into the camera, her white-blonde hair dusting over expressive brows, when they are not taken care of.

thompson: you know, he's expecting something. she's expecting something. i think their assumptions about - one about the other are overturned in a very beautiful way, actually, because they become very drawn to each other on an intellectual level, on an emotional level. i think fiona is expecting someone - what's the word? - limited in some way because of his upbringing within the jehovah's witnesses. and what she finds is this living flame. and, of course, she's warmed by him.

boudin: absolutely. both of my parents were really active within prison and finding ways to give back and be supportive of their communities. my father pioneered a prisoner education program for people with aids, and that was at a time when the hiv-aids epidemic was really threatening stability, not just lives but also the stability of prison life because people were so scared and, as today with covid-19, forced to live in close proximity to each other with very limited access to health care and very limited information about how the disease was spread.

severino: sure - because that was something that joe biden himself proposed. he said when we're this close to a presidential election - when he said it, he actually meant a little farther out than that vacancy came up. he said at that point, it would be inappropriate for the president to nominate someone, and it would be inappropriate for the senate to consider them. and that had to do with the presidential election, and it was something that the majority of the senate agreed with at the time. i don't think you would see that apply in a midterm election year - never would've contemplated that because that would mean you wouldn't hear - have nominees 50 percent of the time.

it is unusual to see a new justice's ideological footprints so clearly in his first year or two on the high court. indeed, most new justices, including those with long careers on the lower courts, are somewhat hesitant at first. they understand that the supreme court's word is the final word, and that looking at issues from this new perspective is somewhat different from the perspective of a lower court judge, whose job is to carry out the mandates of a higher court.

forest: oh, thank you so much.
albright: well, it does. and part of it, i have to say, is that in '91, when i - before i went into the government, i did this survey of all of europe after the end of the cold war. and we did a lot of questionnaires, but also focus groups. and i will never forget a focus group outside of moscow where this man stands up and says, i'm so embarrassed; we used to be a superpower, and now we're bangladesh with missiles. and so what putin has done is identify with that kind of loss of national pride that the russians have had, and he has restored it from - in their eyes. and so he is popular, and it has something in terms of restoring russia's position. and as i say, he has played a weak hand very well.

and the policy story side of this is that trump's policy positions were malleable, to be generous. your listeners might remember, terry, he took five different positions on abortion in three days at one point during the campaign. he was talking about abortion, if it's illegal, women should be punished - and then walked back from that and then said the doctor should be punished - and then said the states should have right here - but then said maybe we should just let the law stay as it is.

hubbard: so on the economic front, he has a whole raft of initiatives, some of which have actually begun, some of which may never quite make it off the ground. you know, one of the big early ones was the privatization of aramco. and so, you know, this was something that he had announced quite - that was quite a surprise to everybody, including many of the executives inside of aramco, which is the state oil monopoly, and it's really the economic engine of the entire country. he basically mentioned in an interview with the economist magazine that he was going to privatize aramco, and it sent everybody sort of, you know, scrambling for information.

when i look through the nominees - and they're so incredible and all of their music is — it's just wildly varied. the talent is undeniable. and yet if you listen to all of us in a row or in any particular scrambled order, it's hard for me to sort of understand how we all ended up in the same place. but that much good music happened and was being created by women in a time when it is so overdue that it just boiled over.
garcia-navarro: did no one try and help you? did no one say, how could this happen to a young girl?
the chief justice of the alabama supreme court has issued an administrative order, directing probate judges that they may not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, despite the u.s. supreme court's decision last year on marriage equality. we have grave concerns about this order, which directs alabama probate judges to disobey the ruling of the supreme court, said u.s. attorneys joyce white vance of the northern district of alabama and kenyen brown of the southern district of alabama. government officials are free to disagree with the law, but not to disobey it. this issue has been decided by the highest court in the land and alabama must follow that law.
jesmer: well, i don't know. i think he spent 40 or 45 million so far, which is a decent chunk of change. no question about it. but you would think that if he was going to write a check, he maybe would have just to kind of avoid all the bad press, but who knows. he's obviously a very unconventional candidate. but the point is, going back to that time issue, writing a check on october 1st is not nearly as helpful as writing a check on july 1st or june 1st. you just need time to build up the operation and go, and, like i said, identify these voters and put them in a category which you can get out to vote.
and even to this day, doug coe, the leader of the group, says, you know, now he's got a much more open mind. you can be a catholic and love jesus just the way you can be a jew and love jesus or be a muslim and love jesus. in other words, being a catholic in his mind doesn't qualify you as a christian. and actually when i visited the c street house, when bart stupak was living there, there was a woman who was sort of functioning as an administrator, and she was a catholic. and she told me that she still goes to mass, but she keeps it secret because she knows doug would disapprove.

moore: my mother was an alcoholic, as i was to become. her alcoholism took another form from mine. she would, by the dint of determination, be sober for months at a time and then be unable to continue. and all of the problems that had been building up and she had been stuffing under the rug of her emotions would burst forth, and she would start drinking in the day. and she would not stop until somebody found the bottle and took it away and pretty much held her captive in the house until she sobered up and we were able to plead with her to stop. and then she would try again.
on his show wednesday night, hannity overall seemed satisfied that moore had responded to his concerns, but he said that it was up to the voters of alabama to be the final arbiter.
the agency's proposed definition would define sex as either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with, the times reports, based on the draft seen by its reporters. any dispute about one's sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing.
and so it's kind of like we're really seeing - it's a little bit as though we were seeing that the people are getting their information on 21st-century technology but the governments are providing 19th-century responses. and so the institutions are not responding to the divisions and the problems that people are having in these countries. and then the other part of this, which i think is essential, is there is some leader at the top who takes advantage of these divisions and, in fact, exacerbates them so that the societies are more and more divided and wrangled and looking for scapegoats, which is where the immigrants come in. but mostly, this is something that's created internally by massive changes in society and some of them due to technology.
sagal: (laughter) yes. that is hilarious. i just - i don't think - i mean, i'm sorry you lost, but your reaction to losing was great.
i'm not particularly sure on his exact likes, but, i say this with feeling pretty confident, whatever it is that they're making, i'm sure he likes. i mean you have to remember around the nba — and i mentioned it earlier with the portland trailblazers — if a player who's a star on that team has a particular preference, whether it's crust or no crust, a certain kind of bread, a certain kind of jelly, nut butter, whatever the case may be — i guarantee you that that team is going to accommodate it, and that that's probably going to be the key reason why they make whatever it is they make.
rege-jean page: he is a tall, dark, handsome, brooding, thoroughly broken man who is struggling with issues of legacy and pride and trauma. and he takes a tumultuous episode to try and unpick that joyous ball of yarn.
foer: i do, too. we had a really brief letter exchange. it was really lovely, and he had asked me if i would sign a copy of my first book for him. i think he collected books. and i sort of acting out the, you know, the childishness or the immaturity or the - what i thought was the reverence or funniness of that age i was really young at the time - 25. i drilled a hole through the book, and i bought a huge padlock.
rob compton: david, i commit to love you until death do us part.
mayer: i know he has a lawyer, and i do not know for sure, but i would assume that because he was in that meeting, his actions will certainly be looked at closely.
and that now, obviously in our modern age, runs up against an ethos where people - they post pictures of every meal they eat and every thought they have goes online. and, you know, what does that do to this sort of reticence to overshare. and, you know, if you can replace a real community with a virtual community, what happens to the real community?
i mean, society's expectations at that point still said, hey, wait a minute, lady, you only go so far here. but i think we broke new ground, and that was helped by my insistence on wearing pants, you know, jeans and capri pants at the time because i said i've seen all the other actresses and they're always running the vacuum in these little flowered frocks with high heels on, and i don't do that. and i don't know any of my friends who do that. so why don't we try to make this real? and i'll dress on the show the way i do in real life.

you know, this was released. we reported on it. other newspapers reported on it. it was, you know, sort of, you know, became part of the public record of our understanding of what happened. and trump just kind of ignored it and said, yeah, it doesn't really matter either way. you know, maybe he did it, and maybe he didn't. but at the end of the day, he's important for us, and that's what matters.
and i got up to leave. and i called a taxi about - i don't know - 1:30 in the morning. and phil's walking me to the door, and we passed by a piano. and he sits down at the piano, and he hands me an unplugged electric guitar. and we wrote a song called if you don't want my love in about - not even 30 minutes. and when he was doing that, he was totally normal guy - just straight-ahead songwriter doing his craft. there was nothing - there was no big circus about it or anything.

my mother was 19 when she graduated college. she wanted to study science. she went to her father, my grandfather, and my grandmother and said, i want to go and study at one of the best schools for that. and my grandfather, who had an arranged marriage to my grandmother, and this was in the 1950s that my mother approached them, my mother said she wanted to go and study at uc berkeley california and my grandfather said go. and so they put her on a plane, and this is when transcontinental travel was not very common, she had never been to the united states. but my grandfather was really quite progressive, and he said to his eldest child who was his daughter, my mother: you go and you study.

but bush, along with neurosurgeon ben carson and ohio gov. john kasich — all struggling in the polls — also had a hard time standing out over the rowdy exchanges of the other candidates. carson again gave muddled answers on foreign policy, while kasich touted his free-trade beliefs and experience balancing the budget in the 1990s.
barry: between the lines and maybe 10 feet under them because understandably it's not in the record. you know, i mean, it's often said that if you look for jesus christ in the historical record, there's two vague mentions of him there. that's it.
at&t and time warner are not competitors; theirs would be a vertical integration of complementary companies: time warner makes the tv shows (and movies and news programming and so forth), while at&t offers the satellite and cable tv services and mobile phone systems on which people consume such content.
someone from the lgbt community will say, 'if you will not honor the choices i make with my life, if i choose a partner and get married, then you're not actually honoring me.' i can understand that, hulst says, grimacing. i can see how they might come to that conclusion.
and so my husband and i have decided that we will be giving our children a stipend when they're in college so that they don't have to put in so many work hours, so they can concentrate on their studies. if you can afford it, i don't have a problem with that.
kurtzleben: you know, to me, there is a theme that runs throughout the book that i found that really gets very profound. she writes very eloquently about the difficulty of marriage. i mean, writes about going to couples counseling with barack. she writes about their fertility struggles, about agreeing to let politics hijack their lives. and it's clear she's not trying to be juicy here or, like, to dish. she - you get the sense she's really wrestled with deep questions about what it's like to weave your life in with someone else's.
the six plaintiffs — two male couples and one female couple, according to the japan times — had asked for 1 million yen (about $9000) per person in damages, citing the pain of not being able to legally marry.

while the resolution didn't mention gay and lesbian victims, outgoing sbc president ronnie floyd said in an address to attendees that an attack against gay americans in orlando is an attack against each one of us, adding that christians should oppose violence and bigotry against anyone in this world, according to minutes kept by baptist press.
i think i was writing incredibly personal music. all of my favorite artists, you really see them as human beings out in the world and you can link this to their music. and i didn't want to deprive people of the experience of knowing the artist a little better when hearing my music.
and even if the absence of a signature by the president isn't enough to void the contract, clifford argues that cohen has violated the terms of the deal by making multiple statements to the media. it specifically references a feb. 13 statement to the new york times as evidence that there was no binding agreement in place.

gross: if you're just joining us, my guest is tim wu who is most famous for inventing the expression net neutrality. his new book is called the attention merchants: the epic scramble to get inside our heads, and it's about advertising with an emphasis on internet advertising. is there a moment in time where you can say this is where advertising on the internet begins for real?

trump had already changed his positions on salient social issues such as these in the 2016 republican primaries, where he did surprisingly well among self-described religious conservatives (especially in the crucial south carolina primary). some expected him to switch back in the general election, or in office.
falk: if you're going to have a show about romantic relationships, i think sex is integral to that. i think we're a bizarrely puritanical culture. american pop culture has gone in a really odd direction where sex is usually portrayed either as just for titillation, both in movies and tv, or it's treated deeply, deeply seriously, with all the sexiness of it stripped out.
prine: exactly. i'm no good with that. if somebody tells me to work or exercise, i go the other way. i'll come up with an excuse.

they said, why would you go and be a part of an institution that is not always fair and does not always pursue justice? some would call it the persecutors office, not the prosecutor's office. ... law enforcement has such a profound and direct impact on the most vulnerable among us. and there is a duty and a responsibility to be a voice for the most voiceless and vulnerable and to do the work of justice. and that's the work i wanted to do. ... it is also understanding that the victims of crime come from the same communities as those who have been treated unfairly. the victims of crime deserve a voice. i, for a while, specialized in child sexual assault cases. i'm gonna tell you, prosecuting those cases were extraordinarily difficult and some of the most important work i did.
the controversy began when rodríguez wrote on his blog that he did not authorize orishas' use of the song, nor did the group request authorization. me parece un lamentable acto de parasitismo, rodríguez wrote on saturday. (it seems to me a lamentable, parasitic act.)

and i go to the supermarket in these beautiful clothes and carrying this handbag and feeling so grown up. and my aunt says to me, just, you know, walk along the aisles and pretend you're looking for something. and i'm like, why do i do this? and she says, because your future mother-in-law will now watch you. and so i have no idea what my future mother-in-law might look like. but i know there is a woman in the shop. and she's come here to see me. and she's come here to pronounce me worthy or unworthy. and if you are rejected, that rejection is crushing. it goes into your resume.
mr. sharlet: to make hampton whole through financial restitution, a transfer of a very large sum of money. the number most often cited seems to be 1.2 million. there's no reason, i think, to doubt doug hampton on this. he's been very forthcoming what is obviously a very painful episode in his life. but senator tom coburn, who until now had a real reputation for candor and integrity, regardless of what you thought of his political views, has been saying one thing and then another. in fact, this past sunday, on george stephanopoulos's morning show, he seemed to contradict himself in the space of a few minutes, saying that no, he had not been a negotiator, but yes, he had attempted to sort of negotiate a deal between ensign and the family of doug hampton and cindy hampton.
that, she says, gives me confidence. i can do it, i can do it.
feldman: it was very painful to no longer have contact with my grandmother. on the other hand, i do mention in the book that my grandmother developed dementia already before i left and that she had trouble recognizing me shortly before i left. and i think that made it easier. i think i might not even have done it if that had not been the case. but it was almost like i had already lost her. and so i could deal with that loss, whereas contact with the rest of my family members - losing that wasn't so difficult. i mean, when you get these letters telling you that your grave is ready, and they want to dance on it, i mean, that's a confirmation that this is the kind of family you don't need. if anything, it sort of cemented my decision and made me feel like i had really done the right thing because you have to get away from family like that.

pusha t: well, i don't (laughter) - i don't understand where he is in his political views. this is one of many things that we disagree on, you know, wholeheartedly. and it's fine. you know, i feel like that's another reason why we work together. i'm also the president of his company for that same reason. i bring other aspects. i bring other point of views to the table all the time. but you know, that's something that we're not going to see eye-to-eye on.

number five is the only broadcast network show on my list. and it's the good place on nbc, which fascinates me because it's a philosophical comedy about the afterlife and about the worth of life on earth. and if you pay attention to it, not only is it much more serious than most television shows, but it's also got some really big surprises in it, which i will not spoil if you haven't started watching it yet. you can start, but it will throw you for several loops. number four is killing eve on bbc america, which is the other show about a paid assassin - in this case, a woman being hunted by a government person who is also a woman. the americans is number three. that was on fx. that ended this year with a very strong finale and a very strong final season. and that was about soviet sleeper agents in the u.s. and these days, when we're so...
mohler and other conservatives are pushing against strong headwinds, however. survey data show that the number of americans who think divorce is morally acceptable has increased significantly in recent years, while disapproval of homosexuality and same-sex marriage has declined sharply. (click to see changing attitudes on homosexuality and same-sex marriage by religion.) the latter holds true even for white evangelicals, among the groups most resistant to lgbt rights. for church leaders like mohler, the challenge is unmistakable.

still, even though it was on the books, sex-based discrimination initially was viewed as kind of a joke, bagenstos says. it really took a lot of work by social movement actors within the feminist movement to organize and mobilize and bring cases — and bring political pressure — so that by the end of the 1960s, both the [equal employment opportunity commission] and the courts were beginning to recognize the prohibition on sex discrimination was something serious.

sagal: all right, here's your first question, trisha. back in the 15th century, unhappy married couples in germany settled their disputes in an interesting way. how? a, standing in a field for night and day until one member of the couple was struck by lightning, demonstrating god's judgment, b, marital duals - to keep things fair, the husband had to fight while standing in a hole, or c, throwing chickens at each other until one gave in.

minhaj: yeah. yeah. when i was announced, jeff mason went on morning joe, and he said he was not looking for somebody who's going to roast the president in absentia; that's not fair and that's not the message that we want to get across. that was his quote. so, you know, i understand where he was coming from. but the irony to me was the theme of the night was about honoring the first amendment. and you want me to, like, censor myself. that, to me, just - i couldn't do it. i just couldn't find myself do it, especially in - given the fact that the person that i'm roasting, the president, is someone who has so exploited that incredible privilege of free speech. the man who tweets whatever enters his head doesn't even want to honor the amendment that allows him to do it. that to me just blows my mind. so let's hear how you handled it. and this is the section of the white house correspondents' dinner where you're actually making some jokes about president trump.

it's far more carll's style to give wry appraisals of american brokenness than to get riled up about it, just as it's his way to keep his philosophizing mellow. during the honky-tonk boogie times like these, he contrasts feelings of powerlessness with the abuse of power in a burned-out drawl, and shrugs over lost opportunities and future possibilities amid the bluegrass gallop of the title track.
another stupak-pitts collaboration goes back a few years, when they tried to take president bush's pepfar anti-aids - $15 billion anti-aids plan for around the world, and stupak and pitts thought that bush's plan was not conservative enough. so they tried to turn it into a kind of an abstinence crusade overseas, and especially in africa. and i think they actually went too far even for the bush administration.

i didn't grow up with dogs, so when we got one in early 2009 — initially for my son, who was struggling with the loneliness of being an only child --it turned out to be transformative for me. about a year after we got lady, our sheltie, my mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. i spent almost every day with my mother during her illness — bringing food over, taking her to chemo appointments, sitting with her at home while she rested. throughout that sad time, lady was my emotional support system: a therapy dog without the vest. i can't tell you how many times after a long day of watching my mother's illness progress as we braced for her loss that i came home and hugged my dog and wept. in the 11 years since we've had lady, she has saved us all. so even though i never actually wore my dog, i felt like i did.

spencer and other figures on the alt-right often explicitly invoke as their objective a desire to shift the overton window, a wonky concept that until recently was only name-checked by political theorists and media studies types. named for joseph p. overton, the political scientist who first articulated it, it refers to the universe of ideas that are palatable and therefore viable as policy; ideas that lay outside of that window are unthinkable. when the overton window has shifted or expanded or contracted, it has often been the result of sustained political agitation. the most obvious example is the civil rights movement, which was, at its root, a project to fundamentally recast the social norms of the united states. it helped make mainstream once-radioactive ideas like the integration of american public spaces and created powerful new taboos around public expressions of racism.

foy: i think, weirdly, with a camera, it doesn't really want to see what you are doing. it wants to see what you're not doing. so i think these characters lend themselves quite well to that in the sense that you let the audience put themselves in that position - if they had that dilemma, if they were in that moment, what would they be doing or thinking or feeling?

but i think what put people off on sweeney was that it had a semioperatic feeling to it. i think that - i don't think they were put off by the story. although, you know, there are people who don't want to see blood on the stage. but i don't think that's what it was about; i think it was the semioperatic feeling of it. and when people went to - and it's still true - go to a musical, they want songs; they don't want semiopera.

diamond: there's a political story and a policy story behind why trump and christian conservatives are so tightly aligned, both in his campaign and now in the administration. i think the political story is that evangelicals, christian conservatives flocked to trump during the primaries and have largely stayed with him. and there's a persuasive case, that's why he won. about 80 percent of white evangelicals supported trump on election day. evangelicals represented a record number of voters in 2016, more than one-quarter of the electorate.

and i think justice kagan's confirmation is a clear counterexample to that. she was confirmed in the summer of 2010, exactly where we are in comparison to midterm elections, but under president obama. i think the democrats are trying to rewrite history and pretend that the biden standard was something that it's not.

rocca: on a recent wednesday in the british midlands city of birmingham, an ordinary citizen passed by the downtown branch of natwest bank and noticed employees cowering beneath their desks. naturally, the passerby alerted the police. and officers were on the scene in minutes, only to learn that the employees weren't under siege. they were playing hide-and-seek as a team-building exercise.

feldman: my grandmother had 11 children, and they were pretty close in age. my father was the seventh son. and in this community, you marry arranged, and you marry in chronological order. so you would wait for your older siblings to be married off before you would marry someone. and if the siblings are close in age, what often happens is that if one sibling starts to get older, all the other siblings waiting behind him would get older as well. and in this community, getting older is very unattractive on the marriage market. we marry very young. and so at some point when my father was in line to get married, it wasn't going well, and he was already 23 or 24. and they couldn't find a match for him because everyone in the community already knew that he suffered from some mental problems, and nobody wanted to offer up their daughters.

lavalle: it's been great afar. i mean, you don't have to ask me. you've got to ask my kids when they come through. (laughter) they're the ones who actually are the means testers of this system, you know? but what has been nice is - so i didn't see my dad all that many times, but i didn't know who he was. and he was a good man in many ways, but there were certain things that i realize - i spent my younger years wishing i got - wishing that he had been there to give me, you know? and then i got a little bit older and i realized oh, you know what? but if he had been there to give me that, he also would have given me all this bad stuff. and there was a fair bit of - i don't want to say bad stuff - but there was stuff that i'm very happy i avoided, you know, having as an influence on me. and so as a result, i decided to just flip it around and be like ok, since you didn't get any of that and you didn't get someone telling you for generations the men of this household always have done this or whatever the hell people do, right? then i could just sit there and be like ok, i'm not wounded by this anymore.
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross back with jane mayer, a staff writer for the new yorker. her new article is titled the president pence delusion. the premise of the article is many of president trump's critics are hoping he won't serve his full term, but what kind of president would mike pence make? she writes about his political career and how it's been influenced by his faith as an evangelical christian and by billionaire republican funders like the koch brothers. her best-seller, dark money, is about the koch brothers.
gross: if you're just joining us, my guest is amy chozick, and she covers hillary clinton for the new york times. hillary has been very guarded with the press. and you can say that's really understandable because there's been so many conspiracy theories about her, and she's just been the target of so much criticism over so many years and, you know, some of it really legitimate and some of it, you know, just, like, wild conspiracy theories.

boudin: basically, what we did, terry, was we analyzed the entire jail population in numerous different segments or slices. we came up with lists of people who met certain criteria that we wanted to focus on, either identifying for release or finding ways to expedite their release, if possible. so for example, we looked at inmates who were elderly. we looked at inmates who were incarcerated for misdemeanors. we looked at inmates who had been conserved and were simply in jail waiting for placement in an appropriate mental health facility. we looked at veterans. we looked at people who were being held simply because of their inability to pay a low bail amount. we looked at people who had already been sentenced and had an upcoming release date in the next couple of months. we looked at people who were incarcerated just because of a technical violation of probation or parole and so on.

we sometimes put the betrayal of an affair as the hegemony of all betrayals when, in fact, in the relationship there may be other ways that people have fallen short for each other. maturity is not just measured by sexual exclusivity. maturity is measured by a lot of ways that people act, respond, show up, breed trust, are reliable, are predictable, are loving, caring ... in a relationship.

owusu devotes a portion of this memoir to surveying the ruptured histories of the many countries she's connected to, but it's her striking personal story and charged language that makes aftershocks compelling. speaking of her father's death, owusu comes to realize that grief is slow internal bleeding. reflecting on the stories she'd heard about the opposition of her father's family in ghana to his marriage to her white mother, owusu passes on this critical folk adage: any river loses its identity when entering the sea. feeling her breakdown approaching, owusu describes stumbling out of the speeding purgatory of her subway train, running into her apartment and spending seven mostly sleepless days rocking in a ratty blue chair she picked up off the street. there she forces herself to confront questions about her upended, dislocated body and mind. ...[a]bout the geography and geology of my experience — about who i was and how i'd ended up in the blue chair. ...

but then markle herself appeared for the first time, making public a dress that had been treated as a secret only slightly less important than spycraft. and while she had an elaborate veil, with flowers from every country in the commonwealth embroidered on it, her dress was very simple. aggressively simple, even, other than the boat neck. her hair and makeup were simple as well: her hair was in a low bun that was a touch loose, and her makeup was natural-looking enough that it didn't obscure her freckles. even in a tiara, she looked like an american actress might look when marrying anyone — not just a prince. it will be a snap to copy the dress for its look, if not its quality.

i wrote about edmonds' third solo album, for the cool in you, in 1993. i was 28, in a new job as r&b editor of billboard, and my doomed first marriage was choking on childhood wounds. i was freelancing too, stacking chips, and in the new york times review i talk about edmonds as purveyor of dreamy love and even dreamier heartbreak. this mood washed through me like saline and sugar. i noted edmonds' ribbons of emotional detail. i considered his status on the musical landscape. but as with most intimate fanships, mine was born in the relief of feeling understood. singer/songwriter karyn white felt similarly. l.a. and babyface ... really helped shape who karyn white was, she has said. that was their gift, to be able to see what was special in me.
gross: you know, we talked about how your father decided to marry your mother through kind of hearing about her through word of mouth and seeing a picture. so they got married. they moved to the states, but she went right back to india soon after because she was studying medicine and wanted to complete med school there.
reilly: i'm a little bit more optimistic in that we are getting better judges now.
the death toll from the virus was more than 18,000 in new york city as of may 1, according to data compiled by johns hopkins university.
gross: if you're just joining us, my guest is songwriter, singer and guitarist john prine. we'll be back after a short break. this is fresh air.
this interview has been edited for length and clarity.
we're just about ready to reveal npr music's best music of 2019 package, but before we do, the month of november gifted us new albums by fka twigs, michael kiwanuka and mount eerie. it's truly been a great year for music, right up to the final months.
liasson: well, the debate was a real free-for-all. it was a complete brawl, but the most intense exchanges were between jeb bush and donald trump. jeb bush has struggled for months to take on trump without gaining much advantage for himself. but last night, he seems to have finally found his voice. here's one of several of those exchanges where trump was asked by cbs news moderator john dickerson whether he stood by a previous statement he'd made that george w. bush, jeb's brother, should have been impeached because of the iraq war.
sagal: on monday, police said there were three separate package bombs sent to homes in blank that were likely created by the same person.
some people, my mother used to say, look for trouble. in her most personal book to date, katie roiphe — frequently a lightning rod for her inflammatory, unpopular stances on issues such as date rape — probes questions raised by the turbulence in her private and professional life.
rocca: i love this - i love his 16th century spanish king persona from behind the moat at mar-a-lago, dispatching his armada.
sagal: no relation - although she...
the language was broad, the language was sweeping. the language meant to include equal protection for negroes that was at the very heart of it and that equal protection included the right to marry as any other human being had the right to marry subject to only the same limitations.
you could go out and get a job - as many of your listeners probably did -in the postwar period without a high school education. and certainly, you were well-situated with a high school graduation. that's no longer the case.
the students were particularly interested in videos of disale teaching lessons that they had trouble understanding, says disale. it was used not just by kids at home, but also by kids coming to school, too. if they had a doubt or question about what they learned in class, they could revisit disale's recorded lectures.
but it was also, you know, things like the coronavirus, where you watched president trump kind of mishandle all of this stuff. people want some steady leadership, and i think it's becoming apparent that that's joe biden.
idris elba: (as charlie) well, i'm just keeping an eye on her while they settle in. that's it.
protesters are now being led away in plastic handcuffs, after being warned three times to stop blocking the entrance. roughly 25 were arrested by my count.
trump gets his best support among those evangelicals who are most conservative, both politically and theologically. they are the most likely both to be republican and to take the bible as the literal word of god — or jot and tittle, as some used to say.
roberts: but, you know, i - you always wonder, though, at this stage in the year - in the calendar, why would these rules come out? and yes, the president wants to get a lot done before his time is up. but it also might be a political ploy on the part of the administration to try to get young people excited and remind them that the republicans, in many cases, are against transgender people, gay marriage, that kind of thing, just an attempt to keep the obama coalition together going into the election.
vicki: right. and i also think that i heard in the clip leading into this, the idea that children coming home and living at home, that there's no that they become more friends rather than parents and children.
at the same time, though, broadening the ceremony beyond the walls of the chapel to encompass the idea of a broader responsibility for each other provided a vital link to how harry's mother, diana, saw the world and her role as a royal. she was an activist always, and her charitable work often seemed to be the only thing she liked about being a princess; the only part of it that brought her any happiness. while curry offered one link between this very british ceremony and markle's american blackness (a gospel choir offered another), he also offered a link between this obscene world of wealth and a man who was raised by a mother who seems to have desperately wanted him to know more of life than that. so both of their mothers felt especially present in that moment, even if only meghan's was seated nearby.
we went to watch the excitement. village life is otherwise boring, says zhang ruqing, who worked at a nearby gas station at the time. (many residents of the area have the family name zhang and are loosely related through generations of marriage, a common occurrence in china's countryside.)
powers says she is troubled by the allegations that moore molested and sexually assaulted teen girls decades ago. she already had reservations about moore's record.
minhaj: i'm a muslim. and if donald trump is elected, he's probably going to throw me out.
brown's admission prompted this statement from the nfl on thursday: in light of the release of these documents we will thoroughly review the additional information and determine next steps in the context of the nfl personal conduct policy.
the briefings and his performance are getting rave reviews, according to campbell. both from people within his party, [and] even republicans.
and when you're ill, specifically with an eating disorder, you lose connection with your own instincts and your own sense of hunger, your own sense of the right behavior and the wrong behavior. and you trust everyone around you. and there's something really - i wasn't raised religious, but the thing about religion that really attracts me is someone with all the answers. and there's such a comfort in that. it's interesting. when you have an eating disorder, you have a voice in your head that's speaking nonsense.
tonight's results are clear — the people of alabama deemed roy moore unfit to serve in the u.s. senate, gardner said in a statement soon after jones was declared the winner. i hope senator-elect doug jones will do the right thing and truly represent alabama by choosing to vote with the senate republican majority.
today, we get some hard-won advice from a dad - a pretty tough dad, a former professional player and later broadcaster, rodney peete. now in his years of professional football, peete has taken his - rodney peete has taken his fair share of shots on the field.
albritton says he's a traditionalist who believes marriage should be between one man and one woman. but he says since the u.s. supreme court legalized same-sex marriage, alabama's system hasn't worked.
dan diamond, welcome to fresh air. so would it be an overstatement to say that most of the leadership of health and human services now is people who were leaders of the anti-abortion movement or the anti-lgbtq movement?
a meteorologist goes up against alabama's deadly tornadoes, as npr's invisibilia explores our relationship with uncertainty.
ruth negga, star of tv's preacher, continues to show her range in her subtle, quiet portrayal of mildred. it's a performance that's matched perfectly by joel edgerton, whose richard is a muted man whose lack of words doesn't represent the magnitude of his emotions. they are the silence, while the rest of the world roars.
martin: right. anything else stand out to you? i mean, this has been getting a whole lot of hype, this book.
in some ways, kapor klein wants young people who grew up poor to channel silicon valley's sense of entitlement — the idea that it's ok to fail; that failure is necessary; and that one deserves support anyway. she herself doesn't come from money. she grew up on a u.s. air force base in biloxi, miss., and one of her earliest memories was seeing, at age 3, her 7-year-old brother bloodied, beaten for being a jew. she knew then the world isn't fair.
in 1979, as now, the country was gearing up for a presidential election that would shape the next decade of american life. ronald reagan, the republican vying for the presidential nomination, was trying to stitch together a coalition made up of religious conservatives and opponents of the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. (reagan, who had been a critic of the voting rights act of 1964 because he thought it was unfair to the south, dogwhistled to anti-integrationists by stumping for states rights in mississippi not far from where three voting rights activists had been killed the decade prior.) but after he won the white house, his administration would grant blanket legalization to millions of people living in america without legal documentation.
janes: i never, ever thought that that day would ever come where the only option for peace in that country would be to re-invite a regime of sorts to come in and run the country again. but, you know, if the u.s. pulls out, i mean, what other choice does afghanistan have?
this isn't just any misbegotten magical mystery tour that barry is taking; this is a cross-country bus ride set during the summer of 2016. trump and his vision of america are implicitly interrogated at every pit stop along the way.
the music of tchaikovsky — perhaps inevitably — brings philip and elizabeth home to russia, where they have apparently decided to stay together, despite the fact that their marriage was originally a sham. they wind up standing side by side in the dark, looking out over what was once home and does not feel like home anymore. they speak of alternate lives in which they might have met under other circumstances. they worry about their children but conclude that they're old enough to get on without their parents. philip says, in english, that it's strange. elizabeth replies, in russian, we'll get used to it.
gross: i love your take on this. you know, a lot of people say that there was - like, one advantage of segregation for black people was that in a neighborhood you'd have people of lesser means and people who are middle-class and people who are very prosperous. you had a professional class there, black doctors, black teachers. they lived in the same neighborhood.
sagal: falls church - that's one of those rustic places that's now, like, a suburb, right?
bianculli: this is from the simpsons.
the news conference was the latest attempt by moore's campaign to stay viable given the mounting accusations against him and increasing loss of support from key figures in the gop. it focused only on the allegation by nelson and did not address the other allegations against moore by other women, including leigh corfman, who claims he initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14.
what was the process like? how did the song get built from there?
some figures stood for something larger. washington guided the foundation of a country that eventually preserved freedom for all. jefferson authored the declaration of independence, in which a single phrase — that all men are created equal — became a hammer that later generations would use to help smash the chains of slavery.
if khashoggi is found to have been murdered, the potential for fallout is high, as npr's sasha ingber reported on thursday:
gross: desiree akhavan, emily danforth, welcome to fresh air. emily, since you wrote the novel that the movie is based on, let me start with you. why did you want to write about gay conversion centers in the early '90s?
hader: and he (laughter) - he's like, do - you know, do another take, man (laughter).
bianculli: that's lotte lenya from the original cast recording of cabaret. our guest, john kander, wrote the music. his longtime late collaborative partner wrote the lyrics. we'll continue our celebration of john kander's 90th birthday after a short break. this is fresh air.
gross: so what are some of the cases that will be coming before the supreme court in the early days of neil gorsuch being on the bench?
gross: oh, dogs. oh, the dogs.

in later years, she was drawn to serious, often searing roles: the mother who has lost a child in the 1980 film, ordinary people; and the paralyzed sculptor in the broadway production of whose life is it anyway? and she was outstanding.
when a juvenile offender commits a heinous crime, the state can exact forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties, kennedy wrote in the majority opinion, but the state cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity.
the stakes here high. alzheimer's forced bella to give up her career. her life is smaller, focused on home, on her husband, on their pets. she says for now it's enough. it feels like normal life. what's happening to me is happening slowly enough that i can't see it, she says.
conan: we're talking about what happens in families as adolescence extends and adulthood, the road, grows longer. you're listening talk of the nation from npr news.
most of these cases will always be invisible, says barr. covered up and reported as suicides or disappearances.
two of the parody set pieces are so brilliant that they hold their own against what's being parodied. channing tatum, in a group of hoofing sailors, do a full-blown production number set in a bar that made me wish the coens would drop what passes for their storyline and turn the film into a musical. they could teach a lot of modern directors how to stage, shoot and edit dance. the other showstopper is a kaleidoscopic water ballet in which scarlett johansson, as an esther williams type, plays a mermaid. her character, as mouthy and blunt as her mermaid is ethereal, turns out to be pregnant, and brolin's mannix wants her hitched.
yvette montoya: the process needs to be streamlined, and it needs to apply equally across the board.
scoot mcnairy: (as maurice lefay) what are we talking about?
gross: it must've been kind of confusing for you as a kid to be raised in a stable family, to have a grandfather who was a famous civil liberties lawyer, but to be stigmatized by a lot of people who you grew up with because your parents were in prison. at the same time, when you'd visit your parents in prison, you felt very privileged by comparison. so you were kind of different in either world, in both of those worlds.
travelers arriving from states with a positivity rate of 5% or higher over a 7-day rolling average, or a positive test rate greater than 80 per 1 million residents, must quarantine for 14 days or the duration of their stay, whichever is shorter. health officials recommend rather than require quarantining for people coming from lower-risk states, and advise they be tested for covid-19 within 5-7 days of their arrival. more information about travel requirements and high-risk states is here.
for quindlen, this apparently has been a difficult adjustment, and she reveals a surprising degree of insecurity in her new position. maybe this is why so much of being a grandparent feels like auditioning, she writes, adding, there are really only two commandments in nanaville: love the grandchildren, and hold your tongue.
president trump appeared to defend two recently resigned members of his staff accused of domestic abuse on saturday, arguing in a tweet for due process and saying that people's lives are being destroyed by a mere allegation.
davies: yeah, resigning from a foreign capital is pretty bizarre. what do we now know about what happened to hariri when he went to riyadh?
yet burshtein also unfolds a darker, more introspective undertow to michal's growing despair of ever finding her beshert. the versatile koler, who won an israeli academy award for her performance, does full justice to michal's inner conflicts and self-doubt. she's wry and ironic and an astute judge of character, but she's also generous and forgiving to a roommate who betrays her. honest to a fault, unwilling to play games and brave enough to face disappointment rather than make do, koler's michal seems to model herself on pride and prejudice's elizabeth bennet in all her incarnations. burshtein creates a productive tension, by turns riotous and sad, between michal's impatience with the banal rituals of courtship and her longing for true love and companionship.

hawley: but jeffrey was interesting because, you know, he's from massachusetts. and the way they form their vowel sounds is completely opposite. and he had to train himself to do the minnesota accent by literally holding his jaw in place. and it created this physicality in that role of dodd, where he literally became this stiff person. he walks with a stiff-legged gait. and he has this very stiff physicality to him that came from trying to do the accent, which i thought was really interesting. and then the next thing he did was he went to play jfk for rob reiner. and he butchered his own massachusetts accent because he was still doing minnesota.
kurtis: tyler norton of columbus, ohio.

davies: david edelstein is film critic for new york magazine. on tomorrow's show...
bianculli: and it's on the simpsons, which started in 1989, and so it's weathered all this and survived longer than just about any broadcast tv show.
but instead what happened was he nearly killed his own career there by signing this legislation you're talking about, the religious freedom restoration act. and what it was was it was presented as a bill that would protect religious freedom, which sounds like a great thing, but when in the fine print what it meant in practice was that people who felt for religious reasons that homosexuality offended them would be able to bar homosexuals from their businesses if they wanted to.
diamond: that's true. that's true. i mean, and great technology is my iphone as i was staring at it while also...
inskeep: if we extended the principles of your compromise, your utah compromise, to this new issue - or, new to many people, issue of where to go to the bathroom, how would the principle apply, do you think?
if it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, i would absolutely, i would be honored to do it. if it's under the, again, under the right circumstances. but i would do that. ... most political people would never say that, but i'm telling you under the right circumstances i would meet with him. we have breaking news.

gross: how old were you when that happened?
for years, stories about boomerang kids and extended adolescence have been percolating. these days, more and more new college graduates can't find jobs and must rely on mom and dad. and the new health care law seems to institutionalize the trend — parents can cover their kids until age 26.
davies: the other thing that you note in the book was that the regime became very sophisticated at monitoring citizens through hacking cellphones, you know, electronic monitoring, through pressure through social media. you want to just give us a little bit of a taste of that?
if [jones] were pro-life, if he hadn't talked about it, he'd be ahead, buchanan said. if jones were pro-life, he'd be up 10 points.
pohlman still takes quiet moments to reflect on her family's loss. i still think about our baby every day. i would be about six months pregnant now if it hadn't happened, she says. we would be planning a baby shower even if it had to be over zoom, we would be getting all the new little baby clothes and washing them and folding them and just getting ready. but we're not, because there's nothing to get ready for.
briger: have everyone in your real family - cousins and stuff - always appreciated you making up family?

and, you know, i can't answer that question. and - but i think that's really what we should keep an eye on going forward, is how much is he learning from these mistakes? and is there a chance that, you know, he's going to grow into sort of a wiser, more circumspect ruler who's going to think a little bit more before he does these kinds of rash activities?
bill kurtis: from npr and wbez chicago, this is wait wait... don't tell me, the npr news quiz. i'm bill kurtis. we're playing this week with maeve higgins, tom bodett and helen hong. and here again is your host at the chase bank auditorium in downtown chicago, peter sagal.
martin: well, what was the then-existing literature on the topic, and how did what you find out differ from - from that, from what was believed or assumed?
america is already great, president obama said. america is already strong. and i promise you, our strength, our greatness does not depend on donald trump.
ehle: (as dr. lydia marsh) you should think of yourself as a christian.
that friend passed away in 2005. by then, burials in the cemetery had already been a problem for about a decade.
simon: mayor pete buttigieg, democratic candidate for president. and we should note that the new york times reports that information came from an internal buttigieg campaign memo on focus groups it held with two dozen uncommitted black voters. you can hear more of our conversation elsewhere in the show. and you can watch online at npr.org/offscript.
in response to the news that the cases are heading to the newly conservative-leaning supreme court, the human rights campaign called on congress to explicitly add protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity by approving the equality act, which was reintroduced in the house last month.
gross: this is fresh air. my guest is desiree akhavan, the director and co-writer of the new film the miseducation of cameron post. it's set in the early '90s at a christian gay conversion center for teenagers. akhavan's first feature was called appropriate behavior. she starred as a woman who, like akhavan, is the daughter of iranian immigrants and is bisexual.
gross: i want to ask you about the dnc hack, which led to debbie wasserman schultz's downfall, and there's a lot of embarrassing things coming out, not to mention private information about donors that's been leaked. what private information has been leaked?
mrs. otto's daughter, betty phillip, sat in a corner. they put her mother to rest on high ground, she said, but not all of her family in kong is so lucky.
but actually changing the system could be remarkably difficult for a political system that's already near paralysis. some lawyers said the change could be made by lawmakers, but others have concluded it would require amending the constitution. to do that, the house and senate would need to vote their support, and then three-quarters of the states would have to approve. another path would be for two-thirds of the states to call for a constitutional convention.

that said, quindlen's wonder at seeing her eldest child grow into his new role is lovely and moving. she reflects, too, on having a half-chinese grandchild, and the growing prevalence of multiracial and multiethnic births in the u.s. where i grew up, a mixed marriage was between a catholic and a lutheran who had, naturally, converted, she quips, in writing about her two daughters-in-law, one chinese, the other part black.
even before official results were announced, khan reached out to pakistanis, promising them to run the country as it has never before been run. he vowed to fight corruption and alleviate poverty. on foreign policy, he has called for peace with india; praised china, pakistan's closest ally; and criticized the united states, arguing that pakistan has been waging war on behalf of washington.

by the way, there's also no state in the country where anywhere near a majority supports deportation. even the reddest states that went for trump by a landslide, there are still majorities there preferring one of these two legalizing options for immigrants in the country illegally.

o'doherty naranjo: oh, thanks for having me.
there are no statewide business restrictions. businesses and individuals are encouraged to follow cdc guidelines, and state health officials have released guidance about the risks of certain social activities.

['the liar's dictionary'] showcases a delight in language that evokes both nabokov and — more on point with its mix of playfulness, profundity, warmth, and heart — ali smith.
not a day goes by that i don't want to be there, she said. not to see him, how they found him, to not know what was going on, not to have news of him — it's been days of anxiety, powerlessness and pain.
gross: but it wasn't that easy. the sponsors were afraid you'd look brazen.
a statewide mask mandate took effect in may, and requires individuals to wear face coverings in public, including while exercising, except for when drinking, eating or under medical instruction.
b harper: yeah, it was just always on the plate. it was always out in front of you. it was always - there was a couple of us, and we were friends. you know, from the whispers to the screams, i mean, it was always around the corner. it was always in front of us - what it meant and that we stood out in our own way. you know, nobody else used an afro pick. just nobody else looked like us in the neighborhood. but that - it was ok. my brothers and i had each other. and like my mom said, the neighborhood was insulated enough to where kids don't know any better until a certain age anyway.
hempel has a fascination — almost an affection — for desperate characters, although she takes them as they are, refusing to exploit their pain. the narrator of greed doesn't hide her desperation; she's livid that her husband is having an affair with a much older woman and refuses to stop seeing her: she was not the first. she was the first he would not give up.
if caila quinn is cast as the first bachelorette of color, producers will probably continue to omit thornier realities. her casting could represent some form of progress, though, if producers continue to highlight her filipina heritage, however awkwardly. portraying an asian-american woman as the ultimate marriage material — and not as a sexualized joke — could signal a step toward better humanizing people of color in this space. but it also could be just another spin on the model minority myth.
what do i love about this book? for starters: dorothy parker. rebecca west. hannah arendt. mary mccarthy. nora ephron. janet malcolm. with sharp, michelle dean has essentially gathered ten 20th century literary lodestars for an all-female intellectual history party thrown between the covers of a single book. the price of admission to this critical gala: the ability to write unforgettably, and being labeled sharp.
etaf rum's new novel, a woman is no man, may violate a code of silence in the tight-knit and often closed palestinian american community of brooklyn in which she grew up, and which she left.
the nrsc and the republican national committee have severed financial ties with moore, who continues to deny the allegations. moore faces democrat doug jones in the dec. 12 special election to succeed now-attorney general jeff sessions. mcconnell and trump both backed appointed sen. luther strange over moore in the gop primary.

and like most people probably listening to this, jake and julia are capable of living with those paradoxes. they're sustainable. they don't cause massive destruction or pain most of the time. but then there are these crises moments that compel them to make a choice - one identity at the expense of the other identity.
sagal: charlie bolden, thank you so much for being with us.
gross: so does this mean you have to move?
faith groups are deeply split over the proposal. despite large majorities of the u.s. population favoring expanded lgbtq rights, many faith groups still hold conservative ideas about marriage and sexuality and fear the equality act would punish them for adhering to those beliefs. mainline protestant denominations and other progressive faith groups have lined up in support of the legislation.
1. cohen and hirschkop asked the court to look closely at whether the virginia law violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. if the framers had intended to exclude anti-miscegenation status in the 14th amendment, which assures equal protection under the law, they argued that it would have been easy for them to write a phrase excluding interracial marriage, but they didn't cohen argued:

some people thought my work reinforced the negative stereotype of women being obsessed with shopping, weight and love, she writes. but it wasn't my fault we still live in a world that partly judges women by what we wear, how much we weigh, and whether or not and who or how we love. not my fault that with every glorious new possibility for women came an extra sense of isolation when we not only couldn't keep up but were told we shouldn't talk about the things that held us back.
gross: you know where i'm going. and at that event, i learned something i never knew about you. and we've been working together a very long time.
gross: it's a good thing (laughter).
lawyers had helped to shield epstein, silver-greenberg says, creating a financial model in which they could secure big payouts for accusers and fees for themselves from the prominent men their clients accused — but let those men keep their actions secret.
shalhoub: (as primo) ok, this is done. now, taste. taste.

i think i bawled, koop said. the couple panicked as they tried to sort out if one should go to the other to get across the border before it closed.
he did not think it was his job to criticize other traditions within christianity, or outside christianity for that matter, wacker said. he insisted that his sole job was to proclaim the gospel.
hubbard: oh, this was very real. and to be frank, i wasn't even sure about it at the time. i remember - i was not in saudi arabia when it happened. it was done somewhat unceremoniously. the government just basically made an announcement and said that, you know, the religious police no longer had the power to arrest and that they were supposed to be sort of kind in their interactions with saudi citizens. and i remember sort of seeing this and saying, i don't know. like, is this for real? is this not for real? is this just sort of a pr thing? and it was very difficult to tell. i ended up sort of messaging a bunch of my saudi friends and saying, what do you think? and they just kind of said, we have no idea, either; we'll just kind of have to wait and see.
blight: it's an amazing meeting. thomas auld, douglass believed, was on his deathbed. he turned out not to die for roughly another year. but he went back to st. michael's on the eastern shore - the very town in which auld had held him as a teenage slave and beaten him, by the way, and then rented him out to other, you know, slaveholders at times as a field hand.
wendle: making decisions, of course, isn't a bad thing. but in multiple experiments, researchers found that when we're exposed to an uncertainty that is threatening, like a global pandemic, our discomfort with it starts to grow until we're desperate to end it, which can cause us to jump to conclusions, sometimes in parts of our lives that have literally nothing to do with the uncertainty overwhelming us. as holmes explains, researchers looking at marriage rates after an earthquake or a hurricane saw them go up, as people were eager to nail down their relationships.
bianculli: this is fresh air. i'm david bianculli in for terry gross. today we're listening back to conversations with film director milos forman, who died a week ago at the age of 86. terry spoke with him a second time in 1996 about his film, the people vs. larry flynt, starring woody harrelson as the publisher of hustler magazine. the film follows flynt's rise from small-time strip joint owner to pornography mogul. it also follows flynt in and out of court as he uses the first amendment to defend himself against obscenity charges. during one of his obscenity trials, he was shot outside the courthouse, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.
greene: i'm good. i wish i were still there. i feel jealous you're still - we were just having lunch in park city a couple days ago, and now i'm back to work in la. you're at work, too, watching movies. so where should we start?
robert jones: so a 13-point jump just over the last eight years, and that's pretty remarkable. there's not very many public opinion issues where we can see that kind of change in that short amount of time.
coordinated efforts to change child marriage laws were already underway when the #metoo movement took hold — arguably changing the cultural and political landscape for issues of importance to women. for her part, smoot is heartened by what she describes as a quickening in the degree of awareness among those in a position to effect change.
cicilline, who largely drafted the equality act, says existing civil rights law already includes religious exemptions. institutions with a proven commitment to their beliefs, he says, may not have to worry whether policies in accord with those beliefs would threaten their funding.
very personally, marjane satrapi's work, persepolis, the graphic novel and the books, really touched me. and i went to see that in the cinema with my mom when it first came out. and it was the first time we saw an iranian woman tell a story that was personal and not braggy. i mean, she's homeless for a while in that story. and it really touched my life. and i think it made my mother see that there was a future for me...

meanwhile, daigle came out to her catholic parents when she was 19; they were not accepting. she did not go home for five years. she married a man and her family welcomed her back. i felt love and i felt companionship, but that feeling that i had for you — that crazy, chaotic excitement — i just didn't feel that, daigle tells barnez.

stormy 'weather' captures our anxious age with bracing wit
anti-fgm activists say lockdowns and school closures during the pandemic left many girls at home, vulnerable to genital cutting in communities that see the practice as a prerequisite for marriage and, in some places, as a rite of passage. girls who have not been cut might be shunned by the community or considered not fit for marriage.

in april 2015, during a supreme court argument over the constitutional rights of lgbt individuals, justice samuel alito noted that bob jones university in south carolina had lost its tax-exempt status because of its prohibition on interracial dating and marriage.
and so they're saying, you know, at first glimpse, as the clinton campaign analyzed how trump took down his rivals, they said, well, this doesn't work as well on women, you know, as it did on men. and so i think they saw that. but one of the interesting kind of surprising things that emerged is the best person to take on donald trump has been elizabeth warren. she seems to really get under his skin.
hawley: i think so. it was interesting, you know, because he and mary winstead who plays nikki, you know, ray and nikki are - she's his parolee, and he's the parole officer. and they have this sort of storied love affair based on probably just breaking every law there is to break. and they both loved this relationship so much. i think it was such a unique cinematic relationship for both of them that if you asked him to choose which role he liked being better, i think he just liked that feeling of being in that relationship because the two of them, you know - they were just together through thick and thin. and they had this innocence to them, even though they had a criminality as well which was really fun.
legend: we just didn't actively praise him. just think how needy you have to be to watch msnbc on a sunday night. and so he was mad that we didn't talk about him and we didn't actively praise him because he thinks...

it wasn't long before dobson walked his comments back, issuing a statement saying that only the lord knows the condition of a person's heart, and adding that he'd heard televangelist paula white personally led [trump] to christ. that generally involves saying a prayer of repentance from sin and accepting jesus christ as one's savior from eternal damnation.
minhaj: yeah, but just in the face of a heart attack, i mean...
lyrically blue communicates both the cool of joan didion and the rawness of sylvia plath, and reminds us that emotional writing is only powerful when it is punishingly precise. the way mitchell made the album was also revolutionary: she produced the sessions herself, directing a small band that included rival/peers like james taylor (one of several lovers honored and exposed by her observations) and stephen stills. mitchell would travel much farther on the lonely road she identifies in all i want, but blue is her crossroads, where she bests her devils and invents a mode of expression that every singer-songwriter must master, but none can truly imitate. —ann powers (npr music)
millies: a lot of those catholic leaders that we see in government are people of joe biden's age or very near to it. nancy pelosi is a little bit older than joe biden. i think most of those members of congress are in their 60s, 70s and 80s. what we're seeing is a sort of a last bloom of that catholic moment that we had in the midcentury that grew up to maturity in the '70s and '80s and '90s. i'd hope this could be an opportunity for renaissance. but the distance between the roman catholic church and public life in the united states is something we're watching grow right now rather than shrink. there are troubling signs.
for judy, that meant wearing her dog. after surviving so much loss, giving up the dog seemed to me to be too much to ask of her. why should she have to give it up in order to prove that she was better? can't we all admit that life is hard and there are times we are especially needy? i have no doubt that eventually judy will wear the dog less. but not right now. right now, she still needs the dog, and right now that is just fine with her. which is what i love most about judy: she just doesn't care what anyone thinks.
because of her efforts on a national scale this became a national conversation in a way that it hadn't necessarily been, said emily johnson, a historian at ball state university in indiana. her book, this is our message, profiles female leaders in the modern religious right.
you know a friendship is over when you're talking more about somebody than to them, and you know a marriage is really in trouble when your partner isn't the person with whom you have the deepest, most intimate conversations. you are in a relationship with this guy that occupies the emotional energy and attention that should be going toward him healing his relationship with his wife, which is what he says he wants to do. my hunch is that your hunch is that you need to step back from this friendship until he figures out whether his marriage is going to be healable or not.
hader: but i was so focused on, you know, fuches and cousineau and, you know, sally and her agent and all these other things that i wasn't even thinking about it. and then we were like, well, what if he got an audition? and then we kind of added that in at the eleventh hour, that whole storyline. and - but yeah, i - i'm the same way as an actor, too. i kind of, like go, is everybody happy with that? ok, we can move on. you know, i'm not precious. i'm weirdly - i like very few - in the edit, i like fewer choices. i kind of like having to be forced to make a decision as opposed to, you know, when i was in my early 20s, these idea - i thought was so romantic that stanley kubrick would shoot 150 takes.

dave itzkoff, welcome to fresh air. i want to talk with you about what it was like to talk with robin williams. and before i hear what your experience was like, i want to share with you a bit of mine. i spoke with him in august of 2006. and i didn't know what to expect. i was afraid he would just be on the whole time. and he would just be jumping from one character to another. and he wouldn't answer any of my questions. and he was in a relatively reflective mood. and he spent some time actually just, like, talking about himself and other times, you know, like, doing characters and making jokes, which were funny and very enjoyable. so i want to play you how the interview ended.
yearwood: yes. it is a compilation of everything you could possibly eat for breakfast, including - so he layers a bottom with, like, some sort of potato. his preference is a tater tot - and an eggs and cheese and sausage and bacon. but he also then puts tortellini in it which - he puts tortellini in everything. i don't understand this. it's his solution to everything.

'hourglass' exposes the fissures that develop in a long-term marriage: dani shapiro's new memoir dramatizes the dizzying ways a lifetime passes, loops around, speeds up and sometimes seems to stand still. critic maureen corrigan calls it an incisive and charged work.

destroy work and, in the end, working-class life cannot survive. it is the loss of meaning, of dignity, of pride, and of self-respect that comes with the loss of marriage and of community that brings on despair, not just or even primarily the loss of money.
one of the songs the two nashville-based singer-songwriters wrote and recorded together under the name the reckless electric was a droll, punkish ode to feminine striving called straight a girls. the message behind it, bragg says, is that it's cool and attractive to be nerdy and work really hard on something you love.

napoli: yeah. that's a problem, isn't it? ray was trouncing around the midwest selling franchises. and he walked into the criterion restaurant in st. paul, which was a very elegant place. and in the center of the restaurant was a beautiful, blond woman - 26 years younger - and she was playing the organ. she was hired to entertain the diners. and ray walked in hoping to sell a franchise to the owner of the restaurant and instead was sidetracked by this beautiful woman. he was a pianist himself, so he was fascinated by her musical proficiency as well as her good looks.

devi: (through interpreter) he might see this news of men in the cities being held to account. but he's still a powerful man in my village. he's turned people against me. i've been ostracized by my community because i spoke up.
but i do think that what is going on with europe and our relationships with europe are part of the very - you know, are really a big part of the problem in terms of a lack of understanding about america's role. and then one other part i think that is really part of this story is that what trump is doing is making america seem like a victim. everything is somebody else's fault. countries are taking advantage of us. the mexicans are sending drug dealers. countries are not paying their dues. the trading system is unfair. and by making americans seem like victims all the time, it then is able to, again, make the divisions stronger in terms of who's with us, who's not with us, and it's totally anti-american foreign policy. and so i think it's very, very worrisome in terms of this victimhood. i don't see america as a victim. i see america as the most powerful country in the world that has a role to play standing up for democratic ideals and human rights across the board.
it's a contrast to president trump, who has given messages that have differed from those of health officials and made false claims during the white house's daily press briefings.

akhavan: i think there's something really beautiful in that. your sexual instincts are being kind of beaten out of you with a twisted version of the bible. but at the same time, you're connecting to people who are like you. and you're no longer isolated because you imagine these people who end up in therapy centers aren't able to connect to openly queer kids around them.

but what an awful lot of people said to me when i was interviewing them in indiana was, pence had nowhere else to go. it was very likely he would not have been re-elected as governor of indiana. he was kind of - his back was against the wall, and this was a rescue plan for him. i mean, this was a way up and out, and there weren't really any others. so this was a kind of a - pretty soon, people in indiana began to hear that pence would like to be picked. he was in the midst of running for re-election as governor, but he was eager to link up with trump.
opposing church closures becomes new religious freedom cause
multi-instrumentalist alabaster deplume's debut release for chicago label international anthem proved to be an entrancing, soothing antidote to the turmoil of 2020. pairing his tentative alto saxophone playing style with down-tempo, incantatory melody, deplume created a balladic suite of soft intimacy, moving from the plaintive entreaties of why, buzzardman, why to the deep swing of whisky story time. a deceptively simple collection of engaging mood music. –ammar kalia
and the 1999 production never made it to broadway. you were revamping the production when fred ebb died in 2004. the song is called he always comes home to me, and i think this is, like, a married woman singing to her maid. and the married woman knows that her maid has probably had an affair with her husband. do i have that right? i've never seen the show.

those lessons from the social movement – the lgbtq rights movement – haven't changed and most americans' views on this have not changed [since trump's election], kreis says. that's what makes the trump administration's about-face so hard for so many people to swallow.

sagal: there's nothing on b-9, trust me.
o'doherty naranjo: really basic. in the beginning, the first requests were all to ask for people to check in on them. and then over time, the requests were really simple - midnight call for a thermometer 'cause someone thought they were coming down who had a lot of breathing issues, calls to deliver food. a mother who was sick who had five kids, including two 5-month-old twins, wanted food delivered for dinner. we did a special run to do passover seder shopping for a group of elderly jewish people who were really worried that they'd miss a seder meal.
adams has also noted that minorities are not more predisposed to infection biologically or genetically, but rather they are socially predisposed to it.
davis: exactly. with - the other thing that i loved about it was that it's measured by points. and i had spent so much time in a field where you're measured by people's judgment, you know, where, you know, you're approved of by others' opinions rather than factual merit. and so that was really fun.
back at james madison university, travis rieder explains a powerpoint graph that seems to offer hope. bringing down global fertility by just half a child per woman could be the thing that saves us, he says.
kelly: elevating your enemies - this prompts me to ask about another thing that president trump's been talking about, which is senator john mccain - the late senator john mccain, who he has taken to insulting again.
it's funny — the whole time i was writing the book i kept assuming that by the end of the novel judy would naturally stop wearing the dog. she would have to, right?! it would be the necessary and obvious proof of growth and change: giving up the crutch would show she was better. but that's not what happened. one of the threads that made it all the way through to the end of the book for me was how we all need to follow our own particular path from hopelessness to hope; how we each have to find a source of comfort and hang on to it for dear life.

legend: ...that i could speak to executives, that i could hire the right people and that - i just had a kind of an elevated standard of the type of people i wanted to work with as well. and i think the biggest thing i got from working at bcg was just kind of an understanding of the standards that i was looking for when it came to the professionals that i surrounded myself with. but i don't think i think about my music as a consultant.
bw: i've always had a great appreciation for really fun pop music. one of my favorite songs ever is britney spears' toxic. i think that's a great song, and i think that if i wrote that song, i would be so proud. it doesn't have any emotional heft, but the melody is brilliant. it's catchy as hell. i've always thought i would love to write stuff like that if i was confident at it. unfortunately, i'm not that good at that. but mary's quite good at writing catchy melodies — better than i am. the first couple songs we wrote were fun, but they weren't really silly. and then we wrote ice cream and liquor. the first time we played it for anyone, people loved it so much we were like, maybe it's ok to just be silly. it's way more fun for us, and people seem to get it. ... so we just kinda gave ourselves permission to do it.
milos forman: my parents built a very small 50-room panzio - or little hotel, if you want - in the former sudetenland, which was the part of czechoslovakia which was taken over by the nazis first - by the germans first. and as a kind of foreman on the building of this panzio in 1920-something, i was not even born, was a german citizen there who - and i know that my parents were very fair people and they treated him fairly.

so that's sort of where that idea of sidekicks becoming self-aware came from. there's this trope: when you have a rom-com, you need confidants, you know. it goes back to shakespeare and probably before that. juliet has her nurse. you need someone who is working behind the scenes as a sounding board and giving advice and making liaisons happen. it's just kind of built in to the form.

president trump, who backed strange in the primary, ignored questions from reporters about moore after giving a statement on his recent trip to asia on wednesday. asked saturday while in vietnam about the allegations against moore, trump said he hadn't paid much attention to the news and have to look at it and i'd have to see. white house press secretary sarah sanders said last week that the president believes that if these allegations are true, judge moore will do the right thing and step aside.

turkle: i think it harmed me. but i think that the trace that i'm most aware of is what i call hyper-vigilance, that in this whole story, i think i'm very attuned to small changes in my environment. i notice things. i think it's something i've used in my work that's been helpful. but i think it's also a great liability. it means that it's very hard to just relax. and i think that's been a struggle. you know, these are memories that i've never been able - i wasn't aware of these experiments until he told me about them. it wasn't as though i had an aha moment in my analyses where i remembered them. but when i put the experiences that i've later learned about together with what i know of myself, i talk about this hyper-vigilance as a trace that i believe that i can trace through my life.

religious freedom is almost nonexistent — christians are routinely discriminated against; churches are limited and speaking out against islam, even isis, can land you in prison. four christian children, in fact, were sentenced to five years in prison for putting up a video that mocked isis. ... the government has undertaken some perfunctory steps to curb violence against women, but human rights watch says, sexual harassment and violence against women remained endemic. the new interior minister, a woman, has put the onus on women, telling them to avoid speaking loudly and to be cautious about how they dress. women are also routinely discriminated against in family law cases. ...

across the globe, bringing an end to open defecation remains a public health puzzle. about 600 million people in india alone defecate outside, and the practice persists in much of the developing world. today, about 30 percent of nepali homes don't have toilets — and here a toilet doesn't mean your standard porcelain bowl. it often means an outdoor squat latrine, with some type of cover to keep flies out. millions still relieve themselves in fields or other places outside.
curtis: so you have to give the parents something. so, for instance, i did a book called where do balloons go? an uplifting mystery...
to illustrate this idea, anderson from heritage uses the example of how caitlyn jenner, a celebrity who is transgender, might experience sex discrimination in applying for a job: someone could say, i think you're really a man and therefore i'm not going to hire you because only women can do this sort of work, or i think you're a woman and i won't hire you because only men can do this sort of work.

montagne: the education department, the justice department warned the states not to discriminate against transgender students or risk losing federal education funds. you're in south carolina today, where there does not seem to be much appetite for a political fight over this issue. but there's plenty in other states like north carolina and texas. do you think this will become a rallying point for either party in the election?
chozick: (laughter) well, this is one of the most intriguing subplots of the convention i think. and i - and certainly they're - the clinton campaign would like, and democrats would like, to sort of push the narrative that this is putin interfering in a u.s. election. i mean, hillary clinton clashed with putin when she was secretary of state. they have a history there. and donald trump has praised him. and so there's almost this kind of whispers of is donald trump some manchurian candidate for, you know, the russians? but certainly there is - you know, there are reports that russia was behind the hack.

but they also piggyback on your friends so that you have the impression that your friends are recommending or liking other products. and i think that's been really the key, the idea of trying to harness social capital for selling purposes. that we've let this happen so easily without clearly getting something in exchange is kind of amazing to me. you know, google - and some of the other sites, youtube and, you know - google has an amazing search engine. the map product is incredible. so there's a sort of exchange when you put up with a bunch of ads. facebook basically gives you access to your friends who, in theory, you had access to already. so sometimes i don't really understand the deal, but i guess it makes it slightly easier. so that's their contribution.

as her mother helps her prepare for the wedding (assistance that evie doesn't necessarily want), evie reflects on her childhood on winter island, off the southern california coast, where her father worked a series of odd jobs — many involving the sale of winter wonderland, a strain of weed that her dad has made into the stuff of pothead legend. sometimes we had money; sometimes we didn't, evie explains. sometimes there were storms, and sometimes sunburns. we lived on fake money, famous money, and drug money, and always, it was just enough to never leave the island.

the president had come to moore's defense, casting doubt on the women's allegations — much as he has done with the multiple women who have accused him of sexual assault. while trump didn't campaign with moore, he did hold a rally just across the border from alabama in pensacola, fla., on friday evening and recorded a robocall on his behalf, urging voters to choose moore because he would support his agenda in the senate. and after trump reaffirmed his endorsement for moore last week, the republican national committee reinstated its financial support for the gop nominee after having pulled it following the accusations.

could the covid-19 pandemic be the inflection point that marks the end of the gendered division of labor at home? now that we are all tethered to our homes, you may be doing more laundry, dishes, cooking, cleaning (did i say dishes?), nose wiping, bottom wiping and emotionally tending to your kids and teens. so it seems super timely for us to talk to the woman who has emerged as a leader in the movement to end the gendered division of labor at home and how to divvy up that labor as equitably as possible. eve rodsky has spent almost a decade surveying women and men about who does what at home to understand how and why we divide up labor along gender lines--and how to shift it--she's talked with economists, psychologists, historians, neurologists and more. and she wrote a book that details exactly how to divide and conquer with your partner, the unending duties at home. it's called fair play: a game-changing solution for when you have too much to do (and more life to live). if you've been listening to inflection point, you may have also caught my conversation with eve at inforum last year. i wanted to hear how her system is working in the covid-19 world. we spoke live (on zoom, of course) for the battery in san francisco about how to make changes that are a win for everyone in your home and in society.

i have to say it's a terrible misuse and appropriation of douglass because it ignores, i would argue, 80 or 90 percent of the rest of his ideas and the rest of his life. he was not antigovernment in the least. he believed in activist, interventionist use of federal power to destroy slavery, to destroy the confederacy and to reconceive the u.s. constitution.
elving: the house freedom caucus - that's the hard-core conservatives - could not be mollified even after they got a vote on their own preferred bill and lost the previous week. they weren't reconciled. they have firmly held out, saying that any kind of amnesty for the people who were brought here as minors by their parents - anything of that nature was unacceptable. and the further that the leaders went in trying to get them onboard, the more they lost the moderates, the house members from districts more supportive of immigrants and immigration. and that dynamic has been enough to interfere with even routine and unrelated business like the farm bill that got voted down and then passed by just two votes.

diamond: when president trump went on air and did a press conference talking about his concern over the, quote, numbers and didn't want a cruise ship with infected americans to necessarily dock and have the passengers evacuated because he was worried about the numbers, it was a remarkable statement for a president to say. the president has been obsessed with the numbers, obsessed with the optics of how this looks, which is not what you want the u.s. president to be focused on. the president's decisions on coronavirus, terry, are, i think, an outgrowth of how he has approached government the past three years. there were so many ticking time bombs that never actually exploded, crises that were averted because either the economy was sailing along, the president's tweets were papered over. but now we are in a crisis moment where these decisions matter.

the first was a disaster she didn't experience personally, but heard about on the radio: a catastrophic earthquake in armenia, where her mother's family had lived before they sought refuge in america. the second was the sudden appearance of her mother, standing nervously at the front door, gripping a pair of red balloons in her hands.
cheryl strayed: in order for you to succeed in your marriage, and in order for your husband to heal, he's going to have to bring those two selves together, and you're going to have to learn how to love those two selves. so that healing journey, if you decide to go it together or if he decides to go on it as an individual, is about learning how to love the darkness that is this man you married.

albright: and that's absolutely true because part of it, both with the fascism and with the communism, there really was not enough pushback from the people and to some extent the authorities there at the time. or there's an outside power that doesn't support. so for instance, what happened when the fascists took over was the period that is known as appeasement that in fact was carried out by friends and allies, like the british, who gave in to what this group that was organized to help hitler in what is known as sudetenland, the small part of czechoslovakia that was occupied by a german minority. and people thought, well, if we give in on this, nothing else will happen. and that is exactly what did happen. one step led to another. and if you are trying to feed the beast and the beast is a fascist, then it makes it very hard to push back.
davies: right. in the end, it becomes apparent he has special powers, that it's not schizophrenia. but he doesn't know that, and we don't know that for a long time. dan stevens, the guy who plays the central character david haller - people will remember him from downton abbey when he played the suave and sophisticated matthew crawley. in fact, i didn't even recognize him. he does such a terrific job of playing this nervous, scattered apparently schizophrenic guy. how did you and he get the right feeling effect for that character?

we trust an institution when we think that it forms the people within it to be trustworthy — so that not only does it perform an important social function, educating children or making laws or any of the many, many goods and services that institutions provide for us, but it also at the same time provides an ethic that shapes the people within it to perform that service in a reliable, responsible way, levin told npr wednesday.

mayer: well, so he is probably as stridently anti-abortion as anybody in american politics. and there was a bill passed actually in indiana when he was governor there - which is where he went after being in congress - that really defined the most kind of far-out anti-abortion legislation in the country. it was a bill that said that when women have abortions, they have to bury the fetus in a full burial. the state requires it. and if they have a miscarriage, they have to have a full burial for that. and it also banned the ability of women to have an abortion if the fetus had some kind of developmental anomaly, so something like, you know, down syndrome or something else, something even worse. it was a bill that was so intrusive on women's rights that women took up a protest effort against it in indiana.
i think the jury is still out on amy coney barrett. we don't really know yet a whole lot about what sort of justice she is going to be. and one of the things that certainly happens with justices on the supreme court - i think we've seen this with john roberts - is the time on the court tends to change and surprise even the justices themselves.

kennedy's position on the court is more than consequential. in the most hotly contested and closely divided cases, his vote often decides the outcome. with every passing day, it has become more clear that president trump's first supreme court nominee, neil gorsuch, is probably even more conservative than the justice he replaced, antonin scalia.

i mean, excuse me, loving v. virginia, the supreme court decision that - you know, that struck down barriers to interracial marriage was more than 50 years ago. and there are a number of shows on television where interracial relationships is not, like, a huge deal. i mean, look at - you know, there's, gosh, grey's anatomy. i mean, how long has that been on? and so at the end of the day, i mean, do you think that the bachelor - does it explode stereotypes, or does it just perpetuate them?

uneventful days, the first proper song following an intro, sets a shell-shocked tone with crisp digital syncopation that strongly evokes phil collins' 1985 hit take me home. but where that song builds to a cathartic chorus in which collins declares freedom after feeling like a prisoner all his life, beck lingers in paralyzing uncertainty as the reality of his new normal sets in. he relitigates old conflicts in his head, but doesn't have the energy to try to change his former partner's mind. he aches for a familiar sense of love and security even as his words describe two people becoming strangers to one another: you might know my name, but you don't know my mind.
mccammon: pence, for his part, was careful not to outshine the presumptive nominee. he gave a disciplined speech talking about spending time with the trump family and vouching for trump's character.
a bill called the equality act has been kicking around congress for decades — it was first introduced in 1974, just 10 years after the civil rights act became law. the current version of the equality act would enshrine in law many of the protections conferred by the obama administration's rules and policies, by explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in education, federal funding, employment, housing, and more. last year, the democrat-controlled house passed the bill and sent it to the republican-controlled senate, where it is not expected to be brought up for a vote.

the one thing about the army is that they have a genius for marketing and publicity. you asked me about the uniform, and initially booth had done it because he wanted the association with the actual british army. and he wanted to equalize soldiers who might come from different backgrounds. but it also was a branding tool. i mean, i doubt he said branding, but he was a tremendous advertiser. the army developed all these things, from the flag to the uniform to the kettle, which helped stamp the army brand in the public square.

1. it's time for my midlife crisis. in fact, midlife crisis is rare. the term midlife crisis was coined by a canadian psychoanalyst named elliott jaques, based on his analysis of artistic geniuses as well as patients in his practice who felt an existential dread that there was not enough time in their lives to achieve their dreams. gail sheehy's book passages turned the midlife crisis into a cultural phenomenon, symbolized by the red sports car, quitting your job or leaving your marriage. but over the past 20 years, researchers have tried to find evidence of a widespread midlife crisis — and failed. they believe only 10 percent of the population suffers such a crisis. what most people refer to as a midlife crisis is really a crisis or setback that occurs in midlife, such as losing a spouse, a parent, a job, or experiencing a health scare. most people recover from these setbacks.

toobin: yes, there is. and it was founded in direct response to the federalist society. it was founded right after the supreme court's decision in bush v. gore in 2000, when the court effectively handed that election to george w. bush. and liberals said, you know, conservatives have been cultivating judges and judicial selection for a long time, for two decades, and we've been asleep at the switch. we need to create our alternative. and there is one. it's called the american constitution society. and it is - i would say it is somewhat successful. it is - has an annual convention every year. and, you know, more liberal judges speak at it. and it has some networking opportunities for liberal lawyers. it's smaller. it has a budget of $6 million as opposed to $20 million for the federalist society.

i think modern moral philosophers think that you really can't judge a life without looking at the total sum of all the roles that are intertwined within it and trying to interpret what they all add up to. and i think that's the aspect of the modern consciousness that really resonates when we read a memoir. we want to see somebody else telling us what it's all added up to because we want to be able to do that for ourselves.
but everything the monarchy does — except, perhaps, spend money — is symbolic. messaging is, at this point in history, most of its purpose. harry himself has acknowledged its magic but also that nobody would really want to be king or queen if it weren't a duty. even if the monarchy moves with the speed of a sloth on benzos, if it must exist with all this pageantry and absurdity to accompany it, why not some joy as well? why not some interest in the wider world? why not some gospel music and some beautiful cello performance?

creatures is frequently heartbreaking, but never mawkish. the novel contains several interstitial chapters, written in the second person and framed as answers to questions about marine life, that delve deep into evie's psyche. it's a risky technique that pays off; the reader discovers a more sensitive, less guarded side of evie: you could end up like the loneliest whale in the sea if you are not careful. if you live on an island with a mother who doesn't want you and a father who wants too much, you might scream and no one will hear you.
but the court also set limits as it accepted the cases. as the court's order list states, the scope of the court's review of the harris funeral homes case is limited to only question whether title vii prohibits discrimination against transgender people based on (1) their status as transgender or (2) sex stereotyping under the 1989 decision in the price waterhouse v. hopkins case.

i think that a lot of people come to therapy for validation. they come because they want the therapist to take their side and say, you're right. he's a jerk. he's a sociopath. and that's what your friends will do for you, but it's not very helpful.
in the longer run, the focus could well return quickly to the supreme court if there are more vacancies — a distinct possibility. justice ruth bader ginsburg, appointed by president clinton, is 83; justice anthony kennedy, a center-right justice appointed by president reagan, is 80; and justice stephen breyer, a clinton appointee, is 78.
what trump has said: in a statement friday afternoon, trump said he vaguely remembered zervos as contestant on the apprentice. to be clear, i never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. that is not who i am as a person, and it is not how i've conducted my life, he said. trump also said zervos had asked him for help, asking that i visit her restaurant in california in april 2016.
a decade under netanyahu has seen the two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict become more remote. religious jewish lawmakers hold more sway over law and society as they block initiatives to expand lgbt rights and allow for secular marriage ceremonies. and democracy has been put to the test with a new law that could weaken the standing of non-jewish citizens and netanyahu himself saying the country is the nation state not of all its citizens, but only the jewish people.

mr. furstenberg: that's precisely right, neal. the early years of adulthood or the late years of adolescence, whatever we want to call it, is creating yet another locale in which there's great inequality among families and among young people themselves.

jeff sharlet, welcome back to fresh air. let's start with a recap of what the family is and what it stands for. you've described it as elite fundamentalism, as opposed to the kind of televangelist, populist fundamentalism. what do you mean by elite?
yearwood: yeah, that's not even fair.
now he assumes leadership of one of the world's most populous muslim countries, facing enormous challenges at home and abroad. pakistan is a nuclear-armed nation that has hostile relations with neighbors afghanistan and india. it is mired in debt, faces rising temperatures and diminishing water supplies. meanwhile, militants continue to wreak havoc in the country's periphery.

sagal: yes. more than half have confessed to going ahead and watching the tv show that you're supposed to be watching with your partner, going in and binge watching it without them. most partners only find out they've been netflix cheated on when they've only been with one person but then they test positive for house of cards.

monk-payton: it is an entire ecosystem that has been cultivated since the show has been on - for almost 20 - you know, almost 20 years. and so i think that it is - makes - it is made up of the fans. it's made up of the various participants across seasons and also across the different programs within the franchise - so the bachelor, bachelorette, bachelor in paradise. and so all of these participants and fans create this entire network that has now been deemed bachelor nation.
davies: well, it seems like you're really at a great point in your career. what kinds of roles do you turn down?

i took our marriage certificate and i took our children's birth certificates, corradi says. i was concerned that, if in the confusion things really got bad, that i could prove those were my children and that we could at least be together.
it's actually not about trying to tamp down on or control the way the mind works. it's about familiarization. just getting to know how nutty it is inside your brain, inside your mind, is incredibly important, because when you've tipped over into panic or any other unhelpful, unskillful mind state — like greed or anger or hatred — then you might notice it. and then you have a choice: am i going to be owned by this panic right now or am i going to be owned by this anger right now? or am i going to be so controlled by the anger that i'm going to say something that's going to ruin the next 48 hours of my marriage? or am i going to eat the 75th oreo?
burke: or anyone else for that matter. let's be honest. i'd say that's true.
there are so many terrific elements in this novel — nick's haunted character, a plot that never darts in the direction you expect it to and a truly ingenious climax — that i could be here till labor day singing its praises. instead, i'll change directions and mention another seasoned hard-boiled writer who introduced a superb new series several months ago.
president trump celebrated the ruling as a profound vindication of his immigration policies, which have drawn significant backlash for years, dating back to the first moments of his presidential campaign.
diamond: about two weeks ago, my colleague nancy cook and i reported that the white house had soured on alex azar leading the coronavirus response. he was asked about it in congressional testimony because we broke the story while he was on capitol hill, waved it away by saying, you know, didn't trust anonymous sources in politico. but by the end of the day, mike pence had replaced him. and by the next morning, there was a new coordinator brought in, debbie birx, to help run the response, too. that's what people saw in public.

mulaney: ...and the bartender who's shown a photo of the missing person and immediately recognizes her and everything about her, like, despite being a bartender in midtown who sees thousands of people every night...
trump's frequent attacks on cnn led to much speculation, including from at&t chairman and ceo randall stephenson, that the president's opposition stemmed from anger over the network's coverage rather than concern over greater corporate consolidation. at&t lawyers initially sought email correspondence between trump's white house and the justice department, but leon declared that any communications were not relevant to the trial, and at&t relented.
i used to say, 'in eight to nine years, when we get engaged eventually,' hamilton said, and then she said, 'that's not a funny joke anymore.'
bianculli: well, les moonves - they've just ruled that he's probably not going to get his 100 million plus parachute, and that's the way you teach lessons in hollywood. but creatively, in terms of what's being made, you are getting more women both behind the camera scripting things and starring. killing eve came - is a perfect example where the - there are so many strong women in killing eve that that would've populated entire seasons' worth of television, this one show, just 10 years ago.
and, you know, if someone from the state department does that, they write up a cable. and they send it back. and that's circulated within the government. kushner doesn't need to do that. and so you have entire branches of the u.s. government who don't know what's happening inside of this incredibly important bilateral relationship.
singletary: and i think that's an important thing, that you're there you came back, and i don't have a problem with that, and i don't think you know, i was listening in. i don't think anyone's saying that it's a bad thing that you go back home to live with your parents.
people of color are more likely to live in densely packed areas and in multigenerational housing situations, which create higher risk for spread of highly contagious disease like covid-19, said dr. jerome adams, the u.s. surgeon general, at the white house briefing friday.

they didn't want to repeat the mistakes that president clinton made by trying to move too quickly on gay rights, socarides said. they were so intent on not repeating those mistakes that i think they became too cautious.

i think people look at christians doing art as a homogeneous group, and it's not. it's diverse.
kurtis: christian was hot. he got them all right. congratulations.
gross: jane mayer is a staff writer for the new yorker. her new article, the president pence delusion, is in the current issue of the new yorker. tomorrow on fresh air, my guest will be john green. his phenomenally popular young adult novel the fault in our stars about a relationship between two teenagers with cancer was adapted into a film. the main character of his new novel, turtles all the way, is a teenage girl with ocd whose intrusive thoughts get in the way of her life. those are things green has to deal with, too. i hope you'll join us.
how did this role come your way?
brosnahan: (as midge maisel) that was telling me?
gross: and on saturday night live, you always used your eyes great for comic effect. on barry, staring into your - like, when i look at your eyes on barry, like, sometimes your eyes are saying, like, thousand-yard stare, the scare of a soldier who's seen combat too long. sometimes it's a stare of someone with just, like, so much existential dread. and sometimes it's the stare of somebody who has just become overtaken by rage and anger. and i wonder if you think about your eyes at all or whether they - it just kind of happens that your eyes communicate so much.

mr. sharlet: well, bart stupak is an interesting democrat from northern michigan, and he - conservative in some ways, not as conservative in other ways, but on these family issues, he is. he's been living at what the family calls their c street house on capitol hill at least since 2002, when he told the los angeles times - the los angeles times was investigating the family - he told them that he would not talk to the press about the house. that it was sort of secret.

when reality set in, all she wanted to do was be there, travel to new york city right away. but she couldn't. with the virus spreading around the globe, travel wasn't an option.
that approach pleases much of trump's conservative base. in a statement to npr, arina grossu, director of the center for human dignity at the family research council, said abstinence-based programs provide the optimal message for teens. she compared the approach to other public health models used to address underage drinking and drug use that aim to discourage such behaviors.
legend: ...who may just go to a spotify-curated list and - or curate their own list and listen to it that way. but i still think, for their favorite artist, they're probably still going to listen to the whole body of work and let it play. but when i do put an album out - which hopefully will be early next year - i'm going to be thinking, just like i did before, about great songs...
rott: because the need is only going to grow.
another is just how financially independent the couple will become and how they plan to support themselves moving forward.
sagal: and are you aware of anybody who just, instead of having an awkward conversation with their child, just hands them your book and says, here, read this, talk to me next week?
conan: i suspect, though, it's your grandma and your mom, they're both having troubles of their own.
victor lavalle: (reading) people who move to new york always the same mistake. they can't see the place. this is true of manhattan but even the outer boroughs, too, be it flushing meadows in queens or red hook in brooklyn. they come looking for magic, whether evil or good, and nothing will convince it isn't here. this wasn't all bad, though. some new yorkers had learned how to make a living from this error in thinking. charles thomas tester for one. the morning of most importance began with a trip from charles' apartment in harlem. he'd been hired to make a delivery to a house out in queens. he shared the crib in harlem with his ailing father, otis, a man who'd been dying ever since his wife of 21 years had expired. they'd had one child, charles thomas. and even though he was 20 and exactly the age for independence, he played the role of dutiful son. charles worked to support his dying dad. he hustled to provide food and shelter and a little extra to lay on a number from time to time. god knows he didn't make any more than that.
garcia-navarro: so one thing is people having to go to these interviews. but what is actually happening in these interviews? are people still being approved? or has the burden of proof gotten higher, and so it is more complicated for people who are in this legal process?

(soundbite of song, big bang theory theme)
foer: jacob at the end of this book, he's taking his dog to the vet, a very aged dog. and he's thinking about it, and he's thinking about the dog's life. and he says to himself life is precious. and he said, you know, what a stupid thought, what a cliched thought, what an utterly obvious thought that never need to be mentioned, and yet that most important of all thoughts is very, very hard to self generate. you know, we have that thought life is precious maybe - what? - on a birthday on new year's or when somebody, you know, falls ill.
gross: that's an excellent piece of tv criticism...

i'm relieved that he didn't become governor earlier, paul saffo says, adding that newsom's eight years watching political master jerry brown will give him a better sense of when to lead and when to follow. i suspect going into this governorship he's gonna understand that timing better than ever.

the times was also slow to cover developments involving joichi ito, then director of the mit media lab. ito resigned from the new york times co. board and the massachusetts institute of technology last september as his ties to epstein came into focus. ito had solicited contributions for the lab and his own venture fund from epstein years after the financier's conviction for crimes involving sex with underage teenagers.
weinstein: (as claire) the gay kid?
klein: the answer was a, mike rowe soft. he settled in exchange for an x-box. your next mike is mike malloy. he came to prominence in the 1930s and earned a nickname. what was it? was it a, mike the durable - gangsters repeatedly tried to kill him by poisoning his whiskey, but he'd been drinking bad whiskey so long it only made him stronger.
that sort of insight was especially valuable considering that, professionally, both artists have at least one foot planted in a highly nebulous musical world. christian rap has often been treated as a subordinate subcategory of predominately white, pop-leaning contemporary christian music, one that provided evangelical youth with a safer alternative to secular rap. at the same time, hip-hop has also exerted undeniable influence on black, urban gospel music, a phenomenon that's generated big crossover moments like kirk franklin's late '90s breakthrough, and mainstream rappers sometimes infuse their work with gospel heft. minor and phillips are each fleshing out their own, compelling visions for what it can look like to do culturally attuned, faith-based but not factional work in that shifting space.
what trump has said: in an emailed statement, the trump campaign vigorously denied drake's allegation:
the rough moment came, in dramatic fashion, after the couple had been quarantining together for about three weeks.
'love is blind' couple offers advice for socially distanced daters
simon: your husband chasten has really taken off. but i have to raise a question with you because i was hoping not to ask anything about orientation. but as you know, there's some polling information recently reported by the new york times that says the fact that you're a man married to another man might be causing some reservations and misgivings, specifically among african american voters in south carolina. the quote that came back in the times was a marriage should be between adam and eve, not adam and steve. wonder what you would say to voters who have that reservation.
gross: so had he already been out of rehab? was he in, like, that transitional period between rehab and going home when i spoke to him? do you have any idea?

prof. hunter: well, i became interested when i was researching my first book, which is called, to 'joy my freedom: southern black women's lives and labors after the civil war. it's a book about domestic workers between the civil war and the world war i period. and i found some very rich documents of family life in the reconstruction era in the freedman's bureau records of the national archives.

i myself feel empty, always feel empty, little sister said as she wept. i simply want to find a man who dearly loves me. why is it so difficult?

diamond: the office of civil rights, overall, is run by a gentleman named roger severino. he did come from the heritage foundation. he ran the religious liberty center there. and roger severino has been praised for his intellect, and he's a principled person. but his principles are around christian beliefs. he's spoken out against the push for same-sex marriage. he said that was an assault on religious liberty. he's criticized the transgender condition. he's obviously anti-abortion. and that makes for quite a puzzle that someone in charge of protecting civil rights for all americans in health care is someone who has said things that some vulnerable groups are deeply concerned about.
jonathan safran foer, welcome to fresh air. you know, in your novel, a marriage is breaking apart. israel is undergoing a catastrophe. there's an earthquake and several countries bound together in war against israel. there's a hebrew expression tikkun olam which is repairing the world. and - is that a concept you're familiar with? and if so, would you describe it and tell us if you see that as relating to your book?
sagal: but i'm amazed because you've done so many amazing things since then. for example...

but it is unlikely that kennedy will remain on the court for the full four years of the trump presidency. while he long ago hired his law clerks for the coming term, he has not done so for the following term (beginning oct. 2018), and has let applicants for those positions know he is considering retirement.
you know, the - my way of thinking if there wasn't a one instance of two boys getting a job dressing as girls to dance with minors in a town like daggsville, i'd be very surprised with the great cornucopia of work in america. i mean, it might have died a death hours later, but i'm sure it must have happened.

lgbtq advocates have built on that argument, bagenstos of the university of michigan explains. in 1964, maybe no one was thinking about this law protecting gays and lesbians and transgender individuals — they may not have had all the same words to describe actually the kind of discrimination at issue here that we do now, he says. but they wrote a law that said if you're treated less well because of your sex, that is unlawful. and these are people who are being treated less-well because of their sex.
j chester: in shooting the one coyote, the thing that was weighing on me the most was that i knew this wasn't the only coyote. i was going to have to obliterate every coyote that crossed our path. and we were the farm that had animals, like, that they were eating. you know, we were creating a food system for coyotes. so it was going to be an endless battle of constantly killing coyotes, and i think that's the thing that scared me the most - was that it felt like an incredibly slippery slope.

what trump has said: trump denied the allegation in an interview with the times, threatening to sue the organization and calling the reporter who asked him about it a disgusting human being. in a statement released wednesday night, the trump campaign emphatically denied all of the allegations in the times story (which also includes the allegations by another woman, rachel crooks, below). from jason miller, a trump spokesman:
and what happens when she does decide to emerge into the world? sometimes it feels like i'm swimming with sharks / just reading books by myself in the park, she sings on the exuberant strawberry. the pervasive undercurrent of misogyny she experiences in daily interaction is the same anxiety that leads many women to protect themselves with a veil of isolation. on the track's anthemic chorus, reo peels back the layers with opulent energy: what do you deserve from me? n-o-t-h-i-n-g / wish you had earned that ph.d. in r-e-s-p-e-c-t / i don't owe you anything!

diamond: historically, that has been where most of these objections have fallen, and the comments coming in have reflected that too. i will say that the history of these conscience protections dates back to roe v. wade. they are kind of born out of the controversial abortion fight. and to make it more palatable, there was some bipartisan consensus among lawmakers that, ok, abortion is now a mandated right. but if there are doctors and workers who maybe don't want to perform these procedures, these conscience protections will help lessen the impact.

ethically, rieder says poor nations get some slack because they're still developing, and because their per capita emissions are a sliver of the developed world's. plus, it just doesn't look good for rich, western nations to tell people in poor ones not to have kids. he suggests things like paying poor women to refill their birth control and — something that's had proven success — widespread media campaigns.

police say that on sunday night, paddock broke out windows in a 32nd-story hotel room at the mandalay bay resort and casino and pulled the trigger, raining a hail of gunfire on concertgoers at the route 91 harvest country music festival across the street. witnesses described what followed as nonstop gunfire that sent people fleeing for their lives.
and it was her - a group of very eager hillary supporters called the super volunteers who emailed me early on and said this is a list of language we're going to be watching for in your stories, and these are sexist terms. and, frankly, they were not at all sexist terms. they were, like, ambitious or will do anything to win. i mean, it was, like, 25 adjectives that you couldn't write a political story without using (laughter).

the writer-director of in the fade is fatih akin. he was born in germany in 1973 to turkish parents. and on the evidence of his harsh and moody films, he remains a divided soul raised in one country but with firm roots in the culture of another. his themes are dislocation and disharmony. in his punk romance head-on, a german man and turkish woman meet cute - well, kind of cute. they're both in a german hospital after respective suicide attempts. but they can't manage to live together without violence.

and so in that choice, you can sort of see that the kochs pushed very hard for pruitt. they funded him in the past. one of their allies harold hamm, who is a billionaire who's made a fortune from fracking, was also very closely involved in choosing pruitt and advising pence and the transition. so the choice of personnel during that transition on environmental issues is where you can see the influence of the kochs.

boudin: my earliest memories are going through steel gates and metal detectors just to give my parents a hug. my whole life has been shaped by the criminal justice system because of the mistakes that my parents made. and it's that life experience of seeing how broken our criminal justice system is that led me to go to law school, to become a public defender and, as a public defender, to see the ways in which our system is failing crime victims, is failing people accused of crime and is failing communities that are impacted by it.

conway: well, you know, at the time, before i'd had this experience, i attributed her excessive and overwhelming lifetime of grief as incomprehensible to me. i couldn't understand how she did not have the energy and drive, as a powerful and very strong woman, to get herself together and take up life again. having lost my own husband, i can see what a temptation that is, although it's not one i've succumbed to. i understand how it might happen.
klein: yeah. i mean, i would say that it feels like you're talking to an angel from above.
b harper: (singing) some born to lose. some born to win. they say we're all born into sin. that's a hard way to begin. but i was born to love you.
they seem very caught up in this gay marriage issue when i think a lot of republicans — and a lot conservatives — have moved on from it, kondik said.
and - but that's what the place was. it was just incredibly dull. and so, you know, once you got to know people, you know, the main attraction was basically food. you would get together and eat. either you'd go out to restaurants or, you know, people would host you at their homes, and, you know, you would you would eat, and that was kind of all there was to do.
boys and men in many parts of india are raised to be far more gentle and feminine — and comfortable with physical and emotional intimacy — than is the norm for western/american males. this was true then [in the '70s], and remains true until today.
mr. peete: well, i think it's a lot of those factors. i think genetically, i think that because i was an athlete and i had all these expectations of my son and because he was a twin. and, you know, when they were first born, she was born a little premature, and we always thought that she was going to be the one that had the issues, and she had some poor muscle tone early on. so we were, like, focused on her and being able to stand and walk. and he was meeting all of his milestones and all of a sudden, it kind of changed in him and he wasn't. and then after that point, we started to really focus in on him.
bialik: i hear that from friends of mine all the time.
feldman: i'm sort of happy to welcome her into my brand-new domain, right? i'm putting out the nice dishes that i have and the nice napkins. and i want to, you know, serve her coffee and, you know, play house. and she immediately says, i know that it didn't work. and at the beginning, i'm just too surprised to understand what's happening. like, what does she know? how does she know it? does she assume it? and she explains that her husband told her that my husband had told him that we had attempted to consummate the marriage and we had failed at doing so.
chinese state media branded him an evil leader disguised in red clothes — a kingpin pretending to be an upright communist citizen — and a high-profile target in a sweeping anti-corruption campaign.

what we found was that in places where people were saying no, it's not changing my community very much, if you looked at whites or conservatives, they tended to say it was changing the country a lot — even though they don't see it in their own lives on the ground.
but hahn wanted to take a look: it was the first house he'd ever bought for himself. he and his wife purchased the house in the late '80s for $55,000 and moved out a few years later. now, it was next to ruined.

the liar's dictionary belongs to a subgenre of historical fiction that toggles between two parallel narratives — set in the past and the present — which cleverly play off each other, unraveling mysteries and juxtaposing epiphanies in both strands. a.s. byatt's possession and ali smith's how to be both are two relevant examples.
evans: i'm not a trained investigator. we weren't carrying out a search. but it was their attempt to show transparency, to show openness and to show cooperation.
i've spoken about my respect and appreciation for the eight justices on the supreme court, kavanaugh said. i know they're all dedicated public servants who have given a great deal to this country.
briger: so this new book, the ballad of black tom, is a response to lovecraft. and the jumping-off point, one of his most notoriously xenophobic stories - it's called the horror of red hook. and red hook's a neighborhood in brooklyn. red hook at the time, i think, was - most of the people living there were recent immigrants, it seems like. what were some of things he said about the people that lived there and that story?
polling suggests a majority of american catholics support abortion rights in most or all cases and oppose overturning roe v. wade, the 1973 u.s. supreme court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. according to the guttmacher institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, most catholic women say they've used contraception at some point, which the church also opposes.
both of the books i'm recommending today are each, in their own ways, about cold cases.
garcia-navarro: one bright spot in this fight - new york's state legislature voted last week to raise the minimum age of marriage from 14 to 17. the law now heads to governor andrew cuomo for approval.
poundstone: no. you know why it's true? the victors write the history.
race is, of course, a huge subject in the film, as michelle obama details feeling immense pressure to be perfect as wife to the first black president. for fans who admire the family and their message of inclusion, becoming will be a bittersweet reminder of how differently the white house's current occupants conduct themselves.
gross: and you're right that a lot of people in local tv news thought of your parents as being responsible for the downfall (laughter) of local tv news. what were your thoughts? what are your thoughts about that now?

l. hardin: and i remember him actually saying - which, we needed to get to this point - where he just told me, like, ok, laura, this is going to hurt. so, like, there was just - 'cause i think that's what was holding us back. and so he just told me that, and so we just knew we were going to go for it. and - but this was all in a space of just, like, trust.
the first step was to check whether anyone was there. he would peer in the windows, put his ear to the door. a beeping smoke detector was a dead giveaway — the batteries had gone dead, but no one was around to change them. if the house was vacant, he would pick the lock on the front door and go in.
but he also became a controversial figure for his lavish lifestyle and anti-lgbt positions and was later accused of sexual misconduct by several young men whom he had mentored. we wanted to hear more about him, so we've called the reverend asa lee. he is associate dean for community life at wesley theological seminary in washington, d.c., and has lectured on the history of the black church. reverend lee, welcome. thank you so much for speaking with us.
well, you know, he falls in love. they fall in love. and they, you know - you fall in love. people have sex. she got pregnant. he did the honorable thing. he loved her, and he wanted to marry her. and i think, somehow, he knew he couldn't marry her in virginia because of the 1924 law. and so they go off to d.c., get married and come back to live in virginia.
and see if it measured up to the template?
foy: isn't it? isn't it? we all support each other.
sagal: that's very nice. i understand that that's exactly what either of your characters would call it.
indoor recreation, fitness and entertainment establishments, indoor visitation at long-term care facilities and indoor dining at restaurants are prohibited in extreme risk counties.
so he's got a lot to hide, and that's the message he's sending when he says it's none of your business 'cause it is our business. and he can't get away with that. but i would assure you that his supporters don't care because they don't care about anything he says or doesn't say. and if he wants to contradict himself midsentence, that's ok with them apparently. but in this case, none of your business - n-o-b is not the answer.
unidentified actors: (as characters, singing) the bodega man can. oh, the bodega man can.

world cafe nashville: the reckless electric
the ruthless julia intends to supplant her party's prime minister by whipping up fear of terrorism. it's an approach that her bodyguard despises. and, as if that weren't tricky enough, someone is trying to kill julia. but who could it be? islamic militants? renegade elements of the security apparatus? her conservative party enemies?
that's really why the government places such a strong emphasis on it, she says, we know the impact that living an undocumented life has on people not being able to go home for funerals or celebrations, the fear and isolation that can result from that.
jones: oh, they all sound great. i'm going to have to go with c.

this was a pretty good nudge. more of a grab. it was pretty close to the center of my butt. i was startled. i jumped.
just ahead of his interview friday with hannity, moore's campaign put out a statement more pointed than its reactions thursday night:
soundtrack to a film about portugal's exploitation of colonial angola, recognition finds singer of the moment serpa laying down wordless long tones, ostinatos and swooping intervals in frictive overdubbed harmony, over a limber, attentive, singular tenor saxophone/piano/concert harp trio: mark turner, david virelles and zeena parkins interlock, and improvise details to warm things up. the foursome's initially bewildering sound becomes beguiling. when serpa sings lyrics on the closing anthem, it's a jolt. –kevin whitehead
unidentified actor: (as character) it wasn't?
eventually the heges sold their house in a short sale for $149,000 — about half of what they still owed to the bank. (in a typical short sale, the bank agrees to accept less than what is owed and release the remainder of the debt. in many cases, lenders prefer short sales over foreclosures.)
bernstein: well, in new york and new jersey, real estate is a famously shady business, and people who own real estate and who develop real estate understand that they need political favor, that that is part of the capital that they are building up. both the kushner family and the trump family were part of the system, but they both pushed it far beyond the limits.

mr. sharlet: looking at the, the family's 990s, where they're moving their money to - into this african leadership academy called cornerstone, which runs two programs: youth corps, which has described its goals in the past as an international, quote, invisible family binding together world leaders, and also an alumni organization designed to place cornerstone grads - graduates of this sort of very elite educational program and politics and ngo's through something called the african youth leadership forum, which is run by -according to ugandan media - which is run by david bahati, this same legislator who introduced the anti-homosexuality act.
while o'connor was on the court, a majority of justices continued to support legislation that regulated campaign fundraising. but after her retirement and the alito appointment, kennedy wrote the court's 5-to-4 decision in citizens united, the 2010 case that remade the way campaigns at every level are conducted.
a. hardin: i think the criticism can be helpful. to me that's not a criticism on waiting to have sex. it's a criticism on waiting to talk about sex or how you talk about sex. that's actually one of the reasons that we decided we want to do this interview - because we felt like we have benefited from that conversation.
tom bodett: no, my wife and i sat in the warm morning sun feeding each other grapes and read it to each other.
carll has described the lighthearted album opener none'ya as a song about his romantic and creative partner, singer-songwriter allison moorer. (he made the quietly symbolic move of asking her not just to co-write this and several other songs, but also to co-produce the set with brad jones, who'd steered some of carll's earlier studio work.) with a touch of sheepishness, carll sings of trying to properly appreciate a woman who's complicated, independent and maybe even a little superstitious. he concludes the album with i will stay, a gently fingerpicked song that promises steady companionship in plainspoken fashion. it's hard to keep believing all the stories you've been told / and to watch the way you try is a sight to behold, he marvels, making that attentiveness sound like a modest aim.
many of these firefighters who are often portrayed as heroes in media reportage, they don't feel like heroes. they feel like they failed, eriksen said. so there are some real issues going on in terms of their well being.
ringhand: but she also gave firm answers and firm commitments to lots and lots of cases and questions, most notably when she was talking about reproductive rights.
a. hardin: we've kind of developed something that, other than this national interview, is something that only we know. (laughter).
jarrett: well, i said at the time that, look, i am - i'm fine. i'm not worried about valerie jarrett. i think that that was symptomatic of a much bigger problem. and i'm worried about the people who aren't able to defend themselves. and the question is when are we going to get to the point in our country - and maybe this gets at your question - where we're not talking at each other but we're taking the chance to actually listen and get to know one another? that's where the racial healing comes from. i remember when president obama created the 21st century task force on policing.
a fox news poll released thursday evening showed jones leading moore by 8 points, 50 percent to 42 percent. jones was also the preferred candidate of women voters by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 58 percent to 32 percent. a poll commissioned by the nrsc earlier this week showed moore's support collapsing as he trailed jones by 12 points, while other polls have shown a much closer race.
and then the broader moves and the president's language confounded and concerned public health experts. the president repeatedly leaned into phrases like, this is a foreign virus, that europe is now a source of america's problems. on one level, he's right; the virus came out of china, and that country's leadership has a lot to answer for in how they initially screwed up the response. i think the trump administration did have good reason to shut down china travel in late january, given the uncertainty about the new outbreak.
hawley: i'm bringing both stamp collection and the game of bridge back...
is there a romance plot more audacious than the fake-dating scenario? netflix's bridgerton recently plumbed the depths of a false courtship in scandal-obsessed regency-era london to great acclaim. but at its heart, the trope concerns two near-strangers forced into the intimacies of a relationship, and the surprising partnership that inevitably springs from an initially unemotional arrangement.
gross: and there might be some, like, romantic attraction between you?
cashin: by mixing, right. you know, your daughter's going to end up being in bed with a negro if you vote for lincoln and the republican party.
and so i was like, well, where are we at with discussing masculinity? how can i contribute to something of a feminist lens to this while examining the male hero in this story? and i thought that part of that is bringing in this conversation that we have contemporarily of masculine vulnerability and where the strength in that lies and where the redemption in that lies and where - what's appealing about that in a romantic hero and what we're looking for in our lovers in the 21st century.
rachel brosnahan: (as midge maisel) they'll have terrible deli.
wu: sure. the fcc in - as you just said, now has in place a net neutrality rule very strong rule. i think it was courageous of the obama administration to pass it. and so right now it is illegal for a service provider to censor or block a site because they don't like it or to privilege someone who pays them extra money. so it's basically a level playing field. i think it was a great victory. it doesn't solve all the problems of our time, but i think we've gotten a much better place.
martin: how did you figure out, or how did you and your wife figure out that there was something going out with r.j.?
behind the scenes, azar and his team did know that he was at risk of being replaced, spent a fair amount of time just trying to shore up his standing, calling officials at the white house, on capitol hill, just trying to make sure that he didn't lose the job of running the coronavirus response. at that point, we were several weeks into fighting this thing. and in a working, functional administration, the amount of effort just to keep a job, just to fend off these internal fights, i don't know if that would be happening. since day 1, there were people trying to get him replaced as the leader of this effort. and alex azar also had to spend a lot of political capital fighting to keep this job at a time when we probably would want his efforts focused elsewhere.

the montgomery advertiser wrote in a recent profile of moore that the original lawsuit was dismissed due to lack of standing, but then-gov. fob james — who once pledged to send the national guard to defend the plaque — sued to get a ruling on the constitutionality of moore's actions. in 1996, montgomery county judge charles price initially ordered moore to stop the prayer but allowed the ten commandments plaque to be displayed; however, he ordered the plaque removed after visiting moore's courtroom the following year.
