i just wish that he would kinda get a little bit thicker skin and get on with what he's got to do. he's got a job to do, you know? he's got all of us looking up to him with hopeful eyes thinking that he's going to be not our savior, but that he's going to get where we need to be and on the right track again.
but on sunday, the brits got in on the fun. the math department at the solihull school in the u.k. calculated some palindromic bonuses; sunday also happens to fall on the 33rd day of the year, with 333 days remaining in the year.

in a bombshell letter to justice department attorneys working on cases filed by refugees and visa holders delivered around 5 p.m. monday, yates said she was not convinced about the legality of trump's decision to block travelers from iraq, iran, syria, yemen, sudan, libya and somalia for 90 days; to suspend new refugee admissions; and to ban the acceptance of syrian refugees indefinitely.
he says this belief is laid out in the bible and he is following it to the best of his ability. i try to live my best to god's word, he says. but then for somebody that doesn't believe, do they look at me as a bigot? do they look at me as a hater?
he's the first one to give you the shirt off his back. if you need any help, he's right there, sherri says. and he has a really good sense of humor. when he has his teeth he has the biggest, brightest smile. it just covers him, covers his whole face.
the bill's original sponsor, ed butler, notes that while the focus on bathrooms certainly didn't help his bill, it wasn't the only factor in its defeat. new hampshire lawmakers were also passing a marriage equality law at the time. for some, butler said, also passing a transgender rights bill as well was too much, too soon.
campaign finance law and the stormy daniels scandal
davies: you moved out of san francisco. and there's an eight-year stretch of your childhood. and you described them as pretty tough. you know, your parents' relationship fell apart, in part, because, you know, your dad would not take the medicine for his epilepsy and had some pretty strange experiences. your mom ends up reviving the business kind of with once-a-month trips into san francisco from where they were living outside of town.
rocca: how - i mean, not that there's anything wrong with it, but macron's wife is how much older?

jonathan safran foer's 'here i am' is both dazzling and draining
hanks: i just came and went on my own accord, and they never said boo. there was one time in high school, i had the flu and i spent two weeks at a friend's house. and when i finally came home, my dad said, where have you been? i said, oh, i had the flu. i slept at kirk's (ph) house. he was like, oh, i figured you'd take care of yourself. so that brand of freedom is not - it wasn't a cruel brand of disinterest, but they were just very busy doing other things.
republican presidential candidate donald trump expanded his list of potential supreme court nominees friday.
in january 2006, officer engeman deployed to iraq as part of an embedded special transition team to train and advise iraqi security forces for a year. one day, while was traveling in his humvee, an ied exploded nearby. he was instantly killed, at 45 years old. it was mother's day - may 14, 2006.
volz: how awkward is that, writing about your parents having sex? (laughter). i tried to skip it, and my writing group - that's wonderful - kept saying, look; you can't cop out on this (laughter). but what's - so my father is a grand mal epileptic, and my mom didn't know he was an epileptic. they had slept together for the first time.
as willing to wait notes, the program does teach about contraceptives and stds, but robinson says all the discussion is focused on heterosexual relationships.

i can't think of a single civil rights law that doesn't have some people who are unhappy about it, says karen narasaki, a member of the u.s. commission on civil rights. but once the country has said, 'well, we believe that people who are lgbt need to be protected from discrimination,' then how do you make sure that happens?
a lot of them are using faith as kind of a focal point, as a centerpiece, vander plaats said. so we'd like to find out what makes them tick.
but to the lgbt community and its supporters, a refusal to place a child for adoption with a same-sex couple is unacceptable discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation. those who oppose anti-discrimination efforts are often portrayed as out of step with the growing public acceptance of same-sex unions.

a civil rights case over the state's lgbt law proceeds. david greene talks to theodore shaw, head of the center for civil rights at the university of north carolina school of law at chapel hill.
hanks: well, you know, i have been alone in a lot of hotel rooms around the world for long periods of time in which i know i have to get up in the morning and create something that i may have an instinctive ability to do or may fail miserably at. i do recognize that sensibility of 3 o'clock in the morning in a foreign land in which you have to have a passport in your briefcase in order to allow yourself entrance and exit. that is one aspect of it, too.

but some doj veterans and law professors found some fault with how she handled the conflict over the immigration order. on the lawfare blog, professor jack goldsmith pointed out that yates had not clearly determined the immigration order was unconstitutional or cited other legitimate bases for refusing to defend it.
gessen's viewpoint may be head-spinning for many, especially those who believe today's maelstrom of disease, unemployment and racial violence represent failures by the incumbent president. yet gessen argues that trump may see it all as an opportunity, not just in his pursuit of re-election, but in what gessen believes is his longer-term concept of his own career trajectory.

the debate over bathrooms and who should use them picked up steam after north carolina's recent law requiring people to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. but the debate started years before north carolina took it up.

i think it is a good thing that charters now reflect reality more accurately, says qiao mu, who once taught journalism at beijing foreign studies university. he left china for the u.s. in 2017 after his career was stymied because of his political outspokenness. why include all this pretty language about democratic freedom and freedom of thought if there is none of that?
we may not like the claim of conscience, haynes says, but you know, we don't judge claims of conscience on whether we like the content of the claim. we are trying to protect the right of people to do what they feel they must do according to their god. that is a very high value.
it was a marriage of convenience, brought about by social distancing restrictions and fortnite's built-in audience, which parent company epic games claims stands at more than 250 million players. but even previous to the current distancing recommendations, fortnite had built a reputation around such events.

offenders use section 132 [of the lds book of scripture called doctrine and covenants] to justify crimes and deviant behaviors; to subvert and oppress their wives and their numerous offspring who have been indoctrinated from birth into believing that a loving god commanded such suffering and disparity, it adds.
garcia-navarro: i mean, this is very dramatic testimony from her. and so how does this intersect with princess haya?
i finally realized that i could not write an honest book without spending as much time on his thoughts and feelings and motives as i had with my mom. and what surprised me so much is how ready he was to go there. we dug through boxes together. we talked about some of his actions from back in the day that were really hurtful to other people. and he was, i think, very brave about it, acknowledging his role in it and also having a certain curiosity himself about both how he had acted and what drove him to act that way.
the first three years [of trump's term] have shown that an autocratic attempt in the u.s. has credible chance of succeeding, gessen writes. worse than that, they have shown that an autocratic attempt builds logically on the structures and norms of american government; on the concentration of power in the executive branch, and on the marriage of money and politics.
sagal: yes. he was in an event in los angeles. he was speaking to the agents. and there was a tv on, and it said, you know, comey fired. and apparently comey thought it was a prank. you know, one of those jolly little jokes where you sneak up behind somebody with an inflated balloon and then subvert the rule of law.
very few would argue that they'd want a man in a girls' bathroom, right? so it becomes very hard to counter them, said stone, who noted that some of the same language was used by opponents of gay rights in the 1970s.

president trump is pledging to repeal and replace the program with the help of congress. jennifer barfield doesn't know how she feels about that. it all depends on what obamacare is replaced with.
rubio's poor performance last saturday hurt him in new hampshire, where he finished a disappointing fifth. he needs a strong performance tonight to assuage concerns he's too scripted and too inexperienced. but if another candidate has a breakout performance, they could grab the momentum in south carolina. trump, for example, is already being attacked over his own personal life, much like gingrich was, but good parrying of those attacks could give him a lock in a state where he's already leading in polls.
wine-banks: no, that came from the testimony at the senate. and we heard it the same way that all americans heard it, which was on television. alexander butterfield was an aide to richard nixon who had been instrumental in installing the taping system. and a sort of happenstance question by one of the senate staffers on a friday revealed this, and it remained confidential and secret until monday, when it was publicly revealed in senate hearings.
it doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is, says cooper. the bottom line is that abstinence is the best and only proven way to keep yourself from getting a sexually transmitted infection or from getting pregnant. and so whether you're straight or trans or bi, the message is the same.
beyoncé and jay-z present a unified front on 'everything is love'
number two, with respect to my actions when i was a junior senator, you will recall that i never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. i never said that a nominee should not get a vote. and what i also said at the time was that i was concerned about some of judge alito's views that i considered more troubling. but in the case of merrick garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.
and the fact, look - i'm not a muscle-bound guy. i don't strike fear in the hearts of everybody, you know - when i have to, i try to unleash some sort of inner charm monster in order to get out of any uncomfortable circumstance.

but he testified from memory for days, and his memory was really incredibly accurate, as he testified about hush money payments and about perjury and the white house suborning perjury and about the approval of the break-in to begin with, which was done by members of the white house staff and the committee to reelect the president. so it was quite remarkable testimony.
demby: so one of the things that leaders all over the country are wrestling with is - you know, the president of the united states has used some very divisive rhetoric, right? and i'm curious as to how that's played out in birmingham. has that sort of animated and agitated a lot of these deep-seated inequities that you're talking about, this centers of power not being evenly distributed?

tucker: it's very impressive the way the music here shifts easily between hip-hop rapping and r&b vocalizing, between beyonce's deep-voice croon and jay-z's high-pitched exclamations. on lovehappy, the duo swaps lines back and forth, the lyrics playfully pointed. the first words of the song are happily in love, and they seem to have reached a point in their relationship where they can joke - very ruefully - about jay-z's infidelity.
palindromic dates have long been viewed as carrying special significance and even spirituality. adding to the universal appeal and rarity of sunday's date is its achieving the eight-digit palindrome pinnacle, working in the cross-cultural formats of mm-dd-yyyy and dd-mm-yyyy.
the fight began last spring, when some parents agitated to update the district's current sex ed program with something that they hoped would be more science-based and inclusive of lgbtq+ people.

and listening to the tapes that aren't relevant to the criminal prosecution, you can hear a lot of conversations between them that show their close personal relationship. her brother, by the way, was the sheriff of cook county. and he - joe woods - exchanged suits with richard nixon, and she exchanged clothes with pat nixon. she was known as aunt rose by both of the nixon girls, tricia and julie. and she was really a part of the family.
a spokesman for buttigieg, who was criticized by a prominent conservative christian leader this week for being gay, said he would consider attending.
and when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the senate saying, i won't meet with a nominee; i won't provide a nominee a hearing; i will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. that matters to people.

there are times when i struggle to remember what it was like to live in that world, but then i remember the dogs, and it becomes really clear, she says. there was the dog that i had when i was a boy. there was a dog for when i was a teenager. and there's one for when i was a cool college boy, and there was one for when i was a husband, and a boyfriend, and a father.

it's being investigated, it's being looked at very, very strongly, trump said, after cbs's lesley stahl asked whether the saudis had murdered khashoggi. and we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. as of this moment, they deny it and they deny it vehemently. could it be them? yes.
jones: viewing a kkk uniform at the civil rights institute. all you can really tell at first is that it was starched. some betty sue, marge, jane, some proper girl with a great black iron made those corners sharp. the hood, white and ablaze with creases, body flat and open for husband, brother, son. behind the glass it seems frozen, waiting for summer night to melt it into action, for the clean white flame of god to awaken its limbs. in front of it you are dwarfed. you imagine a pair of pupils behind the empty holes of the mask. behind the stiff cotton, would the eyes squint to see through small white slits, or would they open wide as a burning house to hunt you down until you pooled like old rope before them?
davies: this is fresh air. let's get back to the interview terry gross recorded with actor ray liotta. it's part of our end-of-summer series of favorite recent interviews.
many factors are contributing to this delay: people are staying in school longer, delaying marriage and having children later. this generation is just starting to buy homes, and kushi expects to see a wave of young buyers in coming years.
the kids write things like, is gender a social construct? and, for any of our facilitators with dysphoria, how does that affect your sex life? and, how does being sexually active affect you emotionally?
sanchez: (as raul mendez) the girlfriend never gave him up - tough girl. don't worry, i'll find him.
sanders: because, audie, we're friends. you probably already kind of know this. my love life is like the end of a michael bay movie. a lot of explosions...
jones: so i don't feel that my work with history is separate at all from my work as a poet or really just as a human being. i think that we all carry histories with us. there are so many histories that have made me possible. so i can't be from alabama and not know and tell that story of george wallace. i can't be a black woman and not tell the story of sally hemings. it's always with me all the time, and it makes me who i am. and as a poet, that's my job, to tell the story of humans. and so i have to, of course, have history in there all the time.
davies: jill wine-banks is a legal analyst for nbc. her book about her days as a lawyer in the special prosecutor's office investigating the watergate scandal is called watergate girl. we'll talk more after a short break. this is fresh air.

wine-banks: rose mary woods was eventually called his executive assistant. at the time, she was his secretary. but she had been with him from the time he was elected to the senate. she had met him when he was in the house of representatives and had been very impressed with how he turned in his reimbursement forms. he thought - she thought he was extremely neat and accurate. and he was impressed with her as well and was one of the first people he hired when he became a senator and one of the first people he brought into the white house after he was elected. and she was much more than an assistant to him. she really was an adviser.
gross: swell. so goodfellas, of course - a 1990 film. you played henry hill. and it's based on the nicholas pileggi novel, wiseguy, in which henry hill tells his whole story, starting from when he's a kid. and he aspires to be like the small-time gangsters in the neighborhood. he ends up being their assistant and ends up being, you know, really, like, a part of that whole ring and ends up in the witness protection program. i know that you listened to tapes of henry hill.
liotta: (as henry hill) really funny - you're really funny.
volz: well, first of all, so harvey was not a customer. he had sworn off drugs. but his camera shop, which was also his campaign headquarters, was one of my mom's regular stops because other people around him and who were working on his campaign were customers. so that was how that connection happened. but he was very much out in the neighborhood walking around, talking to people. he was very personable and very connected to the community. and so my mom knew him.
vanderplaats also has been, at times, a critic of trump's character and rhetoric — though he has largely supported trump's policies on issues like restricting abortion.
(soundbite of charlie mole's importance of being earnest front titles)
trump's list includes none of the conservative lawyers who practice regularly before the supreme court, nor does it include any of the highly regarded conservative judges who sit on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia, the court that the late justice antonin scalia served on, and on which obama nominee garland now serves as chief judge.
wine-banks: she kept all of his personal belongings exactly as they were, including an ashtray with a half-smoked cigar.
davies: and let's just explain for people who aren't watergate buffs. remind us who john dean was - yeah.

for many readers, comparing an elected american president to a russian dictator is simply beyond the pale. but if the comparison seemed strained a week ago, it seems less so on the morning after trump dressed down the governors of the affected states and brandished the threat of federal troops taking over their streets.
tucker: the music on everything is love relies on a constant contrast between instrumental lushness and verbal starkness. this is mass-market hip-hop designed to reach the widest possible audience. and i mean that as a compliment. it's a big, complex goal, one that very few music stars even try to attempt anymore.
besides his major postings, kuhn's journalistic horizons have been expanded by various short-term assignments. these produced stories including wartime black humor in iraq, musical diplomacy by the new york philharmonic in pyongyang, north korea, a kerfuffle over the plumbing in jerusalem's church of the holy sepulchre, pakistani artists' struggle with religious extremism in lahore, and the syrian civil war's spillover into neighboring lebanon.

i would explain to them how gender identity is your internal sense of what it is to be male or female. and then, for some people, their gender identity sometimes doesn't align with their biological sex, harp says. and kids — when they asked those questions — they were like, 'oh!' like it made sense to them.
jones: i've heard that before, and that doesn't make sense to me because we have to remember what happened and what is happening in order for it not to happen anymore. and i'm a teacher, too, so of course i want us to learn and relearn and relearn forever. we can't leave history as history. it's part of the present as well.
meraji: and special thanks to our volunteers tonight. we couldn't have done this without you.
sam rockwell: (as bob fosse) i saw a cut in the movie.
volz: she remembers one day in december of 1981 walking down castro street, making her deliveries. and in the window of star pharmacy, there was a poster that said gay cancer. and it had photographs of a man's legs and feet with little purple spots on them, which turned out to be kaposi's sarcoma. and my mom saw that poster and just thought, that's strange. i saw one of those spots on one of my friend's wrist today. it just was a little thing. and then, pretty quickly, people started to get sick.
my mom, upon receiving this information, after only dating the guy for three weeks, was a little taken aback. she wasn't looking to have a child. so there became a little push-pull between them for a while around the idea of this spirit child, which is, obviously, kind of a crazy thing to write about years after the fact, but i wanted to be true to my parents' visions of what was going on in their lives.
i'm tired of being called a child molester, because i'm not. i've never met a transgender person who is or have been. and i know that if i was in a bathroom and some pervert came in, he would be sorry about it, said gerri cannon, a transgender woman who met with lawmakers every day to keep the bill moving forward.
seattle mayor ed murray is being sued by a man who claims murray raped and molested him three decades ago, when the man was 15 years old.

why a day like sunday hasn't been seen in 900 years
liotta: i'm a big believer that the script is your bible. and the script - and a good one - tells you everything that you need to know. and i just committed to the script. i learned everything. i learned - i had so much time to learn it. and i was home in new jersey 'cause my mother was sick at the time. and marty was just getting ready to launch last temptation of christ. and so the movie was pushed so i had more time.

what i would say is that i had a bad marriage to a good man. right? i had a kind of marriage where i was not happy, and there was a lot going on that was less than freeing and less than true. but because he was a good man ... i had the kind of marriage that women are trained to be grateful for. ... i think, over and over again, there's sort of a gaslighting of women. it's everywhere. it's every time we admit that we want more, we're told we should just be grateful for what you have. it's the first story i ever learned about women, like the story of eve: if you want more and you go for it, you will destroy yourself and the world.

i'm sure that he is aware that, these days, massive advertising campaigns are mounted in opposition to candidates — not just for supreme court, but for appellate court judges.
meraji: and on our show - on code switch - we talk a lot about racial inequities in public education as well as the justice system. and i was just wondering - in those roles that you had before mayor, could you, in your own way, address those inequities?
donna: (laughs) i remember when we were at a military ball, and we were dancing. and the music had been fast, and then we went into a slow dance. and he was in ... his dress blues. and i remember how he would hold me. isn't it weird, i still remember what his lips feel like on my neck?
alqunun's story didn't end in that hotel room. with the help of the united nations high commissioner for refugees, which facilitated her application for asylum, alqunun is now in a safe place, she said.
klein: yeah, do it before you get to that third mic.
the latter is the power lie, or the bully lie ... the lie of the bigger kid who took your hat and is wearing it — while denying that he took it. there is no defense against this lie because the point of the lie is to assert power, to show 'i can say what i want when i want to.' 
meraji: mayor woodfin, there's a lot of nodding happening right here.
hanks: i enjoyed the confidence of actually, penny marshall. i had made two movies with her. the first one was big, which, you know, (laughter)...
klein: you do have a lot of red flags just up and down.
nina totenberg: mr. president, judge garland was runner-up twice before. so why now and not twice before?
hanks: (as alan clay) yeah, don't you know they can only kill me with a golden bullet. golden bullet, you know? you get it? it's lawrence of arabia.
liotta: yeah, my mouth was open really wide, laughing...
but at the moment, there's no target date for getting married either.
davies: now, this photo, ironically taken by white house photographers, kind of made rose mary woods a laughingstock because it showed her in this incredibly contorted position where she's stretching, holding her foot on a pedal and reaching for a phone. it just seems kind of ridiculous. did you have sympathy for her?
... we can let go of the expectations, and shoulds, and supposed-tos that the world gives us and just honor who we actually are and have always been.
a 'home baked' childhood: when the family business is marijuana brownies
we were not traumatized by the reality of them getting the divorce. we were just confused by the geography of it all because my mom could not afford to have four kids. my younger brother was born. she could take care of the baby. and my dad - he - at that time, he had to go off to reno and establish residency for six weeks. but - and he had a job, so he could afford to take the three of us. and so off we went, and we ended up living with a lady, and she had kids. and they ended up getting married, and they were married for a couple of years.

angela kelly, the group's director, spoke against the bill before the panel's vote on monday.
and as they planned all this and used unaccounted campaign money, which led to legislation that's been undone by citizens united, the supreme court case, they had so much money that they could spend it. and it's just very disturbing because i was raised to respect the president and the presidency, even if it wasn't someone that i agreed with politically. and so that was a - what i now see as a childhood vision that was just destroyed listening to the president committing crimes.
liotta: it was crazy. see, now, i've said that before. and i've done that on talk shows. and you're the only person who i've ever talked to who remembers the freddie.
liotta: i did. you know, i told that story...
one of the first battles was in new hampshire in 2009 and started out as, a really very simple extension of nondiscrimination protection to a class that isn't covered and needs to be covered, said state rep. ed butler, a democrat.
unidentified actor: (as character) oh, my god. are you ok?
philpott: it might be a political marriage of convenience. back when jeb bush was running in the republican presidential primary, he was candidate trump's whipping boy.
kuhn previously served two five-year stints in beijing, china, for npr, during which he covered major stories such as the beijing olympics, geopolitical jousting in the south china sea, and the lives of tibetans, uighurs, and other minorities in china's borderlands.
he may inadvertently have created perfect conditions for autocratic consolidation, gessen writes, a climate of more anxiety and fear of change. gessen quotes the 20th-century scholar hannah arendt, author of the origins of totalitarianism, who observed how future dictators used instability while at the same time dangling the promise of stability.
meraji: that totally touches on what i was thinking.
that passage appeared to refer to comments by trump about the plight of christians in the middle east, and to remarks by rudy giuliani, who told fox news that trump had wanted to impose a muslim ban but wanted advisers to find a way to do it legally. immigrants rights advocates said giuliani's words could offer them evidence to prove the administration had a discriminatory purpose.

the diversity visa lottery program goes back to the 1980s when its earliest version was created largely to benefit irish immigrants. in the 1990s congress changed the program so that anyone from a country that doesn't already send many immigrants here can apply.
it seems like there's like a debt spiral or something. when you get into a little bit of it, it just feeds back in on itself, and for us that started with student loans — that was our first debt, he says.
gross: how did that become the title for the record company?
the commission's report on the religious freedom vs. anti-discrimination debate, published last september, came down squarely on the anti-discrimination side. the commission recommended that civil rights protections ensuring nondiscrimination were of preeminent importance and that religious exemptions to such policies must be weighed carefully and defined narrowly on a fact-specific basis.
three days later, public protest was so dramatic, our office and the white house were inundated with bags of mail. this is in the era before email. there were telexes, but other than telexes, there was actual postal mail that we received and the white house received that led nixon to do a u-turn and say, ok, i'll hire a new special prosecutor. and i'll give you the tapes.
that was in parallel to the reality that a couple of teachers that i had, and also an awful lot of the adults, is that they talked about the war in a - literally - a three-act structure. and they described their lives, they told stories about their youths that were divided up into act one, before the war. well, you know, before the war, i lived in los angeles. and before the war, my dad was a farmer. and before the war, i was enrolled at mills college.

there's this whole myth of, 'oh, if you're a lesbian, honestly, just, like, go for it 'cause you can't get pregnant lol!'  jokes wilson. but it's not true — there's, like, risks and stuff that go into that, and i know that from going here. and like, lesbians wear condoms when they're having sex. people should know that. lesbians should know that!
cummings: (as rick halloway) i disagree.
douban: right? so, you know, i've talked to a lot of people about this - a lot of interracial couples, and there's a lot going on. long story short, it is not all that common, although it kind of depends on where you are. so if you are in the city birmingham, if you are on the campus of uab, not that big a deal, not that uncommon. but if you're in maybe coleman county or someplace like that...
totenberg: no. they're both constitutional decisions.
wine-banks: i think it was. and it's easier to say that as a nonpolitician, but i don't think that leaving a president who does the things that president trump has done unaccountable is acceptable. and yes, his acquittal means that he is now with no guardrails and may do even worse things in the next few months before the election. and if he happens to be reelected, his second term will be even more horrible in terms of violations of the law. so i think it was the right thing to do. i don't think it leaves him any stronger. over 80% of the country believes that there should have been witnesses, that there should have been documents, that this was a sham trial. and i think that what we're going to find is that americans are going to hold their senators responsible for cutting this off. to me, one of the most painful things was listening to the not guilties after senators had said, well, yes, he's guilty, he's done these things. yes, the evidence is overwhelming. they weren't just saying unimpeachable. they had to say the words not guilty, and that was just not correct.
volz: he takes, not dilantin, but another medication. i think it's tegretol. and he says he hasn't had a seizure in 20 years.
women in saudi arabia are treated like children, even if they are 50 or 60 years old. they treat women terribly. they aren't free or equal to their male counterparts, alqunun said. i hope my story prompts a change to the law especially as it has been exposed to the world. this might be the agent for change.
siegel: now, during the campaign, trump actually released lists of people who would be the kind of people he would nominate to the supreme court - 21 names i believe. what - who are they?

i was very used to a lacto-vegetarian hindu brahmin diet, and so i found it hard to eat american foods. so we would have to seek out restaurants that had rice — whether it was a chinese restaurant or a mexican restaurant, or whatever. and luckily we lived in new york city, and i experienced the city through my palate, and it was an exciting place to grow up as a child. it gave me great independence, but it also allowed me to really experience a lot of the world in a much less sheltered way than i would if i was living anywhere else.
3. debates could sway the race
sagal: now what do you do there in hickory?
from my earliest childhood memories i can remember being in the kitchen, and my grandmother and my aunts and my older cousins, and my mother, certainly, all taught me about food. i only found out recently from a scientist in seattle at the science museum that i am a supertaster, and i never knew that was actually a thing ... i bring it up because from a very early age, i was always very curious about eating foods that normally toddlers don't eat. very sour things like mango and tamarind, very bitter things like fermented foods or certain asian vegetables. and you know, you don't really give a bowl of fiery indian pickles to a 2-year-old! and yet i was climbing up on my grandmother's shelves in the kitchen like a monkey, sort of like a temple monkey, to try and get at the pickle jars ... i think my young palate needed that stimulation.
brennan: ...i'm going to go with a.
after those protests, the family leader said in a tweet, shouting protests, namecalling are not how christians are called to engage with our culture.
in 2009, he proposed the state expand its anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression to address transgender citizens' concerns about housing, employment, even physical safety.
one thing i, i do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the constitution might be ambiguous. what do they do to — to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? you know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.
davies: in october of 1973. as it happens, you were away on a wedding then, so you weren't in the office. but you did go back. and i want to just focus on that few days when, you know, two people - ranking people had been fired. the president was determined to shut down this investigation. you had an office with files and statements and all kinds of evidence. and you didn't know what was going to happen. were you - what kinds of conversations did you have among each other, and what did you do to protect yourselves?
but at age 31, mchale isn't living that dream. instead, he and his wife rent in danbury, conn., an hour's drive from the elementary school where he teaches, across the state line in new york.

sagal: oh, congratulations. well, landon, welcome to our show. let me introduce you to our panel this week. first up, it's a comedian performing this upcoming week - may 15 to the 21 - at the brad garrett comedy club at the mgm las vegas. it's alonzo bodden.
the first dog we had was this mulish, snarling, resentful dalmatian who was named — and i can't believe we named the dog this — playboy. ... playboy would steal the thanksgiving turkey off the table and chase after motorcycles and bite your friends. so, it was a difficult relationship. however, the one person in the world who loved playboy without reservation — and the feeling was mutual — was my father. ... he would just get down on the floor and ask that question that has haunted me my entire life: who's a good boy? who's a good boy? and i remember being very jealous in some ways of that dog, because my father could love this horrible dog without condition, whereas for me, it was harder, because i didn't know who was a good boy, but i knew it wasn't me.
not owning a home makes him feel he has made a mistake that has kept him short of a key milestone — and his piece of the american dream. mchale says he feels trapped by his and his wife's combined $1,200 monthly student loan bills, which prevent them from saving enough for a down payment.
in fosse/verdon, these two inhabit their roles completely and convincingly. the story isn't rolled out sequentially. it starts with the filming of sweet charity and keeps hopping backwards and forwards, revealing bits of their past a scene at a time. so i'm not doing any spoiling here by presenting a scene from when after the couple is separated but still seeking support and advice from each other. he visits her after a day working on the movie cabaret, and she welcomes him warmly at first, but not for long. any worries about this drama taking it too easy on the characters are instantly alleviated.
every time he tweets something, i just shake my head and say, 'oh god, please don't tweet anymore.' maybe they should take and dismantle his tweet account, meyer said.
ashley m. jones: i think in an interview once i said, well, we'll hose you down with the water where somebody else will just poison you with it. and, i mean, that's basically what it is.

hanks: well, no, i've been doing it for the last five years, but with varying levels of concentration.
douban: ...probably not going to find very many interracial couples.
brown-james: and then when you're together, you have all of that arousal built up so you can do what you want to do and you can be just a regular couple and hang out. like, we've done all the sexy things. we're tired. let's just eat pizza and watch netflix and hang out.

jack gentile: everyone has spent last year trying to get more comfortable being alone or being by themselves. and so now that the vaccine is starting to come out, we're sort of going back to normal. so how do you start to feel comfortable being with other people?
wine-banks: it does, and it's something that needs to be brought back to the supreme court to get a final ruling because there's no question that these are public records that should be turned over. there's no privilege and no reason not to have the witnesses and the documents. and it's very important if the american people are going to be able to know the truth and the facts. i'm very fact-based. and i can see information. people can evaluate and judge what it means to them, but at least they have the facts. and if the facts are withheld, you have nothing.

this moment in our history — a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol — i think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.
davies: now, i paid a lot of attention to this. and i remembered that as being what he actually said - yes, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong. when you actually got the tape, it didn't say that, did it?
gessen's perceptions about russia's people and politics are surely more valuable than those of americans who have never been there (or only visited briefly). but by the same token, average americans might well ask how much gessen really knows about the interior states or the interior life of most americans.

ken tucker, byline: you can listen to everything is love as the completion of a trilogy. in 2016, beyonce released her album, lemonade, which, among many other things, discussed an extramarital affair committed by a husband commonly thought to be her own. then in 2017, jay-z released his album, 4:44, in which, among many other things, he agonized and apologized for being unfaithful. now we get an album from the carters, jay-z and beyonce presenting themselves as a united front. husband and wife, committed partners and musicians.

the bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. the real argument is the one that you made, nina, which is that they don't want a democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a democrat to fill the seat.

after it actually happened, the discussion was, first of all, were we fired or was only archibald cox fired? and it appears that the office had been abolished, but we weren't actually fired. and so the discussion was, shall we quit in protest? and we basically decided, and archibald cox advised us, do not quit. that would give the president exactly what he wants. you know this case. you should never leave it unless you are forced out. as long as you can do your job, do it.
i was procrastinating. i had the movie in my head, but i wasn't writing it. but i noticed this trend in my life, which was that i was showing up to lunch meetings or business meetings, but i wasn't showing up to meet myself. so i wrote a note next to my bed — this is so corny, but i wrote, mike! you have an appointment at café pedlar at 7 a.m. with your mind! it's so corny, and i would show up! i never didn't show up, and i wrote this movie [in] spurts of essentially three hours, like i'd write from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., and the reason why i would do that is because i was essentially barely awake. because i feel like that moment, at 7 to 10 a.m., you're not afraid of the world yet.

ginsburg and breyer are among the court's liberals. the third, justice kennedy, is a generally conservative justice. but he's the author of the court's same-sex marriage decision. and he's been the deciding vote in upholding the right to abortion. so if any of those three goes, you will see dramatically more conservative rulings on these and other issues for a generation to come, at least.
hanks: well, you have your average sandstorm. that's a fascinating thing.
brennan: so - but it's - but how he died is hilarious.
i think it's not just the difference to male and female, it's the difference between being young and being middle aged. so maybe i'm the wrong person to observe those changes, but i try to live my life with courage as best i can. i'll be honest and say that tears live very close to the surface now when they didn't used to. maybe it's estrogen. maybe it's simply being older. ... you live long enough, you end up with a lot of arrows in your side. whatever the reason, it doesn't take much to get me weeping, and quite often weeping just because something wonderful has happened. so my emotions are definitely closer to the surface, but then everything is closer to the surface — and not only because of hormones, but because i'm living in the world with no secrets.
but most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. and they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.
and the whole business changed from when i first started. there were a lot of people that were getting movies that were coming out of television. you know, i started out really hot out of the box. then i've definitely had and up-and-down career. and when things started cooling off again, it frustrated me. so i was just watching what was going on. and that seemed to be the way things started to be going.

if the seminaries refuse to abide by the church's more stringent positions, they could conceivably lose some of their church funding. on the other hand, if they go along with those positions and alienate prospective students, they could also suffer.

you get points just for showing up, vander plaats said. and so i think our audience would embrace them.
the problem was all he did was eat potato chips. and if you've ever listened to anybody eat potato chips for, like, hours as he's talking, it's an extremely annoying thing (laughter). and the biggest thing that i learned from it was just how casual they were - how casual henry was about what happened. it was just like he was telling a story of what his kids were doing and how they played in a park, except they were talking about, you know, people getting killed or beaten. it was very, very casual, though.

at that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. and that damages people's faith in the judiciary — because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.
and nixon says, yeah, we could get a million dollars. and the version that we first heard of this came from one of the president's, you know, inner circle, bob haldeman, at the senate hearings in which he said, yeah, the president said, yes, we could get a million dollars, we could get it in cash, but it would be wrong.

brennan: well, no, i had to - it was between emotional mics or just doing - becoming a mime.

democrats head to nevada first, feb. 20th, but they are already trying to appeal to the largest block of voters in the state — african americans. that was apparent at the democrats' debate thursday night. hillary clinton hopes to rebound from a drubbing in new hampshire at the hands of bernie sanders.
and i feel badly that the president let her believe that she did it, that the white house blamed her. they withdrew. she was represented initially by white house counsel. they withdrew that and made her hire a private attorney and - which is probably the right thing because if they actually were blaming her, ethically, they shouldn't represent her.

the other one is, i think, something that is real to all of us, the shark terror of a loss of confidence in ourselves. no matter who we are, no matter what we've done, there comes a point where you think how did i get here and am i going to be able to continue this? when are they going to discover that i am, in fact, a fraud and take everything away from me? it's a high-wire act that we all walk. and i do this in the work that i do because there are days when i know that 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, i am going to have to deliver some degree of emotional goods. and if i can't do it, that means i'm going to have to fake it. and if i fake it, that means they may catch me at faking it. and if they catch me at faking it, well, then it's just doomsday.

among the questions: when does an invitation or a cake qualify as free speech?
hanks: ...kind of like merchandising-hit-thing, and there used to be a record player that you could buy for kids, and every kid wanted. it was called a close-and-play record. you would just put a record on the turntable, you would close the lid and somehow, magically, the needle would land in the groove. and so i took that and turned it into playtone. but i never thought anything of it until i saw what the graphic artist did with the name. when you make a movie as a director, they'll throw you all this reference material. they say, hey, you need to pick out a logo for the company playtone so we can start putting it up on the walls and use it in the stationery and what have you. and as soon as i saw the logo that they had i said, oh, well if i ever form a company, i got to call it playtone.
olympia, wash. – the washington democratic party says it will donate contributions from controversial spiritual leader jz knight to the anti-defamation league and the campaign to uphold gay marriage. that announcement late friday follows the release of new video clips that show knight making offensive and at times bizarre comments about gay people and people from mexico.

and in this way, the brownies were really all over town. by late 1977, i think, is when they were doing 10,000 brownies a month. it was smart in that there was no fixed location for police to find. the brownies seemed to come from everywhere. and at the same time, it enabled them to reach all of the little culture pockets that were flourishing in the late '70s.

the attorney general said i promised congress i would not do it without cause, and there is no cause. i will not do it. so he was fired. and the deputy attorney general became attorney general and was ordered to fire cox. and he also refused, and he was gone. the third person in charge was the solicitor general, who became the acting attorney general, and he carried out the order.

woodfin: right. now, i think everyone here who was in birmingham know we've seen growth in several places. you can't necessarily control gouging of rent. but what you can do is put things in place just to make sure residents have notice, longer notice. and there are other legal ways and creative ways you can create to make sure residents aren't displaced.
gessen says putin and trump were elected president without really wanting the job. they ran not for president but for autocrat, and they did not expect to settle for anything less. putin has been in office 16 years, is on track for four more and is maneuvering to secure another eight thereafter. trump has retweeted pictures of prospective campaign signs that say trump 2024 and trump 2028 and so on into the future.

as you moved into the '80s, the brownie business changed in a way, right? it wasn't just recreational because it became a way to ease the suffering of people afflicted with aids. and this was at a time when the epidemic was, you know, poorly understood scientifically. there was little treatment. and it was, you know, deeply associated with homophobia. as your mom made these trips to the city, how did the epidemic present itself to her?
wine-banks: it mostly complicated things, i would say. we had to be very careful to pay attention to what the senate was doing because we didn't want them giving immunity to anyone we felt should be prosecuted. we had to make sure that no one told us one story and the senate something else.

we have a lot of our dreams tied up in our children, and it is hard to understand the obvious, which is that your children aren't here to live your dreams. your children are here to live theirs. when i came out to my own mother 20 years ago, she was 85. she was an evangelical christian. she was a republican, and i had a pretty good sense that my coming out as trans was not going to strike her as the greatest thing that had ever happened to her — and yet i came out to her. i told her the story and i started to cry. and she got up out of her chair and she put her arms around me and she said, i would never turn my back on my child. i will always love you. and i said, but, mom, won't it be a scandal when everyone finds out that i'm your daughter now? and she said, well, quite frankly, yes, but i will adjust. and then she quoted first corinthians and said, the greatest of these is love. she said to me, love will prevail, and in large measure, it has in my life. so in some ways what i'm trying to do for my own daughter is to follow the example that my own mother set for me and to allow love to prevail.
meraji: you're not making things up. all right. we have one last question. it comes from a listener named mallory mitchell (ph). she's 26. she's black. she's originally from alabama, and she has a question regarding mayor woodfin's election. let's hear it.
you can choose to have whatever opinion you have on the president's statement today condemning white supremacists, but it's hard to believe he would have read it out if he'd had his druthers. no, the real donald trump was the one we saw on saturday when he decided to condemn violence 'on many sides' in response to the deliberately provocative and intentionally violent neo-nazi march in charlottesville, virginia; when he decided to refer to the events as 'sad' in tweets; when he wished 'best regards' to those injured by the car that was deliberately smashed into them, killing 1 and injuring 20. when he acted in that way, he was operating according to his instinct. and his instinct said: do not attack the white supremacists.

davies: i wanted to just ask about the current president. i mean, it's clear that you believe from the facts and the law that impeachment and removal for office was warranted. as it turned out, you know, the refusal of the senate to consider additional testimony and evidence and the swift acquittal of president trump has left him in a perhaps stronger position than he might have been without it. certainly, that's the view of mitch mcconnell, who said that this was a political blunder for the democrats. you know, your area is law, not politics. but i'm just wondering, was it wise, do you think, for house democrats to pursue the course they did?

before louise even figures out how to talk to the heptapods, she must square off against a hawkish military. for some reason, the fate of the entire world comes to rest on a stereotypical warmongering chinese general named shang who wants to start blasting before he even knows the aliens' intentions, let alone capabilities. it's so clunky. thank heaven for amy adams who makes even the silliest parts of the movie work. she's a grounded actress, direct, plain-spoken, but there's also something brittle about her, mysteriously brittle, as if there's been some trauma in her past and she can't quite breakthrough into the moment. that quality is perfect for louise, who seems to be searching for self as well as scientific knowledge. when the aliens arrive, she's in mourning for a lost daughter who's seen in dislocating flashes. somehow the heptapods hold the key to her past. her eyes come alive when she first beholds their writing, which looks like exquisite ink paintings on air currents that seem like water, as if squids were doing japanese calligraphy. when the revelations come, they're shocking and very moving. you just have to put that other part of arrival with the b-movie general out of your mind. the film is an inadvertent demonstration that hollywood studios and visionary science fiction writers inhabit a different time-space continuum.

news outlets in new hampshire media began using the phrase bathroom bill in their coverage of the bill, which focused the debate even further on bathrooms.
edelstein: louise's intrigued. who wouldn't be? and what follows is a tantalizing puzzle. she goes to the alien ship. her body is sucked into a long, vertical entryway where she has to adapt to changes in pressure and gravity. then she moves into a dark chamber where the aliens - they're dubbed heptapods - melt out of a mist behind a transparent partition. the strangeness is intoxicating. the director, denis villeneuve, has a gift for making that kind of strangeness seem like the human condition, the real reality. as in his films incendies, prisoners and sicario, he mixes penetrating closeups with chill, blurred backgrounds. it's as if his characters live in a void where they're forced to rethink everything they thought they knew. what louise senses is that her job won't be to learn a new vocabulary. mastering the heptapod syntax might require a change in our brains, which might even end up challenging the concept of linear time. arrival is based on the story of your life, a short story by the brainy sci-fi cult author ted chiang, and the part of the movie that's closest to its source is great stuff. chiang's story isn't really about an invasion. the invasion is a device for exploring what happens as we move from a universe of newtonian cause-and-effect into the realm of quantum physics. that idea is in the film, and it's riveting. but there's another equally insistent plot straight from the '50s sci-fi b-movie playbook.

americans are suddenly consumed with multiple crises. even before the outbreak of social unrest following yet another african american's death in police custody, the ravages of covid-19 and economic free fall had disrupted the national life.
so i talk about my father and i reconciling, and confronting him about this moment was very difficult. it was difficult for me, and it was difficult for him. it upset him. and one of the things that i think really helped us come back together is that when this happened, he got very quiet, and he asked who was saying it. and when i said that it was both cheryl and my mom who had told me this, he accepted it and took some ownership for the action. it made him very sad, you know, to think of having done that, right? i thought it was very brave of him to allow that to be the story.
dickinson: contractors at los alamos made the big switch recently from clay-based litter to the organic green kind. and like so many well-intentioned ideas, this one blew up, literally, in a mini mushroom cloud of blame.
jay-z: (rapping) sir acid, like his dad's, [expletive] is trippy.
although trump speaks frequently about the forgotten men and women of this country, trotter doesn't think he's talking about her.
gross: ...he wanted to be the guy that could park - like, double-park in front of the hydrant. and you're not going to get a ticket, you know?
klein: and it's not about winning or losing.
martin: so in this country, laws saying you can't discriminate against people and offering public services were very hard won, as i think many people will remember. but they've been on the books for decades, so i think some people might ask, why is this any different from someone who is refusing to serve black people at a lunch counter, for example, or at a restaurant? what's the difference?
woodfin: first thing is this - is that i'm not. like, we're not going to use our police to do anything around what i call rounding up people. we just don't believe in that. i don't believe in that as mayor. i've had a clear, direct conversation with my police chief. i've had a clear and direct conversation with my chief of our city jail. we're not in that business.
when 2011 began, the worst recession in two generations was technically over, but annica trotter, ray meyer, and jennifer and brian barfield were unemployed and searching for work. six years later, their experience demonstrates life doesn't just snap back to normal after a job loss. their economic recovery remains incomplete and in some ways their story is america's story.
we had a very candid conversation. he's chief judge of the d.c. circuit, so i assume that he either reads the washington post or listens to npr, and i think had a pretty good sense of the posture that majority leader mcconnell took immediately after justice scalia's passing — the notion that the republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.
liotta: (as joey perrini) look, the girl i married was named kit farrell, right? she never existed, so everything that we did just didn't really happen. i'm not mad about it or anything else. that's just the way i want things. that's all.
sanders: i should have just brought my questions for the good doctor because i got a few.
it felt kind of magical, trotter said, that i was witnessing history and also that my daughter would have a connection to that history by having the name of one of the first daughters.
not all faith leaders are convinced, however, that the push for lgbt rights is jeopardizing the religious freedom of people who hold conservative beliefs about sexuality and marriage.
demby: i mean, can you do it?
in a statement, the white house called yates, an obama administration holdover with 27 years of experience prosecuting corrupt public officials and the man who bombed the atlanta olympic park, weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.
wine-banks: she was feisty for sure. we definitely had a situation where i knew that nothing that i got from her would be easily obtained, that i was going to have to be very precise and careful in my questioning to get information. but at the first time, she wasn't suspected of having done anything. i, by some amazing coincidence, asked her questions that turned out to be devastating once we found out that she had possibly erased 18 1/2 minutes of a tape because she had told me about working on it for 29 hours at camp david - that very tape - without ever mentioning that, oh, by the way, there was an 18-minute gap in that tape.
gessen says the institutions and traditions americans thought would protect them have proven weak because they were not built to withstand a personality such as trump. the author had little faith that robert mueller's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election would be the magic bullet that would rid washington of trump. instead, gessen writes, it drew attention away from what trump was doing in plain view ... ignoring and destroying all institutions of accountability ... degrading political speech ... using his office to enrich himself ... courting dictator after dictator ... promoting xenophobic conspiracy theories.
and now some questions about the incoming trump administration - some potentially big issues before the supreme court and trump's progress toward nominating a ninth supreme court justice. for this, i'm joined by npr legal affairs correspondent nina totenberg. hi, nina.
hanks: yeah, it - that along with attention deficit disorder made me what i am today.
'rogue killers' may have murdered saudi journalist, trump suggests
gross: i know you were adopted at the age of about six months. how important to you was it to find out who your birth parents were, or at least who your birth mother was? was that an issue for you? did you pursue that, and did that affect your life?
gross: but you wrote it from the point of view of, like, teenagers in a band.
cummings: (as rick halloway) but it did exist. and your loving each other and caring about each other existed, too.
the civil affairs administration said the registration process involves an official portrait, requiring people to remove their masks, a move deemed too risky in the outbreak that's infected more than 14,000 people and killed more than 300.
she says it started just a year or two into their marriage when michael began acting strange.
leah abrams: i grew up and i spent my whole life in north carolina, where race and identity played integral roles in my upbringing. yet, being in alabama, i feel like i've noticed that race and segregation are more explicitly entrenched in daily life. in particular, a friend talked about being warned from a young age not to talk to white women because of his county's violent legacy of lynching black men for even looking at white girls. i feel like i haven't met many interracial couples in my time here at all. is it really that taboo to be in an interracial relationship in alabama? if so, why?
well, there's no doubt that what played a role, as i said earlier, was that, number one, i think he's the best person for the job. number two, i think he's a consensus builder. and the court would benefit from that at the moment.
liotta: it could be. i don't know. all i can say is my career has been up and down. and i like it much better being up. and when it's up, part of that is people coming up to you and saying things. i remember when i first started - like, i'm an actor. i don't want that sort of thing. all - i just wanted - it's all about the work. and that's just a bunch of b.s.

this is fresh air. the iranian film the salesman is one of the five nominees for this year's foreign language academy award, which will be presented at the end of february. but the writer and director, asghar farhadi, has said he won't attend the ceremony because of president trump's travel ban. farhadi won an oscar for his 2011 film a separation. film critic david edelstein has this review of the salesman.

i feel that if i came across president trump, he would disregard me, trotter said. who am i to him? i'm a poor person, even though in my world i've done what i need to do to elevate my income and financial status.
volz: in retrospect, sure, of course. i feel in general that marijuana is relatively harmless. it's certainly not something that should be consumed by children. and i want to be clear that i don't think i was tottering around stoned during my childhood. i was certainly discouraged from consuming marijuana as a kid. it was grown-up stuff. that was something that i understood.
the 18-year-old saudi woman who secured asylum in canada hopes other women will be inspired to follow in her footsteps.
after a widely circulated draft order aroused considerable opposition from the lgbt community, no further action was taken. asked recently whether such an order might still get signed, white house spokesman sean spicer said only that trump will continue to fulfill commitments he had made. advocates for executive action say they do not expect new developments until trump's nominee for the supreme court, neil gorsuch, has been confirmed.
in the wake of that accident — it turned out to be a drunk driver, and i assumed that that driver would pay for my car, but it wasn't that. it was the opposite. somehow in the paperwork and the police work or whatever, i was made to pay for the other driver's car. the unfairness of it really spun me out. i ended up in this crazy — i mean, i got a subscription on netdetective.com, where i'm looking up the other driver's name and i considered calling him at one point, directly, being like, this is insane! and there's lawyers involved, and it really spun me out, and at a certain point i realized that this is not going to resolve.
he went in high gear and it was so fast for me, barfield said, referring to the president's flurry of executive actions in the early days of his presidency. i was saying in my head, 'slow down, slow down ... let some dust settle here from that last thing you signed before you sign another big thing.' 
gross: so you were exposed to several religions as a kid. and now, is there any that you practice? is there any kind of faith or religion through which you kind of contemplate the great mysteries?
wine-banks: i said, well, then let's go to your office and continue the questioning. and for some reason, the court agreed. the white house lawyers agreed. and her lawyers agreed. and so we went to the white house. it was my first time ever in the white house. and she demonstrated they would not - they, the white house - would not let us bring in a photographer.
gross: so you told us about the potato chip-eating interviews on cassette that you listened to of henry hill. did you meet him in person, like, in a secret location when he was in the witness protection program?
robinson is a high school senior in allendale, mich., a small but growing town about 30 minutes outside grand rapids and smack dab in the middle of what's known as the state's bible belt. drive off the main road and you quickly find yourself in farm country.
if i'm a u.s. citizen and i have a brother or sister in the philippines that i want to sponsor for a green card, that brother or sister will have to wait over 20 years, says cornell law professor stephen yale-loehr. and why should they have to wait that long when someone else can waltz into the united states in one or two years under the diversity program?
wine-banks: it does. and i hate to draw parallels to today, but how can you not when you look at what attorney general william barr did in terms of the mueller report and so many other things? he misled the public and withheld the actual facts until the narrative had been set and people accepted it. and then when the truth came out, people were - well, he said, and i believe that, even though that was completely untrue.
murray, 61, is a progressive mayor, and has been serving in that role since 2014. he had previously served in the state legislature for 18 years, where he led a long campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in washington. as mayor, he pushed through a measure to raise seattle's minimum wage to $15 an hour.
liotta: who knows? maybe my - i got light eyes. i'm from new jersey, and i curse a lot. (laughter) i don't know.
totenberg: actually, the opposite - the longer a decision is in place, the more weight it has. and in the case of abortion, that decision has been repeatedly reaffirmed over a period of 43 years - versus the same-sex marriage decision, which is just 17 months old. and, indeed, while the court has fleshed out how far states can go in regulating abortions, it's not fleshed out how far states go in discriminating against same-sex couples on religious grounds.
kurtis: trust me, i'm an expert.
davies: right. now, this was the so-called saturday night massacre, right?
canada's acceptance of alqunun could further fray its relations with saudi arabia, which had already been tense since the summer, npr has reported. the saudi government expelled the canadian ambassador and recalled its own after canada's foreign minister criticized saudi arabia's arrest of a human rights activist.
davies: was your mom ever recognized, officially, for any of this stuff?
gross: when we left off, we were talking about goodfellas. and you had mentioned the scene, which is a very famous scene - the laughing scene, in which you and a bunch of the small-time gangsters that you hang out with, including tommy, who's played by joe pesci - you're at your favorite, like, restaurant, bar, hangout.
gross: ...which means, you know, having to regulate your diet. are you obsessive about your body when something goes wrong or can you just kind of keep that in the background and not worry about it?
pifer: my friend still needed care. and so i just kind of upped the hours i worked with her. she's a person living with alzheimer's who experienced the loss of her best friend. so together, i mean, we were just a bunch of debbie downers (ph).
did you talk to him about being a piñata, as sen. cornyn put it?
universities' local party representatives, backed by an emboldened public security apparatus, increasingly call the shots at school. when yang shaozheng, a former economics professor at guizhou university, came under fire in 2018 for writing and commenting critically on chinese politics, public security officials called him in and reprimanded him.
the jonestown massacre and the assassinations of milk and moscone happened within 10 days of each other. it was like a one-two punch. it just knocked san francisco completely sideways. i mean, 918 people dead in one day. and then these two very important and beloved civic leaders ten days later. for my mom, it was a seismic shift, a feeling of everything is changing. she describes becoming aware, in an instant, that the wave that they had been riding was about to crash.

the bill was approved by tennessee lawmakers in april and would stipulate that licensed counselors not be punished if they refer clients to other therapists over sincerely held principles, as nashville public radio has reported. lgbt advocates say the bill would make it harder for gays and lesbians to get counseling.

daniel hoffman-zinnel, executive director of one iowa, an lgbtq rights group, expressed mixed feelings about the invitation to democratic candidates.
well in fact, the american people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the united states with sufficient electoral votes. and they also decided that the republicans would be in the majority. they didn't say, we're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. they said, no, you're the president for four years, and mr. mcconnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the senate.
wine-banks: even to this day i remember how devastated and disappointed i was listening because imagining can never be as bad as actually hearing the president committing crimes. and it's not just the expletives, deleted language that was disturbing, but it was the fact that in the oval office, these conversations were taking place about paying hush money to make sure that the watergate burglars never said that they were hired by the white house and the committee to reelect, that they were told to commit perjury. one of them was told to leave the country.
greene: got to start with the joker. right?
pesci: (as tommy devito) no, no, i don't know. you said it. how do i know? you said i'm funny. how the [expletive] am i funny? what the [expletive] is so funny about me? tell me - tell me what's funny.
demby: he's all b-ham everything. b-ham, right? b-ham.
hanks: but i what i did recognize is that something like that - and i guess it's all relative for all of this - might have been good for me. and i use the word good in the form of, it would've been transforming for me. let me tell you - when we were doing forrest gump in south carolina, which is right next to parris island, you know, camp lejeune, south - the marine corps training camp.

a utah bill that would reduce polygamy among consenting adults from a felony to an infraction — on par with a traffic ticket — was unanimously endorsed by a state senate committee earlier this week, despite opposition from critics who argue the law could potentially protect abusers.
and i was down in my career. so to take on something if it didn't work - maybe it would make things worse. and then i said, wait a second. the whole point of me doing this is to take on challenges, to keep growing as an actor and not really caring - one of the biggest downfalls for any actor is fear of judgment. and so if you start acting and you start thinking about and worrying about what other people are going to say about it, you'll never really fully commit to who it is and what it is that you're playing.
klein: well, neal, it's time to play a game that we're calling...
but the illnesses varied a lot. and there was a long time when nobody knew what it was. some people got the pneumocystis carinii. some people had the wasting syndrome and terrible diarrhea. some people had the kaposi's sarcoma lesions. the variety of presentations of the symptom made the onset very mysterious. and it didn't get a lot of press at first because it emerged first within the gay male population. and this was a community that broader society was maybe eager not to look at and not to acknowledge.
gessen cites an array of scholars in this, the writer's 11th book. one is hungarian sociologist bálint magyar, who has described the present condition of his own country as a mafia state, ruled by a crime family in which one man distributes money and power to all other members. (viewers of the sopranos will understand how this model works.) magyar also identifies three stages by which a ruler is transformed into an autocrat: the attempt, the breakthrough and the consolidation.
all of which means conditions are ripe for president trump to assume more power and move closer to the status of autocratic ruler, says new yorker writer masha gessen in a new book surviving autocracy.
justice scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. but if you think about when the supreme court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. and judge garland, if you look at his work on the d.c. circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. and i think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by republicans.
donna: he always had an inordinate amount of patience. the first three weeks of your life you were this tiny delicate little bundle and you just slept on his chest.
beyond that, willing to wait failed to address one issue that weighed heavily on robinson: how gender dysphoria can make sex for a trans person really complicated — married or not.

siegel: now, if president obama's nominee merrick garland had been confirmed, that would've made an immediate difference in the ideological makeup of the court. but that's not going to be so with this nomination, now that trump is going to be president, whoever it ends up being, right?
bodden: do you think it took trump this long to fire comey because he just found out he could?
gross: so if it was a big issue in your mind, emotionally, that you were given up - that you were given up for adoption - and if that hung over you for a lot of your life, and you felt rejected as a result, did you ever have a long talk with your parents about adopting you? or was it like they told you you were adopted, you knew you were adopted, and then you just didn't talk about it?
davies: you know, your dad had a habit of not taking his medication for epilepsy, which led to some really troubling and bizarre incidents at times. it was one point where he said he had to go off hitchhiking to meet the dalai lama. and other things like that happened. do you have insight into why he chose not to take the medicine for the epilepsy?

trump's additional list, coming just days before the first debate, suggests he wants to add diversity to his earlier all-white list of eight men and three women. the second list, like the first, consists of bedrock conservatives, many with records hostile to abortion rights, same-sex marriage and federal regulations.
justice kennedy was confirmed by ronald reagan, and i'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. but ultimately, he was confirmed. and he was confirmed in the last year of president reagan's office. so we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the supreme court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the supreme court, but the integrity of the senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.
gessen objects repeatedly to the reluctance of legacy newspapers and broadcasters (including npr) to call the president a liar (or for that matter, a racist). even when pointing out the inaccuracies and falsehoods the president peddles, traditional journalists balk at terms such as lie and liar. in part, the idea is to keep the door as wide open as possible to attract and retain as wide an audience as possible. gessen understands this reasoning but says it allows the liar or the racist to persist and normalizes such behavior until it appears less objectionable — or simply not objectionable at all.

of the four people npr visited in st. louis last week, trotter is the only one who didn't vote for trump in november.
in some ways, the biggest change is not going from male to female. the biggest change is going from someone who has a secret to someone who doesn't have a secret. and if you have a secret that is as profound as the question of who you are, it's something that's going to eat at you all the time. so it used to be i'd wake up in the morning and i'd think, ok, we're gonna do the guy thing again now. and now i wake up in the morning and i don't think about it. in a way, gender has become something i think about a whole lot less.
then they will tell stories about act two of their lives, which is, well, that was during the war. and that was during the war meant, is that we were in stasis. we didn't know what was going to happen. i found myself - my dad found himself studying hydraulic engineering for the navy in pocatello, idaho. and then was shipped off to some place in the south pacific. and during those five years, the future was a big x. it was a mathematical formula that had not been seen through.
volz: not back then, and i'll tell you why - she never got busted. and so she certainly wasn't going to announce herself in the press. and one of the things that's interesting in the brownie mary and mer the brownie lady confusion - so they were both part of the same zeitgeist. well, poor brownie mary kept getting busted. and she had a wonderful way of handling the press. she was grandmotherly and funny, very, very witty and adorable. and the press just loved her. they just ate it up. and so she, possibly more than anyone, was responsible for bringing the concept of medical marijuana to broader society. and my mom, meanwhile, stayed underground. she didn't get busted. she didn't go to the press. but she worked throughout all of these years to get edibles to people who needed them.

gross: so if you don't mind my asking - i know your father died recently. and i'm very sorry about that.
hanks: so that's about the only decent self-defense mechanism i have that i'm any good at it. but for all the characters i play, i think - i would like to think that the audience is able to get the same thing that i seek for from an audience, which is the question of seeing a movie and then go what would i do? what mistakes would i be afraid of making in the same circumstance?
hanks: well, first it's the dilemma that alan clay is in, which is a dilemma, i think, of our time. if you're going to sum it up in one word and one word only, you would say, alan clay is dealing with china. the fact that china has taken away the companies that he's worked for, the living that he used to make, and it's representative then of all the other failings that he's experienced in his life. he's divorced. he's got a kid. he can't afford college - college for her. and he's now taken whatever skill set he had, which is really, basically, selling things, and he is going to have to go off to a place as alien on the planet earth as i think mars is in the solar system, the kingdom of saudi arabia - accent on kingdom.
in addition to patrick, they had a daughter, nicole mckenna.
but he's not — he's not a pol.
woodfin: yeah. definitely. so i would agree with her that microaggressions exists in birmingham. but i think college is one of the best places to explore issues of race and ethnicity, et cetera because, even from morehouse - being an all-male, all-black campus - it's one of the most diverse places i've ever been to. i spent four years there. this is the time for her, personally, to address that microaggression, but at the same time, colleges and universities across our nation - i think uab can be a center of that to talk about this.
liotta: i've been taken care - for weeks, i'm being taken care of by this nurse. well, like i just say, this nurse - i end up falling for her. and i end up marrying her but then eventually find out that she was the richest woman in america. and she said that she had a different name than what it is that she had. so me being - i was playing the nicest guy in the world, joey perrini. that's why, again, these tough guys in something wild and all this stuff is kind of funny because in the soap i was really principled and religious. and because she lied to me, i got an annulment. and who wouldn't?
sarah hyland: (as haley dunphy) we're really not that old.

demby: so when we got this question, we decided to do a little digging. and according to a report from the pew research center, metro areas in the south are the least likely to have new marriages be between people of different races. the birmingham hoover metro, in particular, was in the bottom 10 for new interracial marriages in the whole country. only about 6 percent of newlyweds in birmingham are interracial couples. anybody want to guess where the no. 1 - no. 1 metro area for interracial marriages is in the united states? just take a wild guess.
tony cummings: (as rick halloway) go ahead.
the couple filed a complaint with the state's civil rights commission, which found phillips was violating the state's anti-discrimination laws that prohibit businesses from discriminating against lgbtq people.
liotta: (as matt wozniak) let me explain to you how this works. i tolerate you because you keep your business contained and you don't cause me any aggravation. we both know that if i brought you down tonight, some punk phoenix would rise from your ashes. and i'm already starting to like him better. how's that for a reminder?

liotta: you want people to watch what you're doing. what's the point? there's a personal side to me of challenges as an actor that i like to take on myself. and i do certain things that, maybe, nobody else knows why i'm doing. but it's all - it all has to do with - to grow as an actor. i really believe that you never stop learning. and you never really ever get there. just like in life, the older you get - you don't arrive at - it's all right, i'm 60 now. i've arrived. it's not true.
it feels especially bad when he compares himself with his father's generation. neither his father nor his uncles were burdened by student loans. they all owned a house and had their full-time jobs by the time they were like 21, mchale says.

i didn't know that hiv was technically preventable cause of, like, prep, he says. it's possible to have hiv but not be able to transmit it. so, when i first found out, i was like, 'are you joking?' and i found out at the pride center, which is honestly shameful to the public school system.

woodfin: you're right. there's a massive amount of, not just poverty, but concentrated poverty in the city of birmingham. when we think about everything in the '50s and '60s around - the intentionality around housing, housing discrimination, it wasn't just at the local level. it actually started at the federal level. and it was at the state level as well. and those policies were enacted at the local level. and then, when there was a final breakthrough in the late '60s, we all know white flight took place. the national realtors association talked about how when that happened across the entire city of birmingham - and other cities in america, too - property value went down. suburban - more suburban america came online. that includes the fragmentation of jefferson county, more - expanding of other municipalities in - suburban municipalities outside of the city.

writing for the new yorker, jelani cobb parsed trump's initial response further:
i feel that if i came across president trump, he would disregard me. who am i to him? i'm a poor person, even though in my world i've done what i need to do to elevate my income and financial status.
davies: well, and what's fascinating is that, you know, your dad - i mean, you write about this in the book - because he would sometimes not take his medication, he's had some really difficult mental episodes, and his memory is not reliable. and when you went to ask him, is this true that you went to a gay bathhouse after your child was born, what was his reaction?

earlier in the week, the mayor's spokesman said the suit was politically motivated. it is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline, jeff reading said in a statement reported by the associated press.

at this point, of course, one must wonder who gessen means by we. one impression easily taken from surviving autocracy is that trump has been visited on americans by some mysterious force or personal magic. there is a lack of focus on the manner by which trump, as opposed to putin, came to office.

gardner: arab ruling families are particularly watchful over the female members of the family. the men have a - far more freedom, but the honor of the family rests with the women. this is why it's really kind of lifted a bit of a lid on the gilded palace life. it's very clear from the testimony in the video of sheikha latifa that she was in a kind of gilded cage. now, many people would say she had every possible luxury, what - she wanted for nothing. but she, obviously, didn't want to be there. she wanted to get away and live a normal life, and that wasn't being offered to her. the same happened to sheikha shamsa, another sister who tried to escape in 2000 and is now in dubai, back in the palace.

gessen sees trump's term so far as the autocratic attempt, his re-election as a prospective breakthrough and a second term as the green light to consolidate his power.
south carolina is famous for its rough-and-tumble politics — in 2000, for example, there was a whisper campaign that john mccain had fathered a black child. he wound up losing to eventual president george w. bush. it derailed his candidacy. with as wide a field as this one, and the stakes being so high, watch out for more dirty tricks. the primary will likely further winnow the gop side. donald trump has a big lead in the polls; ted cruz is hoping to win over socially conservative voters in the northwestern part of the state; jeb bush, marco rubio and john kasich are contending for the significant portion of establishment republicans.
now, you think, well, that's an intimidating prospect. but we ended up shooting in it (laughter), so we used it as a location for one of the - a couple of the scenes from our movie. so right there it's like - it's a mosque - are we allowed to be there? well, in fact, yes, you are. and, in fact, you can bring your movie crew and shoot a scene in there.

gross: that's ray liotta and joe pesci in a scene from goodfellas. so that's such a crazy scene. like, the joe pesci character is so crazy. like, that's an example of it because you had every reason to think that he was actually threatening you because that's how crazy he is. there's a scene where he shoots the michael imperioli character in the foot just kind of for no reason and later just kills him. so what was behind that scene? like, what's the difference between how that scene looked in the original script and how it looked on screen?
gross: what did you want to watch? what were your favorite tv shows that made a lasting impression on you?
and they - it wouldn't be the people that i would normally hang out with. and i didn't care what they thought 'cause here i am thinking, i'm just going to be here for one year. it doesn't matter. so for some reason, i just really committed and listened to what bucket said. and thank god he was an acting teacher who was - it was kind of the stanislavski, you know, the russian director and acting teacher. i just listened to what he said and kind of understood and just learned.

volz: oh, absolutely. so there had been, since maybe the mid-'70s, the beginnings of a medical marijuana movement. but it really had not made it into the press in a significant way. and it was very small. and marijuana was still, in the american consciousness, not considered a medicine. it was considered a party drug. well, the situation with hiv/aids was that the first effective drug treatment didn't come out until 1996. it was 15 years. and this is a disease with an 80-plus percent fatality rate. let that sink in for a moment.

volz: i've done a lot of thinking about this. and i think it's pretty interesting. my dad has a spiritual relationship - or had a spiritual relationship with his epilepsy. he described that in the moments leading up to a seizure, his pre-seizure aura would appear in his peripheral vision as a multi-colored mandala with all colors of the spectrum, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. he describes it as being like looking at god. and my dad is such a spiritually serious person that this really attracted him.
this kind of ideological thinking is like that of the class-struggle sessions during the cultural revolution, cao says, referring to a violent period in the 1960s and 1970s in china when chairman mao zedong sought to root out political enemies.

woodfin: i think one of the things that makes our city different is that we're the economic development engine of the entire state. when you think about workforce that the organizations, whatever lane they're in, whether it's health care or whether it's financial services, manufacturing, which are some of our top three industries here in our city, i think about their workforce becoming younger. so all my friends - when i moved back here 15 years ago, no one my age at 22 and 23 wanted to be in the city. they wanted to go to atlanta. they wanted to go to nashville. they wanted to go somewhere else.
volz: so i have a very intimate relationship with my mom, and it's nothing unusual for us to talk about her very personal feelings about things both from the past and today. but i started this book having been estranged from my dad for many, many years. and really, for the first couple of drafts, i didn't ask his side of the story because i didn't know how.
jay-z: (rapping) y'all know how i met her. we broke up and got back together. to get her back, i had to sweat her. y'all could make up with a bag, i had to change the weather. move the whole family west, but it's whatever.

hanks: ...i played an overgrown - 13 years old, which your listeners might recognize from today's interview, as a matter of fact. but then we - i fell into a movie called league of their own in which i was playing, essentially, a washed-up big leaguer. and after i'd had that experience, i was still in my mid-30s. i had an awful lot of opportunities and offers in order to go off and make a certain type of film, which is, you know, some brand of light comedy, some brand of, you know, quasi-romantic drama that all ended up being under the rubric of, will i ever find the person of my dreams?

taxpayers in hillsborough county, n.h., have spent $63,000 over the last six years keeping treadwell in jail for little more than trespassing.
davies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies back with the interview terry gross recorded with ray liotta. he stars with jennifer lopez as corrupt police detectives in the new nbc series shades of blue. he starred in martin scorsese's 1990 film, goodfellas with robert de niro and joe pesci. when we left off, he told terry that he's met 13-year-old kids who told him, to his surprise, that they've seen the film.
meanwhile on monday, a team of turkish and saudi investigators entered the saudi consulate in istanbul, the associated press reported. it was unclear whether there would be much of anything to investigate forensically, given that so much time has passed since khashoggi was last seen.
liotta: (as henry hill) just - you know, you're funny (laughter).
thank you, bill. thank you, everybody. it is great to be back in salt lack city. salt lake, of course, is a beautiful city surrounded by mountains. later on, we're going to be talking to somebody who specializes in descending those mountains rather quickly, olympic gold medalist hannah kearney. but first, we want to congratulate our friend terry gross and her staff on this week's 30th anniversary of the show fresh air. it is an awesome thing.
the vanderhelms say they believe that being gay or trans is a sin — a sin that a person can resist. steve compares being homosexual to lying, overeating, lust. he says it's no different than me in my younger days looking at pornography.
at the grand rapids pride center, a rowdy group of about 40 teens gathers every week, and they talk about sex, gender and relationships. they have a rotating cast of adults called facilitators, who lead discussions and pull questions out of a hot pink box.
davies: yeah. it's interesting because there are a lot of circumstances where if a lawyer says something to you in an office, you can call him on it. you don't call out a judge in public.
joe pesci: (as tommy devito) pow, ping - i mean, i wish i was big just once.
are you taking this on the road?
meraji: are there term limits here?
bob vander plaats, president of the family leader, said he's sending invitations friday to the top seven democratic primary candidates in current polls.
as a young woman in an overwhelmingly male legal world, she faced demeaning comments in offices, courtrooms and the media, including a new york times profile of her titled a lawyer in miniskirts. and while she was investigating the watergate break-in and cover-up, her own house was mysteriously burglarized twice. fbi agents said a tap on her phone had been installed, then removed.
gross: so you were probably too young to have seen the real route 66 in its time?
demby: go mounties. i don't know what that means. go mounties.

mcevers: (laughter) sounds like a good voice. can i borrow it?
i have always been a huge admirer of his. i've always felt that the way he approaches cases — the intellect, the care to follow precedent, the consensus building — were qualities that would make him an outstanding supreme court justice.
sagal: you know what? they were right. we have gay marriage, now everything's gone to hell.
on thursday, grammy-nominated rapper travis scott performed to millions of fans worldwide — not during a living room set or from an empty venue, but via the massively popular video game fortnite.
for some conservatives, religious freedom means the right to act on their opposition to same-sex marriage and other practices that go against their beliefs. lgbt advocates and their allies, meanwhile, say no one in the united states should face discrimination because of their sexual orientation.
klein: so get two right and you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, carl kasell's voice on their voicemail. bill, who is neal playing for?
sagal: bill, what is andy's topic?
woodfin: as far as i'm concerned, being a mayor period but then being the mayor of your hometown is probably the best political job you can ever have. i don't necessarily have to ever run for office outside of mayor again - like never.
the video appears to have been shot last year at knight's school of enlightenment near olympia. knight claims to channel an ancient spirit named ramtha. earlier this year she started giving generously to the state democratic party and democratic candidates. for several days, democrats have resisted republican calls to return the contributions. but benton strong, a spokesman for the state democratic party, says after the most recent videos came out.

well, you know what? that's exactly what i've done. and so there's no contradiction between what i'm doing and what joe biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.
president trump told reporters on monday morning that he had just spoken with saudi king salman bin abdul-aziz al saud, who he said firmly denied any knowledge of what happened to khashoggi.

the collision of two core american values — freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination — is prompting a showdown in legislatures and courts across the country.
cornish: and sam sanders, host of npr's it's been a minute.
liotta: i turned it down a bunch of times. i wouldn't do it. i was first asked to play him by tina sinatra or nancy - one of the sinatra - his daughters back when they did movie of the weeks. and they were doing a movie of the week of it. and i turned it down because i just didn't want to do it at that time in my career. then it came along.
i was essentially going through a second adolescence at age 40. and a lot of the kind of trial-and-error things that girls go through and women go through when they're 5 and 10 and 15 were things that i was having to figure out. and even now, there are some things that i'm still trying to figure out. like doing a french braid. i'm 61. i'm beginning to think that that ship has sailed. i'm probably never going to learn how to do that now. ...

on monday, trump responded to the increasing pressure to react more forcefully, and gave a stronger rebuke. racism is evil, trump said. and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the k.k.k., neo-nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as americans.
brown-james: thank you so much for having me.
nicole: tell me about daddy as a young parent.
donna: you know, i always felt so loved, but i always felt so honored by him too. i mean, i was never a gourmet cook. but we could have had mud pies, and he would have said, thank you.
davies: your parents were really interested in the occult, both, you know, psychics, i think. they thought of themselves as psychics. your mom read tarot cards. your dad was a graduate of the berkeley psychic institute. he at some point describes a vision that he has for a child. you want to describe this?
gardner: so there are different versions to this. the rumor - and we're not in the business of spreading rumors. i'm only going to tell you that this is what people are saying from the dubai side is that she has been having some kind of an affair or got too close to one of her bodyguards - a british bodyguard. but what her friends who know her very well have told me is that she is deeply concerned and afraid for her life after discovering details of the escape last year of her stepdaughter sheikha latifa, who is one of the daughters of sheikh mohammed. she was a 33-year-old dubai princess who put a video out online saying if you're seeing this, then i have not managed to escape. and she fled by sea. she got as far as the coast of india. and there she was, essentially, recaptured by indian and emirati commandos.

his liver is gone now because of the alcoholism, so we know he's not going to be around for too much longer. and this hurts the girls and i, sherri says. and it hurts me more, because i know the system could have done something.
he gets to yelling and screaming and hollering, and he's talking and he's cussing people out, swearing and carrying on and so forth and whatnot, copeland says. it scares people because they don't know what his intentions are.
gross: well, having several families also exposed you to several religions. i think i have this right - that your mother was catholic.
donna: i would want him to know, nobody has ever loved me the way he did. and i hope, i truly hope he felt the same way.
i can't praise too highly the performances of shahab hosseini as the increasingly fevered emad and longtime farhadi collaborator taraneh alidoosti as rana, whose wordless despair gives the movie's final section so much of its power. farid sajjadi hosseini plays an older man who shows up late and all but owns the movie. the salesman is nominated for this year's foreign language feature academy award, but it's unclear if farhadi would be able to attend the ceremony given the presidential order banning citizens of certain countries from visiting the u.s. he has said, in any case, that he won't come.
williams: (as gwen verdon) an hour ago when you walked in the door. how'd i do?
gessen clearly regards trump not only as a putin apologist and sometime collaborator but as a putin impersonator. the author argues that trump models himself on putin, not because he expects to replicate russian political culture here but because he wants america to see him the way russia sees putin — as someone who can return his country to the glories of an imaginary past.
loretta lynch: this law provides no benefit to society, and all it does is harm innocent americans.
siegel: meaning states could criminalize or legalize abortion. another legal issue he was asked about - does he support same-sex marriage?
whitaker: (as colonel weber) and now you heard it. what do you make of it?
pifer: i always knew - we talked about his response - what his response would be during a situation like this. i always had a feeling that you wouldn't run or hide. so he just did what came natural to him and covered the person closest to him and shielded her from a lot of bullets. you know, when they got down in his low southern drawl he just said, you know, i got you. it was just natural. the shot that killed him was to his right thigh. but i wasn't surprised that he shielded somebody.
davies: and do you remember ever finding that hard, you know, as you got a little older and had friends?
brennan: yeah, 'cause my ex said that three mics is the biggest red flag in the history of red flags. do you agree?
large majorities of christians in the u.s. support same-sex marriage, though a majority of white evangelicals oppose it, according to a 2018 survey by prri.
pifer: ...(laughter) i would - i would probably be asked to have an evaluation of sorts. but...
in some ways, the biggest change is not going from male to female. the biggest change is going from someone who has a secret to someone who doesn't have a secret.
sagal: all right. first, let's hear from mo rocca.
trump fires acting attorney general for refusing to defend immigration order
but one phoenix business argues it cannot in good conscience follow that law — because they say it violates their freedom of speech and religion.
there's a way in which, when i look back in my 20s, i'm embarrassed because i was, i think, kind of sprawling in every direction looking for any kind of success at all: i'll audition for commercials; i'll audition for voice-overs; i'll audition for movies or tv shows or anything! and i was kind of cast in nothing. where that crescendoed was when i was about 30 years old, it was 2008, i got my own sitcom pilot with cbs based on my life. i couldn't believe it. bob odenkirk played my brother and nick kroll played my cousin, frances conroy played my mom. it was like a dream come true. i thought, oh, this is it. i've made it in this certain way. and when it didn't get picked up to air, i was crushed.
legislation either to uphold lgbt rights or to limit them in the name of protecting religious freedom has advanced in several states, and further court battles are likely.
in general, everybody should admit the world is changing really fast and it's hard for the conversations to keep up. i mean, it's hard to remember now, but when barack obama ran for president he was against gay marriage, he said.
what trump's comments monday mean for how, exactly, he will handle the resurgence of white supremacists, remains unclear.
one of the things that you do in the book is you talk about kind of the history of san francisco. and in the 1970s, there was all of this kind of explosion of creativity and art and experimentation. but there was also some really dark stuff. you know, the peoples temple, which was led by jim jones, was active in the city and very connected to a lot of the liberal politicians. and then there was the horrific assassinations of the mayor, moscone, and then the supervisor, the councilman, harvey milk that, i guess, was not a customer of your mom, but somebody that she met on her rounds a lot. how did all of that affect her?
pesci: (as tommy devito) funny how? i mean, what's funny about it?
brown-james: so valentine's day is hard. i've even been thinking about this for my lover and myself, right? do i put on, like, something sexy and - i don't feel like it. we tired over here. so (laughter) what do we do? look for things that you can do together. like, try and maybe send somebody a meal. maybe you have the same meal together. maybe you take a cooking class. but you can do things even though you're individually separated, but you're still sharing an experience and working towards the goal.
volz: no. my parents, i think, like a lot of hippies, a lot of people from their generation, saw marijuana as wholesome and harmless. and i was taught that the legislation around it and the government's view of it was wrong and that what they were doing was right. so i grew up with that idea that we were outlaws, but good outlaws - kind of like robin hood outlaws. and i didn't question that for a long time.
gross: it's the silliest - it was the novelty record with a novelty dance. (laughter).
liotta: yeah, if i think something's funny, i think it's funny. and i just let it out. i'm amused by a lot of things. i love humor. i'm constantly joking around. it blows my friends' minds that i've never been in a fight in my whole life, and i play all these kinds of characters. it might seem exaggerated, but it's not. i just - you know, some people just have some very full laughter - full of joy - and have no shame or fear of letting that out.
in retrospect, when i look back on directing sleepwalk with me, i didn't know how to direct a movie. there's no way to teach someone how to direct a movie. you can go to film school, you can direct a short, but to direct a feature film, it's like waiting tables for the first time — you have to sort of lie and say that you've waited tables before. which of course leads to a lot of incompetent waiters who are liars. but directors are like that, too. you really don't know what you're doing, and i think in a lot of ways these ideas [of improv], these principles, are what got me through — this idea of, like, listen to people more than you talk. ... i don't know anything about costume design, but i hired someone whose work i admire and then i listened to her when she made recommendations. ... i think those are just really good rules for collaboration.
liotta: i guess different strokes for different folks. i guess when you grow up like that, when you're growing up in new york, and your father isn't making a lot of money, to see people who are - have a lot of money and power. you know, that kind of shows a power that they're parking wherever they want when you're not supposed to do that. that really influenced him a lot.

demby: i don't know if - has anyone heard it?
klein: they tried antifreeze, turpentine, rat poison. later they just tried running him over, but that didn't work either.
then, one stormy night, while sipping a glass of malbec, as ling and chan were enjoying their catnip, ling jumped up on jonas and rolled over on her back, paws up. taking advantage of the situation, jonas grabbed a q-tip and some wet ones and figured out a way to give ling a waterless pedicure. he was elated, but felt that something was missing. what his cats needed was a nice color of nail polish to complete the look.
jennifer barfield: i want to hear him say he's crumpling up other trade agreements and changing that asap. that's what i really want to hear. even though i know he's got a lot of big fish to fry on his plate, that's the one that i want the most.
well, you know, i'm going to make the case — i'm going to make the case for a fair process. give judge garland a hearing; give him a vote. and look at the qualities of the man. that's what the american people expect. and, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that i've heard from mitch mcconnell and some other republicans is this notion that the american people should decide — we should let the american people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.
gross: so what was it about the dave eggers novel that made you want to adapt it into a film?
anticipating a new life in canada, alqunun wants to attend college and study architecture, she told the new york times. and she wants to experience what it's like to be a normal teenager. i want to do crazy things i've never done before, she said.

it's very unusual for the justice department to refuse to defend a law or an executive order, though it isn't unprecedented. during the obama administration, for example, top officials decided not to defend the defense of marriage act that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. the supreme court eventually ruled in favor of same-sex marriage.
and so although i've always believed that he would make an outstanding supreme court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the supreme court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring — or at least increasing — the american people's confidence in our justice system.
for years now, his life has looked like this: trespass in an apartment building, spend 30 days in jail; bother restaurant customers, spend 42 days in jail; panhandle aggressively, spend 30 days in jail.
nicole: what's your favorite memory about being married to daddy?
when you're talking about opening up restrooms and schools and in public places, it is just uncomfortable, unnatural and unwelcoming to many, many women and girls out there and i think that's what this really boils down to, said banfield.
bodden: the difference is his wife will live with him.
hanks: (as alan clay) well, maybe all the vendors are in here, and maybe we're just the first.
gross: you're going to be nice to me, right? (laughter).
douban: where are you from? and where are you from is kind of, you know, for me, i never know what they mean, whether people mean where are you from geographically - because i might not sound like i'm from the south - or ethnically. and so i'll say, well, what do you mean? and then they have, you know, sort of, you know - oh, i meant you don't sound like you're from the south, or ethnically, i mean, what's your ancestry, what's your heritage? i feel like sometimes it is a little jab, but other times, sometimes people just might not know, right?
sagal: landon, welcome to the show. you're going to play who's bill this time. bill kurtis is going to perform for you three quotations from the week's news. your job - correctly identify or explain just two of them. do that, you will win our prize, the voice of scorekeeper emeritus carl kasell to do whatever you will with. are you ready to play?
gross: so in a lot of your movies, you portray men in life and death situations, you know, war in saving private ryan. you produced band of brothers, also about world war ii. you were jim lovell in apollo 13. you were the captain of a ship taken over by pirates in captain phillips. you're finishing production on a movie called sully in which you play the pilot who remarkably landed - made an emergency landing on the hudson river after birds flew into the engines of the plane, disabling the engines. so these are men with like nerves of steel under pressure. do you feel like you have ever been tested like that in your own life?
beyonce: (singing) no need to ask, you heard about us. no need to ask, you heard about us. already know you know about us. no need to ask, you heard about us. no need to ask, you heard about us. watch your mouth when you're around us.
demby: and, also, who is better dressed - the dudes at morehouse or the city council of birmingham?
it was not exactly one day. it was less of a decision than, like, an erosion, maybe. ... but i remember there was one day when a barrier came down at a railroad crossing and it was snowing. it was probably january of 2000. so it was the new millennium. i remember that it felt like we were in a new era. and i just watched the cars of the freight train going by and started kind of daydreaming and thinking that question: how long are you going to wait before you leave your actual life? eventually, the barrier went up, the train disappeared down the tracks, but i was just sitting there in my car in this kind of daze until cars behind me started honking and wondering what was wrong with me. so that was the day i came home and i said to my wife, i think i'm gonna get back into therapy. we talked a little bit about the gender question before that moment, but that was the moment that i thought, i cannot keep living a life in which i'm not really myself.
wine-banks: he, jim neal, thought that possibly they were either fake tapes that would exonerate the president or - i'm not really sure exactly what he had in mind, but he really thought it was a trap. he agreed we had no choice but to subpoena them because that was just how it was, and we were going to have to fight it. but i never doubted that it was legitimate. the confirmation that we got from john dean was he was thrilled to know there was tapes because he believed he had been accurate in recounting all of the conversations he had, and he was relieved that he might be able to be proved correct. so his reaction to it led me to believe that this was good news for us.
sagal: hey. how are things in hickory, n.c.?
hanks: we were forced to in a couple of circumstances. i was the only one in my family who did not get a first communion because my parents broke up before they could put me in the catechism. but i remember masses in latin. but we - i thought, of course, well, that's what church is. but then these guys, literally like the book of mormon, they came around in white short-sleeved shirts and black ties, and they rode bicycles. and they convinced my dad's second wife that being a mormon was just the greatest thing in the world. and my dad said, you know what? if you - winnie - that was her name - sweet lady. he said, if you want your kids to be baptized in the mormon church, you go right ahead, but no way are my kids going to go through that.
beyonce: (rapping) ain't nothing to it - real one. ain't nothing to it - boss. ain't nothing to it - real one. ain't nothing to it - boss. i pay the cost. who's gonna take it off? i record then i ball. i've ignored a lot of calls. click, click. you ain't talking about nothing. i ain't got no time. got that dinero on my mind. oh, i got real problems just like you. tell that trick i don't like you.
meraji: all right. so i want to sum this up for mallory. she wants to know what makes birmingham different, and what you're saying is there is more economic opportunity here, there's an economic engine that's moving. it's drawing in young people. it's also a predominantly african-american city, which makes it tend towards being more democratic and progressive, and, you know, you've got young millennials who are out exercising their right to vote. would i have summed that up for mallory?

and now we're into this tug of war. this week, the justice department and the trump administration sided with the baker, said the government couldn't compel him to engage in free speech. and in their brief, said an artist cannot be forced to paint. a musician cannot be forced to play, and a poet cannot be forced to write. a baker can't be forced to make a wedding cake.
vigorous enforcement of the law during the mid-twentieth century did not deter the practice of plural marriage, sen. deidre henderson told npr.
williams: (as gwen verdon) so it's called children! children! it's from a brand-new writer. it's a terrific part, and then the play is just phenomenal.
hanks: (as alan clay) no, brad, we should wait until i talked to karim al-ahmad at 3 o'clock.
wine-banks: she was moved out of her office adjacent to the oval office to a remote office in the executive office building where she maintained a shrine to richard nixon until she was eventually, under president ford, moved to a separate building, a little townhouse on lafayette square across from the white house. and she wasn't allowed to send mail to the president or communicate with him and eventually became - she said it was like being a b-list celebrity instead of an a-list. it's ironic, but she lived in the watergate complex and had a nice lifestyle, eventually moving back to her hometown in ohio and basically being out of the limelight.
tucker: there are sultry grooves all over this album like that one, a song called summer. there's another alluring rhythm in boss, a song dominated by beyonce singing about being successful and in charge. she's the boss of the song title. as a soul music horn section toots affirmatively, she rattles off a verse about how the success and wealth she has is important to her not least for what she can leave behind for future generations of african-american children.
brown-james: mmm hmm. mmm hmm. i would say for jack and for everybody, learning to be by yourself is actually integral, and i want him to hold on to that. when they start to date, they're not going to lose themselves in somebody else's ish (ph). it's like, well, i don't really like this. i can be by myself and be ok. that is an integral tool to have when starting to seek out relationship.

 '[l]ittle mayor signer — see-ner — how do you pronounce this little creep's name?' asked richard spencer, a right-wing leader who dreams of a 'white ethnostate,' as he stood on a bench under a tree to rally his troops, deprived of their protest. the crowd knew exactly how to pronounce his name: 'jew, jew, jew, jew' some shouted out. the rest burst out in laughter. and that was one of the only moments of levity the alt-right audience gathered under the tree enjoyed.
and so i — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just democrats, but a sizable number of republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government. and what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) that's very funny.
jill wine-banks: well, it depends on what part of my career you're talking about. when i first started at the department of justice, again, i was the only woman trial lawyer. and no one really knew how to deal with me because they weren't sure whether to call me a woman lawyer, which is something i've always objected to. i think that distinguishes me in a way that's unfair from any other lawyer. i was a trial lawyer, not a woman lawyer. and so i've always corrected people on that particular thing.
you can listen to the original interviews here:
gross: she had really - ok (laughter).
legal analysts are divided in their assessment of the debate. a federal judge, ruling on a mississippi religious freedom law, concluded that by protecting specific beliefs, the bill constitutes an official preference for certain religious tenets, and may therefore be unconstitutional. other laws and proposals, however, are written in support of beliefs held by several different religions and thus may not run afoul of the first amendment's bar on an establishment of religion.
wine-banks: probably at that moment i didn't. i have an ability to sort of compartmentalize. and i was really compartmentalized on, what questions do i have to ask while listening to her answers so that i can follow up and make sure she's not evading my questions? in retrospect, i definitely have sympathy for her because i know that she may actually believe that she did that, but she certainly didn't.

cornish: ...dr. lexx brown-james, can i just ask you briefly, have you been getting a lot of romantic questions, issues coming up in your therapy?
this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in today for terry gross. our guest, alia volz, writes that before she could spell her own name, she knew she was from an outlaw family. in the late '70s when she was a baby and a toddler, her parents had a roaring business baking and selling marijuana-laced brownies. thousands a month to hippies, artists, office workers and activists in san francisco. volz often made the rounds with her mom, selling their wares to grateful customers every friday. as colorful as that sounds - and it was - it's no less interesting than another story told in her new memoir, the tale of her parents' relationship.

the justice department has sided with a baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. for the lgbt community, it's the latest disappointment from the trump administration.
meraji: it's sacred ground because it's where black people encountered the absolute worst evils of racism and fought back and fought for a society where equality and justice for all actually mean something. and you've written that birmingham today is really a testament to reconciliation. and i want to know - what did you mean by that? what does that mean for you?
perez: ...kept getting kitty litter stuck in between their toes. knowing that his beloved felines hated water and would freak out every time he dug into their little paws, he was perplexed.
texas holds the first-in-the-nation primary next week. voters will make choices in hundreds of races, including governor and u.s. senator. further down the ballot, there's a race that could decide the future of one of america's political dynasties. from member station kut in austin, ben philpott reports.
davies: right. and it's interesting when you compare that to the recent investigations into the trump administration, when special counsel mueller was looking into looking into, you know, the deeds that he was looking into it. and initially the white house did cooperate and provide a lot of documents. once the impeachment inquiry began, they refused to honor subpoenas. it really makes a difference whether some of this basic information is provided, doesn't it?
sanders: i have a more practical question or a suggestion for clark. like, this pandemic year has changed the ways in which we have to be here or there to work for a lot of us. and so maybe there's a way that they can just build in a little more together time physically, more than once a month. i don't know.
felber: that's exactly what you mean.
totenberg: i don't expect the nomination until we have an official president trump, until he's sworn in. he has a government that can vet candidates. he can officially give them to the fbi to do a thorough background check.
you're at a table. and the joe pesci character, tommy, is telling this story. everybody's laughing at the story. you're laughing the hardest. and after the story ends, he looks at you and he says, what's so funny? so let's play part of that scene, and the scene starts with you just laughing a lot at the end of his story.
here's the problem we have, though: if in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, we've got another excuse for not confirming a democratic president's nominee?
meraji: is this a conversation that happened for you?
i really ended up being very much accepted in the department of justice organized crime section, but it took me over a year to get my first trial, and that was because i was not even aware - i had no role models and no one to look to. and it took me a while to realize that the men i started with were starting to try cases. we all start doing appeals, but they had moved on to trials, and i hadn't. and so i had to confront my boss and say, how come? and he said, well, because you're a girl, and you'd be much more vulnerable in a courtroom. in appeals, you're just with lawyers. but in the courtroom, you'd be with mafia members. and i simply said, well, what didn't you notice about me when you hired me as a trial lawyer? and that's how i got my first trial.
wine-banks: we got them from the white house. it was something that helped enormously. we had all sorts of call logs and meeting logs. and it is something that is very important in developing our case to have had that kind of information. so, for example, on one of the conversations that we subpoenaed in that first nine, we at first thought that it was from, like, 10:30 to noon. but when we checked the logs, we sent an addendum by letter to the white house saying this conversation actually took place from this time to this time. and we were very precise because we had the call logs. and we knew who came into the meeting and when they left and who entered the meeting after that person left. and it made it much easier to identify the exact times of conversations.
klein: a, he started a software company called mike rowe soft?

volz: to an extent. my parents weren't trying to scare me with it. but from a practical standpoint, they needed me to understand that what we were doing was illegal and that if i told anyone, including other children - who might tell an adult - it could have very serious consequences for our family. so i did know from the very beginning that if i told anyone what my parents really did that they could go to prison.
and you voted to not end debate on the alito nomination. and if i understood you correctly at your press conference, what i thought i heard you say was, you know, i knew that it was a meaningless vote. you got a pass from the leadership. you can do this.
hanks: i never hoped to have something that dramatic in my life.
vander plaats is a controversial figure, who has been regarded as a kingmaker among white evangelicals in iowa, where the conservative christian vote is a vital voting bloc for republicans. during the 2012 presidential election cycle, vander plaats sparked criticism — including from within the republican party — for asking candidates for the gop nomination to sign a marriage vow promising fidelity to one's spouse, rejection of sharia islam and support for robust childbearing and reproduction, among other things.
dara lind, a reporter at vox who wrote an explainer of the rally and its origins, described it as a coming-out party for resurgent white nationalism in america.

altogether, the set lasted roughly 10 minutes. (several encores of the virtual performance are scheduled throughout the weekend.)
i believe that god made male and female and we don't get to choose that and we don't get to change that, he said. and it's wrong for the state to force me to create artistic products.
siegel: and first, i'd like you to sort out for us two apparently conflicting statements that donald trump made on 60 minutes. one was about the supreme court and abortion.
davies: jill wine-banks is a legal analyst for msnbc. her new book is the watergate girl. after a break, she'll describe her courtroom confrontation with rose mary woods about a mysterious 18-minute gap in the tape of a critical white house conversation. and maureen corrigan reviews the unconventional debut novel of deepa anappara telling a story of child kidnapping in india. i'm dave davies, and this is fresh air.
honestly today was one of the most inspiring days. love every single one of u guys,  scott tweeted in appreciation following the event. and i know times are weird for us. but for one moment to be able to have the ragers to rage where ever you are is amazing.
turns out, while the organic litter might make the technicians feel greener and more virtuous, it does a terrible job of stabilizing nuclear waste. the drums almost immediately started leaking radioactive goo. their frightening solution falls into the it's-so-stupid-it-might-just-work category. they're storing the drums now inside bigger drums. what could possibly go wrong?
woodfin: when we look at the history of america, we haven't always been honest. well, what's on paper wasn't necessarily in practice. racism was real. it was tangible. and the difference between birmingham and any other city in america at that time was our differences were actually wrecking on the world stage. so everyone saw it. they saw the brutality. they saw the racism. they saw the bigotry. they saw the evil. they saw it. at the exact same time, they saw the fred shuttlesworths of our world, the martin luther king jrs. of our world, others fight back. and in that reckoning, we were able to get some - a lot of wins out of that for black people.
rundell says the 13 official united methodist seminaries generally cover between 10 and 20 percent of their operating budget with direct church funding, but he says the loss of that funding is not necessarily the biggest danger.
and it was during this down period of - for me. and they asked me - it was hbo. rob cohen directed it. and he called and asked if i would play it. and i said no - no thanks, i don't want to take on playing somebody that so many people knew - that i just felt the judgment would be too much.
big fight in a small town
the knack: (singing) you don't mean to be cruel. you never even knew about the heartache i've been going through. well i try and try to forget you girl, but it's just so hard to do. every time you do that thing you do. i know all the games you play, and i'm going to find a way to let you know that you'll be mine someday...
i tell my students they are lucky to have such a date in their lifetime, inan tells the oregonian.
sagal: you might think the screaming lotus feels right, but not the people who tried it. so your choice then is amy and her story of the mistake on antiques roadshow. well, to bring you the correct answer we talked to someone intimately involved with this story.
not knowing what happened makes us consider the destructive social forces that helped put that woman on that staircase at that time. in my favorite movie of farhadi's, about elly, a young female teacher disappears while visiting colleagues at their beach house. as they learn more about their absent guest, the focus subtly shifts to the trauma of her life and by implication, the lives of many working single women in modern iran.
farsad: but the thing about marine le pen, she didn't ever scare me as much as trump, i think, because she spoke in complete sentences. and her, like, white nationalism had a certain je ne sais quoi.
now, she ends up being a very important figure in this case. people would know her name because it turned out that one of the critical conversations just a few weeks - a short time after the break-in - conversations in the oval office had an 18 1/2-minute gap where only a hum appears on the tape, very suspicious. a lot of people in the white house had access, but she ends up on the stand having to explain this. and you were the one cross-examining her. tell us about that.
the chickens have come home to roost, says valerie bridgeman, the academic dean of the methodist theological school in ohio.
mandy pifer: i was in my late 30s. he was in his early 40s when we met. so it was a very kind of mature relationship. we didn't jump into anything. we shared stories. we went to concerts. we were best friends. and then kind of really turned it up a notch the last six months of his life.
gross: so the film is produced by your production company, playtone. why did you start your own production company?
davies: and then you did what?
this fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross.
i would be a little surprised if any of them really took him up on this offer to engage in this conversation, hoffman-zinnel said.
martin: you know, on the campaign trail last, year some might remember that president trump - oh, then-candidate trump - made certain statements that at least some gay and lesbian supporters took as assurances of his support for them. so how is his record now bearing out that point of view?
garcia-navarro: that's the bbc's frank gardner in london.
december's anthem-singing protest at fudan university illustrates just how such a monitoring network can mobilize to quickly control small-scale incidents.
we are very clear that we will stand by our lgbtq students, staff, faculty, alums, and friends, says jay rundell, president of the methodist theological school in ohio, one of 13 official united methodist church seminaries. we will resist what we see as a narrow misuse of scripture and tradition.
he says his managers had received numerous complaints from students about remarks he had made in lectures in previous years, but his managers only quietly reprimanded him before dismissing the claims. the problem is not that chinese students and colleagues are reporting their professors. that phenomenon has always existed, says shi.
jay-z: (rapping) vintage frames, i see nobody [expletive] with him.
demby: i thought you were going to say, like - we going to have to scrap on the stage. what we doing? what we doing?
and i would expect that the older ones and the younger ones will get knocked off. and the person will have a track record that attracted trump and, therefore, will unattract a lot of democrats and their constituencies.
to those among you who repeatedly used the label 'the bathroom bill,' who incorporated this into every headline and story lead and failed to tell the whole and complete truth of this legislation, i say you are not journalists. you have served merely as stenographers to ignorance, hatred and discrimination, said then-state sen. jackie cilley.
mr. president, thank you so much for your time. we appreciate it.
woodfin: i think it has. this trade war is real in the state of alabama, not just birmingham metro area, where bibb county is next door and tuscaloosa county's next door. and we have residents who are employees of these organizations where the auto industry - it works very well for the state of alabama. that doesn't work either for birmingham or for our state.
sagal: landon, we're going to leave politics behind, thankfully, if just for a second. your last quote is a reaction to yet another failed marketing campaign this week.
demby: is that a place? are you actually...
nicole: if you had a minute, one minute ... what would you say to dad?
(soundbite of future islands' seasons (waiting on you)
woodfin: he just answered my - he just answered for me.
douban: that's deep. but it's on the other side as well, where, you know, a lot of african-american men might still have that sort of - you know, maybe have been told by their fathers not to talk to white women, not to look at white women, not to get into relationships with white women because it's just not going to go over well. it's just not something that you do. and it wasn't that it was just inconvenient or anything like that. but, i mean, there was a point in history - and it was not all that long ago - where your life would be in danger if, you know, you were a black man pursuing a white woman.
brennan: yeah, my dad's dead. yeah. that's correct.
trump's first month in office seems like a clown show to me, trotter said, though one with very serious implications.
in arizona, brendan mahoney was one of the lawyers in town who people would call when they were fired from a job or refused a room because they were gay.
volz: yeah. of course. so as a kid, it was something that i was - of course i was aware of it. you would see - the presentation of aids was so dramatic physically. and it could happen very quickly. we'd be gone for a month and come back the next month. and somebody who had been a beautiful 30-year-old would look 70.
hanks: gary - my producing partner, gary, is a - he's got all sorts of gold records from when he produced records for people like robert john, the lion sleeps tonight. he's done, like, smokey robinson records. so he's well-versed in the music business. some time in - not too long before i started writing the movie - i heard the saga of a drummer by the name jimmy nichols. do you know the name jimmy nichols at all?
i think it's unfair for americans to blame africa or south america or the philippines for this decision.
liotta: (as joey perrini) i don't want to talk about it. i'm just wondering.
dating during a pandemic is tough. and with valentine's day coming up, we asked you what questions you have about finding love or keeping love alive in your current relationship. as a heads up, some of our discussion will be sexually explicit.
asked about the argument that therapists should have an obligation to serve everyone, haslam said, lawyers don't serve everyone. ... lawyers right now can say, 'i'm not the person to help you on that issue; i don't agree with what you're trying to do'; and they can turn down that person and they can go somewhere else.

after widespread condemnation, the family leader issued an apology and removed language stating that slavery had a disastrous impact on african-american families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an african-american baby born after the election of the usa's first african-american president.
fudan is one of at least three universities that have revised their charters since 2018, emphasizing unswerving loyalty to the communist party, an npr analysis found. they have downgraded or erased language about academic freedom from their charters, while adding a new clause: the university communist party committee is the core leadership of the school.
a student who created the chat group to organize the protest deleted the group from wechat, a popular chinese social media app, in the early morning hours before the event, after his school counselor got wind of the scheme and pressured him to withdraw.
it potentially could show the audience of the family leader a visible, positive representation of an out gay man who's running for the highest office in our land, he said. so maybe it could potentially change people's hearts and minds — or at least get them to think more broadly.
bianculli: fx has made half of fosse/verdon available for preview. that's enough to recommend it highly, but not quite enough to allow for the rendering of a final verdict. i really like that it makes room for some of fosse's famous friends, like neil simon and paddy chayefsky, played respectively by nate corddry and norbert leo butz. and while i'm intrigued by others, like margaret qualley as ann reinking, i need to see more to see how this all plays out. that's because fosse/verdon, written and directed by a tag team of other producers and executive producers - including thomas kail, steven levenson, joel fields and charlotte stoudt - is all over the place, emotionally and artistically. it recreates scenes from classic stage shows and movies while framing them within a frenetic, sometimes fantasy narrative. that's exactly what bob fosse himself did while directing the 1979 movie all that jazz, which was his barely fictionalized story of his own physical breakdown while juggling work on several simultaneous projects.
last year, a performance by the electronic artist marshmello brought in millions of watchers, and other live events such as a kaiju film-inspired battle between a massive robot and sea monster.
mcevers: it was around 11 a.m. a husband and wife wearing ski masks had walked into the holiday party for the county public health department and started shooting people. the public health department is where shannon worked. mandy started calling his phone. because she had worked as a crisis counselor helping witnesses and survivors of traumatic events, mandy knew from her training that something wasn't right.
davies: alia volz's new memoir is called home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco.
gross: what our listeners can't see is that in that scene, you're not only laughing loudly. but it's like visually, you are laughing. like, your mouth is, like, way open as you laugh - like, your whole face is shaped like a laugh. it's as if, like, you're trying to prove, like, this is funny. i am enjoying myself. i'm all in on this joke. and there's even a collage on youtube of your laughter through the movie. was that a thing for you when you were making it - that you thought that this character had to just, like, demonstrate that he thought something was funny and that he was enjoying life?
from my short experience with him in government, he's not that kind of leader, trotter concluded.
if a football coach is not allowed to lead his team in a public prayer, or a high school valedictorian is not given permission to read a bible passage for her graduation speech, or the owner of a private chapel is told he cannot refuse to accommodate a same-sex wedding, they might claim their religious freedom has been infringed. others might argue that such claims go against the principle of church-state separation, or that they undermine the rights of lgbt people to be free from discrimination.
brown-james: yeah. there are long-distance sex toys (laughter) that - they connect to an app. so you can send a, hey, how you doing, boo, to your lover, right?
meraji: if you listen to the code switch podcast, they say it every episode. but it's a very confusing thing for people, and i feel like my whole life has been navigating - what are you, where are you from? - these type of questions. and it was in college when i decided i am going to learn as much as i can. and so i took a bunch of ethnic studies courses, and i really made answering these questions and dealing with these kinds of overt and maybe not so overt microaggressions - i made this my life's work. she can - lisa, you can do this, too. you know, you can get paid to have these conversations.
davies: the business was still going when you were a toddler and, i guess, into kindergarten, right?

in the heat of a presidential campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of republicans saying that they won't give your nominee a hearing? they clearly don't want to look rude, so they'll meet with him and tell him that they don't want to meet with him. [laughter]
kelly mcevers, byline: they met a few years ago online.
brennan: i - it's - do it early.
but, you know, i think the way he described it — and i'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself — the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. he has loved being a judge for a very long time. he occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. he's got a great job.
liotta: i think i was throwing ashes on him - is - i think is what i did.
liotta: as far as what you were saying to begin with, in terms of kids knowing or not knowing, i do have kids that age coming up to me - mostly young boys. from their fathers - the fathers passed along music and books or whatever that affected them when they were younger. you know, a lot of times you pass it on to your kid. so they'd pass on field of dreams to their sons who played baseball. and some of the fathers that, you know, show their young sons - like, i've had 13-year-old kids come up to me and say, oh, my gosh, you were so good in goodfellas. and i'm thinking, oh, my gosh, what kind of parents do they have? that's a little too young to see that one.

i'm not worried about my religious freedom, curry said. i get up and go to church on sunday morning, ain't nobody stopping me. my freedom to worship is protected in this country, and that's not going to get taken away. i have been in places where that's been infringed. that's not what we're talking about.
what if gessen had spent more time in the country these people feel they have lost? it would not likely change gessen's mind about trump. but it might alter the writer's perspective on trumpism. it might help translate a deep empathy for the plight of ordinary russians and relate it to the fears and frustrations of their american counterparts — the millions who voted for trump and now accept his authoritarian tendencies as being in their own interest.
around 10 years old, we begin to lose who we are, when we start learning how to please ... when we start to internalize our social programming. so that's when we learn how to be a good girl, a strong boy, a good christian, a good woman. and, you know, over and over again, we hear from women that their taming, their social programming, came when they learned how to be quiet, and kind, and sweet, and accommodating, and pleasing, and pretty.
gross: so was she really wealthy or was she faking it?

davies: you write about the first night they had sex, which is interesting both because you know about it...
gross: yeah, it's kind of like you - say your arms are at your side. you move them up parallel to the ground.
well, first of all what i would say is take a look at the appointments i've made since i've been president of the united states. i've appointed as many african-americans to the circuit court as any president ever; more african-american women on the federal courts than any other president; more hispanics, more asian-americans, more lgbt judges than any president in history.
(soundbite of song, that thing you do)
now you can imagine at that age? i had no idea what the word meant, she recalls.
we have seen a great number of false equivalencies in the past two years, and the most recent presidential election was defined by them. yet it remains striking to hear trump imply that nazis and the interracial group of demonstrators who gathered to oppose them were, in essence, equally wrong. it would have been naïve to expect the president to unambiguously condemn neo-confederates (heritage, not hate, etc.), but nazis? for reasons that are not hard to discern, the swastika, at least in the united states, has always been more clearly legible as a symbol of racial bigotry than the confederate flag.
davies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross, who has a cold today. we're listening to my interview with jill wine-banks. she's a legal analyst for msnbc, and she has a new memoir about her days in the 1970s as an assistant special prosecutor on the watergate investigation. it's called the watergate girl. when we left off, she was talking about president nixon's longtime secretary and executive assistant, rose mary woods, who was close to the first family and an integral part of the administration.
sagal: hey. how are things in the oxford, miss., the oxford of the south?
vander plaats noted that in recent weeks, several candidates have woven their personal faith into their pitches to voters. warren has made the case that her christian faith helped shape her liberal political values. harris opened her campaign by calling for unity and speaking of her faith in god during her announcement speech in january.
her new memoir details her experiences in the watergate probe and her personal struggles with a failing marriage. i spoke to her yesterday about the book called the watergate girl: my fight for truth and justice against a criminal president.
the justice department confirmed its office of legal counsel had done a review of the order to determine whether it was on its face, lawful, and properly drafted.
pifer: ...i thought, well, this is weird.
but because it didn't settle the looming question on whether the first amendment guarantees of religious freedom are more important than a state or city's anti-discrimination laws, similar cases are again simmering in lower courts — including arizona and colorado.
sanders: thank you, audie. this was fun.
simon: well, let me ask you about precedents. and a lot of people have referred to the john edwards defense. this, of course, former democratic presidential candidate who was acquitted by a jury and convinced them that he had made payments. gosh, i'm trying to remember. it involved the birth of a child to a campaign aide who decided that he would identify himself as the father. and he said, look, that wasn't to save my campaign. it was to save my marriage and the mortal embarrassment of my wife, elizabeth edwards, who was, then, mortally ill.
so i wrote a note next to my bed ... i wrote, 'mike! you have an appointment at café pedlar at 7 a.m. with your mind!' it's so corny, and i would show up!
gross: so i remember the first time you and i talked in 1988 when you were on fresh air, you were talking about how in the early days of your career, you read parts as the weird guy, the insecure guy who compensated for his insecurity by being funny. and you said they were pretty one-dimensional characters.

sagal: this is very strange. in some way, emmanuel macron is president trump's mere image. trump is 70, the oldest american president ever. macron is 39, the youngest french president ever. macron, like trump, is in a may-december marriage. well, in trump's case, it's more like may of the following year marriage. but in his case, macron is the young one. did you know this? when he was 16, he fell in love with his 40-year-old drama teacher.

the church did not respond to npr's requests for comment.

the day after the singing protest, members of the party youth league at fudan university posted a prewritten statement on wechat: the school anthem remains the same. not only does fudan have academic independence and freedom of thought, but it also educates the country's future leaders, strengthens the university and protects the country. the determination that led us to fudan in the first place hasn't changed. if given a second chance, i'd still choose fudan. professors who posted veiled statements of support for the protest on wechat were told to take their posts down.
there has always been a large evangelical subculture in u.s. methodism, says mark tooley, president of the institute on religion and democracy, even though the hierarchy of the church for many decades has been more on the liberal side.

sanderson: ...that it was not related to the election - that it was purely to help him personally and to save his marriage, et cetera. but now with the entrance of rudy giuliani and his appearances in media, i think that that narrative is now much less clear than it was previously.
liotta: ...you were doing all this blow. you were beating people up. but - and then i would see him for years. he had a rough life towards the end of his life. and i would see him, a lot of times, in venice. and he was just, you know, out of his mind on - you know, doing something - usually pretty loaded. i would see him leaning against trees or just sleeping on the beach. and i would bump into him every once in a while.
and i would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on earth.
i think people are finally realizing the absurdity of the argument. we have been going to the bathroom with transgender people for all of our lives, it hasn't been a problem, and i think people are starting to realize that, said butler.
brown-james: sam, i'll let you start.
south carolina prides itself on being the decider in gop politics. before 2012, it had correctly picked every eventual since 1980. but struggling former house speaker newt gingrich had a breakout debate performance just days before the primary there in 2012. he defended against questions about his personal life and wound up breaking the streak. that helped sway much of the support statewide toward him and helped him earn a decisive victory. (gingrich looked like he had momentum coming out of south carolina, but a flush-with-cash superpac supporting romney, tore down gingrich as the contest moved to florida.)
shaw: well, i think these conversations are good to have. i think they're important to have as we deepen our understanding of what our national values and principles are. the question to me isn't whether we have these conversations. it's how we have these conversations. and i guess what disturbs me - i know what disturbs me - is when some people are treated as if they are not legitimate members of our society. that troubles me and its tone and its tenor. so that's part of a larger problem that we're having as a nation in this strange time in which we find ourselves.
volz: it has been an absolute pleasure, dave.
brennan: if you're going to do it.
two of the executive producers of fosse/verdon should be noted at the start. one is nicole fosse, the real-life daughter of bob fosse and gwen verdon. another is lin-manuel miranda, whose broadway success with hamilton has been nothing short of phenomenal. his presence alone suggests that the musical numbers recreated here will be done with precision and reverence, and they are. and while her presence dictates that this biography of her parents is authorized, it is not an entirely flattering portrayal of either of them. the portrayals, however, are so good, it's almost a relief.
davies: ...fused (laughter) in the civic consciousness. but...
now, the attack that killed eight has brought heightened scrutiny to the program and prompted calls to end it.

hoffman-zinnel added that if candidates accept the offer, vander plaats has a responsibility to create a very safe environment where folks feel comfortable being there.
martin: so take a step back for a moment, if you would, and tell us the background on this case that the supreme court is, in fact, preparing to hear.
volz: yes. well, in some form or another, it continued until i was an adult. but this original iteration carried on until about second or third grade.
well, he's a very good actor because i had dinner with him sunday night [at a small charity event], and he looked like — he kept just was saying he wasn't going to get it. [laughter]
woodfin: it's not my mother's house.
if you're a musical theater fan, just the title fosse/verdon is enough to make this new fx miniseries one of the most exciting tv prospects of the year. gwen verdon, who originated the onstage characters of lola in damn yankees and roxie hart in chicago, was one of the best dancers on broadway. bob fosse's particular style as both choreographer and movie director was dazzlingly different and, captured in such films as cabaret, still crackles with energy. this eight-part drama sets out to tell how they met, collaborated, fell in love, got married and had a daughter. but that's only part of the story, which is about a relationship that keeps going long after the marriage has been dissolved.
volz: absolutely. i - you know, i want to say that i was so well cared for and surrounded by love and affection. i was not left to run wild. i was looked after - basically, at my mom's hip through my entire childhood. so there's no neglect in that.
gross: that's my guest, ray liotta, in goodfellas. it's just so interesting to me how low his sights were set as a kid. you know, like...
sanderson: yeah. so this comes down to two things. one is - and this is the most important - what was the intent behind the payment? was it related to the election? the second is what the source - what was the source of money? and i think what's interesting about the last 48 hours is that there's been - the waters have been muddied considerably. so there was an existing narrative about why the payments were made, about the source of the money. and now...
felber: but it wasn't random. smudge wasn't just rokist (ph). he was full-on racist.

woodfin: if i reflect back when i was 15 and 16, 17 in high school, i don't think that's something that you actually did for real. was it explicit not to do it? no. was it something that you just - that you felt? yes. now, she's right. i don't know how much more i can add to what she just said. my mother is married. she's in an interracial relationship. her husband is white. they've been married over a decade now. i think it's interesting watching my own mother, from a personal standpoint, be in an interracial relationship. i think for each generation we see, not just in birmingham, but in the state, things have changed for each generation for the better.
hanks: my parents were so disinterested in what was going on in my bedroom that i didn't have to pretend anything. i could stay up as late as i wanted to.
woodfin: no one wants to interact with the court system. no one wants to be a victim, a defendant. i don't even think the defense lawyers want to be there for real. but in my position, i have - i had a choice. i also had discretion. and it's easy - i've seen it - for people to be abusive in that position. but, for me, it was all about how to help people, how to bring issues to a resolve, how to heal victims but, believe it or not, how to help defendants as well.
in the aftermath of the conference action, the united methodist church is likely to lose some of its unity.
shaw: well, the state makes an argument, and how strong that argument is is up for grabs. the state cites federal court decisions that say that gender does not include sexual orientation or transgender and that transgender people are not a protected classification of people under federal civil rights laws. so - and it's part of the culture wars that have been going on. for people who are civil rights advocates, they've been clear for some time now that discrimination on the basis of who and what people are goes against our most basic and fundamental laws. and even the supreme court, which has been a conservative supreme court, has, of course, moved with respect to sexual orientation to ban discrimination in the context of marriage.
grove: i want to say macron.
in those days, coming out as transgender was unknown territory, at least it was for me. i barely even had a word for the thing that i felt. and as much as i knew i wanted to live my true life, i also felt that if i lived that life, it would almost surely lead to a life of marginality, of violence. i just thought, i might well be killed, that there was no place in the world in which i could live. there is no place in the world for me to be. ...
johnson: well, and the justice department briefing anticipated this argument. acting solicitor general jeffrey wall says race is different. there's a compelling government interest in eradicating discrimination based on race. laws that target racial bias can survive very strict scrutiny, strict review under the first amendment. but those same classifications aren't so clear, the trump doj says, for sexual orientation. colorado only began issuing same sex-marriage licenses in 2014. and a divided supreme court only ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. there's still a lot of litigation out there on how and if old civil rights laws that mention sex actually covers sexual orientation too.
siegel: so, nina, in one case, he says a supreme court decision ought to be overturned. in the other case, the court's decision ends the discussion. is there anything different about those two issues in supreme court rulings?
amy adams: (as dr. louise banks) is that...
allendale public schools maintains that the sex education program it has used for a decade, called willing to wait, meets the requirements of michigan law, emphasizing the benefits of abstaining from sex until marriage. the superintendent, garth cooper, believes that lgbtq+ kids get the same thing from it as everybody else.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) well, that's - congratulations. when do you start?
there were efforts early on about some kind of compromise, he tells npr in a recent interview. i think those are less and less plausible as time goes on and as sides get factionalized. it's hard to see in some of these cases how there would be an outcome that is amenable to everyone, and so i think we're seeing these cases with us for a long time.

his campaign believes the more non-white voters hear his message, the more they'll be open to voting for him. there's at least some evidence that sanders is benefiting from a generational divide even among non-white voters, npr's sam sanders reports. there hasn't been any south carolina polling on the democratic side yet after iowa and new hampshire, though.
the ramifications of the general conference action are not yet fully evident, but fractures are likely — between progressive clergy and conservative laity, between young and old church members, and between methodists in the united states and those in africa, asia and other parts of what's known as the global south, mostly less-developed countries where conservative social views and a more strict interpretation of the bible are prevalent.

demby: and for real, in the past, you've talked about the importance of revitalizing areas of birmingham. in cities all across the country, there's this tension between revitalization and gentrification in sort of building these communities up and displacing the people that were there. and i'm curious to how - birmingham and how you're thinking about that tension and resolving that.
davies: on the other hand, i mean, it sounds like you felt very much loved and accepted, which probably has a lot more to do with how a kid grows up than what they necessarily inhale or eat.

what does it mean to be a woman who had a boyhood? that's the question lgbtq activist jennifer finney boylan set out to explore her new memoir, good boy: my life in seven dogs.
demby: yeah. absolutely. i mean, and it's not just ignorance, right? there's, like, power behind a lot of it, right? so, i mean, i do think that there should be space for her to cut her friends off. i mean, i do think that there's so much psychic energy that comes along with trying to shepherd your friends. i mean, you can have that conversation with somebody, right? it doesn't mean they want to come along with you - right? - and see what was janky about what they asked. and so, you know, you should feel empowered. i know it is really hard in some cases. so cut people off. their enlightenment is not your responsibility, especially when it comes at the cost of your, like, you know, psychic health, right?

my responsibility is to ensure that the position of the department of justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. in addition, i am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. at present, i am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am i convinced that the executive order is lawful. consequently, for as long as i am the acting attorney general, the department of justice will not present arguments in defense of the executive order, unless and until i become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.

on modeling marriage and motherhood for her children
with respect to judicial philosophy, i have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so i don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases — because i can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and i have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.
woodfin: no. no. we're not going to do that. i believe in welcoming cities. that is something that we are past exploring. that is something we're going to actually do. they put a paper in my hand and said, sign it. that's not how i necessarily govern. i read it. i turned it over to my legal department. but i also turned over to my legal department welcoming cities. and when we look at both of those, i think not only protecting our immigrant community but making sure we do things beyond ice is important.
and so i spoke to a sociologist at uab who studies race and culture. and she said there are a lot of young people who feel like that was 200 years ago in their minds, but in reality, we're not all that far removed from that part of history. so that still lives on in a lot of people. that said, the vast majority of people told me that, for the younger generation, it is more and more commonplace, and it's ok by them as opposed to their parents who might still be resistant to interracial relationships.

but one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. and sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the american people actually matter more than your short-term politics. they actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. and there have been a number of times where, as president of the united states, i've had to do things that i knew were bad politics but i understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.
fresh air weekend highlights some of the best interviews and reviews from past weeks, and new program elements specially paced for weekends. our weekend show emphasizes interviews with writers, filmmakers, actors and musicians, and often includes excerpts from live in-studio concerts. this week:
the south carolina primary for democrats will be the first significant measure of african-american voters in a state. eight years ago, black voters made up 55 percent of the democratic electorate in the state. polls have shown that's a demographic sanders, the vermont independent, has struggled with compared to clinton. but coming off strong performances in iowa and new hampshire, and closing the gap with clinton nationally, sanders could well be competitive.
nathan guttman, a reporter with forward, an online news site aimed at jewish americans, penned a vivid piece about covering the march. he recounted watching as spencer launched into a rant about the mayor of charlottesville, michael signer.
simon: what's the essential detail here - when the payments were made, who made them or why? and can you ever really determine why?
bill kurtis: from npr and wbez chicago, this is wait wait... don't tell me, the npr news quiz. i'm bill kurtis. we are playing this week with mo rocca, amy dickinson and peter grosz. and here again is your host at the providence performing arts center in providence, r.i., peter sagal.
gross: so not only did playtone, your production company, come out of that thing you do - the title came out of it, too - because in that thing you do - it's a movie about a band. and you play an a&r guy from a record label who signs the band and tries to kind of bring them into the big time. and how did you come up with playtone? you wrote the script.
women taking care of everything during extraordinary circumstances is nothing new. right? we've been doing this since the beginning of time. this is just a different iteration of it. and so, you know, every woman that i know right now is juggling work, relationships, home, her own anxiety, her own fear, which is what we do every day.
the commission chairman at the time, martin r. castro, went further with a statement of his own, saying, the phrases 'religious liberty' and 'religious freedom' will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, islamophobia, christian supremacy or any form of intolerance.
brought to new york by immigrating parents in the early 1980s, gessen returned to this birthplace on journalistic assignment a decade later. gessen then spent most of the next 20 years as a writer, editor and activist in post-soviet russia, observing the rise of the former kgb officer who now holds that nation's highest office.
cornish: ok. we'll be leaning on your expertise for sure. but first, i want to start with you, sam. you've been talking about love in the time of covid a lot on your show, right?
wine-banks: it didn't, and john dean had told us it didn't. so we knew that it didn't say that. but again, when you listen to it and you're waiting for those words and they don't come, you not only know that bob haldeman committed perjury, but you also know that the president was part of a conspiracy to pay hush money. and it proves your case in a way that almost nothing else could have done.

brennan: i - yeah, i get it and i love it.
you know, the relationship between your parents, as described in the book, is just fascinating. these are two really interesting people, and this is a very intimate portrait of them - their courtship, their marriage - involving events that were, in many cases, before you were born. and i know you did lots of interviews. i'm wondering what it was like to kind of get in your parents' heads, your parents-in-their-20s' heads, and kind of - almost, like, kind of reconstructing a 360-degree view of your early life a little at a time.
bodden: neal, was that the plot behind the whole special?
davies: which meant that you as a kid had to keep a really big, important secret, a family secret. do you remember being told what the stakes were or how you knew?
and so, you're right, nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following supreme court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. but people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. and this becomes i think a symbol of a process that, if republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're democrats or republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the senate.

it's a much different political reality in colorado where the state's new democratic attorney general phil weiser will defend the state against phillips.
if great words can heal and inspire, base words can corrupt. trump has been delivering the poison of prejudice in small but increasing doses. in charlottesville, the effect became fully evident. and the president had no intention of decisively repudiating his work. what do we do with a president who is incapable or unwilling to perform his basic duties? what do we do when he is incapable of outrage at outrageous things? what do we do with a president who provides barely veiled cover for the darkest instincts of the human heart? these questions lead to the dead end of political realism — a hopeless recognition of limited options. but the questions intensify.
you know, eventually, the special counsel's office asks for 64 more tapes, and there's a battle that goes all the way to the supreme court. and eventually, the court rules that they must be turned over. and that meant that you and the special counsel's office got the tapes. you could hear them themselves.

the battle between the two sides, the state and phillips, eventually landed in the high court.
it was really striking, you know, the weight loss and the way that it transformed how people carried themselves. suddenly, a young man would be using a walker. it was terrible. and then people started to disappear. as a child, i only understood so much, you know? as the years passed, i came to understand what was going on. and people began to disappear from our lives.

after she learned on social media that her family had disowned her, alqunun said she'd like to drop her family name and go by rahaf mohammed, the toronto star reports. it's her latest show of defiance against a family she says abused her, in a country that forces women to get a man's permission to travel or marry. relieved to leave that culture behind, she hopes to galvanize others to do the same.
and i said, well, what's the difference? and you know what the difference was between the two of them? infection. and i thought, so let me get this straight, this isn't just about the fact that an ied took off your limbs and almost killed you. it's about that same ied picked up germs and microbes from the dirt and the dust of afghanistan or iraq, and put it so deep inside you that your body is now fighting centuries-old infections that still might kill you because we haven't figured out a way in order to make - itself infection-free.

felber: in appearance after appearance since, smudge has consistently bristled and spat at blacks, latinos and even his local bakersfield news anchor who is asian.
so then you had to sing and dance. i said, how am i going to sing and dance? i'm a jock from new jersey.

coming up, ken tucker reviews the soundtrack for the new netflix series the get down. it's set in the late '70s. it's about hip-hop, graffiti art disco and other cultural trends of the time. this is fresh air.
mcevers: so you knew when he didn't pick up?
davies: and so while you had this secret and you knew that you were an outlaw family, it was illegal, did it ever seem wrong to you?
pifer: but, you know, we have a garden together. we have a dog together. so i just spend a lot of time in flip-flops and sweatpants gardening. my landlord still wanted his rent check. so as much as i wanted to stay in bed and not ever get out, luckily, i had this friend to get me out because she still needed help. and she helped me.
today, the church excommunicates practicing polygamists.
phillips said the message about sex and gender identity conflicted with his christian religious beliefs.
volz: my mom, from the beginning, she just sort of took me everywhere. and so in the early days of sticky fingers, this meant that i went on brownie runs with her. first, she had me in a front carrier, then on a gerry carrier and, eventually, in the stroller. and she would hang duffel bags of brownies from the back bars of the stroller because they were very heavy.
she's a social worker, so her first reaction was, good! therapy's a good thing. she wanted me to be happy, but she also felt, once it became clear that transition was coming right ahead, that she had a dilemma where she had to think: i have to help the person that i love most in the world at this moment of their crisis. but in so doing, i might lose the person that i love. it's kind of an unsolvable dilemma. and, yet, here we are still together, after 32 years of marriage — 12 as husband and wife, and 20 as wife and wife.
sanchez: (as raul mendez) we both want what's best for the community, lieutenant. i think you know what that's going to take...
delegates at the church's general conference, meeting in st. louis, mo., feb. 23 to feb. 26, adopted several resolutions that not only reaffirmed the church's longstanding conservative positions but also introduced tough new measures for their enforcement. methodist clergy who officiate at any marriage not involving a man and a woman will now face a one-year suspension for the first offense and permanent removal from the ministry for any subsequent offense.

brian barfield has felt forgotten for years:
hanks: that literally comes in like they know it on the weather. they say tomorrow there will be a sandstorm that will last for 18 hours. and, sure enough, in the morning, there is a thick orange cloud, and there is the finest particles of sand, more like chalk or flour that seeps in through every crack in the window and underneath every door sill. i went back to my hotel room. we were shooting out in the middle of the desert near a place called tan-tan, morocco, but we were very much out in - as deserty as you could possibly ask for. everything in my room was covered with a fine layer of golden slash orange grit, so that wreaked havoc with some of the eyeballs of the crew and some of the sprockets of the machinery.
npr first profiled trotter, meyer, the barfields and two others in the st. louis area in 2011 as part of a long-term project called the road back to work. for a year, they kept audio diaries documenting their quest for employment. there were successes and failures, health scares and relationship troubles, jobs secured and lost.
meraji: before he was mayor, he would've said one particular answer.
there is that, which is, you know - it's kind of an adventure, actually, in order to be a part of. there was also the - morocco is not unlike saudi arabia in that it is also a kingdom. a king runs the place, so it has the patina of being a recognizable - almost a nation with, you know, western customs. and, you know, there's burger kings and things like that are there - pizza huts. but it is also still very much a - an islamic nation. my hotel room had a view of the biggest mosque i believe in all of north africa, if not maybe the second biggest mosque in the world there in casablanca.
gessen is particularly sensitive to issues of linguistics and the subtle shifts of wording that can mean so much — noting how the words immigrant and refugee (both relatively sympathetic terms for most americans) have been systematically replaced by such terms as migrant or invasion.
davies: this is fresh air. and we're speaking with writer alia volz. she has a new memoir about her mother's business selling pot-laced brownies in san francisco in the 1970s. it also deals with volz's parents' relationship and some remarkable events in san francisco in the period. the book is called home baked.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) a play, yes. a straight play?
liotta: that's it - didn't talk about it at all. as a matter of fact, i'm pretty sure they told me - i did - for show-and-tell in kindergarten, i told people the story that i was adopted. it never came up. it never really bothered me. i mean, the only time it would bother me with my parents is - on saturdays, they used to make us clean - you know, clean the house and vacuum and do chores. and i would never forget saying, the only reason why you adopted us was to do all this work. so it never really bothered me and i never really thought about it that much.
her daughter is named malia and was born shortly after president obama won in 2008, though trotter and her boyfriend picked the name before they knew one of obama's daughters was also named malia.
now, that's a huge burden of command, and it's something that you have to fight and tamp down, and you can't even begin - you can't allow yourself a moment of hesitation. and that faith in oneself is a very - that's the difference between success and failure, and it's not easy to do. and all of these guys have some degree of accomplishment, but it's been learned and earned at the same time. you know, no one is made a captain of a cargo ship without, you know - without an extraordinary amount of experience behind them. and that brand of of terror or loss of your own self-confidence, look - that's something that everybody goes through at some point. i have - my life has never been in jeopardy ever once.
volz: no. and i know that seems strange. but it was something that i learned so young that i don't have a specific memory about it. it was always who we are. so i had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning.
(soundbite of tv show, shades of blue)
mcevers: after that day, mandy stopped working as a therapist. she transferred all her clients to other counselors.
i want you guys to know that our belief does not mean that we hate these young kids, she says, voice quivering. our belief is not about the fact that we think there is anything awful about them. but love does not mean that we accept certain things also.

transcript and video: president obama's interview with npr's nina totenberg
brian barfield: i want him to come out and say, 'here's what i've done. that was the start folks. and here's what i am going to do. i'm going to put hillary behind bars. i'm gonna build up our military. i'm going to make sure that wall gets built and mexico will pay.' ... everything he said in his campaign, just keep going right with it.
liotta: and i ended up in the hospital.
volz: no, but she found out. so apparently, what happened is that my dad - who can't keep a secret - told cheryl (ph), the other salesperson, at a point. he just had to get it off his chest. and i think that she told my mom. and then he, later on, during a big fight, he told her in an angry way. so my mom found out fairly shortly thereafter. this wasn't something i was told about as a kid. but i think as a teenager - was when i found out. and it is the kind of story that sticks in your craw.
greene: ok. so now to the actors - and i mean, as we know, one of the things oscar has been criticized for for a long time is lack of diversity. what are we looking at this year?
within hours of the tragedy in charlottesville, journalists, scholars and other leading voices weighed in around the internet, with analysis and deeper understanding of how this unfolded.
hanks: the story that has to come out, now, is all of what you're talking about. that yes, of - i've talked to guys with missing limbs, and i visited with a bunch of wounded guys a while back. and there was two guys that had lost limbs, and they were still in wheelchairs. one guy was going to be in the hospital for probably about another three years, missing two arms and - two legs and an arm. and i was talking to another fellow who was in the same condition, suffered the same wounds, but he was going to be getting out in a couple of weeks.
sagal: here then are your choices of the cats in the news. was it, from amy dickinson, how the wrong cat litter led to a nuclear meltdown at a nuclear waste facility; from rosie perez, how somebody annoyed with cat litter on his floor came up with a business for cat manicures, pedicures and other salon services in new york; or from adam felber, how the hero cat of youtube turns out to be an unreconstructed racist?
under the first amendment to the u.s. constitution, congress is barred from enacting an establishment of religion, but neither can it prohibit the free exercise thereof. the question under current debate is what it means to exercise one's religion.
when the conversation doesn't include you: lgbtq+ sex ed in a small town
hanks: and you don't know his name. and i just thought, well, that is a brand of serendipity that might be the backbone in order to put into this movie that i wanted to make that was about music, that was about growing up. so what happens in that thing you do! is guy patterson has to replace the drummer in the wonders because he broke his arm. and it's because of that serendipity, that circumstance, that he ends up having six of the greatest months of his life. so it was taking something that had happened in real life and turning it to my own devices.
mcevers: her name is denise peraza, is that right?
christina aguilera: come on. come on. yeah. (vocalizing). come on. come on.
volz: ok. so this is kind of, i want to say, a ridiculous part of the story. although, i think my parents would disagree. but my mom - both of my parents, actually, believed strongly in the occult and specifically the i ching, which is a 4,000-year-old chinese divination method rooted in daoism and confucianism. and you would consult it in the way that you might consult tarot cards. and my mom believed wholeheartedly in this practice.
(soundbite of guy van duser's viper's drag)
i have a boy and two girls — until they tell me otherwise — and my son had a bunch of friends over and i walked into the room and i said to them, is anybody hungry? and all the boys answered, yes, without taking their eyes off the tv. the girls said nothing, took their eyes off the tv and started looking at each other's faces. and i'll never forget it, because i thought: oh, we girls, in every moment of uncertainty are trained not to look inside themselves, but to look outside of themselves for approval, for permission, for consensus. ... a girl who at 10 years old can't tell you if she's hungry or not, becomes a woman at 40 years old who is still asking her friends if they approve of the person she's dating. ...there's decisions that we can make as a community that we can call our friends about. and there are decisions that can only be made by going inward and deciding for ourselves. because in the end, when we're talking about our lives, there's no map. right? we're all pioneers.
his shoulders and knees are busted from years of physically demanding work. and unable to find a job after years of searching, he finally gave up and got approved for federal disability payments. so i am officially retired, he said.
davies: and you mentioned that some of the women who were transcribing the tapes just...
woodfin: two worlds. i would say what's similar is people have high demands and high requests and a lot of issues and concerns for whatever level you represent people. they come directly to you. they want you to fix something, solve something, address something. so that's similar, but different in this - in the fact that this is the largest city in the state of alabama. so there are many and multiple issues that i am tasked with and responsible for addressing. i want to address - hopefully, my city councilors don't get mad. but i will definitely say my brothers at morehouse.

gwen verdon is played by michelle williams, who's come a long way from the wb's dawson's creek, and she was good even there. in manchester by the sea, brokeback mountain and my week with marilyn, she's shown her versatility and sensitivity. and when i saw her take a turn starring in the recent broadway revival of cabaret, she was one of the best sallys (ph) i saw at the roundabout theatre, and i saw them all. and speaking of versatility, bob fosse is played by sam rockwell, who's done terrific work in everything from confessions of a dangerous mind and galaxy quest to three billboards outside ebbing, missouri.
meraji: ...for almost a decade. you were also president of the school board. is that correct?

amy dickinson: alvin bar hit the jackpot recently when he brought a ceramic jug to antiques roadshow to be appraised. alvin came away with shocking knowledge that his $300 ugly face jug was worth $50,000. the grotesque-style pottery which looks like a cross between a gargoyle and nick nolte's mugshot, was described by the show's appraiser as bizarre and wonderful and about 100 years old. after the jug was appraised, alvin bar, its owner, reacted like he went to bed with phyllis diller and woke up with beyonce.

but my relationship with the i ching as a kid was that i trusted it. and the fact that my mom felt confident using it made me feel confident as well. so i sometimes think about how, you know, the knowledge that my parents could have gone to prison at any time, how that should have been terrifying to me as a kid. and yet, it didn't keep me awake at night because i trusted my mom's decision-making abilities. and i trusted the i ching then. it was later, more as a teenager, that i was like, oh, no. wait. science (laughter), you know? and i started to rebel more against the idea. but it's really only as an adult that i look back at the situation we were in and worry about the kid i was.
pifer: yeah - well, i had a feeling when he didn't pick up. but when it went straight to voicemail...
so did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that republicans really do like him?
meraji: mayor woodfin, you've got to take this first.
david letterman. so it's a very weird, wild story. i found out i had four birth half-sisters, a half-brother and a full sister - things i didn't know. and i'm 44 years old, so i didn't know any of this stuff.
meraji: she's actually from staten island.
sagal: did you just say father of four cats?
gross: and they're at this turning point of their lives 'cause they're teenagers entering adulthood or maybe college or maybe the military and maybe fame. and, like, you don't know, through most of the movie, which direction this is going to go in. and you're the person who's kind of, like, experienced in it. you're the a&r guy. so why did you choose to do it from the point of view as a band? i assume you love music, in part because of this movie and also, like, your company has produced the telecasts of the rock and roll hall of fame inductions.
and she also - i had asked her about precautions that she had taken to avoid erasing. and she basically screamed at me, well, i used my head. it's the only thing i had to use. and it turned out that wasn't very effective, obviously, because the mistake was made. and when she finally was called the second time to testify, i had to give her her miranda warnings, which is something that lawyers seldom ever do. but she was now a suspect in a criminal investigation, and so i had to do it before i could ask her any questions.
kurtis: you know, not many people get all three right, but neal brennan did. congratulations, neal.
gross: martin scorsese was very close with his mother and even did a documentary about his mother. i assume he really understood what it was like for you to have a mother who was very sick.
greene: well, professor, if i might just ask you about an opinion piece that you wrote for the charlotte observer, you said your vision for civil rights has shifted over time and that there was a time when you would've watched from the sidelines discrimination against lgbt people and thought that it wasn't your battle. what's changed now?
we went to church. church on sundays was, like, two hours. bible school was a very prescribed thing. dinnertime was the parson coming over with - and he would - parson, would you do the honor of us asking the blessing? my sister and my brother and i would roll our eyes because that'd mean that guy was going to talk for 40 minutes. you know, he'd have his head bowed and the operatic voice would come out. dear heavenly father, we ask bountiful blessings on the hanks family. here we are. he would talk for - and eyes closed, the food's getting cold, we're all hungry. we didn't quite really understand what was going on.

the environment for lgbt rights in new hampshire has changed in the intervening years, said butler. the lgbt community is more visible and better organized, and public attitudes are changing about transgender people.
wine-banks: no, you don't. you just smile and stand there, all the blood draining from your face and in total horror. i mean, it was very hard to be the first. and i always felt that as the first, if i screwed up that i was going to make it harder for anyone to follow me. it would be easy for someone to say, well, women just can't do it. and so i really felt that pressure to perform well so that other women could follow me.

so the scene down at fisherman's wharf was one of the spectacular emergences. there were, actually, at the time, thousands of artists and crafts people who sold to tourists on the street all kinds of things they made themselves. and there was a busking scene of people like robin williams and penn and teller and magicians and tap dancers and musicians and whole dance troupes - this really elaborate scene that was called the new vaudeville.

one of the reasons it is so hard to find our inner voice is because the voices outside of us are so loud. over time, we have lived more and more of an exterior life. right? we are always looking at our phones. we are always listening to the tv. we are always listening to outer voices. and so one of the things that changed my life is a practice of spending a few minutes a day just with no other voices, and just listening. getting back in touch with the inner voice ... i do not think that everyone needs to leave their husband and marry a female olympian — although i highly recommend it — but what i do think is that everyone needs to practice honoring that inner voice.
davies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross. we're listening to my interview with writer alia volz. her new memoir describes her mother's successful business serving marijuana-laced brownies in the 1970s in san francisco and her parents' relationship at a time of cultural and social change in the city. volz's book is home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco.

felber: remember smudge, the hero cat who was caught on video saving his toddler friend from a vicious dog a couple of weeks ago? of course you do. more than 130 million people watched it on youtube. well, the happy story has kind of a sour coda because in addition to being a hero, it now turns out that smudge is a huge racist.
so she would use the stroller to transport the brownies. and we'd go from business to business. and her customers just absolutely adored me and fawned over me. so i was very little. obviously, i don't remember much clearly from this period. but i do have these flashes of memory. and there's a certain feeling that comes to me when i think of it. it was a very exuberant period in the city and especially in the castro, where my mom was mostly working. and there was, i think, a lot of cheek-pinching and fawning and a lot of joy around it is the feeling that i get, anyway.

we can't use equality to just wipe out one of the [first amendment] rights, carlson-thies says, or say you can have the right, as long as you just exercise it in church, but not out in life.
woodfin: that's a really good answer.
davies: now, what's interesting, you initially request - i think - nine tapes, and you had to ask for specific dates. and this is an interesting fact that occurred to me as i read this. it helped in asking for specific dates to have white house logs, which you had been provided by whom?

what he wants to hear: i would like to see him remain calm, and not go off on a tangent, and focus — focus on the problems at hand and what he's done so far and what he hopes to accomplish. i want him to get up there and act presidential and look presidential and don't pass buck and don't start slamming anybody and just tell it like it is. ... i want to hear what he thinks he's accomplished. and i don't need him to necessarily be optimistic, to sugar-coat it, but tell me what you really are doing. tell me what progress he's seen, real progress he's seen. i would like to see some hard mechanics.

so for - you know, my mom had the first really high-volume delivery service. now you can use an app to summon a company like eaze and a complete stranger will show up to your door with a lanyard. you don't exchange more than five words, and you pay for it with a debit card. the community aspect has completely run out of the process. the current canna-business (ph) laws are also extremely harmful to small farmers, who were the ones who kept this all going during the '70s and '80s. so some of the changes have really stripped the community-building feelings out of it. at the same time, i'm glad that people have access, especially those who use it for medicinal purposes.

gross: (laughter) did you have attention deficit disorder?
wine-banks: there's a lot of reasons why. he has the motive to erase it because it was the very first tape on our subpoena. likely, in preparation for whether he was going to give them to us or not, he listened to the tapes. and logically, he would have listened to that one first. my theory is he listened to them and went, oh, this is bad. it shows that i know everything just a few days after the break-in. i can't let people hear that. so he erases it. then he goes to the second tape and goes, oh, my gosh, they're all bad...
woodfin: but should there be term limits? yes.
rockwell: (as bob fosse) why not?
brennan: not exactly, but i will say, like - jessi, do you know what sliding into someone's dms means?
klein: we're really selling your stand-up special.
while both cases make their way through lower courts, both sides anticipate the high court taking the issue up again — for the sake of clarity.
this year it may be an issue. in fact i think it is, in part because of the circus that has been the presidential campaign season so far.

then on february 11 of 1964, the beatles were on television, and it all went away before the first commercial break of the ed sullivan show. to see these guys on tv, in which everybody on the planet stopped what they were doing in order watch it, 1964 became, i think, the most joyous year of my life. and it was all because of them and everything that followed. so when i began having these stories rattle around inside my head, i selfishly wanted to recreate that same joy that i experienced as a 7-year-old kid in february and march and april and the entire summer of 1964.

and my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. i'm not demanding that republicans vote for merrick garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. and at some point, it's got to stop.

but he would have these grand mal seizures. and sometimes they led to psychological instability, as well as memory loss. but i find it fascinating because the idea of a spiritually associated seizure is not new. dostoyevsky wrote rapturously about seizures. and some pretty interesting historical figures have been posthumously diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. so i don't know if my dad might be in that category. in any case, it was a strong force in his life.

and so the - just the circumstances are much different than the edwards case. they couldn't ever tie it directly to the election. and there was really no smoking gun. we have - it remains to be seen now in this case whether there is a smoking gun. but certainly, the circumstances surrounding the payment would back up the fact that this was related to the election.

the only non-judge on the list is utah sen. mike lee, a ted cruz supporter during the primaries who has refused to endorse trump and continued that position friday, even in the face of a change from cruz.
look, it's a lot easier and it's a lot happier in order to talk about, and then they won the war and went home and became dry cleaners. but it's something else that when those infections are inside you, how in the world does somebody come back from afghanistan after three tours and just pick up right where they left off? i think that - boy, you're in the high country when you're talking about that kind of stuff that rattles around inside your brain.
cornish: now, staying with the theme of keeping a relationship exciting, our next question comes from someone in a long-distance relationship. clark is from new york. he asked that we use his first name only because his question has to do with sex. now, he lives a few hours away from his girlfriend. they just started dating. and they're only able to see each other once a month.
liotta: (as joey perrini) look, we got an annulment, right? that means, like, the marriage never happened, right? - never existed.
sagal: and then he was sent away by his parents, who tried to break up this forbidden romance. and he said, i will return and marry her. and he did it. and everybody's like, whoa, this kind of salacious. but it's covering up the real interesting thing, which is that a drama geek is now the president of a major western power.
there are many people who feel that they always were who they are, and to refer to an earlier part of your life differently is really disrespectful, she says. but even though i respect that view, for me, ... i had this experience and it's an experience that i now struggle to connect to.

wine-banks: yes, although in the watergate case, there were a lot more complications. at first, he said, this is a hoax in a witch hunt, which sounds dramatically familiar to listeners today. he also simply refused. he just said, i'm not turning them over. eventually we went public. archibald cox, who was the special prosecutor, had a press conference and, in a very moving and dramatic and - full of integrity, said why we needed the tapes and why we had a legal right to have them, which led to the president ordering the attorney general to fire archibald cox.

carlson-thies is one of several conservatives who support a fairness for all initiative to forge a compromise between advocates for lgbt rights and religious freedom, but the effort has had little success so far. the lgbt community and their allies have been cool to the notion of compromising their cause, while a group of more strident religious freedom advocates made clear their own opposition to the recognition of sexual orientation as a status worthy of civil rights protection.

and that's when i realized, oh this idea of mother as martyr — that mothers have to prove their love by slowly dying, by burying their own needs, and their own ambition, and their own desires, and their own emotions ... this is just another way we get women to disappear. ... don't take culture's definition of good mothering, because all culture will tell you is to keep disappearing. what i decided is that a good mother is not a martyr, a good mother is a model, right? that children will only allow themselves permission to live as fully as their parents do. and so we must not settle for any relationship, for any community, for any nation less true and beautiful than the one we would want for our babies.

three sources close to the justice department confirmed that yates, who had been planning to leave the department in a few days anyway after her successor won confirmation, knew her decision to speak out could lead to termination. but, the sources said, after agonizing over the situation, she felt strongly that the immigration order could represent a thinly veiled effort to target a particular religious group, and that was worth taking a stand.

the vanderhelms are deeply troubled by the idea that anyone in allendale would feel hated because of their views. by the end of the conversation, kim's brow is furrowed, and she is near tears.
comedians have been mocking presidents forever, meyer said, wondering why this president feels compelled to respond.
less than two weeks after his inauguration, and only hours after yates sent a message to department lawyers announcing that she would not defend trump's order restricting travel and immigration from seven muslim-majority countries, the new president removed the nation's top law enforcement officer in a move not seen since the nixon era.
that's been one of the things i'm proudest of is, for example, when i was general counsel of the army - another first as a woman - my successor was a woman. and that meant that i had done a good enough job that they were willing to hire another woman.

they play corrupt new york cops who take bribes, plant evidence and shake down drug dealers in their precinct. the criminals pay off the cops. and in return, the cops let the dealers do their thing, as long as they don't get too close to schools or cause any other trouble. before we hear about liotta's life and movies, let's hear a scene from the premiere of shades of blue. liotta's character, lt. matt wozniak, is using a little coercion to keep one of his dealers in line.

so we've reported that republican — leading republican senators sent a message sort of back-channel: ok, if you appoint merrick garland, we — we still will oppose him now, but we would confirm him in the lame-duck session after the election if there's a democratic president. did that play any role in your decision?

her devastation lingers. she even insists on showering in her old, collapsing apartment. but she doesn't want to go to the police. the inaction in the middle section of the salesman is excruciating. and there's a broader aspect to the film. slowly, we begin to see the parallels between this event and death of a salesman, in which willy's son learns that his dad is seeing a prostitute, which helps drive the old man to suicide. more, i cannot say, except that i didn't draw too many breaths during the last half hour.

a good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a supreme court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.

as much as whodunits, farhadi makes what-done-its and why-done-its. the director has a detached, rather clinical style, as if he's photographing specimens in a terrarium, the terrarium being a city in which artists have to watch their backs because of hovering sensors. his own social criticisms are oblique. the movie begins with the imminent collapse of rana and emad's lovely apartment, a literal collapse, the result of apparently careless citywide construction.

clinton also led in south carolina in 2008, but those leads evaporated once barack obama proved he could win in lily-white iowa. he not only carried the black vote 78 percent to 19 percent over clinton, but he also won with women (also a majority) and young voters. sanders has been beating clinton by huge margins with young voters, and even won women in new hampshire.
wine-banks: rose mary woods was basically thrown under the bus by the white house counsel. they said we have now discovered as part of the drip, drip, drip of bad news - after the hearing on the first two missing tapes, they came back on the day before thanksgiving and said, whoops (ph), there is a problem in a third tape. there's an 18 1/2-minute gap, and only rose mary woods can explain it. and we can find no innocent explanation for it, which was really a dramatic announcement. and i had cross-examined her when she first testified about the two missing tapes as basically just a chain of custody witness because she had handled them.
sagal: emmanuel macron, the new president, he's a rich businessman who has never held office before. and he ran for the presidency saying that politicians have failed the people, and it was time to return when france was great. all true. he's just like donald trump, except macron can speak better english.
haslam last week vetoed a proposal to make the bible the official state book. he told npr it trivializes the bible. he also successfully urged lawmakers to withdraw a so-called bathroom bill, tennessee's version of legislation that would require students to use restrooms according to their gender assigned at birth rather than one that matches the gender with which they identify. north carolina and mississippi have both approved such laws amid widespread criticism.
so i had to rely on ollie atkins, who was the president's white house photographer. and the pictures are dramatic proof that her story didn't hold up. she also, just to make it clear, she said she had to make two mistakes. she had to push the wrong button and keep her foot on the pedal, which was a physical impossibility, certainly for 18 minutes. you might have been able to do it for one second but not for any prolonged period of time. so it just wasn't possible.

well, first of all, if you look at what joe biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a supreme court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.

i think, in 2018, when i fast forward and there have been so many stories - when you think about the four little girls, there was a fifth girl that survived, sarah. and when i think about her, she is the definition of reconciliation, where she spoke recently - there was a re-enactment of the children's crusade, the march. and she spoke in front of an audience, but the majority of the room was full of children. and she spoke of forgiveness and forgiving to what happened to her, what happened to her sister, what happened to her friends. and i think if i had a tangible example to give of just what reconciliation means, she embodies that.
woodfin: i've been paying attention to other cities. in 2018, you can't call d.c. chocolate city anymore. hot atlanta. we've seen the changes there. and then, you see it even in a city like austin. i think for birmingham, watching other cities - what can we do? a city made up of 99 neighborhoods, where 88 of them are all black, 11 are majority white.

and the alameda naval air station meant that most of my friends were in the navy, their dads were in the navy, their parents were dealing with that. and this was during vietnam, so i had - my schoolmates all had dads on the uss ranger and the iwo jima and the enterprise, aircraft carriers and what have you. and they were all in the gulf of tonkin, and they were flying missions in this war that was going on.
the idea of having sex as a trans person is weird because your brain is disconnected from your physical body, she explains. so when you look at your body, you don't want this, you know? so the idea of having sex in this body is hard ... because maybe i'll just look down and see this disgusting body of mine and cry or something, you know?
it's very rare to find a purely conservative or a purely liberal congregation, tooley says. so if there is some sort of a division, or if there's the creation of a new liberal methodist church, that almost inevitably will generate painful divisions in local congregations. often the clergy are more liberal than the laity. so in many situations, you may have pastors who would like to join the new, more liberal denomination, but a majority of the lay people in their church may prefer to stay in the old denomination.
it did make a big difference, though, in terms of acceptance of what we were doing because you had a public disclosure of information so that the american public could hear john dean testify. and i have to say at the time when he testified, he had no notes because he had been escorted out of the white house and had left without his diaries and messages. so he testified from memory.
klein: that's exactly what i mean.
and if it wasn't for buckets, i probably would've left. but i came back the next year. and i ended up going the whole four years. but during those four years, i graduated to doing riff in west side story and just different musicals. so to answer your question, yes, i had sang before.
meraji: all right. let's go to the next question.
woodfin: let's just say last tuesday, i had a drink at the platinum. how about that?
gross: the freddie was just, like, the goofiest dance ever. yeah.
david edelstein, byline: a woman is brutally assaulted in the early part of asghar farhadi's gripping iranian drama the salesman. the woman, rana, is washing up in the bathroom of her new apartment in an unfamiliar part of tehran, just home from acting in arthur miller's death of a salesman, where she plays willy loman's wife. she hears the buzzer from downstairs and thinks it's her husband, emad, who plays willy. so she unlocks the door and returns to what she was doing.
boylan writes that when she was living as a boy, and then as a man, there were times when she found it impossible to express the thing that was in her heart. but she never had to hide what she felt for dogs. her memoir is told through the lens of seven different dogs she loved throughout the years.
our panelists read three purrfectly amusing stories about felines in the news, only one of which is true.
meraji: but earlier you talked about how, you know, 88 of the 99 neighborhoods here are black and 11 are white.
liotta: (as henry hill) get the [expletive] out of here, tommy.
davies: actor ray liotta speaking with terry gross. their conversation continues after a short break. this is fresh air.
and now to the story of a royal marriage gone wrong and the geopolitical wrangling that has ensued because of it. princess haya bint al-hussein is the sixth wife of sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum, the ruler of dubai. the tale that follows involves allegations of kidnapping, possible infidelity and much more. to fill us in is the bbc's frank gardner, who has been following the story.
pifer: she survived. she's going to be having a baby girl after the first of the year - olivia shannon (crying), so...
meraji: i'm puerto rican and iranian.
demby: that does not happen in new york...
and i saw photographs of him, and i saw a little bit of footage of this guy picked out of total obscurity to play drums between three of the most famous musicians in the world at the time. john, paul and george were up front, and jimmy was playing the drums, and i just thought, what did that guy experience for a few months?
gross: so something about your health - you've publicly said that you not long ago were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes...
whether that will shift with time as the millennial generation marries and has children is the big economic question.
peter grosz: dr. vincent benjamin of palm springs, calif., is one of america's leading experts in the kama sutra, the ancient indian book containing dozens of creative sexual poses with names like the eagle, the bridge and bandolier. but the kama sutra isn't just sexy twister. it can be a way for couples to rekindle the dormant flames of their marriage, which is why this week dr. benjamin sold out the symposium he hosts at the sheridan in indio, calif., entitled more bang for your buck, spicing up your love life for only $50.

let me conclude by asking you sort of a devil's advocate question.
davies: and did you know that that could mean prison and, you know, foster care for you? or...
liotta: you go up and down (laughter) - probably with your feet.
as the news was breaking of the directive from yates, trump senior policy adviser stephen miller told msnbc's greta van susteren that yates' decision was a further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become.
liotta: no, man, she had cash.
but can you blame the republicans who look at this nomination and say, there's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court. so can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win the presidential nomination [sic]. and if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the democrats do the same? they called — they're all already calling it the biden rule.
in fact, there were many u.s. methodists who joined united methodists from africa and elsewhere in supporting the new resolutions at the general conference.
meraji: were you discouraged from having interracial relationships growing up?
russian-american masha gessen sees putin in trump, trouble in future
shaw: well, when i wrote that, what i meant was that i was focused on the battles on behalf of african-americans. over time, as a civil rights lawyer, i came to realize that we have to be opposed to the subordination of people because of who and what they are, even if we're not part of that group. but i simply think that discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation and, in this instance, specifically transgender people, is simply wrong. it should be wrong. it's a matter of law. and i think as a country, we've been growing in our understanding of our values and principles with respect to discrimination and how we treat our fellow citizens and how we want to be treated ourselves, all of us, whether it's on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, age, our religion, on and on. it's just growth.
gross: you're an overgrown boy in that.
jennifer barfield says she loves trump, too, but maybe not absolutely everything about him.
ten years after his death, storycorps features an interview recorded march 2013 with engeman's widow and daughter, where mom shared with nicole the couple's great love story, from the very beginning.
douban: right? in the moment, it just kind of like - i don't know, it just didn't really register. and then you have that moment later where you're like - you're thinking, did that really just happen...
this operation got pretty big. your mom was moving something like 2,800 brownies a week at its height. how did she manage the risk? i mean, this was, after all, a class 1 narcotic. you know, these were felonies every day or every week. how did she manage the risk of it?
simon: that michael cohen had made them and the president knew nothing about it, right?
meraji: ...of applause for everybody who volunteered.
davies: as you and your mom made these deliveries, did you find people who you had known for years and years getting sicker and sicker?
philpott: but this member of the fourth generation of the bush political dynasty hasn't quite lived up to the expectations. there are questions about how well his office has handled hurricane harvey relief. even worse, he's received bad press over his handling of the alamo - you know, the one we're supposed to remember all the time. so facing an unexpectedly tough primary, george p. bush has sought out the most coveted endorsement in republican politics.
liotta: (as matt wozniak) you don't dispense street justice in my precinct. now, where is he?
that said, butler notes there has been no recent attempt to add gender identity to new hampshire's anti-discrimination law.

our panelists tell three stories about an expert getting something wrong, only one of which is true.
my law school - i went to columbia in new york. the students there wrote a letter to him complaining about his treatment of me, and he did apologize for that.

you've said that neither party comes to this process clean.
liotta: (as himself) goodfellas, something wild, field of dreams.
meraji: welcoming cities - what do you mean by that? what's the discrepancy between the two things because you were talking about there's these two things?
this kind of struggle is playing out in communities across the country. in a recent national survey by the nonprofit glsen, less than 1 in 10 lgbtq+ students said they received sex ed that was inclusive of their identities. in some places, laws expressly prohibit teachers from discussing lgbtq+ people or topics in a positive way — in other words, promoting homosexuality. activists commonly refer to these as no promo homo laws.
cornish: speaking of which, we got quite a few questions about virtual dates, how to make them less awkward, more fun. could either of you jump in here with some creative ideas for virtual dates?

now we'd like to introduce our next guest for the evening. he grew up here. he graduated from shades valley high school.
boylan acknowledges that some in the trans community might take issue with the notion that she had a boyhood.
pifer: yeah, you know, sometimes i have gone out. and you know what? it's - it was - the first time wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be because i'm not going to hijack their experience with my own experience. i just know that they have a long road ahead of them, the people we respond to. and keeping them safe in the moments after the horrible accident is really helping me heal, to an extent. it's giving back. and it's a huge word, people were dropping it. i didn't agree at first. but i think it's destiny now.
colonialism is a real thing. but i also want to point out, having talked to several of my friends in africa, that not all africans agree with this decision, she says. i think it's unfair for americans to blame africa or south america or the philippines for this decision.
equality for all is something that we here in colorado are committed to, the laws will be enforced, weiser said. we will just have to play a few more innings before we win this game.
lisa garaya: when i came to college, i learned about various theories surrounding race such as microaggressions and power dynamics. these are words that i had obviously never heard, but i began to feel like these examples of casual racism hit a little too close to home. for example, growing up, it was a pretty normal occurrence to be asked what kind of indian i was - red dot or feather. i thought back on how time after time my white peers made me feel uncomfortable with their comments about my racial background, except at the time they were saying it, i didn't know why i was uncomfortable. learning about microaggressions provided clarity but also introduced a lot of anger in my life. it's frustrating. do any other people of color who go through this epiphany feel this way? how do you decompress your past with this new outlook on it?
unidentified actor: (as character) why are you here? can you - can you understand us?
greene: now the state of north carolina is basically accusing the obama administration of trying to rewrite laws, suggesting that this should be left to congress and that the obama administration has an agenda here that they're trying to put forth. i mean, does the state have an argument there?
i thought that i would be able to at least make enough money to make the payments, which wasn't true at all, she says.
martin: that's npr justice correspondent carrie johnson. carrie, thanks so much.
philpott: grandson to president number 41, nephew to number 43 and son to jeb bush, the former florida governor and presidential candidate. that's a lot to live up to, but it was a mantle that, southern methodist university political science professor cal jillson says, george p. appeared ready to take up.
at the courthouse, he pleads guilty to public urination. he says he didn't think life would be like this when he was younger.
kelli barrett: (singing) don't dab your eye, mein herr, or wonder why, mein herr. i've always said that i was a rover. you mustn't knit your brow. you should've known by now...
but i think the same cohort of people now, who are 22 and 23 - they want to stay here. and so it's good to see our city be a part of the national trend of people wanting to be in the urban core in the central city. with that, that's bringing a whole new flavor of young people and new people, i think, from a governing standpoint. people want their municipal government to reflect the same thing we're seeing in the private sector. they want it to reflect the same thing they're seeing on the social scene, which is something new. and that's what our candidacy and campaign represented.
coming up, maureen corrigan reviews the compelling memoir of a vietnamese refugee who fled the fall of saigon with his family and grew up in a pennsylvania town. this is fresh air.
how can innovation happen in a society like this? asks shi jiepeng, a classical-chinese expert who is now a visiting scholar at the university of tokyo. shi was also singled out by party inspectors three years ago because of remarks he had made about deceased chinese leaders such as mao and emperor wu of the han dynasty.
gross: yes. i'm talking about the first divorce, right.

meraji: all right. listen. how about this? there were over 5,000 18 to 35-year-olds who participated for the first time in a municipal election in the city of birmingham because of what i said earlier. like, millennials definitely want to be here.
well, you know, i — i — that just shows his wisdom once again, because when it comes to things like getting — being nominated for the supreme court, it's probably always wise to not count your chickens before they're hatched.

davies: well, it came from the people you loved and trusted, right?
davies: right. so she ends up giving this explanation of - and people who remember watergate will remember this - that it seems the only way she could have erased this, she said the phone rang and she went to pick up the phone but somehow kept her foot on a pedal that was connected to the recording. and then that's what caused the erasure. but what's remarkable about this is that she says, well, it was different in my - when you made a comment about that's awkward, and she says, well, it's different in my office.
annica trotter, 31, was the youngest person we met in 2011. and she doesn't just have a job six years later, she has a career. she is working overnights as a registered nurse, making a difference in people's lives one shift at a time.
their position is completely hypocritical to what it actually means to be a christian, she said. if they're reaching out to evangelicals and saying, 'i am a christian, but i support gay marriage; i am a christian, but i support abortion,' that's being hypocritical.

when it comes to the supreme court, i've appointed two women, one hispanic. and in each case, the good news is that i appointed the person who i absolutely thought was the best person for the job. in this case, merrick garland is the best person for the job.
hanks: ...like, went with the flow, and we moved around an awful lot. and, by the time i was 10 - i was actually kind of proud of this, as a matter of fact - by the time i was 10, i had lived in 10 different houses.
if they don't buy it from us, they're going to buy it from russia or they're going to buy it from china or they're going to buy it from other countries, trump said at a news conference on saturday. from the standpoint of jobs, economic development, a lot of other reasons, i would like to do something where we could maybe look at other things [than canceling the deal].
nondiscrimination is a great american principle — it's a core american principle — as is religious freedom, haynes says. when you have two important american principles coming into tension, into conflict with one another, our goal as americans is to sit down and try to see if we can uphold both.
this week, the trump administration weighed in on an important civil rights case heading to the u.s. supreme court. the u.s. justice department sided with a colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. to advocates in the lgbt community, it is just the latest disappointment from the trump administration. npr justice correspondent carrie johnson is here to tell us more. carrie, thanks so much for joining us.

richard spencer, the white nationalist leader and university of virginia alum who coined the term 'alt-right,' would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. 'if you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs,' spencer told the atlantic last year, not long after the election. 'by 2015, gay marriage is popular. what is possible has shifted. that's what the alt-right is doing. it's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.' 
woodfin: i think sanctuary city is narrowly tailored and isolated towards don't have your police enforce certain things of rounding up and hurting people, which i agree with. we're not going to do that. but welcoming cities is more broad about, how do we help our immigrant community? and as i go to birmingham city schools, i can tell you our immigrant community continues to grow. so it's - for me it has a broader positive impact, whereas sanctuary is don't do this. welcoming is, this is what we're going to do.
trump: if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states.
philpott: and a bush loss? well, that would have pundits across the country talking about the end of the bush political dynasty. still, it's a big family. for npr news, i'm ben philpott in austin.
this is fresh air. i'm tv critic david bianculli, sitting in for terry gross. today's show is dominated by song and dance. first up, we'll listen back to an archive interview with gwen verdon, the broadway actress and dancer who electrified audiences in everything from can-can and damn yankees to chicago. along with one of her husbands, choreographer and film director bob fosse, she's the subject of a new fx miniseries called fosse/verdon, which premieres next tuesday. let's begin with my review of fx's fosse/verdon.
meraji: you can check out ashley's work online at ashleymichellejones.wordpress.com. ashley's newest book is called dark//thing, and it's going to be out in february.
davies: you know, you write in the book that brownie crumbs blanketed the floor where you played. between secondhand smoke, secret finger swipes of batter and stolen crumbs, you - the tots probably consumed a significant amount of cannabis. and there was some drug use among your parents and your friends beyond marijuana, you know, a lot of cocaine. you know, there are people who would be appalled reading this. what's your take on this? did you ever feel like any of this seemed irresponsible in retrospect?
yet many economists say this younger generation will eventually be able to buy — just later than previous generations.
del barco: yes - it also earned nominations for costume design, cinematography and score. but david, it's worth noting - it's worth taking a closer look at that directing category. the nominees include martin scorsese for his gangster film the irishman, quentin tarantino for his nostalgic take on 1970s hollywood once upon a time in hollywood, sam mendes for his world war i film 1917 and south korean director bong joon-ho for parasite. and you'll notice, though, that not a single woman was nominated for directing. announcer issa rae quickly noted that after the category was read.
sagal: thank you so much for playing.
hanks: no. it was - it literally came down to this - just simple. there was only one way that it could economically work. my mom and dad - god bless them - you know, they were together for a while. but when it was (laughter) - when it was time for them to divide, boy, did they know it. they needed to break up, and they did.
president trump is said to be considering an executive order to bar the federal government from punishing people or institutions that support marriage exclusively as the union of one man and one woman. the language is similar to a bill expected to be reintroduced by republican sens. ted cruz of texas and mike lee of utah called the first amendment defense act.

their new shabbier apartment has items belonging to the evicted previous tenant and her small child, whose bike is still there. that tenant apparently had clients, meaning johns, and emad suspects the person who assaulted his wife might have been one or else was sent by the woman to harass the new tenants. when he finds a set of keys dropped by the attacker and the van parked nearby they belong to, emad wants vengeance. but rana is impossible to pin down.
clinton has been emphasizing her support in the african-american community, touting the endorsement of the congressional black caucus pac this week. civil rights icon and georgia rep. john lewis was dismissive of sanders, saying he had seen evidence of the clintons' work to gain equal rights but not sanders's.

the original story behind the masterpiece cakeshop case is both undisputed and well known: a gay couple in colorado walked into the bakery in 2012 and asked for wedding cake. the owner and master baker jack phillips declined to make a custom cake for their party because he said their union violated his religious beliefs.
liotta: (as henry hill) just - you know, how you tell a story. what...
the measure did ultimately prevail. more than five years later, mahoney said the law has made a huge difference in the lives of lgbtq people.
liotta: to get better movie parts, to tell you the god's-honest truth. i - you know, i've been lucky enough to do and work in this business for years. but i wasn't getting the exact kind of parts that i wanted. usually, it wasn't about if i had the ability to do it. it was more about - did i have enough umph behind me to put butts in the seats or eyes on the tube? i just started seeing people's careers.
but in china, where officials are trying to get ahead of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, the date saw a surge of couples registering to wed, spurring the government to advise couples to postpone their weddings.
greene: when you say it's just growth, it makes me want to ask you if conversations around, you know, same-sex marriage that we've seen in recent years and the supreme court decision on that and the conversations around this law, i mean, are - as sensitive and infuriating as some of these conversations can be to some people on both sides, i mean, is there an argument that these conversations are just good for society to have as time evolves?
wine-banks: they did. they cried because they couldn't believe what they were hearing as they listened to this horrible series of conversations. and it's available to anyone who wants to listen through the national archives. you can listen to these tapes. and it's proof beyond doubt of the president's culpability.
davies: ...in a way, they had a place in the sort of recognition of the medical benefits of marijuana, didn't they?

klein: i mean, i think the red flagness (ph) is balanced out by the fact that you do present - and i mean this as a compliment - like, there's a wounded bird quality that i do think - i will say as a woman that i did also find appealing.
jennifer barfield is currently among the 4.8 percent officially counted as unemployed.
cal jillson: he was a young, vibrant, good-looking guy. so he looked like a central-casting, next-generation bush candidate starting in texas but with national possibilities.
klein: bill, how did neal do on our quiz?
now what is true, nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. justice scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. and so i understand the politics that republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.
hanks: i am a chrismated hellenic in the greek orthodox church. i do like, on occasion, going to sunday services. nothing is really expected of you in the greek orthodox church. you don't sing. you don't have hymnals. you might take part in some of the same choral chants that goes on. but i go, and i like to ponder the great questions of the universe when i go. and, i think, i embrace it as cleanly as i do because of the background that i had in all these other theologies that came at me.
i think the impact was profound, he said.
what i have seen are the public statements of leading republicans like orrin hatch broadly complimenting judge garland as a brilliant, fair jurist, who should be confirmed to the supreme court.
the unemployment rate would rise to about 9.4 percent if those who are marginally attached to the workforce or working part time for economic reasons are added to those still looking for work.
sagal: this is terrible. andy, it is nice to have you with us. you're going to play the game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction.
multiple gofundme campaigns have raised several thousand dollars to help alqunun start over. the official fundraising campaign quickly raised $10,000 and is no longer accepting money. there's also a campaign by the australian group secret sisterhood, which had protested in sydney to try to persuade australia to grant alqunun's refugee request. alqunun filled out her visa application at the australian embassy in bangkok last week, but the unhcr withdrew its request for resettlement there because the country was taking too long to decide on her asylum, abc reported.
johnson: sure. the owner of a colorado shop called masterpiece cakeshop refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple several years ago. colorado, like a lot of states, has public accommodation laws that are designed for businesses that interact with the public to prevent discrimination. and this baker, jack phillips, said no. he violated the statute on the books in colorado, saying he didn't want to be compelled to violate his first amendment rights, his deeply held religious beliefs, by celebrating this gay couple's marriage. but the same-sex couple said the baker was violating their rights.
dickinson: ...in the 1970s in bend, ore. sure enough, the original artist, betsy, verified that she had made it in ceramics class. so it's not 100 years old, and it's not worth $50,000. it's as old as your mom's crosby, stills, nash and young album and is worth a little more than $300. the antiques roadshow expert admitted his mistake, and the owner took the jug out from behind his couch. he said, i hated it when it was worth $50,000. who wants that lying around their house? now it's on my table, and i love it again.
brennan: i was trying to get more women to slide.
gross: david edelstein is film critic for new york magazine. tomorrow on fresh air, we'll talk about the trump administration's relationship with the alt-right and the divisions he's created in the christian right. our guest will be investigative journalist sarah posner. i hope you'll join us. i'm terry gross.
davies: you said - that was the story in your family. your mom didn't know it at the time, right?
but the artistic, creative process of one is still based on your ability to fight down those doubts of yourself, and you have to move forward. you have to move forward with a degree of confidence, and you cannot sweat too much the possibility that you are making a wrong mistake. it sounds almost like a paltry comparison to a lot of the characters that i've been able to play in these big movies, but, you know, that type of a battle of self-worth is something that everybody goes through at some point.
wine-banks: thank you. it's been a pleasure, dave.
brown-james: so one thing - and some people hate me for this, but i'm a go ahead and say it because i tell everybody to do that - i take sex off the table. so we can build up arousal, let's plan to do something funny every day. so we're laughing together. we're touching. let's look at just making out. kissing starts to decrease the longer that people are together, which are a million nerve endings that are not being tantalized on a regular basis. so let's just go for broke and have a make-out session midday for our, quote-unquote, lunch. and it doesn't have to go further than that.
but at the universities that have adopted pro-party charters, say academics interviewed by npr, the rule change encapsulates some of the difficulties that educators face in china.

trump's election raises host of issues for supreme court
davies: all right, let's talk about the watergate case. one of the interesting things about this is that in may of '73, when the special counsel's office is organized and you begin this criminal investigation into nixon and his associates, the u.s. senate forms a committee and is beginning to hold public hearings on this. and a lot had come out on this because the watergate burglars - one of them, james mccord - had begun talking about the cover-up, in effect. what effect did it have to u.s. prosecutors to have these senate hearings going on at the same time? did it reinforce what you were doing? did you learn things from it?
kurtis: look. he's a showboat. he's a grandstander. you know that. i know that. everybody knows that.

in response to this story, willing to wait sent a statement to npr, which says that the program includes topics such as reproductive anatomy, stds, healthy relationships, dating violence, consent laws, setting boundaries, refusal skills, goal setting, contraception methods including efficacy and limitations, and communicates the intrinsic value of every student without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity.

1. the state contains significant numbers of both evangelicals and moderates
-- the upstate: the most socially conservative, religious voters are clustered in the upstate, anchored by greenville and spartanburg and home to fundamentalist bob jones university. on friday, most gop candidates were at the famed college for a faith and family presidential forum, talking up their socially conservative values on abortion and same-sex marriage. only trump, who's come under fire for his obscenities and previous support of same-sex marriage, didn't attend.
liotta: right. and at that time, on all the oprah shows and maury - and this was 17 years ago - a lot of the shows were about locating friends, family, mothers, fathers - every show was about that.
and i have confidence that — without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case — he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.
i don't want to get into his mind — but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers, he said. who knows? we're going to try getting to the bottom of it very soon. but his was a flat denial.

negin farsad: and can you imagine, like, hillary clinton having fired james comey if she was president? people would like, oh, my god, emails, benghazi, evil lady. she would have had to wear like a scarlet letter c on her pantsuit. there would have been like a burning at the stake. like, it would've been a whole thing. but with donnie, we're just like, it's kind of funny, you know?
sanderson: well, it is a - fundamentally, a reporting problem. and the whole reason we have these reporting obligations for candidates is that voters are supposed to be able to look at the finance reports and base their votes on information. that's a potential problem for him, that the report - this payment was never reported. if it was related to the election, it should've been disclosed to the american people in advance of their vote.

unidentified man: president trump said, texas land commissioner george p. bush backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and i back him now.
recovery from trumpism — a process that will be necessary whenever trumpism ends — will not be a process of returning to government as it used to be, a fictional state of pre-trump normalcy. recovery will be possible only as reinvention: of institutions, of what politics means to us, and of what it means to be a democracy, if that is indeed what we choose to be.
volz: my mom came up with this really innovative business plan where she sold exclusively to people on the job. so she would go around to boutiques and restaurants and real estate offices and even medical offices and only sell to the people who were working. they would buy at large volume and then redistribute the brownies through their own social circles.
liotta: (as henry hill) it's funny, you know, that story - it's funny. you're a funny guy.

all right. let's get started. our first question comes from a listener named lisa garaya (ph). she's 21 years old. she's indian-american. and she grew up right here in birmingham. she says everything she knows about how to treat people comes from growing up in alabama, comes from her childhood here in alabama. but things have changed for lisa. and we're going to listen to her question.

4. black voters will be decisive on the democratic side
the only member of the bush political dynasty still in office is texas land commissioner george p. bush. although president trump vanquished bush's father, jeb, and has criticized former presidents george h.w. and w. bush, trump has endorsed george p.'s re-election bid.
liotta: yeah, i guess it did. the first thing i ever did was a soap opera. and i played the nicest character in the world, joey parini. i got it right - about six months out of college, i got the soap. i did it for three years. and then i came to la. for five years, nothing happened. and then the first thing i got was something wild. so that kind of put me on the map as - 'cause that was kind of a crazed character.
donald trump: i'm pro-life. the judges will be pro-life.
liotta: well, yes. but what happened was the love of my life, eileen (ph), died after i gave her a saint christopher medal up on a rock under the moon. i'll never forget the line i proposed to her -with the moon and the stars as my witness, i pledge my love to you. so that's what - but she died. i went up to where i proposed to her. it was winter. i slipped, fell (laughter).
volz: well, yeah, san francisco has changed quite a bit. with respect to cannabis, it is now legal for adult use. and san francisco and then california were first in denoting cannabis as an essential business during coronavirus, which was a watershed moment. nothing like that has happened before. so cannabis is very accessible to people. i feel that, at least for adults, that it should be. i think this is a good thing. but the culture has changed so much around it in ways that i find very heartbreaking.
it just keeps going. you're always - you're constantly learning things if you're the type of person who stays open and current. my dad, who - god bless him - just passed away at 98 - he was hip to everything because he read, 'cause he would watch tv. he wasn't - he wasn't closed down about anything. and he passed that on to me - or the way to talk to people. you can have a conversation with anybody. he kind of passed that on to me. he didn't pass music onto me 'cause i couldn't stand - the ironic thing is i once played frank sinatra. and i remember my parents listening to that. and i said, oh, my god, who is this guy? turn this off.
it's the first time the family leader has invited candidates actively seeking the democratic presidential nomination to the event, a spokesman said. vander plaats acknowledged that the group – known for fighting same-sex marriage – is an unlikely venue for democrats, but added, if you're going to cast a vision of unity, i think you need to be able to have the courage then to go to that venue ... and cast that vision.
hanks: ...or the people who came around the house when i was 9.
i can't watch it anymore because i get too choked up. it's very emotional for me, much more so than sleepwalk with me. sleepwalk with me ... never got to me in the way that [don't think twice] does, because it's really these six characters that keegan[-michael key] and gillian [jacobs] and kate [micucci] and tami [sagher] and chris [gethard] and i play. they're not me — they're these people who i believe exist. and i cry every time. i mean, i have nothing against crying, i just don't want to do it every day. i feel like once a week is fine, but if it becomes every day, after a while people are like, mike, what's going on with you?
greene: we spoke this morning with professor ted shaw. he is head of the center for civil rights at the university of north carolina school of law in chapel hill. we asked him to help us understand exactly what's being debated when it comes to civil rights. it sounds like discrimination is against federal law when it comes to genders. is the central question now whether gender should be interpreted as including the gender one chooses for theirself and not the sex based on the birth certificate? is that what's really in question here?
sagal: bill, how did landon do on our quiz?
the irony is jennifer barfield spent most of the last five years gainfully employed. but at the end of november, a temporary assignment ended, putting her back in the all-too-familiar position of searching for work.
i very much would have loved to have interviewed her. i would have loved to have interviewed friends of hers because i really wanted to portray her not just as the stereotypical way she's portrayed. i wanted to portray her as her friends knew her, but none of them would talk to me. they felt that i was the enemy, and i felt i just was doing my job and now would like to portray her fully. i did as much research as i could, tried so many people. bob woodward advised me to stop calling people and to actually knock on their door because it would be harder to slam the door in my face. and guess what? i went to interview someone who knew her quite well, and they slammed the door in my face.
and let's turn to that confrontation between the department of justice and the state of north carolina. each filed lawsuits against the other yesterday over a law known as house bill two. that state law says government buildings plus public schools and universities must restrict bathrooms and locker rooms according to one's sex on a birth certificate. yesterday, north carolina's republican gov. patrick mccrory announced his lawsuit, saying the justice department lacks the authority to intervene.
jesse tyler ferguson: (as mitchell pritchett) field of dreams.
when she walked through the airport door in toronto, and canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland was there to greet her, i felt free, and it was like i was born again, she told abc. i felt overjoyed. there was a lot of love and hospitality, especially when the minister welcomed me and told me i was in a safe country and had all my rights.
reaction to the new list was predictable.
later, when my own child came out as trans, i was surprised at how much i struggled, at least at first, with it. i suddenly had this insight into what i'd been asking other people, and including my own mother, to understand. in the end, i think i was glad for her, and i love my daughter and i'm really proud of her. but it's funny how i think having me as a parent didn't make my daughter's transition easier. in some ways and think it may have made it harder.
and basically, if you had polled america, people believed the denials. so he said, for example, that the chief of staff had done certain things. and the chief of staff, bob haldeman, testified that he hadn't. and people believed haldeman rather than dean.

one of the major activities of the [catholic] church, going way back, was to look after the orphans, says stanley carlson-thies, founder of the institutional religious freedom alliance. for that to be illegal unless the religious people change their standard, seems to me ... unfortunate.
gross: so you're shot in the desert of morocco. what were some of the things that went wrong in the desert?
sanderson: yeah. so there have been a number of commentators that have drawn comparisons with that case. i think the differences are that this - the circumstantial evidence - the timing of the payment, most notably - seems to be much more related to the election. michael cohen had an opportunity. when stormy daniels was originally making noise about their affair several years ago, he could've made a payment back then. he chose not to. they sent just a letter. but shortly before the election, michael cohen did make that payment, apparently.
the move is part of a broader trend that has been growing since 2013, the year xi jinping became china's president. from 2013 to 2017, at least 109 universities unveiled their first-ever charters, affirming party leadership, according to npr's analysis.
rocca: but a plucky wendy and her canadian cohorts made the best of it. it would have been awfully hurtful to swaziland to turn around and leave. so they used their snow skis to waterski along the zambezi river. they made their own chocolate from cacao beans they picked. wendy even dressed up as heidi to read stories to masai children at a bonfire. i hadn't packed anti-malarial pills for switzerland, but luckily since canada has nationalized health care, i stopped in at our embassy in mabopane. that's the capital of swaziland.
you won't forget me, will you?
gardner: because in december last year, princess haya invited mary robinson, who's the former irish president and also human rights commissioner for the un, formerly, to come and see for herself the state of princess latifa. and they both vouched for her, saying she's fine. she's clearly a troubled young lady. so basically, the official version was that she was mentally unstable and needed looking after. and princess haya, according to her friends, feels that she was, in some way, hoodwinked and given a wrong version of events. the bottom line is that princess haya is now in hiding in london, preparing for a legal battle, which we don't know exactly what it's going to be about - whether it's custody or money or whatever. but that is coming up at the end of july. so this is pretty embarrassing for the dubai government. why does it involve several countries? princes haya is the daughter of the former king of jordan, king hussein. and she is - that makes her the half-sister of the current king of jordan. she has chosen to come to england, to britain, where she was educated. britain has very close ties to the uae, so this is, potentially, a very awkward diplomatic spat between two close allies - britain and the united arab emirates.
sayfullo saipov, the suspect in this week's new york terrorist attack, is a native of uzbekistan who came to the u.s. through the diversity visa lottery. it's a system for people from countries that have sent relatively few immigrants to the united states in the past five years.

in 1995, darakshan raja's pakistani parents applied to enter the u.s. through the lottery. her mother, a professor of english, wanted to pursue her career here. raja recalls the long list of documents and certifications her parents had to provide: birth certificate copies, entire academic history, government reference letters, family and marriage records, financial statements, multiple english test results and certificates from the police that the applicants don't have a criminal record.
later when emad does get home, he sees blood everywhere. he finds rana in the hospital where the wounds on her face are being stitched. she won't talk about what happened, not then, not a few days later. the nature of the assault, a description of the assailant, the motive, it's a blank to be filled by emad's churning suspicions and fears. that blank is central to many of farhadi's films. his oscar-winning a separation turns on a woman's unseen fall in a staircase.
woodfin: ...it's not my actual mom's house...
gessen is also exercised about the change trump has wrought in the perception of reality. in a chapter titled the power lie, gessen explains the difference between an ordinary lie that may collapse in the face of facts and the trumpian lie.
but then i did field of dreams, where i was a nice guy in that. and then along came goodfellas. and maybe that kind of started it. but henry hill, the part i played - he really didn't - it wasn't that violent. everybody else was kind of crazy around him. but yes, i've definitely played my share of them.
liotta: (as himself) when you see my movies later, you're going to realize that this is a special moment. come on. and... cheese.
and so i think he would kind of edge up to it. he didn't want to deny himself that connection with the godhead that he felt was there. and so he would try to control his seizures internally. at a point, he had a method where he thought that if - when the mandala appeared, if he shifted his eyes hard in the opposite direction, he could stop himself from having a seizure. so he kept trying to control it.
he's not my president, she said.
you don't play with people's lives, trotter said, referring to the potential impact of trump's orders on immigration and federal hiring. i think that before anyone makes decisions so concrete, much more thought needs to be put into it.
wine-banks: well, before this happened, in anticipation that it might, we had copied some of the most significant documents. and each of us had taken briefcases of documents to our homes and stored them there just in case. we hoped we would never have to use it because it would have been illegal because they were grand jury materials. and we didn't want to violate any of our ethics and any of the rules. but we felt that there might come a time when our morals required us to do something to protect the country and to protect democracy. luckily, it never came to that, but we did have that at home.
williams: (as gwen verdon) i'm going to be in rehearsals.
alia volz, welcome to fresh air. this book is, in part, about the city of san francisco. and your mom was there, i guess, in the mid and late '70s. it was a city undergoing remarkable change. just paint a little bit of a picture. what was going on at the scene at fisherman's wharf, the performances? give us a sense of it.

back in allendale, the school district has removed any mention of gender and sexual identity in school materials. it has also removed the mention of lgbtq+ students in the anti-bullying campaign, and it has no plans to include queer and trans issues in a new sex ed program that it's working on now.
and when you hear judge garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the oklahoma city bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. and i spent a lot of time on that.
the new list consists of 10 more possible nominees, including a u.s. senator who has refused to endorse trump.

davies: and i guess they both expected that the spirit child was on its way to the earth. you want to share that?
your base, some of them quietly said, you know, everybody on that list, except merrick garland, was a minority or a woman; some of them were both. you picked the oldest person by far, the only white guy, and he's sort of a centrist liberal. he's not, you know, he's not going to — this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the supreme court.
sagal: i know. there's hardly anything in it. yes, there are some that are tall and thin. there's narrow. there's shapely. there's short and round, pear-shaped, you know. the idea is that it's soap for all types of women, but no woman basically wants to be stopped at the checkout counter and be told, you sure you don't want that fat bottle?
4 things to know about the south carolina primaries

liotta: no. i used to use it a lot - being adopted - especially when you're going out with a girl or looking to find out a girl. i'd say, hey, how you doing. in the first five minutes, i'd somehow get in that i was adopted because i always looked at it as being given up. i never looked at it as being wanted. i couldn't get past being given up. and then i met a girl, got married, wanted to have a kid. but she thought it was extremely important - because i was born in the '50s, and they didn't give you any information about health or anything. they had very, very limited information that they had to legally give you. so...
the democratic national committee blasted trump for trying to silence yates and predicted the confirmation of his nominee to lead the justice department would get tougher. many top former doj officials, including attorney general eric holder jr. and civil rights chief tom perez, tweeted messages of support. person of integrity/attorney with great legal skill, holder wrote. her judgment should be trusted.
a rally with white nationalists chanting phrases like jews will not replace us and end immigration, one people, one nation was, as many expressed online, disturbing yet not really all that surprising.
davies: and part of the business was actually finding people who needed the relief that marijuana would bring. there was another woman named mary jane rathbun, who had been making and distributing marijuana brownies. she became known as - what? - brownie mary, as supposed to your mom, who was the brownie lady. and they kind of got...
hanks: i remember seeing kurosawa's the seven samurai and les strada on tv, and i'd - look, these things all went over my head, but without a doubt this was counter-programming that hit a very fertile audience, which was my brain. and i think actually the time i spent alone watching television when i was in, you know, fifth - from fifth grade on, that was really quite an education for me because i was alone. and i was - for 20 minutes at a time, i was very concentrated on the subject matter.
saudi woman who fled country hopes she inspires others to follow
hanks: well, actually, no, it was a very good thing. i mean, my parents were so - my dad was married to the love of his life, finally. it took him three marriages to get there. but when they landed together, they were so busy having fun and dealing with their own sturm und drang that i could have been a tenant who lived downstairs.
davies: right. and so not so long after, there was - finally, the business came to an end - or at least its first end. do you want to describe the circumstances of that?
no, he isn't. and so we discussed that, and i wanted to make sure that not only he felt comfortable with it, but his family felt comfortable with it. you know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we're — we call folks like judge garland civilians. and so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of.
gross: so in terms of growing up surrounded by people who'd been in the war and whose lives were divided by before, during and after the war, what did that leave you with in terms of what war means and whether you really were, like your parents said, really lucky to be spared?

we believe leading our children to explore lgbtq issues may have significant physical and mental health ramifications, the complaint reads. it goes on to say that including queer and trans kids in the anti-bullying materials may increase discrimination against students in our schools who do not agree with lgbtq.

at the very center of this debate stood tiffany harp. parents discovered that harp, the teacher of a high school elective class called family and relationships, had discussed both sexual and gender identity with her students.
volz: sure. we were talking about the i ching earlier. and suddenly, in mid-1979, my mom goes to throw her usual weekly hexagrams. and the passage is really dark. the results are bad. and the imagery in the passages has to do with imprisonment and punishment and things like that. and she became fairly convinced - well, very convinced very quickly that they were going to be busted. and the business was huge at this time. and, i mean, everybody knew about them. it was a little - maybe a little too high-profile. and she became sure that they were going to get busted. so my parents, taking this extremely seriously, packed up, closed up shop. and we moved out of san francisco within two weeks.
we're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment, he added.
bodden: no, he won't. he won't.
demby: in addition to chuck holmes and gigi douban, who you met earlier, we need to give a special shoutout to audrey atkins for her...
rocca: and melania. so - ok.
security has been a concern, too, since the spouse of a diversity visa holder from egypt shot and killed two people at los angeles international airport in 2002. and now after the terrorist attack in new york, president trump is calling on congress to shut it down.
everyone was enraged, one of the student protesters told npr. she withheld her name because of the almost certain repercussions for speaking publicly on the matter.
then they go on with the rest of the lives, and it's act three. and it was always, well, you know, that was right after the war. well, after the war, i became a dry cleaner. and after the war, i got my teaching credential. and after the war, you know, i got married and had kids or after the war, so and so had developed a terrible alcohol problem and was never the same when he came back.
it took so much effort to say even one phrase. you had to pay attention to people's expressions. one person might hear me and agree. but another person might hear me and report me. i could not give lectures in such circumstances, short of simply reading from the textbook, says you shengdong.

ben philpott, byline: voters usually don't spend much time considering their choice for texas land commissioner. the office plays several important roles, but, yeah, it's kind of the bottom of the barrel when it comes to statewide races. but the office has received plenty of attention over the last three years because there's been a bush holding the job - yes, as in that bush family.

davies: you said that lead of your team in the special prosecutor's office thought that this revelation of a recording system might have been a trap, meaning what? what was he suspicious of?
woodfin: and you cannot just give one answer because we have an infinite amount of restaurants to choose from.
demby: oh, ok. all right. i was going to say...
the university party secretary, institute director and local party officials tried to move me to library duties because of my political problems, but i put up a huge fight, cao remembers. four professors were docked pay, but because cao pushed back on his punishment, he was dismissed.
hanks: well, in fact, i made another movie called, larry crowne. but there is value in the affection, i think, that a filmmaker has for the subject matter. and 1964 was a very, very powerful year for me because i was a conscious being who witnessed the - as any kid did, i was 7 years old - at the assassination of john f. kennedy. and i was confused for months by what had happened to the country, but also by the demeanor of every adult that was in my life. there was a sadness. there was a crippling mystery that had gone on because of the assassination of john f. kennedy. there were still dark clouds and furrowed brows of my dad and the teachers and their friends and every adult that i knew. and to be 7 years old, it was like a vibe, an eggshell vibe, that was part of daily life, and i was uncomfortable by it. and i was saddened by it, and - but i was also mystified by it.
both feel strongly that politicians, at the national and local levels, have failed them. when we spoke in late 2011, brian barfield said there was no such thing as a politician that knows how to bring jobs back. elected officials were so worried about winning partisan squabble, he said, that america's losing.
meraji: we're about to do a segment that people love. it's kind of like an advice segment. we call it ask code switch. and we have listeners write in to us with questions about race and identity in america, and we try to answer their questions.
woodfin: that is - it's tough to answer that for one thing. so if a person is an outdoors person, i recommend ruffner park...

wine-banks: yes. he thought that it was a trap. and i am much less skeptical. maybe i was more naive, but i believed that it was a make or break for us. i knew that it either was going to confirm what john dean said and make our case, or if it deviated from what he said, we would have been in serious jeopardy of not being able to prove the case because then there would have been serious doubt about his credibility. and so the only question we had was not if we would subpoena tapes, but which ones. and we foresaw executive privilege claims being raised.

it is every parent's natural right to teach their own children what they believe in regards to sexuality, part of the statement reads. it is not the right of a minority of our community to impose their desire for comprehensive sexuality education inclusive of lgbtq subjects to be taught to other people's children.
douban: let's just keep in mind that alabama was the last state to overturn its ban on interracial marriage. that was in 2000, which when you think about it, was not all that long ago.
meraji: and i'm shereen marisol meraji.
but, he added, i personally wonder ... regardless of whether you're a religious person or not, everybody comes into every conversation with a particular worldview and things that you believe are right or wrong. the question is can you counsel from a totally non-value-based position?

trump sent pompeo to meet with the saudi king in riyadh on monday and said pompeo may travel to turkey as well. the president has said he doesn't want the khashoggi matter to scuttle an arms deal with the saudis.
volz: he didn't remember, which seems convenient and perhaps was. but i should say about my dad and his epilepsy that the grand mal seizures would wipe out huge chunks of his memory, and there are many things that he wishes he remembers that he can't. he's a good custodian of the memories that he has, and they check out with my research and with the stories that other people i interviewed told. but there are huge episodes, huge swaths that are simply not there, and this was part of what wasn't there.
i decided to stay in a less than healthy marriage for a long time because of my children. ... one day i was braiding my daughter tish's hair, and i looked at her and i thought, oh, my god, i'm staying in this marriage for her. but would i want this marriage for her? and if i would not want this marriage for her, then why am i modeling bad love and calling that good mothering?
one of the thorniest cases involves catholic charities, whose agencies long have provided adoption and foster care services to children in need, including orphans. under catholic doctrine, the sacrament of marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman, and catholic adoption agencies therefore have declined to place children with same-sex couples.
davies: just for the record, the actual quote from the tapes. the president says, you could get a million dollars, you could get it in cash. i know where it could be gotten. it is not easy, but it could be done. but the question is, who the hell would handle it? any ideas on that? nothing about it being wrong.

it did not make sense to a lot of other people. outraged parents started showing up at public hearings to protest, forming long lines to speak in front of the school board and sex ed advisory board. at one meeting, a parent named sylvia rhodea stood at the podium and said, when you fundamentally discredit the very nature of god's creation of our youth as male and female, you are seeking to discredit god.
lee gelernt, deputy director of the american civil liberties union's immigrants' rights project, said of yates' action: this is a remarkable but welcome development and sends a powerful message that there's something very wrong with a muslim ban.

and he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared i think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that i might make. because he thinks it's important.
brennan: it - are you talking about, like, are you going to do some live sliding? is that what you mean?
demby: i want to ask a clarifying question, too. you mentioned that you've said to immigrants' rights groups that you would not enable ice through the police force there.

jay-z: (rapping) haters, please forgive me. i let my wife write the will. i pray my children outlive me.
hanks: and i said what? what did i do? he said you now officially have type 2 diabetes. and i - all i could think of - well, what did i do? well, what i did was i ate very badly, and i didn't take any of that stuff seriously. now, look, i'm going to be 60 years old this summer. it's time and order. i want to be around for at least another 20 years, so i've gotten much more rigorous about what i eat and how - the exercise that i get.
the pictures made her basically a laughingstock. there were a lot of cartoons about the rose mary twist or the rose mary stretch that were really hard on her, i am sure. it must have been a very devastating thing for her. i got a lot of mail from secretaries around the country saying, i've used that same equipment and it's not possible. no one could do that. it wouldn't work that way.

johnson: his record in office has not quite backed that up according to gay rights advocates. early on in this administration, the justice department revoked guidelines for how schools should treat access to bathrooms and locker rooms for transgender people. in july. the president tweeted would ban transgender people from the military. and his justice department also went out of the way to file a brief in another case. that case said the civil rights act, which provides protections against discrimination for people in the workplace, did not cover sexual orientation according to trump's doj.
she and brian go back and forth about whether her obamacare plan is any good. because she is unemployed, there are enough subsidies to make her plan affordable (though brian adds they wouldn't be able to pay for it without his disability money). but if she gets a good-paying job, she'll have to pay the government back. brian is skeptical and calls it the unaffordable care act. jennifer said she's thankful to former president obama for making this option available, even if it is imperfect.

you fast forward to today in birmingham, and that's reflected in the makeup of a city that's probably the fifth-blackest city in america. that's how you get three-fourths. that's how you get 88 neighborhoods with 11 majority. those 11 neighborhoods are concentrated in the south and southeastern portion of the city. and they backend one of the wealthiest cities, suburban cities in america. mountain brook's probably like - it's in the top 20 most richest cities in america, next to the seat city of the 7th congressional district in alabama, which is the third-poorest u.s. congressional district in america, right? so there's just a massive amount of inequity right here.

and part of the trial strategy for cross-examining him was to get him angry and to get him arguing with me because we really felt that if he yelled at me and showed his true personality, it would definitely hurt him much more than if he yelled at rick ben-veniste. and my strategy had worked. he was getting angry. the jury was hating him. and judge sirica stopped him.

totenberg: right. we get a conservative for a seat previously held by a conservative, as opposed to the centrist liberal garland likely would have been. this, in some ways, is the dress rehearsal for the next nomination, which, if it happens, will make all the difference in the world. two of the justices, ruth bader ginsburg and justice anthony kennedy, are over 80. justice breyer is 78.
sagal: how do i know it's not smith burg from landon grove? so where is smithburg, md.?
president obama spoke with npr legal affairs correspondent nina totenberg on thursday about why he selected merrick garland for the supreme court, why he thinks the judge deserves a hearing from the senate and the impact obama sees for the u.s. judiciary if that doesn't happen. nina writes about the conversation here; a full transcript is below.

siegel: so how soon do you think it'll be before the incoming president announces his nominee to fill the current vacancy?
you know, it's interesting. so you requested those nine tapes. the nixon administration said, no, these are private conversations of the president's, that they're subject to executive privilege. and one of the things you write is that as this unfolded in public, his refusal to supply the tapes hurt his support even with his base of supporters. that's again, a difference from what we're seeing today, isn't it?
davies: you know, one of the things that occurred to me as i read this was the power of being the first to set a narrative in a controversy like this. and in particular, there's this tape on march 21 of 1973 where, in nixon's office, they're talking about raising a million dollars to ensure the loyalty and silence of the watergate burglars.

klein: neal, where do you rate your special on the netflix and chill scale? like, how chillable (ph) is your special?
well, jill wine-banks, welcome to fresh air. let's talk about your experience in the watergate investigation. you were hired at the age of 30 for the special prosecutor's office. you are an attorney with some experience. you'd done criminal prosecutions for the justice department. you were, i guess, the only woman trial lawyer on the team there. how were you regarded by all of these other men - the attorneys, the agents, others?
douban: so it kind of depends on where you are. i spoke with a woman who is white whose husband is from kenya. and she told me that when they married back in the '90s here in alabama, her grandmother said to her, i'm glad at least that your grandfather has passed away already because this would've killed him.

this is a hell of a lot too much family togetherness for me. ... what i'm saying to my people is: we just lower expectations right now. right? our children are not going to learn what they would have learned in school. you know what they'll learn? they will learn that sometimes things are completely out of our control. and in the end, what matters is how we take care of ourselves and each other. so whatever you need to do to take care of yourself and each other. do it right now.
gross: you're pretty well known now. and probably your most famous film is goodfellas. but people who are young don't necessarily know much about anything except current films. and that's kind of the joke in an episode of modern family that you just guest-starred on. and i want to play a clip from that. it's a really funny episode. and in this episode, the three kids from the family - they want to treat their uncle to a special gift for his birthday. and it's kind of last-minute. so the three teenage dunphy kids decide to buy a map to the stars' homes in hollywood and take their uncle, who loves barbra streisand, to barbra streisand's house. so they take him there. and the uncle's played by jesse tyler ferguson. they take him there. and instead of seeing barbra streisand in front of the house, they see you in the front yard - you, as ray liotta. but only the uncle recognizes you. the kids have no idea who you are. so you're trying to tell the kids who you are by listing some of your biggest films.
douban: '97. yeah. i am one of those damn yankees that stayed. birmingham is just - it's just a town that does that to you. it just draws you in. it's easy to live here.
kurtis: i can't believe president oprah balanced the budget and gave everybody a car.
liotta: yeah, i'm sure maybe personally he did. but i didn't really bring that to the set until - i mean, to be totally honest, my mom passed away in the middle of the movie. and they told me on a particular day during a particular scene that i really had to get home that night because things took a turn for the worse. and, you know, i broke down. i went into my trailer.
gross: tom hanks, it's just been fabulous to talk with you. thank you so much.
liotta: i got into the university of miami. i had no idea what it was that i wanted to do. so i just went - i was just going to take liberal arts. i got to the head of the line, and they said, because you don't know what it is, what you want to do, you're going to have to take math and history. i said, oh, my gosh, there's no way. i don't even want to be in college. i'm not going to take any math and history. right next to the line that i was in was for the drama department. i said, oh, my gosh. that's it. i'll be a drama major.

liotta: no. i got a call from him after he saw the movie. marty didn't want me to talk to him at all. he just wanted - we're just going to go by the script now 'cause he knew that maybe if i met him, he might embellish or - he didn't know what was going to happen. they just wanted me to just go by the script and not to meet him. i got a phone call that he wanted to meet me at a bowling alley in the valley with his brother. and i said, oh, boy, what the heck is this going to be?

if i'd gone to a doctor and been given the chance to take the medication that i needed, i probably still would have been very reluctant to do it because i was just too afraid. and i thought that i would be wrecking the rest of my life, that i would never be loved by anyone except for maybe my dog. i thought that i would never have a family, i would never have a job. it seemed like my best life might well cost me my life. i just soldiered on, hoping that it would all get better.

the media generally assist in this, gessen argues, even when serious news organizations fact-check the president, by presenting two notions of reality side by side and inviting the audience to decide. right there, the president has won, gessen says. the lie has been given equal standing with verifiable facts, and the concept of truth has been devalued.

meraji: it's not all horrible if that's what you want to do. and, i mean, another thing is she talked about really caring about what alabama taught her and what she learned here in birmingham. so to me, that sounded like she really cares about this place, and she really cares about the people here. and i feel like if that's the case, and she really wants to maintain these friendships, if someone says something to her that feels off or feels like a microaggression, yes, ask the clarifying question, and then if she still feels like it was a microaggression, explain how to ask this question in a better way - if she feels like doing it - you know, if she wants to maintain these relationships because sometimes people say things, and they have no idea what they're saying. so yeah. if she's open to having these conversation with friends and family here in birmingham, i would say do that.
alqunun's newfound freedom has come at a cost. her family has disowned her simply because i wanted to be independent and escape their abuse, she said. i wanted to be free from oppression and depression. i wanted to be independent. had she stayed in saudi arabia, i wouldn't have been able to marry the person i wanted. i couldn't get a job without permission, she said. alqunun's father has denied physically abusing her or forcing her into an arranged marriage, the associated press reported.

khashoggi, who recently has been living in virginia and writing columns for the washington post, hasn't been seen since oct. 2, when he entered the saudi consulate to handle paperwork for his upcoming marriage.
liotta: (as joey perrini) all right. what about all the craziness, you know, about me being married to an heiress, our fights over money or how to live? you know, if i want to annul that, i have to annul all the good times, too.
tucker: there's been a lot of pop music made about marriage. i'm thinking about richard and linda thompson's corrosive breakup album shoot out the lights, marvin gaye's alimony concept album here, my dear, and the ups and downs charted in the many songs written separately by split spouses loudon wainwright and kate mcgarrigle. this carters album is very much in that tradition with a significant difference - the classics i just listed were about marriages that fail. this one is about a marriage that prevails years on.

strong says the party will donate a total of $70,000. washington senate democrats will also donate their contribution from knight to the campaign to uphold gay marriage. in a statement, the ramtha school says the release of the videos may violate copyright law and it may sue.
rocca: yeah. when macron meets with justin trudeau, i mean, gay twitter is going to explode.
davies: so, you know, you're in the position in the prosecutor's office where you've been gathering all this information. and how are you going to prove whose version is right? you hear there are tapes. and it's interesting how that impacted you. you're - the guy who was head of your team, jim neal, was suspicious of this, right?

woodfin: right? in housing, in education, in transportation and employment opportunities and on and on and on. one of the things we're doing around racial equity is we want to create an equity tool to assess equity in each department. we then as a - as an administration can be intentional about how we create more equity for the services we deliver for - make sure it touches all 99 neighborhoods, regardless of socioeconomic, regardless of race.

if the saudis do offer this sequence of events, they will need to account for why they have claimed, for the past two weeks, that khashoggi walked out of the consulate.
sam sanders, byline: hi. it's good to be here, although i'm still scratching my head saying, why me for romance and love questions?
turkish officials have told reporters that they believe khashoggi was very likely killed or abducted within hours of his arriving at the consulate. one security official told the new york times that a squad of 15 saudi men arrived in istanbul and killed khashoggi. the official said one of the men had brought along a bone saw for dismembering the body.
the barfields met in what was at the time a booming support group for unemployed people in st. louis. they didn't immediately find jobs, but they did find love.
many writers also took on the response from president trump, whose initial reaction to the violence in charlottesville criticized equally both sides of the protest. we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, trump said, in remarks that brought condemnation from both democrats and republicans.

two free-spirited psychics who made their way in a city of enormous cultural and social change - the explosion of the counterculture, the growth of the gay liberation movement, the horror of the aids epidemic, as well as the assassinations of mayor george moscone and city supervisor harvey milk and the suicides in guyana of the followers of jim jones, whose peoples temple was an influential presence in the city for years. alia volz's writing has appeared in the best american essays 2017, the new york times and other publications. her new book is home baked: my mom, marijuana, and the stoning of san francisco. like many of you, i'm working from home these days. i spoke to alia volz, who was at her office in san francisco.
grove: i think president trump said james comey, you're fired.

alia volz: of course. well, san francisco in the 1970s was coming out of the summer of love, this huge influx of young people who'd come out to experiment with new lifestyles. that was very much over. but all kinds of new subcultures were flourishing. the way that i think about it sometimes is if the '60s were a sketchpad, the '70s would be the box of crayons. there was just wonderful and crazy experimentation. some of it went horribly awry. and some of it was spectacular.
liotta: (as henry hill) to me, being a gangster was better than being president of the united states. even before i first wandered into the cab stand for an afterschool job, i knew i wanted to be a part of them. it was there that i knew that i belonged. and to me, it meant being somebody in a neighborhood that was full of nobodies. they weren't like anybody else. i mean, they did whatever they wanted. they double-parked in front of a hydrant, and nobody ever gave them a ticket. in the summer when they played cards all night, nobody ever called the cops.
what trotter wants to hear: i would like to hear some kind of humbling statement that addresses the elephant in the oval office. i want to hear something that says, you know, 'i do understand the power of my position. i do understand the needs of the american people and that i am working hard to remain connected and do what i can to serve.' you know, to actually serve the people and not run the people ... or dictate the people. but that's a pipe dream. i'm not going to hear that from him.
when i met abby, there was a voice inside of me that i finally recognized as my own. ... and following my love for her was a turning point in my life, but not just because i chose her. it was because i finally honored myself. right? i chose to, for the first time, abandon everyone else's expectations of me instead of abandoning myself. and i think that's what i'm trying to get out of this book, which is this idea that we can let go of the expectations, and shoulds, and supposed-tos that the world gives us and just honor who we actually are and have always been.
cornish: and we also have npr host sam sanders of it's been a minute fame with us.
iranian director asghar farhadi's latest film is one of the five nominees for this year's foreign-language academy award. critic david edelstein says the salesman is tense and powerful.
author and blogger glennon doyle has something to tell all the women out there trying to put a brave face on a terrible situation, juggling home life with all the other expectations placed on them as the world seems like it's falling apart: i think every woman on earth needs to lower her expectations for herself, exponentially. at this point, we're not trying to be amazing. we are just trying to make it through the day. her new book is called untamed, and it details how she found her truest self — ending an unsatisfying marriage, and falling deeply in love with a woman while discovering how to be brave.
fresh air weekend highlights some of the best interviews and reviews from past weeks, and new program elements specially paced for weekends. our weekend show emphasizes interviews with writers, filmmakers, actors and musicians, and often includes excerpts from live in-studio concerts. this week:
sagal: that was derek thompson, a senior editor at the atlantic, writing about dove soap's decision to make their new soap bottles look like what?
liotta: (as matt wozniak) i need to remind you about our understanding, raul?
bill kurtis: translated into cat, that would be (imitating cat meowing).
philpott: that's trump speaking on jimmy kimmel live! in 2016. trump said jeb bush supported illegal immigration because his wife, george p.'s mother, was born in mexico. that didn't stop george p. from endorsing trump after he became the republican presidential nominee. as president trump has rejected much of what the bush family stood for in politics, whether it's on immigration or foreign policy, jillson wonders whether george p. bush can evolve in what's now trump's party.
so i went. and he was there. and i met him for the first time. he had just seen the movie. and basically, he says, yeah, i wanted to meet you. you know, thanks for making me not look like a scumbag, to quote him. and i'm thinking to myself, oh, my gosh, did you really watch the movie? you pretty much were a scumbag. you ratted on your friends...
and then to make it even worse, when the court ordered that we have the tape investigated, we hired a group of professionals in this field, first of all, hoping that we could recover the erased material. but we couldn't. but also what they discovered was that it was not one erasure. there were multiple erasures.
hanks: well, here's the deal. jimmy nichols was, you know, a hired hand-drummer in the british music scene. and when the beatles did their asian and australian tour, ringo starr got sick - tonsilitis or something - and he could not make a certain number of dates in australia and japan. so he became the drummer of the beatles for a section of their tour. jimmy nichols, live from the budokan with the beatles.
and at that point the process has broken down. democrats have not been blameless in this process. you cannot point to me a circumstance in which democrats have left a seat open when a republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.
david edelstein, byline: have you ever thought about the idea that in american space-alien-invasion movies, extraterrestrials have no problem mastering the king's english? well, arrival is different. communication between earthlings and aliens doesn't happen at the start. it's the source of the suspense, what the movie builds to, because you can't know what ets want if you can't ask and they can't answer. are they here to exterminate us? to save us? who can interpret their weird burbles? a linguist maybe. her name is dr. louise banks, played by amy adams. the aliens have arrived in vessels that look like titanic, mile-high wedges, which hover in seemingly random spots all over the planet. no one knows their intentions. out of nowhere, forest whitaker as a military colonel descends on louisa's very nice lake house in a very loud chopper and plays her a recording.
birbiglia's first feature film, sleepwalk with me, came out in 2012 and was based on an autobiographical story that the comic told on this american life.

university administrators did not defend him. yang was fired that august.
academic freedom has always been precarious in china, although the 2000s saw a brief liberalization. but since xi took office, academics say, ideological constraints have intensified, stifling discourse and innovation at home even as china seeks a global footprint in academia.
volz: sure. and i want to say that my mom also confirms and describes that my dad identified the moment of conception and didn't even bother getting a pregnancy test. she believed him, and it turned out that he was right. she began to show. it became obvious. so that is a kind of a story, kind of a myth that i grew up with. i don't know how many people have these really high and magical myths about their births (laughter), but i sure had one. my dad, however, was convinced that i was going to be a boy - absolutely certain. and because he'd been right about everything else, my mom went along with it, too.
'the salesman' offers a brilliant portrayal of marriage and vengeance
in 2013, polygamist and reality tv star kody brown and his four wives, meri brown, janelle brown, christine brown and robyn sullivan, challenged utah's criminal polygamy law. the family stars in the tlc series, sister wives.
so during that span of time when there was just nothing for people to do to take care of themselves, cannabis emerged really early on as helpful with some of the symptoms. nobody thought weed was going to cure aids (laughter). but it helped with the wasting syndrome, which manifested with a total loss of appetite and crushing nausea. cannabis was good for that. it helped with insomnia, depression, pain. so people began to turn to cannabis to help feel a little better while this horrible, horrible thing was going on. and in the case of the wasting syndrome, it helped them eat. it helped them hang on longer. it became very important.
this fx series isn't just an homage to all that jazz. it plays almost like an expanded director's cut, with verdon's half of the story given equal prominence. but the difference is bob fosse's all that jazz was all bob fosse's vision and voice. and i know how he ended all that jazz - boldly and brilliantly. with fosse/verdon, i still haven't seen anything from the chicago musical or anything else from the later years, yet i'm very eager to see what fosse/verdon presents in its second half because the first handful of episodes, like the musical numbers they recreate, are surging with creativity and excitement. it's showtime.

klein: the answer was a, mike rowe soft. he settled in exchange for an x-box. your next mike is mike malloy. he came to prominence in the 1930s and earned a nickname. what was it? was it a, mike the durable - gangsters repeatedly tried to kill him by poisoning his whiskey, but he'd been drinking bad whiskey so long it only made him stronger?
the evangelicals and institutional moderates voted to reaffirm the church's teachings, and then the institutional moderates moved to the more liberal side, tooley says. but then they were replaced by the rising global church, especially in africa.
meraji: that was, what, 19 years ago? more than that?
and jia tolentino, a writer for the new yorker and a graduate of the university of virginia, meditated on charlottesville's progressive guise and ability to hide its dark racial past. while i was at u.v.a., the fact that slaves had built the school was hardly discussed, and the most prominent acknowledgment that jefferson was a slave owner came on valentine's day, when signs went up all over campus that said 'tj ♥s sally.' 
liotta: ...'cause they're saying, you're supposed to be singing. you're supposed to be dancing as you're singing. so i just did the refrain, and i did the freddie. and i got into it. and the first year, all i did were musicals. i was in the chorus for my whole freshman year. but there was an acting teacher there named robert buckets lowery. and he was great. they called him buckets because he used to play basketball. me being a jock from new jersey, like - 'cause when you first get into drama class and, you know, kids who - they're just different people in a lot of different ways.

and butterfield had debated with himself what he would do if he was asked, and he had said if he was asked a direct question, he would give an honest answer. he wasn't going to volunteer the information, but he was asked a direct question. and it was based on a document that had been found that sounded like it could have been a transcription of a conversation. it was not, but it led to the question of whether there was a taping system, and butterfield said, yes, there was.

though no one from cast agreed to be interviewed, one family who sympathizes with the group's views did agree to share its perspective. kim and steve vanderhelm have lived in allendale for 21 years; they have two kids who graduated from allendale public schools a few years ago. the vanderhelms still care a lot about what the district is teaching.
douban: so, i mean, if you - just listening to him speak, he mentioned young voters so many times. and that was key, i think - not just young african-american voters but white millennial voters as well. i think - yeah. young people were and are a big part of this city's moving to the next level.

there's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the supreme court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. george washington nominated a couple of supreme court justices in his last year. and obviously george washington had better poll numbers, i'm sure, than i did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, i think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.

brennan: yeah. yeah. i was doing - i didn't - someone came to my show in chicago and a woman didn't know what the premise of the show was, so she went on my instagram, my facebook and my twitter during the show and was basically like, dude, you got to stop doing this emotional stuff, thinking that i would somehow, like, get a note on stage and be like, you know what? she's right.

barfield watches the nbc nightly news and it usually starts with a story about trump. the more bad things they say about him, the better i enjoy my day because that means trump did something right, barfield said. when [host] lester holt's upset with trump, trump — i could just go hug him.
and i can tell you how i know it worked. the people would see me in the street and says, hey, thank you so much. you remember me? you represented me. in my head, i'm like, actually, no, i didn't. i was your prosecutor. but it's how you treat people. and so in how - in treating people right, i think you can find a way to close some issues that are systemwide but, at the same time, help that individual.
code switch alum matt thompson, now executive editor at the atlantic, riffed on the brazenness of the white supremacists who marched this weekend, compared with klan members of decades past who hid under white hoods. the shameless return of white supremacy into america's public spaces seems to be happening by degrees, and quickly, thompson wrote.
brennan: sliding into the dms is when someone on instagram especially direct messages you and it's of a sexual nature, hence the slide. do you understand?

i think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. i think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in washington. i think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.
i think to live in this culture means that you're constantly being influenced by what the culture wants you to be, and if you're a woman, it means you're supposed to be thin. you're supposed to care about how pretty you are. you're supposed to care about a lot of things that maybe you shouldn't care about as much as the culture says you ought. ... there's a way in which i felt: if i want to fit in, if i want to pass in the world, then this is all the junk that i have to do. and it took me a while before i realized, actually, no, you can fight against that stuff. you've gone to all this trouble to become female. why would you become anything less than the person you want to be?
and so much of your poetry seems to be engaging with the past, right? you're contextualizing the past, reimagining it. your book wrestles with, you know, sally hemings. there's horace king, who was a black architect and politician who built alabama in a lot of ways. there's george wallace, obviously, the segregationist governor. do you feel like you're doing the work of a historian in your poetry?
