one of the last anti-abortion democrats in congress, lipinski often bucked the mainstream of his party. he declined to endorse president barack obama in 2012, voted against the affordable care act and opposed same-sex marriage until the u.s. supreme court ruled to make it legal in 2015.

toobin: well, leonard leo is the executive vice president of the federalist society, which is a lawyers group, a nonprofit organization, that was founded in 1982 and basically operates to bring conservative lawyers together for meetings, for panels, for conventions. and leo has become sort of the public face of the organization and someone who really is a networker extraordinaire who has learned who are the brilliant, often young, conservatives in the world and has cultivated them to have high-level government jobs and judicial appointments.
and what ended up happening was a circus. what ended up happening was she was vilified for doing what she believed was the right thing to do. and again, having personally prosecuted sexual assault cases, i was incredibly disappointed and frustrated by the lack of information that leaders have about the nature of these kinds of issues like sexual assault. and how they treated her, i thought was regrettable and really unfortunate. and i have nothing but praise for her and her courage, including what it did, which was require people to have a national conversation about an issue that is seldom discussed — and impacts a wide range of people in all genders, in every socioeconomic background, race, religion and ethnicity.

anderson from the heritage foundation doesn't think there's a contradiction between social progress and trump's rollbacks — he says it's about nuance on these issues. i don't think anyone in america wants to be bullying or harassing or denigrating lgbt people, he says. but i also think there are reasons that women are concerned about privacy and safety in public restrooms or locker rooms or the equality on athletic fields and tracks.
tea party darling sarah palin threw her support behind donald trump in a raucous speech tuesday night, a blow to a surging ted cruz with less than two weeks to go until the iowa caucuses.

the initial hesitation from pence might be the result of differences between the two men. here's how they differ on some key issues:
to the disdain of national republicans and against the advice of president trump, controversial alabama judge roy moore announced thursday he will run again for the senate in 2020, after losing a winnable race for the gop as allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against teen girls surfaced from decades ago.
just as moore has to turn out his white evangelical base, jones has to turn out black democrats.

unfortunately, gov. christie has endorsed many of the ideas that barack obama supports, rubio said, arguing that he supported supreme court justice sonia sotomayor's nomination and wrote a check to planned parenthood — something the new jersey governor denied.

mayer: i think probably so. i mean, i think that they realized this was a vulnerability. you've got a vice president who is as close to these big billionaire interests as any politician in america. and he's side by side with a president who said he was going to take on those same billionaire interests. it's - you know, it's a contradiction, and it's hanging right out there. and if anyone is going to see it, it's going to be me because i've written dark money, a book about the koch brothers, so i'm sure that they had that in mind.

this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. one man is responsible to a considerable extent for choosing a third of the justices on the supreme court, including neil gorsuch, who was sworn in monday. that's what jeffrey toobin reports in his latest article in the new yorker called the conservative pipeline to the supreme court. the article is about leonard leo, who toobin says served in effect as president trump's subcontractor on the selection of gorsuch. leo also played a crucial part in the nominations of justices roberts and alito. leo is executive vice president of the federalist society, a national group of conservative lawyers, which toobin also writes about in his article. the society was co-founded by law students in 1982. one of their faculty advisers was antonin scalia, who justice gorsuch has now replaced on the court. jeffrey toobin is a staff writer for the new yorker and a senior legal analyst for cnn.

part of that success is due to the huge number of judicial vacancies that existed when trump took office — 122. that staggering number is due to the fact that republicans, who controlled the senate in the last two years of the obama presidency, confirmed only two appeals court judges — a record that dates back to the 1800s.

millies: well, i'm not sure he's really said all that much. he's done something far better than that. he's shown us. joe biden's public catholicism has been a part of who he's been as a senator, as vice president, really, since he came into office in 1973. and what we continue to see is the way that his public faith transmits itself into public life just by simple gestures, something as simple as the sign of the cross that he made at the tomb of the unknowns on inauguration day but also in a whole life approach to public policy. finally, though, in a very recognizably catholic way, joe biden really speaks a language of unity and reconciliation. that's always appropriate but maybe never more appropriate than it is right now.

i think that, without a doubt, the social issues will motivate voters even if they are skeptical of the allegations against moore, taylor said. quite clearly, abortion is probably the most salient issue in the race, and more generally, social issues.

a 2014 pew research center survey found that 58 percent of alabamians believed abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, with just 37 percent supporting its legality. another pew study earlier this year found a wide chasm between the parties on the issue of abortion, with it being one of the most polarizing issues separating republicans and democrats.
gross: as a woman, what do you find maybe objectionable about that?
millies: pope francis, i think, has tried to lower the temperature in what is inside the united states and more and more around the catholic world, a culture war rooted in abortion, rooted in an opposition between the modern world and the more traditional perspective on the world of roman catholicism. and so these fault lines inside the catholic church are growing more and more visible.

i talked with prominent policy leaders who had worked for the george w. bush administration or they'd worked for the romney campaign in 2012. and i asked them again and again, would you work for this president? and as unpopular as trump is today, he's been our president for a year. he oversees a big staff. and i think we're starting to forget just how many people he had alienated during that exceptionally brutal campaign. he insulted the bravery of john mccain. he went after the gold star family - the khizr khan incident. he'd seemingly mocked a disabled reporter, the list went on and on.
and over the years, i've talked to some law professors about this how these conscience protections have evolved to be a kind of counterweight to whatever controversial issue there might be in health care, which historically is centered around these christian beliefs. earlier, it was abortion. increasingly, there is some concern about assisted suicide and physicians who want to work with patients who maybe want to end their lives because of a terminal disease. and the conscience protections can kind of extend out as far as that.

the high court disagreed with those rulings, finding that the proclamation falls squarely within the scope of presidential authority.
lee: bishop long's ministry, although, it did a lot of good - let me be very clear when i say that there were a lot of moments of positive ministry moments where lives were changed in terms of social-economic standing - but the way in which that ministry took place was an emphasis on personal piety, holiness and not much the prophetic witness against injustices in the broader society.
so trump, never a guy to sweat the policy details as a candidate and now as an administrator, he didn't have much of a policy shop around him too in the way that hillary clinton had dozens of internal staff and external advisers. so the trump administration ended up relying on, first, staff associated with mike pence, who had deep ties to the anti-abortion movement - and then also think tanks like the heritage foundation, this very conservative group in washington, d.c., that had fallen out of some favor and really got a big break by attaching to the trump campaign as kind of the dark horse candidate. and that really started to manifest the representation of anti-abortion views, the christian conservatives.
conservative christian colleges, once relatively insulated from the culture war, are increasingly entangled in the same battles over lgbt rights and related social issues that have divided other institutions in america.
jones is on a push to engage african-american voters — with visits to places that have historical resonance, like selma and tuskegee, which was once home to booker t. washington, george washington carver and the tuskegee airmen.
it is not that the church serves highly educated liberals who might be expected to support a progressive agenda. the surrounding community, according to johnson, is a conservative area, with a lot of folks who feel disenfranchised. i'd say it represents the new face of poverty.
we fought a war for that in the 1860s, he says. also for slavery and other reasons, but one of them was to keep the federal government out of our back pocket. they want to legislate everything and alabama is just not going to put up with it.

gross: probably better than he knew it - he probably had staff to tell him when to go someplace. but that's a lot of hours. so what was your reaction when he was actually forced out of hhs?
tur: they found o.j. on the slow-speed pursuit. they covered the 1992 la riots and the beating infamously of reginald denny, a gravel truck driver who happened to stop in the wrong intersection at the wrong time. they covered almost every police pursuit that you saw in los angeles in the 1990s, malibu wildfires, madonna and sean penn getting married. madonna ended up flipping my dad the bird. and, in one instance, a terrible crash at lax where two planes collided on the tarmac and burst into flames.
and when you're ill, specifically with an eating disorder, you lose connection with your own instincts and your own sense of hunger, your own sense of the right behavior and the wrong behavior. and you trust everyone around you. and there's something really - i wasn't raised religious, but the thing about religion that really attracts me is someone with all the answers. and there's such a comfort in that. it's interesting. when you have an eating disorder, you have a voice in your head that's speaking nonsense.
akhavan: (as desiree) you know, this impulse you have to mother and domesticate? it's super gay (laughter).

but even in america, do you know if you were a group of sioux people who decided to submit to the government and try and do what they were being asked to do, you know, first of all - the rations given to you were disgusting more often than not. but if they didn't arrive, you and your people were going to start starving out there on the plains. and that - you know, the word hunger - because thomas has lost his family who have died on the stone floor of his house. his mother and his sister and his father have all died of hunger. so he knows what hunger is, so he notices hunger. and i was noticing hunger, as you say.

tur: i was about to throw up not for any partisan political reason, not because i wanted somebody else to win, not because i'm a democrat or i'm a republican or i'm an independent. it was nothing political about it. it was this wild ride, this unreality that we're living where facts don't matter, where nothing seems to really matter is where we will end up living for the next four years. not only that but my embed, ali vitali, came up to me and said donald trump is going to keep doing rallies. so i envisioned myself trapped in a press pen for the rest of my life, never able to find a real home, never able to get my life back, to sleep in my own bed, get a routine back; not only that, not able to get anyone to trust us again.
gross: this legislation has just been proposed. it hasn't been signed into law. so it's not in effect yet and it might never be in effect. but it's on the table. it's before parliament. so is there a direct connection between the family and this proposed anti-homosexual legislation in uganda?

over the years, the social service delivery has almost eclipsed the evangelical outreach, and that's a cause of consternation among salvationists. it looks like, unless they can figure out a way to make their mission, their evangelical mission, more attractive to young people, you know, they - it's possible that they could become a large social service organization with a very few clergy running it. and that would be not what the founder had in mind.
don't get me wrong, as a descendant of slaves, i fully appreciate the civil rights movement itself. it's just a tough genre to pull off artistically. it's far too easy for these films to succumb to chin-to-the-sky self-righteous squinting at the heavens. what many films based on historical events lack is the uncertainty of the moment they're trying to reproduce — the doubt of outcome, the insecurity about the effectiveness of the strategy being utilized.

over the years a thriving cottage (heh) industry has arisen, full of stories that seek to deconstruct fairy tale endings by radically reimagining them (comics like fables and castle waiting, television series like once upon a time) and/or dosing them with withering irony (jay ward's animated fractured fairy tales.)
so donald trump asked leonard leo to make up a list of potential supreme court nominees. gorsuch was on that list. after president trump got to nominate neil gorsuch, leonard leo took a leave from the federalist society to groom gorsuch for the hearing. so what was his role in the grooming, do you know?
duterte is hardly the only autocrat trump has had kind words for. from saddam hussein's efficient killing of terrorists to the smart cookie in north korea, trump has praised strongmen around the world when others wouldn't. the following list reads like a who's who of totalitarian leaders with dicey human-rights records. and in all of the countries, the american president and real-estate magnate has a raft of potential conflicts of interest, too:

so it seems that pence was in the room and knew better and that when he came out and gave that misleading statement to the public that it could be construed as a cover-up, and it could be construed that he was involved in some kind of obstruction of justice for participating in a meeting about firing comey because of the investigation.

trump, on the other hand, has no such personal testimony. he has an ancestral association with the presbyterians but has never been known as a churchman. indeed, he has made his way in the worldliest of worldly occupations and appeared on the cover of playboy. his three marriages and serial sexual episodes are scarcely the stuff of sunday school lessons.
what i regret about her experience is that she was treated as though she was on trial. she was not on trial. she had done nothing wrong. ... she decided that what she had known needed to be known by the decision-makers. so she reached out to her member of congress, to make sure that those people who have the responsibility for vetting this guy knew this thing that she knew. and she wanted to remain anonymous because it was never about her. she initiated all that visited her in the ensuing months because she felt an obligation as a citizen to make sure that those who are in a position of power and responsibility had all the information.
gross: do you know how active vice president pence has been in getting anti-abortion people and anti-lgbtq rights people appointed to hhs and, perhaps, other agencies as well?
my mother was a force of nature. she was somebody who really committed her life to the service of others. she is and was somebody who was incredibly smart but incredibly loving at the same time. these things coexisted with my mother. and there's so much that i learned from her that we would call values and principals, and reason for being.

students and faculty at many religious institutions are asked to accept a faith statement outlining the school's views on such matters as evangelical doctrine, scriptural interpretation and human sexuality. those statements often include a rejection of homosexual activity and a definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman. changing attitudes on sexual ethics and civil rights, however, are making it difficult for some schools, even conservative ones, to ensure broad compliance with their strict positions.

life is god's gift and the right to life comes from god and not from any law or constitution. because it terminates human life which begins at conception, abortion can never be condoned in any circumstances, priests in the diocese of achonry wrote in an open letter published by the irish catholic bishops' conference last week.
no one thought they had done anything exceptional and they would joke with me [asking]: 'gail, when are you done? you know, how many times are you going to come see us? when is this book actually coming out?' and i had one moment that i knew it was a book ... when i asked rojda, who was one of the commanders, 'why did you form these womens protection units?' and she looked at me and she said, 'well, one, we were never going to let isis stand, you know, what they were doing to women and two, we just didn't want men taking credit for our work.' and i thought, well, that's how you have a universal story.
and i've been thinking about that for - well, nigh on 50 years. and what that means - and when i first heard it, i thought, well, i know what that means aged 8 because i've been to all the cowboy films up in the adelphi cinema in dun laoghaire. so surely i do know what he's talking about. and that was a very exciting idea. but later, you wonder then about the sadness and the sorrow - historical sorrow of an irish person, himself essentially a native person, an aboriginal person, by a great trauma having to go to america, joining an army that was engaged in the destruction, erasure and removal of a people, the native american people, not unlike himself. so that was one of the things. so my task was to follow, and in this instance, follow a person like that to america. but i have to say, it was a joyful undertaking.
inskeep: instead, utah lawmakers passed legislation that was backed by the mormon church and by pro-gay rights organizations. it protects lgbt people in the workplace and elsewhere, although not in religious institutions.

given political divisions over climate change, it's not clear whether the issue will be as big a factor in the general presidential election. colorado voter ksue anderson believes it will be in the mix. but she wants democrats to push whatever issues it will take to beat president trump.
the announcement comes after reports that the white house was considering a new executive order that would undo former president barack obama's 2014 executive order that gave new protections to gay and transgender people. when it was signed, the order applied to 28 million workers — roughly a fifth of america's workforce.

on the other hand, some religious groups are exempted. churches and religious schools and charities get the right to employ only those people who adhere to their religious beliefs. does that sound contradictory? tyler deaton of the american unity fund, who identifies as a gay conservative, tries to explain.

although bill is 16 years removed from the white house and hillary's own presidential dreams were smashed in november, rapert cites a familiar list of reasons why the clintons' names should be removed from the busiest airport in arkansas, including allegations of impropriety at the clinton foundation, hillary clinton's emails as secretary of state and bill clinton's impeachment by congress.

yet there's a moment where they're running in kobani in this battle, which is the first time isis faces real defeat. they are running low on ammunition. they're running low on people. they're running low on food. but what they have is spirit and motivation. and actually, one of the women commanders now is saying: 'know what they think of you, show them what you can do, show them that women have value, that women cannot be enslaved, that this is not what is going to stand.' and i think that sense that they were not doing this simply for themselves, but for women around the across the region and beyond, ran through everything they said to me.
samantha power, former u.s. ambassador to the u.n. under the obama administration, also reacted with outrage to the news — decrying the move as needlessly cruel & bigoted.

mr. sharlet: well, it's an idea that goes back into the '70s with one of the gurus of modern christian-right thinking, a guy named francis schaeffer, but it really picked up steam with the work of a man named charles colson. chuck colson some listeners may remember as the watergate felon, nixon's sort of henchman who went to prison - was born again, as he writes in his book, through the family, through their intervention and bringing him to christ. they actually helped get him out of prison by writing letters to the parole board and everything else. and he had this idea. he's an evangelical. he had this idea that catholics and evangelicals, who historically in american life have been at each other's throats, could work together on culture war issues, that they could be co-belligerents in the culture war. and i think the family has been one of the vehicles at which that's happened at the elite level, despite the fact - and i think this is important when we look at someone like bart stupak - the family began as a virulently anti-catholic organization.
it is also likely to have an outsize impact on the office of the presidency itself, having affirmed the chief executive's broad powers to dictate immigration policy as a response to changing conditions abroad.

moore spokeswoman jane porter was even less subtle when she appeared on cnn tuesday, talking to pregnant anchor poppy harlow and congratulating her on her unborn child.
hoogstra's group, along with seventh-day adventists, latter-day saints and members of some other denominations, support an alternative approach, called the fairness for all act, which also extends anti-discrimination protections for lgbtq people, but with more religious exemptions.

in the end, republicans recognize that they may be better off without having to deal with moore in their caucus.

just as vexing are the cultural questions, especially among the staff and faculty who work with lgbt students on a daily basis. all colleges and universities receiving federal aid are required to have a title ix coordinator responsible for working with students who feel they have been subject to discrimination because of their sex. whether gay or transgender students are entitled to title ix protection is unresolved, so title ix coordinators find themselves having to judge on their own how to respond to those students who seek their help.

before long, graham was one of the most famous and admired men in america. he became a regular white house visitor, meeting with every president from harry truman to barack obama and becoming a friend and counselor to several. graham was especially close to richard nixon, a golfing buddy, though that friendship was diminished by the watergate scandal.

alabama has hit the trifecta of political scandal. three top elected officials — one from each branch of government — are embroiled in controversy and could be forced from office.
throughout the debate, all the republicans had common enemies — president obama and democratic candidate hillary clinton.
mayer: yes. i mean, and so in particular, some of the trade deals they were against. and in particular, one of the things that they objected to most strenuously was an idea that the trump administration was pushing early on along with paul ryan, which was to impose a border adjustment tax. this was going to be a tax on items that are imported into america, and the aim of it was to try to get americans to buy more american goods and try to get american companies to - manufacturers to use american-produced, you know, items.
diamond: matthew had been a major player in the legal fight to weaken or overturn the birth control protections in the affordable care act. the obama administration had included birth control as one of the preventive measures that insurers had to cover as part of the aca that immediately produced legal fights. religious groups said, we don't want to provide contraception to our employees. it went all the way to the supreme court. there was a compromise hashed out that some groups could decide to object to allowing birth control for religious reasons. with matthew bowman and some of the other hhs leaders in charge now, the trump administration a few months ago dramatically broadened that exception, allowing virtually any employer or organization to say, we don't want to provide contraception to our employees. so it's an interesting flip. the guy who fought this policy all the way to the supreme court is now on the inside working to roll it back.

it's the first major electoral blow to trump since his own upset victory just over a year ago, giving democrats a special election win after several near misses. democrats were victorious in november in the virginia and new jersey governors' races, but the win in such a red state that trump won by almost 30 points is a political earthquake heading into the 2018 midterm elections.
mayer: oh, it killed it right then. those campaigns, especially the second one, were eye-catchingly negative for indiana, where you're, you know, they like to be midwestern nice. and, you know, i interviewed his brother about the campaign and was surprised about how frank he was about it. he said, you know, it was partly immaturity. but he said of mike pence, he was full of [expletive]. and - which was a surprising thing to be able to quote but it's in the article. pence, you know, he disappointed many of his backers by using his campaign funds to pay off his household expenses. it wasn't illegal, but it just didn't look proper.

president donald j. trump spoke today with president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey to congratulate him on his recent referendum victory and to discuss the united states' action in response to the syrian regime's use of chemical weapons on april 4th. president trump thanked president erdogan for supporting this action by the united states, and the leaders agreed on the importance of holding syrian president bashar al-assad accountable. president trump and president erdogan also discussed the counter-isis campaign and the need to cooperate against all groups that use terrorism to achieve their ends.
polling by the pew research center last year came to similar conclusions: 50 percent of millennials, between the ages of 18 and 36, said gun laws in the u.s. should be more strict. that share was almost identical among the general public, according to kim parker, director of social trends research at pew.
alabama has hit the trifecta of political scandal. three top elected officials, one from each branch of government, are in trouble. the house speaker is on trial for public corruption. the chief justice has been suspended for possible judicial ethics violations, and a sex scandal has the governor in the crosshairs of state and federal investigators. npr's debbie elliott joins us now to sort through all this. and, debbie, this sounds like a mess. what's the common thread?

gross: so let's first talk about the family's role in how this scandal has played out. first, again until a couple of weeks ago, john ensign lived at the family-owned c street residence, and also he went to c street - to see c street people for advice. coburn, who - senator coburn, who lives at c street, was the chief advisor, it seems, judging from what doug hampton said last night. so what was the advice that hampton says ensign got from c street?

the late '00s saw an explosive, cross-genre revival of retro-sounding soul music that continues to shape the pop landscape to this day. arguably, that trend's catalyst was amy winehouse's earth-shaking final album. working closely with producers mark ronson and salaam remi, plus a then-little-known brooklyn soul ensemble called the dap-kings, the young, beehived-and-tattooed london singer pivoted from jazz to the velvet musical vocabulary of '60s girl groups and motown. yet however smartly it evoked the sounds of an earlier era, back to black could never have been mistaken for anything but contemporary — or anyone but winehouse. funk and r&b grooves snapped through a post-breakbeat filter; her lyrics about lost love and self-destructive habits pulled zero punches; her delivery came fluid as exhaled cigarette smoke. even tears dry on their own, whose arrangement reproduced tammi terrell and marvin gaye's version of ain't no mountain high enough down to the drum fills, sounded magnificently fresh with winehouse's lead line — a romantic duet flipped into a frank, lonely rendering of a breakup's aftermath. this was a soul record that wouldn't forget that hip-hop happened, a thoroughly modern tract on heartbreak whose bluntness made it believable. —rachel horn (npr music)
while o'connor was on the court, a majority of justices continued to support legislation that regulated campaign fundraising. but after her retirement and the alito appointment, kennedy wrote the court's 5-to-4 decision in citizens united, the 2010 case that remade the way campaigns at every level are conducted.
to cite one example, when the state's controversial religious freedom law was enacted, pence appeared on abc's this week. in the 12-minute interview, host george stephanopoulos tried in vain 12 separate times to get an answer to various versions of this question: if a florist in indiana refuses to provide flowers for a gay couple's wedding, is that legal under the state's new religious freedom law, yes or no?
the question, terry, is, was this new division necessary? i talked to folks inside hhs. and one lawyer who's worked on civil rights issues told me this was essentially a solution in search of a problem. there really hadn't been that many objections about religious liberty in health care, that workers weren't able to express their religious liberty which is protected. that has not been controversial that there should be protections if someone wants to opt out of an abortion because of his or her moral religious beliefs, that had been ok.

another stupak-pitts collaboration goes back a few years, when they tried to take president bush's pepfar anti-aids - $15 billion anti-aids plan for around the world, and stupak and pitts thought that bush's plan was not conservative enough. so they tried to turn it into a kind of an abstinence crusade overseas, and especially in africa. and i think they actually went too far even for the bush administration.

what the structure arguments mean is that the power of government is limited in a much stricter way than previous judges have seen. so what these lawyers in the federalist society are trying to do is use the court to limit not just abortion rights, not just gay rights, not just affirmative action, the traditional issues, but to limit the power of government all together to address problems. and that is potentially the most dramatic change of all. and that's where you might see neil gorsuch assert his influence in the most direct way.

gjelten: the legislation gets a harsher review from the human rights campaign, which advocates for lgbtq rights. in a statement, the group's chairman, alphonso david, says the bill is a double whammy of dangerous rollbacks and discriminatory carve-outs. congressman stewart says he does not yet have any democratic cosponsors for the bill, but he thinks some will come.
and even to this day, doug coe, the leader of the group, says, you know, now he's got a much more open mind. you can be a catholic and love jesus just the way you can be a jew and love jesus or be a muslim and love jesus. in other words, being a catholic in his mind doesn't qualify you as a christian. and actually when i visited the c street house, when bart stupak was living there, there was a woman who was sort of functioning as an administrator, and she was a catholic. and she told me that she still goes to mass, but she keeps it secret because she knows doug would disapprove.

the house speaker, mike hubbard, had been convicted of misusing his office for personal financial gain last summer. and then we had chief justice roy moore of the alabama supreme court removed from the bench because he was defying federal court orders on same-sex marriage. so overall, it was a rough year for alabama politics.

diamond: there's a political story and a policy story behind why trump and christian conservatives are so tightly aligned, both in his campaign and now in the administration. i think the political story is that evangelicals, christian conservatives flocked to trump during the primaries and have largely stayed with him. and there's a persuasive case, that's why he won. about 80 percent of white evangelicals supported trump on election day. evangelicals represented a record number of voters in 2016, more than one-quarter of the electorate.
it's an entire pattern of complementarity that we see woven throughout the account of scripture, he says, from genesis 1:26-28 all the way to the book of revelation. so it's not a minor matter to suggest that the church can somehow just update its understanding of gender. this is where we must be found faithful, regardless of the cultural understanding around us.
to win over white voters who were beginning to defect from the democratic party, bill clinton positioned himself to the right of bush and reagan on immigration. clinton ran on cracking down on illegal immigration, and in 1996 he signed a bill into law that made it harder for people to become legal citizens while making it easier for them to be deported. deportation went from a relatively rare outcome for undocumented people to a more common one.

the fugees struck gold in the late 1990s with albums like the score, a feat that also made their resident wordsmith, lauryn hill, a household name. but when hill went out on her own two years later and dropped her debut, the neo-soul masterpiece the miseducation of lauryn hill, she schooled everyone all over again in new and necessary ways. in it, hill refuses to shy away from topics often left unspoken, injecting classroom love lesson interludes and hard-hitting lyrics about how money changes people in the banger lost ones. then there's the cautionary tale doo wop (that thing), a bold song that unpacked sexual politics and not only scored hill two grammys, but also earned her the distinction of becoming the first woman since debbie gibson (with 1988's foolish beat) to have a song that she simultaneously wrote, recorded and produced soar to the top of the billboard charts. and that's just one song on the miseducation of lauryn hill. the album, rife with hill's biting rhymes and sharp turns of phrase, is a wonder from start to finish, from her smoldering duet with fellow r&b superstar mary j. blige i used to love him to the unapologetic, plucky to zion, in which hill details how people discouraged her from having a child in order to further her career: everybody told me to be smart / look at your career, they said / lauryn baby use your head / but instead i chose to use my heart.

sebastian barry: (reading) chapter one. the method of laying out a corpse in missouri sure took the proverbial cake, like decking out our poor lost troopers for marriage rather than death. all their uniforms brushed down with lamp oil into a state never seen when they were alive. their faces clean shaved, as if the embalmers sure didn't like no whiskers showing. no one that knew him could have recognized trooper watchorn because those famous dundrearies was gone. anyway, death likes to make a stranger of your face. true enough their boxes weren't, but that was not the point. you lift one of those boxes, and the body makes a big sag in it. wood cut so thin at the mill, it was more a wafer than a plank. but dead boys don't mind things like that. the point was, we were glad to see them so well turned out. i am talking now about the finale of my first engagement in the business of war. 1851 it was most likely. since the bloom was gone off me, i had volunteered aged 17 in missouri. if you had all your limbs, they took you. if you were a one-eyed boy, they might take you, too, even so. the only pay worse than the worst pay in america was army pay. and they fed you queer stuff till you just stank. but you were glad to get work because if you didn't work for the few dollars in america, you hungered.

core values in our society sometimes come into conflict. most americans, for example, believe people should not be punished for their religious beliefs, but neither for who they are. that means balancing the right to oppose same-sex marriage, a view held by some religious people, against the right of lgbtq people to be free from discrimination. here's npr's tom gjelten on the latest effort to find a compromise.
severino: sure - because that was something that joe biden himself proposed. he said when we're this close to a presidential election - when he said it, he actually meant a little farther out than that vacancy came up. he said at that point, it would be inappropriate for the president to nominate someone, and it would be inappropriate for the senate to consider them. and that had to do with the presidential election, and it was something that the majority of the senate agreed with at the time. i don't think you would see that apply in a midterm election year - never would've contemplated that because that would mean you wouldn't hear - have nominees 50 percent of the time.
still, even though it was on the books, sex-based discrimination initially was viewed as kind of a joke, bagenstos says. it really took a lot of work by social movement actors within the feminist movement to organize and mobilize and bring cases — and bring political pressure — so that by the end of the 1960s, both the [equal employment opportunity commission] and the courts were beginning to recognize the prohibition on sex discrimination was something serious.

while a news outlet might pass on giving space and airtime to legitimizing a figure like spencer, it's much harder to ignore the president of the united states, by definition the most mainstream political figure in the country. trump was restrained after the skirmishes between unite the right rallygoers and counterprotesters turned deadly. he characterized what was happening in charlottesville as an egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence, on many sides. whatever his motive, ku klux klan members and neo-nazis — the kind of villains that it takes virtually no political instincts or particular ideology for a mainstream figure to condemn — escaped even a token condemnation from the president. the white supremacist treated instead as just one of any number of unruly partisan hordes and not especially worthy of rebuke. it was a remarkable moment. it seemed almost as if something in the country had shifted.

doty devotes the largest number of pages to whitman's uncharted desire, how whitman navigates and proclaims queer sexuality. doty's fascination is as a poet, teacher, and as a man. he's at the top of his game in these chapters, proceeding line by line through song of myself and other poems, sharing their impact on his life. he sets whitman's work in historical and literary context, weaving in the aids epidemic, bram stoker's dracula, oscar wilde, and whitman's american contemporaries — emily dickinson, ralph waldo emerson, and herman melville among others.
it is here that doty unspools his teenage marriage to an older woman, ruth, with its strains and secrets, its sexual misalignment. hiding my sexuality meant hiding my body, he writes. although he escaped the horrors of aversion therapy, mental institutions, and prison, he lived through a weird, nearly total silence...an entire culture conspired to say that something evident was simply not there. it makes you crazy. doty examines his sexual life with rigor as well as a sense of wonder. he relishes the moment — insatiable — while simultaneously standing on the sidelines commentating.

gross: jeffrey toobin's article the conservative pipeline to the supreme court is in the current edition of the new yorker. he's a staff writer for the magazine and senior legal analyst for cnn. after we take a short break, ken tucker will review an album of biblical psalms set to music by country singer jessi colter and guitarist lenny kaye. this is fresh air.
the referendum comes after weeks of anticipation, acrimony and more than a little heated discussion around a simple yet deeply divisive question: should the country repeal a constitutional amendment that bans abortion in nearly all circumstances?
toobin: yes, there is. and it was founded in direct response to the federalist society. it was founded right after the supreme court's decision in bush v. gore in 2000, when the court effectively handed that election to george w. bush. and liberals said, you know, conservatives have been cultivating judges and judicial selection for a long time, for two decades, and we've been asleep at the switch. we need to create our alternative. and there is one. it's called the american constitution society. and it is - i would say it is somewhat successful. it is - has an annual convention every year. and, you know, more liberal judges speak at it. and it has some networking opportunities for liberal lawyers. it's smaller. it has a budget of $6 million as opposed to $20 million for the federalist society.
diamond: valerie huber is someone who believes in abstinence, which is an interesting role for someone now in charge of family planning and contraception awards. she is the new leader of this office. she replaced someone named teresa manning who abruptly left in the past 10 days. and teresa manning had said that contraception didn't work. so even though there has been some turnover, it's a sign of just how deep now the bench goes among anti-abortion folks and anti-contraception folks at hhs. and there's a lot of scrutiny right now, terry, on that office. it's running well behind when it normally would issue applications. there is a sense that there might be an effort to steer money away from planned parenthood, which has historically been a very big grantee providing not just abortion help but also sexual education, contraception, other emergency care, and instead steer that money towards federally qualified health centers around the country. so that's one reason why valerie huber and that office, again, another office in this giant administration, may have a very significant role depending on the regulations that she's shaping.
gross: so he runs for congress. he actually gets elected to congress in what year?
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross, back with jeffrey toobin, a staff writer for the new yorker and cnn's senior legal analyst. his latest piece in the new yorker, the conservative pipeline to the supreme court, is about the federalist society, a nationwide group of conservative lawyers, and its executive vice president, leonard leo. toobin writes that leo served in effect as president trump's subcontractor on the selection of neil gorsuch to serve on the supreme court. leo also played a crucial part in the nominations of justices john roberts and samuel alito, which means, toobin says, that leo is responsible, to a considerable extent, for a third of the supreme court. when we left off, toobin was explaining why he thinks that justice gorsuch will at every opportunity vote to overturn roe v. wade.

but if you were of military age as a young person, a young man, from ireland getting off the boat in america, you were immediately put into the union army if you're - if you landed in a union port, and vice versa in a confederate. this was to earn your citizenship. i mean, this was something i simply didn't know. so a person who has lost everything behind him - his future, the people who loved him, the people he loved, his whole possibility of meeting some girl someday in a, you know, a hawthorn-strewn country road and marrying her and having his babies, and all the rest of it, gone for all eternity - is then put straight into a uniform, given a musket and told to go and fight for something he didn't understand. was he even speaking english?

no union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family, kennedy said in his opinion. in forming a marital union two people become something greater than what they once were.
and i think there's a broader question of what is happening in the united states with life expectancy, which has been going down. there has been a rise in suicides. a lot of that is tied to the opioid epidemic. but it is a historic change, and the health department is on the front lines of trying to arrest that. is the trump administration up to that challenge? what will they be doing? who will they be putting into office? and alex azar, as the looming leader, is going to have that challenge on his plate, too.
let's start with a scene from the film. cameron, the main character played by chloe grace moretz, has been sent to god's promise after she was discovered making out with her girlfriend. in this scene, soon after she's arrived god's promise, she's been invited by reverend rick, played by john gallagher jr., to talk with him over a game of pingpong. rick is one of the people who runs god's promise. he considers himself ex-gay, having been, quote, cured of homosexuality with the help of his older sister who founded and directs god's promise.

barry: well, the whole adventure of these seven books, indeed, has been to try and go and find, if only in the imagination, these bits and bobs of my family, the people who weren't talked about, the people who - around whom a silence fell, whether for political reasons or because they went so far and never came home. and this was one person that my grandfather told me about when we shared a - a bed and a room when we were - when i was small in the 1960s in ireland. and he'd tell me these wonderful stories, and this was a story he couldn't tell because all he knew about it was that a great-uncle of his had been at the indian wars. so that's where that started.

mayer: it happened with so little consultation, really. what happened was that it was a very shallow pool that trump advisers were picking from. they were trying to find someone to become vice president on the ticket, and it really came down to chris christie, the governor of new jersey, or mike pence, the governor of indiana.
danforth: one, conversion therapy is in the news again obviously. and just yesterday, for instance, delaware became the 14th state to thankfully pass a law sort of forbidding it when applied to teenagers. and there are other states and municipalities in the act of doing that. so i think conversion therapy seems to be very much in the news, and people are having an awareness of it again, which is important. there was this sense for a long time that it just didn't happen anymore. but i also just think that the actors gave such honest performances that feel very queer and very real, right? they feel authentic to my sense of queer teens today.
mayer: yes, of course. they've been pushing very hard on that. the thing you have to remember about them is that they - ok, they've got the second-largest private company in the country, and it is very much engaged in the fossil fuel business. they've got 4,000 miles of oil pipelines. they've got a coal company. they've got coal-powered power plants. they've got coal up in canada. and so their whole business plan relies on stay - keeping america on fossil fuels. and so they've thrown a tremendous amount of weight behind stopping anything that would get - put a tax on carbon or push america towards some kind of agreement on climate change that might tax carbon pollution.

and the longer you're in therapy, or in group, or rehab or whatever, you slowly develop this other voice that combats it, that's, you know, the therapy voice. or, the wanting to get better. you know? the other voice drowns out the crazy in you, and you slowly start to function a little better each day. and what if the voice that was drowning out your instinct was a religious one, and it was trying to kill in you the instinct that was as inherently a part of you as your sexuality?

the office of refugee resettlement - i've been covering hhs just for more than a decade, this is the first time i can remember that the office has been at the center in the abortion fight. last year, the political head of that office appointed by the trump administration, a guy named scott lloyd, began blocking teenage girls in his custody from seeking or obtaining abortions even when they alleged rape. and scott lloyd even went so far as to personally visit some of these undocumented teenagers and try and convince them to change their mind.

potential trump conflict: trump has strong business ties to china. he has tried to get into the chinese market since 2008. he signed onto two multi-million-dollar deals that fell apart, including one with state grid, the state-owned power company. in october, the trump organization announced new plans for 20 to 30 new hotels in cities all over china. industrial & commercial bank of china ltd. is a tenant in trump tower. bank of china, also state-owned, is a debt holder for at least part of a $950 million loan for a building in new york in which trump is part-owner.
gross: so there used to be this expression - there should be no litmus test for the supreme court. but president trump said he'd choose a pro-life judge, but neil gorsuch wouldn't speak to his views on abortion, though people deduce that he is against it. so, like, what does the litmus test - does anybody believe anymore that there's no litmus test?
loving avoids these potholes by simply and elegantly flying far, far over them. loving isn't a movie about a landmark civil rights case; it's a movie about two people who fall in love, get married, start a family and just want to do all that in their rural virginia hometown. loving is as much about the contrast between the quiet pastoral — beautifully rendered in 35 mm by cinematographer adam stone — and the loud and chaotic urban landscape of washington, d.c., to which this reserved family is exiled.

at first glance, the princess bride — both william goldman's 1973 novel and rob reiner's 1987 film — would seem to belong to the latter camp. both feature wry, knowingly meta elements, both happily riff on our received expectations. and yet this story, filled with giants and pirates and swordsmen and princesses, ends with true love winning out. with, in point of fact: mawwiage.

they survived for 70 years by not locking themselves in with any one faction. so you see democrats like representative mike mcintyre, a very conservative democrat from north carolina; representative heath shuler, also from north carolina; representative bart stupak; senator mark pryor, who is pro-war, anti-labor, anti-gay and a creationist, but he is a democrat. and he's a guy who explained to me a couple years ago that through the family, he had learned that the meaning of bipartisanship was that, quote, jesus didn't come to take sides; he came to take over.

this album dismantled the hip-hop boy's club. for the first time in history a woman rapped, sang, wrote and produced every song on a major rap release. within the first sounds that we hear, missy elliott invites you to become engulfed with the undeniable virginia-based funk, a region that's equally southern and eastern, through aquatic synth sounds paired with earthy drum patterns. the result? a vibe that's both familiar and futuristic. without selling overly sexualized imagery and without imitating hypermasculine gangster rap, elliott awards us with pure originality. she didn't just change the scope on how we interpreted sexy and gangster: the genres bended to her liking. the sound shifted to jazz with her vocal improvisations and scatting on the rain (supa dupa fly), over an ann peebles sample. it became the blues on beep me 911, a somber song about uncertainty and urgency. and her esteemed comrades busta rhymes, timbaland, lil kim, aaliyah, da brat and ginuwine complemented and fit comfortably within the theme of the perfect album. elliott presciently knew her music was groundbreaking and reminded us throughout the record with her boisterous lyrics. today, supa dupa fly remains one of the best hip-hop records of all time, and its level of innovation and musicianship remains unparalleled. —stasia irons (kexp)

but anyway, here's the little letter (reading) sir, as the more than proud father of one shining person who happens to be a member of the lgbt community, i will be voting yes in the coming referendum. in that sense, it is a personal matter. i have read quite a bit in the papers about our new more tolerant society and that may be so, and, of course, it is a solid point of view from which to vote yes, but i don't see it as a matter of tolerance so much as apology, apology for all the hatred, violence, suspicion, patronization, ignorance, murder, maiming, hunting, intimidation, terrorizing, shaming, diminishment, discrimination, destruction, then yes intolerance visited upon a section of humanity for god knows how many hundreds of years if not millennia. my child will be just shy of 18 when the votes are cast, and therefore cannot vote himself. by voting yes, i will be engaging in the simple task of honoring the majesty, radiance and promise of his human soul.
moore: separation of church and state never meant to separate god from government. the first amendment never meant to divide our country from an acknowledgement of god. it's time to stand up and say, we have a right under our constitution to acknowledge god.

and then bush named harriet miers, his white house counsel, to replace o'connor. and then when her nomination imploded, he named alito. and this was an interesting moment in leo's career, i think, this bush effort, because, you know, leo is proudly and effectively a member of the conservative movement. and harriet miers was really unknown to the conservative movement and in particular, unknown to the federalist society. she was not a constitutional lawyer.
sagal: all right, liz, here is your last limerick.
north carolina recently enacted legislation commonly known as the bathroom bill, a law that bans transgender people from using public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. and a controversial so-called religious liberty bill in georgia — which would have allowed religious officials and faith-based organizations to deny services when doing so would violate a sincerely held religious belief — prompted a number of companies to threaten to boycott the state. the governor vetoed that measure.

if history is any guide republicans will abandon — as they have before — traditional protections for the minority party, meaning that the views of opposition party senators will not be considered in the appointment of judges, even from states where both senators are democrats. senate democrats, even when they controlled the senate, did honor those gop views, but republicans have forsaken that traditional accommodation in recent times.

that's a real question of what is within bounds for an official. that's led to repeated legal challenges from the aclu and others who went all the way to the supreme court. my colleague based in texas, renuka rayasam, has covered this very closely. it's an area where there was no expectation that this would be one of the places where abortion would be hashed out and fought over. but the trump administration has been looking for ways to pull back the government's role. and where patients who maybe in the past had been able to seek abortions, now they're running into new barriers.

and what happened was the kochs just attacked it with their entire machinery. they have a great political machine in 36 states. and they went at it. and eventually trump abandoned it. and so that border adjustment tax is gone. and in its place, we've got this new kind of tax reform proposal which since it doesn't include new taxes such as the border adjustment taxes, it instead is projecting a tremendous deficit - $1-and-a-half trillion over the next 10 years.
but i will say, it is really problematic when you have a catholic — the most prominent catholic in the country, which is what president biden is — taking this stand that he is in favor of abortion — which the church says is a grave moral evil; it's the killing of defenseless, unborn, vulnerable human life — and then presenting himself for communion, hasson said.
the times journalists wrote that their report lays bare how powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy.
younger white people are much more likely than older white people to say that black people face a lot of discrimination. most republicans reject the idea that black people do. black people are the racial group least likely to support same-sex marriage but the group most opposed to laws that would allow businesses to refuse service to lgbtq people. these are just some of the findings in a massive new study on american attitudes about how americans perceive discrimination, from the public religion research institute, a nonpartisan group that studies attitudes about culture and public policy.
the candidates all also took a strong stand against gun control executive actions that obama issued last week. charleston, s.c., the site of the gop debate, saw its own tragedy last year when a gunman with white supremacy leanings killed nine people at an african-american church.

takano: well, it came rather quickly on the heels of super tuesday. and i - you know, my district went strongly for senator sanders, even wider, a bigger margin than the state as a whole, in california. and that's one of the primary reasons that i came forward, other than i'm also a progressive that wanted to come home after super tuesday kind of shook things out. my feeling is that i wanted to put forward arguments as a chairman of a full committee in the house of representatives. i saw senator sanders being very effective as the chairman of the senate veterans affairs committee.
more prominent, less vulnerable americans — ellen degeneres, as one major example — were coming out. and in 2003, lawrence v. texas, a landmark supreme court case that effectively decriminalized homosexuality, softened the ground for later gay-rights goals, such as same-sex marriage.
they wanted to steer him away from neutrality or leftist sympathies and bring him into conservative american alliances, and they were able to do so. they've since promoted uganda as this bright spot - as i say, as this bright spot for african democracy, despite the fact that under their tutelage, museveni has slowly shifted away from any even veneer of democracy: imprisoning journalists, tampering with elections, supporting - strongly supporting this anti-homosexuality act of 2009.
mcconnell came under heavy criticism from democrats for holding up president barack obama's nomination of judge merrick garland before the 2016 presidential election, leading to trump's nomination of justice neil gorsuch to fill the seat on the court open because of the death of justice antonin scalia. mcconnell is coming under immediate criticism from democrats for pledging to confirm a nominee just before this year's midterm elections.

biden portrayed clinton as a person who knows about the problems of the middle class and who has always been in public life. clinton knows, he repeated over and over. and trump has no clue, he said.
for anderson, trump's pivot was no surprise. despite the signals that he might be friendly to the lgbtq community, anderson says, the general stance that trump had taken was, 'look, i'm going to be a friend to social conservatives. i'm going to be a friend to evangelicals and catholics.'

for years now, lawyers have been floating proposals that future high-court justices spend no more than 18 years at a time on the supreme court bench. the plan would space out appointments, so presidents would make appointments every two years, supporters said. that would bring regular turnover and fresh thinking to the court — and align with the longer life spans of americans since the nation's founding, they argue.

and just as in the u.s. with gay men, women sex workers in india were the victims of persecution and abuse by the government as well as from other quarters. they were arrested in mass drives, their blood was drawn without consent and they were cruelly incarcerated for months and even years, separated from their children and families without being told why. it is because of those experiences that countless sex workers in india have long demanded decriminalization of their work.
adams: that's right. so it protects you as far as employment and as far as having a place to live, having housing. at the same token, which was the great thing that legislative action can do that a court ruling can't do is, a court ruling can give those protections to the lgbt community. but it can't finesse those. so as we gave those protections, we actually exempted out religious schools.

she says access depends on where you live. metropolitan areas like birmingham and montgomery are open for business, but remote rural areas are more of a patchwork, forcing people to travel elsewhere to get a license.
of course, only a portion of this book is about me — more than half is about the scores of women sex workers, gay men and trans women whom i've met over the decades. and getting to write a history of their remarkable lives and efforts, which have led to all kinds of progress in india, was equally transformative for me.
when the obama education department issued its federal guidance to schools in may of that year, buchert felt empathy and relief — first of all — for young transgender people around the country, she says. there are real people — real trans people — who are suffering discrimination, not going to the bathroom, skipping gym class. those kinds of discriminatory conditions can have a lifelong impact on these youth.

in many places in the united states, you can still be denied housing or lose jobs over your sexuality and gender identity. and, bull said, the culture war is being fought through the courts and state legislation. groups on the religious right now say this is a freedom of speech and freedom of religion issue for some people of faith. the argument is that when cake-makers or photographers comply with nondiscrimination laws by serving lgbtq people at their businesses, they are going against their faith.

this is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information, cornyn said thursday morning. no senator deserves to sit on this committee, or serve in the senate, in my view, if they decide to be a law unto themselves and willingly flout the rules of the senate and the determination of confidentiality and classification.
in 1966, there was a protest at julius's bar in manhattan — the bar, citing state regulators, refused to serve these openly gay men, kreis says. and at the time, the chairman of what's essentially the new york city's version of the equal opportunity employment commission, suggested that this was a form of sex discrimination — and this is only two years after the civil rights act of 1964 was passed.

adler: the stonewall bar was one place you could be safe, and of course this was 1969, when the whole nation was in turmoil, but boyce says unlike civil rights activists or feminists, gays rarely thought of themselves as a group. homosexuality was either considered a crime or an illness.
lee: they were absolutely devastating. bishop long's ministry was built on what many would describe, and i would describe, as homophobic preaching and teaching, very conservative reading of scripture. and so his positions that he preached for a number of years put him in a position that when these allegations broke, they directly went to his character and spoke to his integrity and credibility as a minister. and so i believe that those allegations were a singular contributor to the demise of the new birth ministry under bishop long.

in 2012, moore successfully won back his seat on the state supreme court, just less than a decade after being removed from the bench. after winning the gop nomination — defeating another appointed judge despite being heavily outspent — the race turned unexpectedly competitive given moore's history, a similar scenario to what worries republicans now.
the national republican senatorial committee, whom moore specifically blamed during his announcement as plotting a smear campaign against him, re-upped the statement that nrsc chairman todd young, r-ind., issued last month and reiterated that the people of alabama rejected roy moore not too long ago.

former florida gov. jeb bush had some good moments, sparring with trump over tariffs against china, arguing that the businessman's plan would drive prices up and hurt consumers. when trump shot back and called bush weak, the audience booed.
gross: it seems crazy to me.
diamond: the division is so new, and the rule that came out to accompany it is a proposed rule. so we're still in the early days. i do think it's illustrative, though, to look back at what the george w. bush administration did. in one of its final acts the, administration expanded conscience protections and made them broader. so pharmacists, other employees - not traditionally just doctors and nurses, as you said, that maybe didn't want to prescribe medicine related to contraception or work with gay or lesbian americans on fertility treatments. there were a number of examples of those folks being unable to access the care that they wanted. and that's why the obama administration, fairly early on, started working to roll back and narrow what religious objections could actually be be filed.
cory said this morning that he was releasing committee confidential documents, and that's exactly what he's done, booker spokeswoman kristin lynch said in an email to npr. last night, he was admonished by republicans for breaking the rules when he read from committee confidential documents. cory and senate democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night's documents publicly available, and cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. and he'll keep releasing them because republicans are hiding brett kavanaugh's record from the american people.
boies says the times account is terribly unfair. i didn't do anything deceitful here, and there's no basis for that allegation, boies tells npr in december. for them to put that in the article that is about me, without making clear that they're not making that allegation about me, it is, i think, quite misleading.

tur: i remember i was concerned about transgender rights, about how people might treat my father, about this idea that my dad was somehow other or that there could have been something wrong. i certainly worried about that. donald trump, when he was asked about transgender rights on the today show and asked about the bathroom bill on the today show, said that - he was asked in regards to caitlyn jenner. and he said, she can use whatever bathroom she wants. and he came out, and it was something that was, at the time, relatively celebrated among the trans community, that he wasn't going to do what you would expect a typical social conservative to do.

but in those days, many churches were not receptive to having poor people in them, and they either shooed them away or stuck them in the back. so, booth realized that many of the people who he did convert needed a church for them. in fact, the army was called at first a church of the black sheep for this very reason. so out of necessity, the army became a church, and it is considered a christian protestant denomination.

and also, you know, one of the things about liberals is that they have never taken the same interest in judicial selection that conservatives have. you know, i spoke to caroline fredrickson, who is the current president of the american constitution society. and he said, you know, democrats love to mobilize against an attorney general nominee. jeff sessions - you know, they were calling their congressman. but they were not engaged on the neil gorsuch nomination.
parker: i would say zero chance of that happening. it's just not going - i don't think it's going to happen. they don't - by splitting the ticket or by bringing in a third-party candidate, they're essentially assuring that hillary clinton becomes the candidate - becomes the president. and who's going to volunteer for that job? they talk about people like ben sasse, who is somebody - you know, he's clearly a rising star and someone to watch...
i know that gov. pence did do some important work with the administration to expand medicaid in his state, earnest said. that's something president obama has been encouraging democratic and republican governors across the country to do.
the white house has a particular kind of power over this question. it has the power to interpret whether lgbtq people are protected by sex discrimination protections in laws passed by congress, to issue rules and policies that reflect that interpretation, and — through those actions — the power to send a message to the country.
how a person practices their faith can tell us an awful lot about how they're going to hold that office. and i think that's one of the interesting things about watching joe biden and thinking about joe biden as a catholic as much as any of those other public officials.

the election of november 2016 — obviously it was a national election for president, but it was also the night i was elected to the united states senate. and as i write in the book, even just that night, which was the impetus for writing this book, i was experiencing our election and watching on the monitors this thing happen to our country. and i write about how my godson came up to me crying, auntie kamala, this man can't win. and he was afraid. and people were afraid. and my speech, impromptu that night, was we must fight. and that there is so much worth fighting for. and i wrote the book to talk about that.

as many as 12 other judges adopted similar policies after the u.s. supreme court legalized same-sex marriage. some, like allen, closed their marriage license division. others will sign the license but quit performing marriage ceremonies.
back in consideration are some of the names on the previous list: judge thomas hardiman, of the 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals, which covers pennsylvania, delaware, and new jersey, and judge raymond kethledge, who serves on the 6th circuit, which covers a large part of the midwest. hardiman was the runner-up last time and is known as a staunch gun rights advocate. all four are in their early 50s.

after nearly fifty years, blue remains the clearest and most animated musical map to the new world that women traced, sometimes invisibly, within their daily lives in the aftermath of the utopian, dream-crushing 1960s. it is a record full of love songs, of sad songs; but more than that, it is a compendium of reasonable demands that too many men in too many women's lives heard, in 1971, as pipe dreams or outrageous follies. all i really, really want our love to do, is to bring out the best in me and in you, too, mitchell sang to an elusive partner on the album's first track. that line, like so many of the melodic and lyrical gestures throughout blue, is simple, but so radical. with the counterculture collapsing under the weight of its machismo-driven mythologies, women pushed forward with calls to imagine genuine equality in real life — in the private places where love and art is made. blue articulates that demand and its effects more clearly than any other work of art. musically, it reflects mitchell's belief in what she's called the feminine appetite for intimacy, with her nearly naked guitar playing, appalachian dulcimer and occasional piano dominating the mix. yet its rhythms and unexpected flights of melody also reveal mitchell's movement toward the deeper improvisational waters of jazz, a sonic illustration for her love of crossing lines, the white lines of the highway or the generic ones of the recording studio.
cornish: so when we hear a quote like we did from the attorney general talking about a dangerous movement and religious liberties under attack, it's in this context that we're talking about.

gross: so let me ask you about one other person, valerie huber, who oversees the title x programs at hhs, and that includes funding for contraception care. and title x was put into effect during the nixon era. it provides grants that provide comprehensive family planning, including contraception for low-income and uninsured individuals at reduced cost or no cost. so what's valerie huber's background?

that process stretched beyond title vii and employment discrimination to include, for instance, sex discrimination in health care, as outlined in section 1557 of the affordable care act, and sex discrimination in schools in title ix of the of the education amendments act of 1972.
it's interesting because we also see this among groups like mormons, who are more likely to be opposed to same-sex marriage but who have their own history of being a persecuted minority group.

the contrary view expressed in where i am, however, accorded closely with the views of franklin graham, who wrote the foreword to the book and handled all the publicity for it. when asked by npr about the suspicion he had written the book under his father's name, franklin graham airily dismissed the idea.
and so i think, you know, obviously, we're in the heat of the battle now. this is how it goes. we've all been through these elections, moving from a primary to a general. i think progressives are going to come around. they're going to be comfortable with joe biden. he's going to lay out a big vision for the future of this country, and we need his steady leadership. so i think they're going to come around. but, you know, it's hard to say that when you're in the middle of the battle. but he's a clear choice, the much better choice than donald trump would be.

and, you know - and from the beginning of time and that led me to think that, you know, being gay has been part of what we are as a human creature ever since the dawn of time. so where is the history? you get a lot of - a little bit of history from san francisco in the 18 - up to 1863, for instance, when dressing as a woman was outlawed, of parties that were just for men, of events that were just for men. and in this world of america in the 1850s where there are no women more or less just about the west of the missouri or the mississippi, you know - it's well said in a book i was reading that men occupied not only public spaces usually occupied by women, but also domestic spaces which is a very interesting idea. but the immense discretion required, i mean, i - thomas if i am putting him through anything - i think he put himself through all these things, but, say, as a writer putting him through these things - i thought if he has to go through the indian wars and the civil wars, you know, i was very relieved that he was able to get through that particular war of being allowed to be in love with john cole and live a life with him and try to create a little family with the sioux girl winona.

this year, democrats intend to compete vigorously with republicans for the support of catholic voters. they may be helped by having a ticket led by a catholic. also, the catholic electorate includes a growing number of latinos — most of whom opposed trump in 2016. a february poll by ewtn news and realclear opinion research showed biden leading trump among catholic voters, but trump led among those who describe themselves as more active in their faith — attending mass weekly and praying frequently.
this finding highlights how life experiences and political socialization can really shape how an individual, or a generation of people, thinks about how to create change, casey says. older generations of lgbtq people came of age at a time when legal protections were nearly unthinkable and activists agitated in mass scale social movements. but younger people have grown up in the era of gay marriage, 'don't ask, don't tell,' and employment protections, and more successfully petitioning for rights through judicial or legislative processes.

gross: so one of leonard leo's jobs at the federalist society has been to kind of create a pipeline for students to get to the bench and for people on the federal bench to get to the supreme court, people who conservatives approve of because the federalist society started more as a student organization and then it became something to channel people to judicial appointments, right?
diamond: historically, that has been where most of these objections have fallen, and the comments coming in have reflected that too. i will say that the history of these conscience protections dates back to roe v. wade. they are kind of born out of the controversial abortion fight. and to make it more palatable, there was some bipartisan consensus among lawmakers that, ok, abortion is now a mandated right. but if there are doctors and workers who maybe don't want to perform these procedures, these conscience protections will help lessen the impact.
far from a political liability, the president's embrace of same-sex marriage helped to mobilize young supporters. and he was handily re-elected. in his second inaugural, obama wove the push for gay rights into a broader civil rights tapestry, stretching from seneca falls and selma to stonewall.

the exchange alarmed officials at conservative religious schools, for which the loss of tax-exempt status or federal funding would be devastating. their anxiety deepened a year later, when the obama administration notified colleges and universities that it interpreted title ix as prohibiting discrimination based on a student's gender identity, including discrimination based on a student's transgender status. christian schools saw that letter as threatening a loss of federal funding if they refused to accommodate students who identify as transgender and want to be housed with other students who share their gender identity.

i get some heat for saying that not everybody has to be [pro-abortion rights], pelosi said during a georgetown university forum in 2018. when the day comes when we can say we don't want any of our voters to be anti-choice, then i think we'd have a right to say that we don't want any of our candidates to be anti-choice.
gross: i think the environment that you create at the gay conversion center is what's sometimes called a total environment where like everything in it is controlled. and the attempt is to control your mind, too. and everything is for jesus. even the aerobics exercises that they watch are jesus-centered aerobics. it's a blessercize (ph), not an exercise. and i just want to play the song that's sung in this blessercize video.
manson: you know, my sense is that this will be a final blow for a number of catholics who really had been holding onto hope because of pope francis. the media had such a love affair with him, and i think people were really holding on tight to the last threads of hope. and this could be the final blow.
gross: so here's a logistical question. how do you camp out at the airport without getting chased away by security?
at the peak of bryant's homophobic activism that year, an assistant to then-president jimmy carter, midge costanza, made the decision to invite gay-rights leaders to the white house. it made national news, faderman said, and bryant and her supporters loudly protested against the meetings.
sarah mccammon, byline: well, you know, before addressing the whole group at this hotel in times square in new york, he - trump met with a smaller group of about 40 leaders or so. i was not in on that meeting, but we do know from a video tweeted by one of the participants, reverend e.w. jackson, that trump wondered aloud about hillary clinton's faith.
rte says it conducted its poll with a sample size of 3,800, and that the survey had a margin of error of +/- 1.6 percentage points. the irish times conducted its poll of 4,500 voters with ipsos/mrbi — a branch of the company npr partners with for its polls. that survey had a margin of error of +/- 1.5 points, the newspaper said.
i have an obligation here, really, to do this and to set things right, ermold told the associated press about his decision to run for the position. i don't think the other candidates are looking at a larger message.
i knew people would go - try to go after me by using my family. i just - i knew that was obviously going to happen, and they did. i mean, they did on twitter, often, but i ignored them. i mean, i remember responding i think once. and i pointed out that my dad is an incredible person who's done incredible things, who's saved the lives - literally, saved the lives of dozens of people, who's gotten death threats for doing a job that was important, for being a journalist. and my dad made a really brave decision by deciding that he, now she, wanted to live her truth. she wanted to live as a woman. and i think that's an incredible thing. and for the people who want to use that against me, or to try and take me down or insult me over it, i just - i feel badly for them because they're ludicrous people.
until the ruling was announced, we didn't know this was what we'd get and i'm just overjoyed, said gon matsunaka, director of the activist group marriage for all japan and president of the pride house tokyo consortium. its value is absolutely measureless.
we are on the losing side of a massive change that's not going to be reversed, in all likelihood, in our lifetimes.
but the informant appears to have been a fraud. and he has since vanished. even so, he inspired an investigation by the times not of epstein, but of one of the country's most famous lawyers. in a 5,400-word expose published on nov. 30 and an hourlong television show, the times placed boies at the center of a narrative that insinuates deceit and greed inside a morally corrupt legal system.
gross: before we get to the stupak-pitts amendment and its connection to the family, can you just do a roll call of some of the prominent senators and congressmen who are affiliated with the family?

for some alabama voters, supporting abortion rights may be a sin worse than some of the sexual misdeeds alabama gop senate nominee roy moore has been accused of — allegations moore has denied.
he grew up milking cows and pitching hay on his family farm just outside charlotte, n.c.. his parents were pious presbyterians who led their children in prayer before every meal and insisted that they learn a new bible verse each day.
i mean, at this point, thomas is wearing a sack, so he doesn't even have clothes of any shape or form. they come in, and they get this work. and it's the first time i think you realize that handsome john cole is handsome and that thomas must be really, you know, a good looking person because they're able to pull this off, and it's their work. and it's - you know, what they say coming into town they would have been prepared to swill out sewerage. they would have been prepared to - even to stick knives into people if they could get away with it, you know, they will do almost any work. and they get this work which actually is a bit nicer than the other possibilities.

president trump took note of the disparity in death rates, saying, it doesn't make sense and i don't like it at his tuesday briefing. the next day, he called the disparity terrible and added, we are doing everything in our power to address this challenge.
briger: well, one of the things that sustains him through all this carnage, and one of the most enduring parts of the book is the relationship that thomas mcnulty has with his lover handsome john cole. and, you know, they maintain this clandestine romance as soldiers in the army, and then they have a domestic life together. you know, i found it interesting that you decided to write a book about a gay relationship in an era where even that phrase would have been a foreign one. i mean, did you...
gaines-cirelli: my heart has been broken for years now as we have been in this struggle. and i have to say that 2019's general conference was particularly painful for me, personally. i had worked hard. foundry united methodist church and so many other partners had worked very, very hard to try to find a way for us to do something that felt like we could stay together as a family, even in the midst of such painful disagreement. so in this moment, i feel both that same pain because we've gotten to this point, but i'm also feeling hopeful because i've begun to come around to a place of resolve, you know?
not even an hour after the meeting, kessler sent a text message to times reporter emily steel saying that he wanted to meet again. that afternoon, at the back of a chinese restaurant, kessler steered the two times reporters, steel and bernstein, toward what he argued was a different scandal: the behavior of the two lawyers they had just met. kessler alleged the attorneys wanted to turn his material to their own advantage, rather than that of their clients — the women who said they had been victimized by epstein and his social circle.
weekend edition's sophia alvarez boyd and ed mcnulty produced and edited the audio of this interview. digital editor cyrena touros and editorial intern jon lewis adapted it for the web.

the supreme court has accepted three cases that ask whether federal anti-discrimination laws should apply to sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, putting the court on track to consider high-profile lgbtq issues after its next term begins this fall.
mayer: i think he really didn't want to be interviewed for the piece no matter what. it's - they've given very few interviews to anyone working on profiles. and they actually kind of went out of their way in the case of me to sort of block my access to them. i literally at one point became the pool reporter for the white house press association so that i could follow him on one of his trips where - on air force two. and his office went to great lengths to try to see if they could block me from being the pool reporter that day. it was kind of extraordinary. it's never - i've been covering the white house on and off since the reagan era, and i've never had anyone try to object to me being the pool reporter before. so they were keeping him very much under wraps.
pence did suspend the resettlement of syrian refugees to indiana after the paris attacks last fall, but a spokesman for pence defended the act, saying there is a difference between a total ban on muslims and suspending syrian refugees when it comes to security issues when members of the obama administration's intelligence community have said that isis has attempted to gain entry into the united states via the syrian refugee program.
i was not raised evangelical. i was raised lutheran. but all of my friends - eighth grade, ninth grade, 10th grade years - were evangelicals. and i think i associated with them. i think i tried to speak that language and think that way partly as an act of self-protection. i thought if i hang out with these folks, maybe i won't say that i'm gay. they'll kind of keep me closeted, which will be a safer space to be.
alabama gop senate candidates roy moore and luther strange have been national figures for a long time. take a look back at the first mentions of both candidates on npr.
younger voters showed more support for overturning the amendment than older voters did, according to rté exit poll projections. among people aged 18 to 24, 87.6 percent supported the repeal, compared with 63.7 percent of people aged 50 to 64. voters over the age of 65 were the only ones to come out against the repeal according to projections, with 58.7 percent voting no.

and in particular, joe pitts has been in the news because of the stupak-pitts amendment, was one of the guys who really helped to bring abortion to the forefront to the group, starting in the late '70s, and that's become a concern of a lot of members. and, as you expand outwards over the last couple decades, and you look at the concerns of politicians like senator sam brownback, senator jim inhofe, senator tom coburn, all these guys who are very involved members -you see homosexuality, you see all the culture-war issues taking a place alongside biblical capitalism and this foreign affairs expansionism, and, in fact, merging in the family's view into one sort of united world view.

and finally, gorsuch and thomas refused to sign on to the limiting language of the court's 7-to-2 decision on state aid to religious schools. five justices agreed that it was unconstitutional for the state of missouri to deny public funds to resurface the playground at a church school. but gorsuch and thomas wrote separately to strongly suggest that, in their view, religious schools are entitled to the same kind of taxpayer funding that other schools get.
mayer: well, (laughter) that's a good question - because i think he acts as the connective tissue between the trump administration and congress, between the trump administration and the - kind of the socially conservative base of the party. and most importantly, he is the connector between the trump administration and the billionaire donors in the republican party. he is the guy who does most of the fundraising and outreach to the money.
shelley says the splc's brand promise is broken.
prof. winston: the salvation army was the brainchild of william booth, who was a british evangelist. and in the 1860s and �70s, he tried several different missions to reach the un-churched poor in london, but none were very successful. so, one day he was brainstorming with his top command - well, i call it a command in retrospect - but with his top men, and they said, what we need is an army, a salvation army. and he loved the name, he was sort of autocratic to start with. and so, they had a great time making this into a living metaphor.

if the court decides there are exemptions to civil rights law, bull said, it puts gay people in an awkward position of not knowing where or what kind of businesses they can use and [at] which ones they're not welcome. ... right now is a pivotal time for lgbtq rights.
the silence had to do with a very real fear of persecution, exposure and shame. the consequences were tragic. for instance, there is no doubt that countless gay men and trans individuals in india contracted hiv as a result of the fears engendered by section 377. by now, because of the aids pandemic, it is well understood how criminalization and marginalization multiply the risks of disease, for instance by keeping people from openly learning about safe-sex methods or by forestalling healthy romantic relationships.
the white house has released two excerpts from president obama's speech. they show that obama will paint an optimistic picture of the country.
music can make a statement and inspire people in a way. maybe you don't call it activism, but it certainly makes people feel engaged and enlarges human understanding.
and so in that choice, you can sort of see that the kochs pushed very hard for pruitt. they funded him in the past. one of their allies harold hamm, who is a billionaire who's made a fortune from fracking, was also very closely involved in choosing pruitt and advising pence and the transition. so the choice of personnel during that transition on environmental issues is where you can see the influence of the kochs.
luther strange: i'm attorney general luther strange.
the obama administration had supported some of those fights. and there really had only been about one complaint per year during the obama administration. but since donald trump's election, there have been 34 complaints alleging religious discrimination. there are real questions as to why there would be such a massive spike in a little over a year. and folks that i talked to suggested that perhaps hhs was looking for those cases to come forward, that there was some encouragement to help create an environment where they would be able to justify this new office.
the first legal same-sex marriage in the u.s. took place in massachusetts 15 years ago this week. now same-sex marriage is legal across the country, and support for it has grown. but people who fought for the right say the fight isn't over. gabrielle emanuel of member station wgbh has that story.

gross: so it sounds like the people whose religious rights this office is protecting are the people who have religious or moral objections to abortion or to lgbtq people and don't want to treat them or don't want to perform abortions or don't want to treat lgbtq people for certain procedures or medications. i mean, it's a select group of religious people whose rights they seem to be most interested in.
following the uprising, spurred by police raiding the bar, activist groups began organizing to demand rights.
joe biden is only the second catholic president of the united states. he's also a supporter of abortion rights — a position at odds with official teachings of the roman catholic church.
gross: in researching the family's foreign policy, so to speak, and what it's trying to do abroad, you've been researching who's funding what. and you've raised various questions about the family's funding for foreign trips in which it is kind of combining american foreign policy and its own social policy. can you talk a little bit about your concerns about that?
diamond: the office of civil rights, overall, is run by a gentleman named roger severino. he did come from the heritage foundation. he ran the religious liberty center there. and roger severino has been praised for his intellect, and he's a principled person. but his principles are around christian beliefs. he's spoken out against the push for same-sex marriage. he said that was an assault on religious liberty. he's criticized the transgender condition. he's obviously anti-abortion. and that makes for quite a puzzle that someone in charge of protecting civil rights for all americans in health care is someone who has said things that some vulnerable groups are deeply concerned about.
baynes-dunning spent her first days on the job meeting with staff to hear their concerns both at the group's headquarters in montgomery, ala., and at field offices around the south.

the evangelists who preceded graham had a mainly regional appeal, whether in the south or the north, but graham was known as america's pastor. during a 4-month-long crusade in new york city, more than 2 million people came to hear him in various venues, including madison square garden. each service ended with graham urging people to come forward, stand before him and dedicate their lives to christ as a 1000-voice choir sang, just as i am, without one plea, the hymn that served as his anthem.
the allegations against moore have come during a cultural moment reflecting changing views about allegations of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual assault. in the weeks since bombshell new york times and new yorker reports about hollywood megaproducer harvey weinstein, several famous and powerful men have been accused of sexual misconduct and suffered varying impacts on their professional fortunes as a result — including men at npr.

pitts is what the family calls a core member. they have a very unusual theology in the sense that they think that christ had one message for an inner circle and then a kind of different message for a sort of slightly more outer circle. and then the rest of us, christ told us little stories because, frankly, we couldn't handle the truth. and the core members are those they think are getting the real deal. pitts is part of that core of the family that has been steering it and setting its agenda, if you want to put it like that, for many years.

defenders of the original constitution and its view of states' rights argue that the non-proportionate senate still makes sense or that it can be amended through the usual process. but a constitutional amendment requires three-fourths of the states to agree to it, meaning it can be blocked by as few as 13.

meanwhile, we're happy that diane winston is with us, and she joins us from our studios at npr west. welcome, thank you for joining us.
i think if we do that right, it helps get around this false choice that would imply that winning back working-class voters who are white somehow means we ought to walk away from our bedrock commitments on racial and social justice, he said in an interview with npr. which i think is the exact wrong way to go.
democratic pollster brad chism's firm surveyed white women in alabama and found that many were conflicted in their choice, with some wanting to vote for jones but also still having major reservations about his support for abortion rights.
on gay rights, the three dissented when the court summarily struck down an arkansas law that barred married same-sex couples from having both their names on a birth certificate. writing for the conservative trio, gorsuch said, it is very hard to see what is wrong with . . . a birth registration regime based on biology.
i believe marriage is between a man and a woman and firmly believe that biblical world view, he says. and i couldn't put my signature on a marriage license that i knew not to be marriage.
hillary, who was raised in illinois and educated on the east coast, had a complicated relationship with her husband's home state. in her autobiography, living history, she wrote, i was an oddity because of my dress, my northern ways, and the use of my maiden name.
the whole movement has developed to its extreme, and there seems to be a growing amount of people in the society favoring same-sex couples' rights to marry, he says. the opposition party needs a target to attack or an outlet for its anger.

and one particular photograph i saw there were two or three boys doing the dancing, you know, with the men. i was a little bit - i mean, as a modern father, of course, i was a little bit alarmed by that. i mean, but there's no point being modern - modernly - if that's a word - alarmed by the past because it's just - it is a different country. whether or not i read that it was actually a possible employment - but to my way of thinking, you see - i mean, this nascent america predicated upon such incredible violence, but also the possibility.
and now, so far, he has acted in a way that is above board. but i think what i've heard, terry, is that these are still the early days of the trump administration. we're just one year in. and in many cases, the administrators over at hhs needed some time to kind of find their footing. and now they are starting to release a series of rules, building divisions - whatever it might be - that are laying the groundwork for future efforts down the line.
the 2016 election highlighted donald trump's successful courtship of white evangelicals. this year, much of the focus could be on catholics. the presidential campaigns are fighting for votes in the catholic-rich midwestern states, and the presumptive democratic nominee, joe biden, is himself a catholic.
simon: we're going to talk about the supreme court major decisions on government unions, president trump's travel ban. we've got to begin with the sad and appalling killings this week of colleagues, really, at the capital gazette in annapolis.
gross: so some of his talking points, you say, come from some of the corporate sponsors of that indiana policy review foundation. like, i think tobacco - the tobacco lobby was one of the sponsors. and one of his top - one of pence's talking points was that smoking doesn't kill. in fact, 2 out of every 3 three smokers don't die from a smoking-related illness, that a greater scourge was big government disguised as do-gooder health care rhetoric.
sagal: well, it has to do with the sort of modern division of labor in the home.
all this comes as a surprise to those who had thought trump an improbable champion for people who prioritize religion.
it's really tough to know, but it's not about public opinion. even republicans — like, rank-and-file republicans on the ground — about half of them support a path to citizenship. another 10 percent support legal residency. it's only about 3 in 10, even republicans, that support identifying and deporting immigrants.

instead, moore argued that while the legal analysis is yet to be determined, the confusion over the law has an adverse effect on the administration of justice in alabama.
ms. winston: well, going back to that genius for marketing, william booth originally said that he didn't want the army to take any political positions because he didn't want to detract anyone from supporting them. he, himself, didn't listen to that, and he got really embroiled in this whole, you know, trial in britain, which was aimed at raising the age of consent for women to engage in sex.
for a man who often struggled to win brown's praise or even his attention, it's an attempt to promise fresh ideas and perhaps a willingness to embrace issues the outgoing governor left for others, such as single-payer health care.

so you never expected to be covering the trump campaign. you were an nbc correspondent based in london. you'd come to the u.s. because you were asked by a teenager through the make-a-wish foundation to shadow you for a day. so you generously came to the states so that, you know, you could see him, he could shadow you. how did that lead to covering the trump campaign?

mccammon: according to a poll last year by the public religion research institute, large majorities of american christians support same-sex marriage, although most white evangelicals oppose it. npr reached out to all seven democratic candidates who were invited to speak to vander plaats' group, and most declined to comment on the record. a buttigieg campaign spokesman said he would consider participating. a spokesman for former texas congressman beto o'rourke declined, saying in a statement, quote, vander plaats and the family leader have unapologetically provided a forum for dangerous anti-lgbtq hate speech on numerous occasions.
gross: is that a comfortable place to be?
eaton: under the new policy, the lds church now says lgbt members may baptize their children, and nonmembers can have their kids blessed. in addition, same-sex marriage will no longer be considered apostasy and abandonment of faith, just a sin. but jordan sgro, who also grew up lds, wishes the church would apologize for excluding lgbtq members.

barry: oh, man, i tell you. there was a funny moment in philadelphia when i was doing an event with john panvel (ph) who's, of course, a great man. and i had been in a bit of trouble in ireland with a play. i don't need to go into it, but i know somebody in the audience said, well, how do you feel about your country now? you know, because there had been calls for mr. barry to - possibly to leave the country and all the rest. and i instinctively said, well, i love my country. see, i love my country because i know my country. i'm not loving unconditionally or blindly. i've tried to look into the whole matter, and i remain in love with this strange land and its people.

our theme for this year is, 'we protest,'  mohler tells npr. you might say [it's] putting the 'protest' back in protestantism. he and his fellow conservative leaders urge christians to take a biblical stand against such things as no-fault divorce, extramarital sex, transgenderism and gay marriage. his new book is we cannot be silent: speaking truth to a culture redefining sex, marriage, & the very meaning of right & wrong.
ross: i tried that (laughter). and that was a very sad time. i need church. i need to come together with my faith family and receive the support and the love that they give every sunday. and you just - you can't do it by yourself.
they didn't want to repeat the mistakes that president clinton made by trying to move too quickly on gay rights, socarides said. they were so intent on not repeating those mistakes that i think they became too cautious.
it's unfortunate because there are some probate judges .... that do not want to adhere to the rule of law, says coleman. so because of that, now some legislators in the state of alabama want to get out of the business of marriage in the traditional sense.
the ministry of education is seeking to revise the national guidelines — a common process that includes all subjects, not just gender equity. during a recent public hearing, parents spoke out, fearful that gender equity education is providing wrong information and is influenced by same-sex marriage advocates.

rep. tim ryan says biden is the candidate to beat trump
diamond: there are so many different ways, both very big and visible to small and kind of hidden away. this administration's policies are being shaped by the views of leaders who are anti-abortion and who have expressed, before joining the administration, some very strong anti-lgbt views too. for instance, there's a corner of hhs called the office of refugee resettlement. it takes custody of more than 100,000 refugees every year. it also handles unaccompanied minors.
gorsuch came down pretty strongly against any sort of assistance in dying, any sort of, you know, the medical help in dying. and i think that is a very good proxy for his views on abortion, that the government cannot sanction anything related to the taking of human life. so i think one of the surest bets about justice gorsuch's judicial philosophy will be, like justice alito, like justice thomas, he will be against any sort of a constitutional right of a woman to choose abortion.
taiwan has really improved a lot in terms of gender equity education, says yang, who is part of the panel working on revising the national guidelines. but all the progress doesn't mean there will be no setbacks; especially when we are talking about social movement.

ms. angela lewis: they have not accepted because they feel like it's so taboo, especially in the west indian culture.
sure, trump's followers like the idea of having fewer tax brackets, said conservative ben domenech, publisher of thefederalist.com, but, what gets them riled up and active is the embrace of the culture-war issues — that trump has shown himself perfectly happy to fight in a way that republicans in a lot of other positions have been unwilling to traditionally.
while the obama administration sent all its potential nominees to the american bar association for rating as to qualifications, the trump administration has refused to do that prior to nomination. and at the senate judiciary committee, where traditionally appeals court nominees were considered on their own at a hearing, they now are routinely considered with several other judicial nominees, and senators have to pick and choose who they will question in the five or ten minutes allotted.
as the crowd applauded, moore cautioned southern baptists that religious freedom has to be for everyone.

npr's will huntsberry reports there is a sit-in going on outside the arena:
grosz: we should look like seals...
emanuel: massachusetts did not reverse it, but a backlash swept the country. all told, 41 states explicitly limited marriage to between one woman and one man.
book: less, by andrew sean greer
diamond: well, it's interesting you bring that up because the theme that has been raised over and over again is that this administration has focused so much on the objections of doctors and workers who say we have religious objections to treating these patients, whereas the vulnerable patients who maybe haven't been able to access an abortion because the patient lives in a rural community and there's only one provider in that community who performs abortions and maybe this provider doesn't want to - has moral objections. so the patient is further locked out. or trans patients who historically were discriminated against and now are looking at the possibility of a rollback in regulations put by the obama administration.
quotable: there are a few foreigners, with full bellies, who have nothing better to do than try to point fingers at our country. china does not export revolution, hunger, poverty nor does china cause you any headaches. just what else do you want?

tamara keith, byline: just as it became clear bernie sanders had a real shot at winning iowa, former secretary of state hillary clinton turned up her criticism, arguing sanders has big ideas, but they're not based in political reality. the washington post editorial board said simply sanders is selling fiction. but sanders told supporters in fairfield, iowa, he doesn't buy it.
loving doesn't waste time giving a history of the unions and marriages of african- and european-americans going back to the 17th century. in fact, the entire discussion of race in the film is pushed out of the room for as long as it can be, mirroring the choices of the couple themselves. it's a non-issue until it comes back for both the characters and the viewer, in an unavoidable fog seeping in under the door.

in the case of india's sex workers, for instance, a wealth of data shows that today only 1 in 10 ever work in a brothel. instead, the overwhelming majority operates from their homes or small lodges, often using mobile phones. yet, in the popular western imagination, all of india's sex workers work in the heinous conditions of mumbai's brothels of the 1980s.
if anyone has doubts about how different the court is likely to be when a centrist conservative like kennedy is replaced by someone more hard-line, there is the example of justice sandra day o'connor's retirement in 2006. president george w. bush chose samuel alito to replace o'connor, and the effect has been profound; o'connor has even complained privately that alito is systematically dismantling her legacy.
toobin: right. i left out race, which is obviously something that a lot of liberals care about and the naacp...
this 2018 article uses the fiftieth anniversary of loving v. virginia to juxtapose the public legal posture of lgbt litigants with the private practices of racial discrimination in intimate relationships, or 'sexual racism.' the authors argue that some white people's aversion to dating and forming relationships with people of color is a form of racism, and this sexual racism is inconsistent with the spirit of loving.

jane mayer, welcome back to fresh air. so i feel like i don't see mike pence very much, and i often wonder if he's a power behind the scenes or if he really doesn't matter that much within the trump administration. so what's your impression?
the message underlines the church's insistence that marriage should be limited to a union between a man and a woman, saying that same-sex unions involve sexual activity outside of marriage. in the vatican's view, same-sex marriages are not part of god's plan for families and raising children.
we see them in yards of people we know who are conservative republicans, says attorney andrea powers, who lives in suburban birmingham.
mayer: you know, this kind of amazed me. he had - there were six kids in the family - four boys and two girls. and the rule at the dinner table was that the children were forbidden from speaking. so the parents would have the conversation and the kids could only basically say things like pass the butter please and thank you. and the children were also told that whenever an adult entered the room, they needed to stand up, and if they didn't abide by these rules in the family, the father pence was a strict disciplinarian and would hit them with a belt, give them a talking to and hit them with a belt.
and secondly, in a country he knew nothing about - a total tabula rasa picture with nothing drawn on it. i mean, it is quite astonishing. but also for a novelist - i mean, for a human being, that's quite frightening. but for a novelist, of course, that's possibly, wickedly, a wonderful thing to think about and to try and tackle in a book.
haven: you know, politics is politics, so this is first guy where i'm like, oh, my gosh. he's not a politician. he's a human.
if it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, i would absolutely, i would be honored to do it. if it's under the, again, under the right circumstances. but i would do that. ... most political people would never say that, but i'm telling you under the right circumstances i would meet with him. we have breaking news. (may 1, bloomberg)
in other words, the closer one lives to the epicenter of a major metropolitan area, the greater the chances that the person votes for democrats. just as reliably, of course, moving away from the epicenter dramatically increases the chances that a person votes for republicans. wilkinson's maps show these tendencies to be so routine and so pronounced as to be almost comic.
and i tell you, it was the beginning of a sort of university of information of observing him. i mean, he is a beautiful child, and he's a wonderful man. he's full of music. he's the most vital person you can imagine. and, you know, in his great kindness and empathy for his poor, ignorant straight father, he took it on himself to instruct me somewhat. and we sat through our 20 hours of rupaul's drag race - though he could show me what was what. and, you know, and i had just thought recently if you wanted a reality tv star for a president, why didn't you choose rupaul? i think she would have been a much better choice, but let's leave that there.
gross: do you know if mike pence is actually being investigated?
kennedy may also have thought it best to ensure that there is a full complement of nine justices for at least a year. he could even have been put off by president trump's tweets about the judiciary.

jonah mutono: i used the name kidepo'' because it was a good way to hide. i've never been the performative type. none of my friends really knew — they knew that i make music and i would write songs occasionally, but just going out in the world and being someone who writes songs, that was such a new concept for me. so i decided at least to have the privacy and the space to be able to put music out and still hide parts of myself.
i'm not bringing a suit, i promise, but the democrats are going to bring a lawsuit. you have to have certainty; you can't have a question. i can agree with you or not, but you can't have a question over your head, trump said, defending the line of attack he has brought up on the trail, questioning whether cruz meets the constitutional definition of a natural-born citizen.
klein: yeah. i mean, i would say that it feels like you're talking to an angel from above.
in that third case, the court of appeals for the 11th circuit turned away an appeal from gerald lynn bostock last summer. even before bostock's appeal request was declined by the full panel, his attorneys already had asked the supreme court to weigh in.

emanuel: rob compton and david wilson were plaintiffs in the landmark lawsuit.
kennedy's position on the court is more than consequential. in the most hotly contested and closely divided cases, his vote often decides the outcome. with every passing day, it has become more clear that president trump's first supreme court nominee, neil gorsuch, is probably even more conservative than the justice he replaced, antonin scalia.
they said, why would you go and be a part of an institution that is not always fair and does not always pursue justice? some would call it the persecutors office, not the prosecutor's office. ... law enforcement has such a profound and direct impact on the most vulnerable among us. and there is a duty and a responsibility to be a voice for the most voiceless and vulnerable and to do the work of justice. and that's the work i wanted to do. ... it is also understanding that the victims of crime come from the same communities as those who have been treated unfairly. the victims of crime deserve a voice. i, for a while, specialized in child sexual assault cases. i'm gonna tell you, prosecuting those cases were extraordinarily difficult and some of the most important work i did.

i mean, that also heartened me as a human person, the possibility of it, you know.
trump, though, seems more focused on the view of those conservative christians who see this step as fulfilling a key biblical prophecy. in this view, jerusalem needs to be available as the site of the third temple, a necessary precondition for the end times or last things that are essential to many fundamentalist christians' faith.

and then cecilia's the person in my life who has the best taste. and she optioned it. you know, i told her i liked it. she read it and instantly said, this is what we're doing. and i always felt like if she thought something could be done, if she thought i could do it, then i can do it. and living near her is the best enabler. so it's been really great being close to the person in life. who motivates you and believes in you. i mean, she's my - she wants - she always would like me to clarify that were not romantic partners. i talk about her as though she's my wife. but she is, you know, one of the loves of my life.

the payments were not illegal at the time but would become so under rules changes that followed the disclosure. and he used such nasty attack ads against his opponent, democrat philip sharp, that they backfired, according to sharp, giving the democratic incumbent a much larger victory over his gop opponent than in pence's first run.

mr. sharlet: well, they began with the issue of economics. i mean, they began as a union-busting organization. that was their first and strongest mission, and for a long time they saw their two goals as economic and in foreign affairs. something - economically what they, the core members, came to call biblical capitalism, the idea that capitalism is ordained by the bible in a very sort of deregulated, laissez-faire, privatized market; and foreign affairs, a kind of expansionist view of what might be called a soft empire for america.

president trump has never considered lgbt americans second class citizens, and has opposed discrimination of any kind against them, white house spokesperson judd deere tells npr in an emailed statement. he notes trump's participation in washington's pride activities last year, and that the president has hired and promoted white house staff who are gay, and pushed for international decriminalization of homosexuality.
the legislation is designed in the most targeted manner possible to prevent government interference in the lives of the people from which all power to the state is derived, bryant said.
the sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions protected by this act are the belief or conviction that: (a) marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman; (b) sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage; and (c) male (man) or female (woman) refer to an individual's immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth.
and just maybe, that was obama's plan all along: to create the space for a national evolution on gay rights. many of the president's early critics have come around to that point of view.
but the democratic party has got this very broad coalition they're trying to hold together. and even among white democrats, we see some some variation. even though there are double-digit differences between the regions, it's still worth noting that white democrats in the south are still twice as likely to say african-americans face discrimination than white republicans in the south. you can see the regional pull, but that partisan pull is still there.
joe biden believes that health care is a right. and he was instrumental in making sure that everybody in the united states had coverage, working with president obama to pass the affordable care act. that is not an insignificant thing. you look at where joe biden was with gay marriage. you look at him passing the violence against women act, on the assault weapons ban. i mean, he's got a really long record that will continue to come out that, i think, will make those folks comfortable to come back home...
president trump has pledged to nominate a replacement who will almost certainly vote differently on many of these issues, putting some landmark decisions in jeopardy — from roe v. wade to the legalization of same-sex marriage.
it's hard to imagine two men with more different personalities and backgrounds. trump — with his brand name and background in real estate — was an unconventional candidate from the beginning. pence, meanwhile, is a far more recognizable republican, who is known for introducing himself as a basic guy and a christian, a conservative and a republican, in that order.

helen hong: a canadian school district is grappling with what to do about a recently retired longtime school cafeteria cook. elsa bennett (ph), the beloved cook, was praised for decades for her friendly rapport with her middle schoolers as well as her super cheesy mac and cheese. the school itself was widely known to have the most well-behaved, easygoing and unusually calm student body. well, it turns out ms. bennett's secret ingredient was weed.
takano: well, i think - in my endorsement statement, i talked about how he has the clearest history of protecting medicare and social security. i talked about his early support for marriage equality back in the '90s. he was one of the few members of congress that had the courage to stand up in the '90s. and as an openly gay person in congress, it matters to me to see people like bernie sanders with courage that really occurs before we expect it to, especially when it comes to standing up for lgbtq rights. so...

now, he is not a neo-nazi. what he is doing there is he's fetishizing strength. he is not looking to democracy, but this model of absolute strength, and that leads the family into relationships with men like museveni in uganda. before him, their key man for africa was a guy named siad barre of somalia, for whom chuck grassley became a kind of defacto lobbyist as the united states pumped up his military, which he then used to absolutely destroy his country to such an effect that somalia has never recovered and today is a haven for al-qaida, for terrorism, for piracy. it's a lawless nation. the family says that's part of god's plan.

steven taylor, a political science professor at alabama's troy university, agreed that social issues may be a sticking point that many conservative voters aren't able to overcome in voting for jones. in addition to abortion, moore has hammered home his opposition to same-sex marriage and transgender rights.
the 2015 policy had divided the church, and many members felt it punished children. the children of such marriages could only be baptized once they turned 18, and to do so they needed to move out of the household and disavow same-sex cohabitation and marriage. in protest, at least 1,000 members of the faith showed up in salt lake city to formally resign their membership.

what trump has said about him: if he says great things about me, i'm going to say great things about him. i've already said, he is really very much of a leader. i mean, you can say, oh, isn't that a terrible thing — the man has very strong control over a country. now, it's a very different system, and i don't happen to like the system. but certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader. ... he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters....

as a boy, billy did not rebel against that religious discipline, but he was soon attracted to a more raucous form of worship. after attending a few outdoor revival meetings, he decided his christian calling was to be a bible-waving preacher like the ones who came through charlotte in pursuit of lost souls. he subsequently left presbyterianism to affiliate with the southern baptist denomination.

and the policy story side of this is that trump's policy positions were malleable, to be generous. your listeners might remember, terry, he took five different positions on abortion in three days at one point during the campaign. he was talking about abortion, if it's illegal, women should be punished - and then walked back from that and then said the doctor should be punished - and then said the states should have right here - but then said maybe we should just let the law stay as it is.

many who spoke in support of the former judge said moore was being unfairly targeted because he has stood up for christian principles. moore is known for refusing to remove a ten commandments monument he'd had placed in the alabama judicial building rotunda and for ordering state judges to ignore the u.s. supreme court's decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide under the federal constitution — each of which led to his being removed from the bench on separate occasions. other speakers decried the lgbt transgender mafia and said that moore was the enemy of both democratic and republican homosexualists.
the renewed drive to challenge the equality act on religion-based grounds has prompted some faith groups to ramp up support for the legislation. among them are the evangelical lutheran church in america, with nearly 4 million members, the u.s. episcopal church, other mainline protestant denominations and most jewish congregations. all have moved in recent years toward more tolerant positions in areas related to marriage and sexuality.
donald trump didn't do that. there was no reason to expect that he would do anything in a normal way, obviously, at this point. but instead of just allowing hillary clinton the three days of her convention, he takes the podium in doral, miami, at his golf course down there - his golf resort. and holds this freewheeling press conference, as he tended to do from time to time on the campaign. and in it, he called on russia to hack into the emails of hillary clinton, find her missing emails.

ryan: i don't think there's any question. i think that, you know, senator sanders has some support with, like, alexandria ocasio cortez, who's a huge figure in the latino community, and others, you know, i think that have helped. but i think at the end of the day, nothing's going to sharpen everybody's mind like the prospect of removing donald trump from office. and so i think that the coalition and the democratic party and - across the country is going to come together behind joe biden, and we're going to beat donald trump.
greene: that was the president speaking at a rally in north dakota yesterday. now, kennedy was often the court's swing vote, so the person who fills this vacancy could become one of the most influential people in american politics for decades to come. and here to discuss this is carrie severino. she's chief counsel and policy director at the judicial crisis network, which pushes for conservative judicial appointees. welcome back.
gross: so what else do you think we should know about what this story says about c street and the family?
garcia-navarro: so you have these fault lines within the catholic church. and i'm just wondering if you see them playing out politically. i'm particularly interested in the supreme court and biden.
very personally, marjane satrapi's work, persepolis, the graphic novel and the books, really touched me. and i went to see that in the cinema with my mom when it first came out. and it was the first time we saw an iranian woman tell a story that was personal and not braggy. i mean, she's homeless for a while in that story. and it really touched my life. and i think it made my mother see that there was a future for me...
the protests by lgbtq activists that followed stonewall remade the movement, known as the gay movement at the time. it spurred more lesbian, gay and bisexual americans to come out to their families, their communities and actively push for lgbtq civil rights. lgbtq historian lillian faderman points to the formation of the gay liberation front shortly after the uprising, and pride parades a year later to commemorate the protests. those parades now span cities across the country and the world.
meredith, who signed the protocol representing progressive groups, says that he is under complaint from the church for marrying a man, but that his immediate supervisors and his congregation are happy to have him continue to serve as pastor. the protocol immediately puts into effect an abeyance, which means that complaint goes into a drawer where it can collect dust.
we just dumped a bunch of numbers and statistics together and came up with this sort of wacky list of places that are actually more gay than you think, albo tells npr's madeleine brand.
this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. the belief that homosexuality is a sin and that you can be healed of this sin with the help of jesus is the premise of christian gay conversion therapy. the new film the miseducation of cameron post is set in the early '90s at a fictional residential gay conversion therapy program called god's promise where teenagers are sent by their parents or guardians usually against the will of the teenager. once arriving at god's promise, the teens are called disciples and are forced to conform to rigid rules. their communication with the outside world is cut off for several months. and they have to agree that all sexual behavior outside of marriage between a man and a woman is a sin.

it's not the first time conservative christians have weighed in on the issue. last november, the national association of evangelicals called on believers to welcome syrian refugees. that came in the aftermath of the paris attacks as many elected officials — mostly republicans — called for a halt to immigration of those refugees.
it would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves, he wrote.

instead, he doubled down on commitments to these voters in the fall, emphasizing a pledge to appoint supreme court justices in the mold of the late antonin scalia. his first appointee, justice neil gorsuch, was a promise fulfilled.
toobin: his daughter died at age 14 of spina bifida.
gross: this is fresh air, and if you're just joining us, my guest is jane mayer. she's a washington correspondent for the new yorker. her new article is called the president pence delusion, and it's subtitled, trump's critics yearn for his exit. but mike pence, the corporate right's inside man, poses his own dangers.
the argument moore intends to make seems to focus on the influence an anti-moore group called project birmingham had on the election. the washington post broke the story about some of the group's controversial tactics, which included creation of fake accounts to deliver misleading messages on facebook to help buoy jones. it was similar to tactics russians used to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, but this time it was americans behind such a scheme, bankrolled by an internet billionaire. jones has decried the group's tactics and called for a federal investigation into them.
roberts: anybody who did that would be doing it for the purpose of saying we just can't stomach donald trump. and we're giving people an opportunity to vote for neither him nor hillary clinton, knowing that hillary clinton would then win. so the democrats are dying for it to happen. but i think the likelihood is slim to none.
his determination to cooperate with mainline protestants and with roman catholics alienated his fundamentalist friends, said grant wacker, a duke divinity school professor whose book america's pastor: billy graham and the shaping of a nation traces the social and political significance of graham's preaching career. they took great offense that graham was willing to cooperate with the enemy.
he goes to lunch with the president on a regular basis. he attends many of the national security meetings, the principals committee. he's done a lot of foreign policy travel, but he doesn't have a portfolio, and some of the previous vice presidents who i spoke to were kind of baffled about the way he's conducting the job.

the story that got told was that somehow the president had to be dragged along unwillingly, said tobias wolff, who advised obama on lgbt issues during the presidential campaign and after. nothing could be further from the truth.
obergefell v. hodges, the landmark 2015 supreme court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, would have been unthinkable just a generation ago. the public perception of queer people had shifted dramatically: in 1994, most americans thought homosexuality should not be accepted. by 2017, about 70% felt it should.
tur: no. i think i just put it out of my head immediately and kept going. i just chalked it up to donald trump being such a bizarre character. i mean, this is a guy who - his mood swings were wild. on, you know, on one day, he would try to introduce me to a crowd and tell them how great i was as if i was his wife or he'd call me out and say that i was doing great reporting at a rally. and then, you know, a couple days later or a couple weeks later, he would call me a liar from the stage. i mean, he just swung back and forth between these two poles that i just chalked it up as another mood swing.

how much of this trump personally understands or buys into is open to debate. but he has shown a keen desire to court those who take the prophecy at face value and with all their hearts. that courtship has been highly successful, at least so far.

so i don't think this is a term with the kind of big blockbusters, like same-sex marriage or obamacare, that we have seen in recent years. but, you know, terry, one issue that i think everyone should keep an eye on, which will keep coming up in one way or another, is something that is another gorsuch specialty, which is the hobby lobby-type issues, which is basically the issues that arise when religious people or companies owned by religious people say, we don't want to follow the rules that are established for everyone else.

and then there was the president's own, very public evolution on same-sex marriage. when he first ran for president, obama went only as far as supporting civil unions. but after vice president joe biden took the plunge during the re-election campaign four years ago, obama went on national television to announce that he'd changed his mind, too.
martin: so why hasn't he been able to, i mean, not just build a broader coalition of voters but even just repeat the wins that he had in 2016? what's your read on why he lost michigan?

bentley himself resigned earlier this year amid a sex scandal. the optics of him appointing strange, who as the state attorney general was investigating possible misuse of his office to cover up the alleged affair with an aide, greatly hurt strange in the race with moore, according to several local observers.
manson: because so many teachings about sexuality in the church depend on the main teaching here, and that has to do with natural law and the idea that sex must always create life. and if the church in any way deviates from that idea, it has to change its position on a lot of issues, including contraception, including even women priests. that teaching is based on this. so if they change one thing, the whole thing cascades, and i think that's just too overwhelming for them.
mike pence is a polarizing figure in indiana now, she says.
their new alliance comes as the onetime detente between trump and cruz, the two top outsider candidates in the crowded race, has come to an end. in last week's debate, cruz attacked trump over his liberal new york values. and cruz's campaign has been pushing clips of trump previously stating his support for partial-birth abortion and gay marriage. meanwhile, trump has been raising doubts about the canadian-born republican's eligibility.

the unexpected death of justice antonin scalia and the looming face-off between the white house and the senate over his replacement have revived proposals that would limit the tenure of u.s. supreme court justices.
adams: absolutely. we think we we were handling that community in a very sensitive and a very appropriate way, and to have federal - the government insert their efforts into our local school districts and local schools, people are pretty frustrated.
so the men of isis, the men who bought and sold women as a central part of what they did and who they were, you know, come to your neighborhood. and so many of these women had signed up — well before there was an isis — to simply defend their own towns, their own houses, their own neighborhoods in the chaos of the syrian civil war. and then that starts to all morph with the fight against the islamic state. and, you know, many of them said you have a choice of either becoming someone's property or being forced into marriage or taking the fight to these men. and i think at a moment when so many women are rewriting the rules that govern their lives, this was exactly what these women did.
diamond: this is essentially an entire team dedicated to ensuring religious liberty in health care and punishing doctors and hospitals that don't allow workers to express their religious objections. this creation of the team, which we scooped last week, was clearly politically choreographed. there was the march for life in washington where tens of thousands of anti-abortion supporters came to the city. the announcement of this new division was scheduled for a day ahead of that. and then religious leaders at the events were able to tout it and celebrate and say, look what the trump administration is doing to protect religious liberty.
martin: you're saying that there really are probably only around - what did you say - 100,000 members or officers in this country and perhaps a million around the world. how do they sustain themselves as an organization? that is not a large core, particularly given how extensive their network is in this country. how do they sustain themselves? who joins these days?

what he's accused of: a long-time general in the country's military, he rose to power in a bloody coup. some 800 protesters were killed in a single day ... public criticism of the government is squashed ... anti-government protests are banned ... scores of people have been arrested ... privacy rights are routinely violated ... some independent human-rights organizations have been banned; ngo workers could face up to 25 years in prison if they are believed to be working against egypt's national interest ... charges were brought against the country's top anti-corruption official ... forced disappearances ... detainees tortured ... thousands of trials with flimsy evidence ... overcrowding in prisons that have seen forced feedings and isolation ... freedom of speech is repressed — the head of the press syndicate was charged with publishing false news, which threatens public peace. ...

but cuomo still had his eye on new york. he ran for governor in 2002 but failed to win the democratic nomination after remarking that the governor at the time, george pataki, held the leader's coat — that leader being new york city mayor rudy giuliani. cuomo became a pariah, as the new york daily news described it. not long after that he went through a separation from his wife that became fodder for tabloids in 2003.

but that could mean religious schools could face expensive legal fights if they challenge the equality act, according to mcfarland, the seventh-day adventist lawyer.
we don't think judges are the right people to do this, he says. we think the legislative body should draft a law that is in fact constitutional. at stake, according to mcfarland, is the first amendment right to free exercise of religion.

trump himself — who had stood behind moore despite the sexual assault allegations as other groups like the nrsc abandoned him — also echoed similar sentiments last month, tweeting that he holds nothing against roy moore, and unlike many other republican leaders, wanted him to win, but roy moore cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating....judges and supreme court justices!

for now, olsen said, trumpian populism remains a tantalizing promise for people who are interested in it.

given that religious beliefs do change over time, that evolution may be more important than new legislation for the promotion of lgbtq rights.
toobin: well, it was really very similar, except there was - he didn't prepare a list of potential nominees. the white house did that themselves. but certainly, his role was similar when it came to mobilizing the conservative movement in support of president george w. bush's three. remember, it was three nominees to the supreme court. first it was john roberts to replace sandra day o'connor, then chief justice rehnquist died and roberts was named to replace rehnquist.

kurtis: is donald trump a sex monster?
toobin: well, that's really the story that i wrote in the new yorker is how leonard leo, this really - this person who has never held government office, who's never been a law professor, who doesn't give speeches, who doesn't, you know, write books, how he of all people in the world became, in effect, the guy who picked supreme court justices for republican presidents. and it's really the story of the growth of the federalist society, which is, you know, it's interesting. a lot of democrats, when they talk about the federalist society, they make it sound like it's something out of the da vinci code, like it's some secret cabal. there's nothing secret about the federalist society. it is a group that - it was originally started by law students who felt that there was too much liberal influence on law school campuses and faculties. so they started holding meetings, and they started bringing in guest speakers. and it expanded dramatically in the '80s under the reagan presidency.
what trump has said about him: at a very young age, he was able to assume power. a lot of people, i'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. and he was able to do it. so obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie. (april 30, cbs)

democrats in the senate have been unable to slow down or block judicial nominees at every level, starting with the party-line vote in the spring to abolish the filibuster for supreme court nominees, followed by the swift confirmation of trump nominee neil gorsuch to the supreme court.
while most americans don't pay much attention to nominations to the federal courts, wheeler notes that a strong part of the republican party base, more so than the democratic base, are tuned into judges. there is a small group of people for whom this means an awful lot, he observes.

that's when a federal judge struck down alabama's ban on same-sex marriage. the state's then-chief justice roy moore told local officials they weren't bound by the federal court ruling. that threw alabama's marriage license system into chaos. some offices closed altogether.
at a very young age, i knew i wanted to be a lawyer. and mostly because the heroes among many of the civil rights movements were the lawyers. these individuals who understood the skill of the profession of law to translate the passion from the streets to courtrooms of our country and do the work that we know must constantly be done of reminding people of that promise we articulated in 1776, that we're all equal and should be treated that way.
toobin: oh, absolutely. all his friends told me that, that this is a child with a very substantial disability, spina bifida, as well as other medical problems. and the notion that a child with genetic disorders that could be identified in the womb, the idea that a woman could terminate that pregnancy, is anathema to him. and i think that is not just an abstract belief. i think out of the love of his daughter and the love of his son, who was also afflicted with spina bifida, is something that shaped his views. you know, of course, the real issue with abortion, of course, is who decides. you know, if leonard leo and his family believe that no fetus should be aborted, that of course is fine. supporters of abortion rights believe that that decision shouldn't be up to leonard leo or his judges or his government. it should be up to the women who are facing that decision.

this is where the water gets a little deep, so we won't wade in too far. but suffice it to say that at some point in time, according to various passages in the bible, jews will be in possession of jerusalem and a new temple will be erected. thereafter will come the antichrist and a period to be known as the tribulation. it gets harrowing, but, cutting to the chase, christ himself will return to earth in triumph and glory and all true believers will be united with him in heaven.
if you remember what happened with immigration reform, there was a bipartisan bill in the senate, but it went nowhere in the house. so what's the difference between the senate and the house? in the house, republicans especially are only responsible for members in these very small districts that have been gerrymandered to be homogeneous, so they have very little incentive to go anywhere that's going to be risky for the group of white, middle-class constituents that they have.

from the rowman & littlefield book description: drawing on established scholarship on the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality, asian american sexual politics shows how power dynamics shape the lives of young asian americans today. asian-american women are often constructed as hyper-sexual docile bodies, while asian-american men are often racially 'castrated.' the book's interview excerpts show the range of frames through which asian americans approach the world, as well as the counter-frames they construct. in the final chapter, author rosalind s. chou offers strategies for countering racialized and sexualized oppression.

those are the question that need to be asked. and those questions, i think, have even started occurring, or occurring even more strongly, within the christian right itself. and i thought one of the most promising developments of this to come out of the scandal was a christian right magazine called world magazine - hard christian right. this is probably the leading christian right magazine in america. and they looked at what was being said about the family - said we've got to check into this. and they did one of the best investigative reports. they confirmed the overseas travel. they confirmed the strange theology of seeking out dictators. they went further than i had in looking at some of the financial connections that don't seem to quite add up, the policy of secrecy and so on. and this is coming from a christian right source. and i think what that does is it moves this whole conversation out of the old left-right debate and moves it where it should be, into the public square where we're talking about transparency, we're talking about accountability, we're talking about politicians taking responsibility for the ideas that shape them and that they put into effect. and those are matters that i think pretty much everybody, left and right, agrees on. and i think the result of all this, the pressure that happens from these local reporters, and from the christian right corners, and maybe from my book is to force the family to start answering questions about itself.
but even before the accusations of sexual assault surfaced, moore was a controversial figure in alabama politics who narrowly won election in the past and lost nominations for governor. he is a former alabama supreme court chief justice who was twice removed from the bench, the first time for refusing to remove a statue of the ten commandments he'd had erected in the state judiciary building. later, he was re-elected to the court but then suspended after he directed state judges to ignore the u.s. supreme court's 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.

i've watched this man up close. i've seen what he's made of. let me tell you something about mike pence. this is a man of solid character, ryan said.
the answer to that depends in part on what the supreme court decides in those three upcoming cases related to lgbtq people and employment discrimination: altitude express v. zarda; bostock v. clayton county; and r.g. & g.r. harris funeral homes inc. v. equal employment opportunity commission. oral arguments in those cases were heard in october 2019.
speaking of groups with histories of discrimination, lgbtq were also more likely than straight people to think that african-americans experienced discrimination.
in october of 2017, then attorney general jeff sessions issued a memo that the u.s. department of justice would no longer argue in court that transgender people are federally protected from employment discrimination. by that point, buchert had packed up her belongings and moved to washington d.c. to work for lambda legal on lgbtq federal policy and litigation, so she could be in the fight.

donna mclaughlin: we have a 5-year-old and an 18-month-old. the 5-year-old daughter is just really thrilled that we're doing this. and it's something we had never really thought would happen.
elving: the house freedom caucus - that's the hard-core conservatives - could not be mollified even after they got a vote on their own preferred bill and lost the previous week. they weren't reconciled. they have firmly held out, saying that any kind of amnesty for the people who were brought here as minors by their parents - anything of that nature was unacceptable. and the further that the leaders went in trying to get them onboard, the more they lost the moderates, the house members from districts more supportive of immigrants and immigration. and that dynamic has been enough to interfere with even routine and unrelated business like the farm bill that got voted down and then passed by just two votes.
multiple women have now come forward accusing moore of sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, from when most of them were teenagers decades ago. the reporting of allegations began one week ago when the washington post spoke to a woman, leigh corfman, who said that when she was 14 and moore was in his 30s and then a local assistant district attorney, he pursued her romantically and initiated sexual contact with her.

i've been pretty impressed with how he's dealt with trying to convey accurate information to not just the people of new york state but specifically the people in new york city, says christina greer, an associate professor of political science at fordham university.
roberts: well, his - he points to polls that show that - that he is running ahead of clinton against trump. the reason, however, that he doesn't bring it up is that nobody has done any negative campaigning against him. there have been no negative ads against bernie sanders. nobody has gone back and looked at his somewhat colorful past. and no one has really examined his policies in-depth.
there's no need for these high-caliber rifles that pierce through walls, evans says. people can say they use them for hunting or whatever, but why do you need a weapon with such high caliber that it would pierce through the animal and like eight trees behind it?
the ban had undergone several revisions since its chaotic introduction just days into trump's presidency, but each one had been rejected by lower courts as either illegal or unconstitutional.
gross: and - but his daughter died as a result of the (unintelligible).
and so i was talking about his tone, and i guess i came off as relatively generous toward donald trump compared to my previous reporting because donald trump walks in and he barrels in and the first thing he sees is me standing off to the side. and he comes right up to me, and he kisses me on the cheek, just puts his hands on my shoulders and pulls me in before i could do anything. i was powerless. i just stood there frozen thinking, oh, my god, what is this man doing? he's not my friend. he's not my business partner. he's not a social acquaintance. he's not a family member of mine. this is somebody i am covering. this is a presidential candidate. i am the reporter assigned to this beat. that is just - it crosses a huge line. it's so unprofessional and so inappropriate given the circumstances.
rebecca haven: (singing) oh, we need a human revolution. the '60s just were not good enough.
when i was living with the family, which is sort of how i came to this whole story is by sort of reporting from within the group, stupak was spoken of quite often as an ally of joe pitts; these are two guys who work well together, and as a guy who was a mentor to a lot of younger members of the family.
many people say in fact that they're puzzled about the appeal of donald trump, especially to professing christians. the fact is, he has racked up many votes and endorsements from leaders. for example, on super tuesday, every state that trump won, he received the majority of the evangelical vote. what do you think the appeal is?
the first impulse of hillary clinton or barack obama is to take rights away from law-abiding citizens, said bush. that's always what they do, whether it's the san bernardino terrorist attack or these tragedies that take place. i think we ought to focus on what the bigger issue is. it isn't law-abiding gun owners.
the teenage high school activists who have been organizing since the florida shooting, they say, are part of a separate group some call generation z. pollsters generally don't count the views of those under 18, so there probably won't be national polling on this group until more of these young people are officially adults.
gross: would there be, like, official consequences for that?
it's such a dark, violent play, full of monsters and magic and revenge, and then — in the last few minutes! — it turns on a dime. suddenly, it's all is forgiven! everything's jake! let's get married! this tonal whiplash is funnier than anything that's gone before, but it's so dang giddy, it can't help but win you over.
i just think it cheapens the value of the most sacred relationship in the world, says republican phil williams, the lone senator to vote against the bill.

it is unusual to see a new justice's ideological footprints so clearly in his first year or two on the high court. indeed, most new justices, including those with long careers on the lower courts, are somewhat hesitant at first. they understand that the supreme court's word is the final word, and that looking at issues from this new perspective is somewhat different from the perspective of a lower court judge, whose job is to carry out the mandates of a higher court.
barry: well, i couldn't have because i just wouldn't have known anything, but my lovely son, toby, just a few years ago - he was only 16, and i was just beginning the book - became very, very unhappy. and, you know, when our young men become unhappy, you know, we've got to mobilize ourselves. you've got to really try and find out. i mean, in a way, you can't ask directly because that could be more distressing. you've got to be kind of super sherlock holmes of this unhappiness - could be something tiny, could be something huge.
gross: give us an example of what kind of laws and decisions we'd be talking about.
martin: that is the reverend asa lee. he's associate dean for community life at wesley theological seminary in washington. reverend lee, thank you so much for speaking with us.
palin is expected to be an important surrogate for trump and will campaign with him wednesday in iowa and oklahoma.
still, 22-year-old jeremy grunden of harrington, del., says he is encouraged to hear that millennials are less likely to support banning assault-style weapons.
by the time of his death, billy graham had been out of the public eye for so many years that the younger evangelical generation had grown up without direct exposure to his ministry, and for many he was a relative stranger. franklin graham had taken his father's place.
surveys suggest that most catholics voted for trump in the last election, and many continue to support him. the group catholicvote.org hosted a friendly town hall last week with mick mulvaney, trump's former chief of staff and a devout catholic. one of the program hosts, former republican congressman tim huelskamp, asked mulvaney what guidance he had for those catholics considering whom to support in the fall election.
gallagher: (as reverend rick) yeah, a gay bar of all places. two men from my church came in. they saw my car parked outside, and they knew i'd been struggling. so they came in looking for me.
and i give you my word, if i am elected president, no serviceman or servicewoman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men and women will feel the full force and fury of the united states of america, cruz said.
do you think your mom would want you to run for president?
the catholic church and the archdiocese of milwaukee are not endorsing the rally and are in no way affiliated to or sponsoring this event or campaign locally, statewide, or nationally, listecki said. the mission of the church is religious, not political.
martin: how will you teach about bishop long's ministry going forward?
it's only been a little over a decade that our own movement has come to understand homosexuality and gender identity in different ways, says rabbi jacob blumenthal, ceo of the rabbinical assembly, an international association of rabbis in the conservative tradition.
rendon and newsom haven't always seen eye to eye. asked about newsom's ambitious agenda, rendon says that compared to brown — who focused on climate change, fiscal stability and criminal justice reform — the new governor has a wider range of policy interests.
she would not talk about specific allegations, citing personnel policy, but generally acknowledges there's work ahead.

majorities also say they have personally experienced slurs or insensitive or offensive comments or negative assumptions about their sexual orientation. and 34 percent say they or an lgbtq friend or family member has been verbally harassed in the bathroom when entering or while using a bathroom — or has been told or asked if they were using the wrong bathroom.
presumptive gop nominee donald trump appeared today for the first time with his vice presidential running mate, indiana gov. mike pence. pence brings a popularity with the base that could help trump.
i believe an agenda for black americans needs to include five things that all of us care about: homeownership, entrepreneurship, education, health and justice, the mayor of south bend, ind., told the audience at the national action network's conference.
gross: my guests are desiree akhavan, who directed and co-wrote the new film the miseducation of cameron post, and emily danforth, who wrote the novel the film is adapted from. we'll talk more after a break. this is fresh air.
update at 7:46 p.m. et. on climate change:
but justice gorsuch seems both sure-footed and sure of himself and his views. though he was confirmed in time to hear only the final two weeks of the term's oral arguments, his votes and opinions in those cases — and others that the court has disposed of since he was sworn in — paint a vivid picture of a justice on the far right of the current supreme court bench.
neal brennan: you can't see it, but during that entire applause i was waving.
you can find several versions streaming on broadway.tv, itunes and other streaming services.
i think there are candidates who are way too far afield and who haven't won races, or who haven't won a statewide race, he said. maybe they need to sort of prove that out in order to be able to gain further confidence.
tulsi gabbard, the hawaii u.s. representative and iraq war veteran who has stirred controversy within her own party, is suspending her bid for the white house.
just to be clear, our question was about the approximately 11 million people in the country illegally. our question is: what is the best way to deal with this group of people? should we:
[if] homosexual sex within marriage is wrong and heterosexual sex within marriage is great, we're not treating 'immoral conduct in heterosexual or homosexual relationships...in the same way,'  as one person noted on twitter.
this is obviously a moment fraught with challenges, throughout our entire catholic church certainly, but nowhere more so than this local faith community, said gregory on thursday. i would be naïve not to acknowledge the unique task that awaits us.
buchert describes the reversals as hurtful and infuriating. she adds that the administration has also, in her view, appointed many anti-lgbtq judges, and has made moves to stop collecting data on lgbtq people in a drive to erase lgbt people from from the record. evidence for those charges was detailed in a report last year by the sunlight foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that advocates for openness in government.
elliott: so that trial is coming up later this year. and in the meantime, as we said, he has been removed. he's suspended pending that trial.
gross: and you're wondering, like, why did you take this dog? so here's the scene. you speak first.
the point of life tenure is to keep justices insulated from politics, said george washington university law professor orin kerr. that didn't quite pan out.
still, as the state's first lady, hillary started the home instruction for parents of preschool youngsters program, a popular early education program that continues to have bipartisan support today.

two of the cases — bostock v. clayton county, georgia, and altitude express, inc. v. zarda — were consolidated because both include claims that employers discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. a third — r.g. & g.r. harris funeral homes v. eeoc — involves the question of whether existing discrimination laws apply to transgender workers.
the army national guard veteran added that biden's late son, beau, a fellow member of the guard, was a friend.
trade means jobs, but trade also means security. the time has come for all of us to urge the swift adoption of the trans pacific partnership — governor mike pence (@govpencein) september 8, 2014
clinton knows, he repeated over and over. and trump has no clue, he said.
justice antonin scalia, who wrote the decision, made a crucial point: male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil congress was concerned with when it enacted title vii. but statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws, rather than the principal concerns of our legislators, by which we are governed.
gross: so, emily, my last question for you. what is it like to see this...
they know they can't beat me any other way, riggleman said. anywhere else, that would be called bribery.
jones: today we have more than two-thirds of the country saying they know someone who is gay or lesbian and about a little more than 1 in 10 saying they know someone who's transgender.
mccammon: nominating pence, a governor with experience in congress, could also help trump with the party's establishment, who frequently urged him to watch his tone. but even in this speech, the real estate developer displayed his tendency to follow no script but his own, often drifting from his prepared remarks as he praised his running mate's economic record.
there have always been two parts to the republican party's message: conservative social issues for its white, blue-collar, evangelical base (think school prayer, abortion, same-sex marriage, immigration and crime) and a supply-side, trickle-down economic message for the rich and corporations. trump has taken this two-pronged approach and put it on steroids.
at national prayer breakfast, trump pledges, 'i will never let you down'
toward the end of his own speech, obama tied together all of the big themes of this election: trump, he said, doesn't adhere to that common creed. clinton, on the other hand, does, he argued.
margot adler: after years of raids on gay bars and years of beatings in the street, this was the night that gay people pushed back.
martin: so, tell us about how the salvation army started.
while the resolution didn't mention gay and lesbian victims, outgoing sbc president ronnie floyd said in an address to attendees that an attack against gay americans in orlando is an attack against each one of us, adding that christians should oppose violence and bigotry against anyone in this world, according to minutes kept by baptist press.
gross: this is fresh air. and if you're just joining us, my guest is jane mayer. she's a washington correspondent for the new yorker magazine. her new article is about vice president mike pence and his political background, his ideology and his place in the white house today. the article is called the president pence delusion. and it's titled that because it's about, well, what kind of president would mike pence make if, for some reason, president trump left office?
gorsuch, thomas and alito would have let the modified trump travel ban go into effect in its entirety, while six justices, including the chief justice and kennedy, issued a compromise ruling that allowed the executive order to go into effect with certain conditions. until the court reviews the order more fully in october, the six said that the modified ban cannot be applied to foreign nationals who have a credible claim of bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states.
i have two guests. desiree akhavan directed and co-wrote the new film. emily danforth wrote the young adult novel the film was adapted from. the novel, also called the miseducation of cameron post, was first published in 2012.
i would resent it, too, if i was the legislature, brown told kqed, insisting he never said that. the governor said he expected legislators would push back against the next governor in ways they did not with him.
defying a precedent set nearly seven decades earlier, the justices in the majority defined the amendment as saying individuals — and not just groups — enjoy the right to bear arms.

izurieta: ...over 800 hatchlings for the...
tur: it was really difficult because this came out of nowhere. they had been doing really well. they were on top of their game. we would go to restaurants and we'd hear people talking about my dad, and they would have no idea who my dad was because my dad's face was never on television. i mean, they were, you know, a part of the fabric of los angeles. and it changed in an instant. they lost their business. they were difficult to work with. and kcbs, who they were working with at the time, got a chance to hire their employees out from underneath them and find a different helicopter to use. and so it undercut our entire business, and suddenly we were massively in debt. they weren't the kind of people who saved a lot of money.
joe biden wants americans to think of him as the presumptive democratic nominee against donald trump, and after last night, he does have a stronger case. biden one in four out of six primary contests, including michigan, where 125 delegates were up for grabs. the results narrow the path to the nomination for bernie sanders. he went home to vermont last night, and that is where we find npr's scott detrow, who's been traveling with the campaign. hi, scott.
tonight's results are clear — the people of alabama deemed roy moore unfit to serve in the u.s. senate, gardner said in a statement soon after jones was declared the winner. i hope senator-elect doug jones will do the right thing and truly represent alabama by choosing to vote with the senate republican majority.
gov. asa hutchinson, a republican, is staying out of the fray. hutchinson says the decision is up to the airport commission, although he emphasized that arkansas remains proud of the clintons.
by the 1990s, the bgea was run by franklin graham, billy's designated successor, and franklin's views differed sharply from his father's. franklin called islam a very evil and wicked religion, something his more temperate father never would have said. at a rally in 2003, shortly after the united states invaded iraq, billy graham noted that christianity shared a middle eastern homeland with islam.
gjelten: over these years, more and more lgbt people have come out publicly.
folks, you cannot believe one word that comes out of donald trump's mouth, he said.
moore, however, didn't have any regrets about standing by his beliefs.
a fox news poll released thursday evening showed jones leading moore by 8 points, 50 percent to 42 percent. jones was also the preferred candidate of women voters by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 58 percent to 32 percent. a poll commissioned by the nrsc earlier this week showed moore's support collapsing as he trailed jones by 12 points, while other polls have shown a much closer race.
bill kurtis: meet our nato allies.
brennan: i - yeah, i get it and i love it.
salie: i mean - it's real.
gross: ...and giving them, like, gay and lesbian roommates. and it's like, maybe that's not the finest way of going about it. (laughter).
akhavan: people always ask me. like, i get a lot of questions about this, and it's like don't forget these are all teenagers. it was a set of teens, and it's not my place to ask them who they prefer. and i think when people make assumptions about young actors, that's a bit toxic and gossipy. it's not my place. i care a lot that my hods, my heads of department, are female. i care that my collaborators are queer. i want to create an environment where my work has authenticity. that matters to me, and that's within my control. but i think it's really strange to make assumptions about an actor's sexuality. in terms of gender, i think there's a lot to be said about casting trans actors in trans roles or seeing trans actors for cis roles. that's a debate i want to engage in, but i can't quite put my finger, you know, on a 19-year-old's sexuality and nor would i want to approach that.
tur: i remember in the moment...
after allegations of a toxic workplace culture that discriminates against women and people of color, the southern poverty law center is trying to emerge and chart a way forward. turmoil in the civil rights organization last month resulted in the firing of its famous founder and the resignations of its longtime president and legal director.
meredith says the protocol speaks to where he believes the united methodist church is called to go. he referenced a banner outside his church that reads, no matter what the politician, the tv preacher, your income, your diagnosis, your documents, your relationship says about you, you're a beloved child of god.
he devoted much of his speech instead to other issues important to conservative christians, from religious liberty to abortion. he praised vice president pence's wife, karen, for teaching at a conservative christian school that requires its staff to declare a belief in marriage as the uniting of one man and one woman, and he pledged support for a government-funded catholic adoption agency in michigan that faces an aclu lawsuit over its refusal to place children with same-sex couples.
it could mean winning over skeptical voters like francis byrd, a financial analyst from brooklyn. to him, buttigieg is too inexperienced to be running.
prof. winston: no, from the very start, booth was ready and willing to go with the army metaphor. in fact, he was even called the general before this happened. so, you know, that was where he was at.
in the long run, olsen doesn't think this trumpist combination of trickle-down economics and white-identity policies offers a viable path for the gop.
green: this administration has a strong base especially among white conservative voters who identify as evangelical or born-again christians and catholics. and among these groups, religious liberty is a huge concern. they tend to think of religious liberty in the context of, for example, objection to transgender identity, objection to same-sex marriage, objection to birth control or abortion. and so we see those types of priorities being elevated under the trump administration across agencies.
adler: they say dress like a boy when you come home.
the poll, conducted earlier this year, looked not only at violence and harassment but also at a wide range of discrimination experiences. we asked about discrimination in employment, education, in their interactions with police and the courts and in their everyday lives in their own neighborhoods. we're breaking out the results by race, ethnicity and identity. you can find what we've released so far on our series page you, me and them: experiencing discrimination in america.
irma thomas: (singing) you can blame me, try to shame me, and still i'll care for you. you can run around, even put me down, still i'll be there for you. the world may think i'm foolish. they can't see you like i can. oh, but anyone who knows what love is will understand.
how did your family treat you?
those laws often defined religious belief quite broadly. supporters of such bills could argue — as douglas laycock of the university of virginia did last year, talking to npr's jennifer ludden — that religious freedom laws have a range of applications.
soerens says donald trump's proposal to bar immigration from countries with a proven history of terrorism would likely keep out christians and other religious minorities as well.
johnson: yeah - who he loves very much and very authentically, but it gets confusing when he meets this kid elliott who he's also attracted to. and i think what is sort of at least fresh to me about the story was that alex's conflicts are not so much external. you know, he goes to a pretty progressive high school. it's not like, you know, he's going to get beat up if he comes out of the closet. so the conflict becomes internal. it becomes what am i really into? it's ok to date boys now in high school. it's ok to date girls. so it's all on me. where do i fall into all of this? and that's kind of what the movie is about.
trump: besides that, bobby knight, my friend who really did help me - i mean, if you want to reference bobby knight in indiana, we love bobby knight. but he agrees with everything i'm saying. he loves the governor.
this isn't one of those things.
akhavan: if it was, it wasn't a very good one.
but the senate's top democrat argued wednesday that kennedy's replacement should not be considered during this midterms year, citing the course senate republicans pursued in refusing to consider garland.
diamond: ...while also watching price's plane come in for a landing at dulles. but i guess the backstory is at politico, we believe in covering every agency like it's a mini-white house. i'm a health care reporter, so that means digging into key leaders of the health department - hhs - just like white house reporters dug into michael flynn or steve bannon or gary cohn. so tom price, obviously, someone that we're going to track and follow - it was actually very hard to track him in his early months because his staff did not put out his schedule and often wouldn't tell people where he was or what he was doing until a few days after it happened.
now it is time to move on to our final game, lightning fill in the blank. each of our players will have 60 seconds in which to answer as many fill-in-the-blank questions as he or she can. each correct answer now worth two points. bill, can you give us the scores?
and what made you change? why did you want to do something different now?
prof. winston: so, it was almost a youth crusade. it was for young people who missed the civil war and who wanted to make a difference in the world. and they would often defy their parents by joining because nice, normal, middle-class and upper-middle-class people just thought salvation army parading around the streets, playing brass bands and wearing these kooky uniforms - it just didn't seem christian to them.
ermold told newsweek that he wants to send a message to people who have been discriminated against. we need to not just symbolize. we need to send a message out to all these people saying it's ok, ermold said. you are important.
gross: so mike pence has a very difficult time in indiana, in part because of the religious freedom restoration act. it hurts his career politically, and then he becomes vice president. how has he chosen to run with donald trump on the ticket?
gross: ...as in marco rubio, yeah.
higgins: then diego joined the conservation program from his home in san diego and got busy. paternity tests indicate that diego is responsible for about 40% of the tortoise babies born. but that wasn't even the record. james p. gibbs, a syracuse professor of environmental and forest biology, said another more reserved, less charismatic male, e5...
this week, mississippi lawmakers approved a bill called the protecting freedom of conscience from government discrimination act.
to this day, it remains unclear what the newspaper's reporting uncovered.
to the extent it has any impact at all, in the first year or two, it will probably be a positive one for most people. their taxes will go down, and they'll be able to keep more of their own money.
diamond: we spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the best vantage points would be. i remember calling the hotline for reporters who have legal questions about what was allowed and where. i talked to a lawyer. where could we be? could we take photos? is it within our right if we approached tom price if we saw him walking? and dulles turned out to be an interesting vantage point because the charter jet terminal is kind of off to the side - for listeners who maybe have been to the main dulles terminal, it's kind of this big retro-future building. the charter jet terminal's a few hundred feet to the side of it, and there's a side road that kind of leads up to it.
biden: the turnout's turned out for us.
it just sounds undemocratic, said gabe roth, executive director of an advocacy group called fix the court, about the lifetime court appointments. there's definitely concern about the justices being out of touch. there have been a number of cases with modern technology, whether it be smartphones or bulk data collection or different types of ways of getting tv over the airwaves or over the internet.
how one man brought justices roberts, alito and gorsuch to the supreme court
you think democrats don't want school lunch money going to religious schools? really? once they study the unintended or intended consequences, they're going to want amendments, she says. we're going to have democrats who say, 'i've got religious people. i've got christian colleges. i've got yeshivas. i've got latter-day saints, seventh-day adventists. and i'm not going to pass a draconian bill.' 
how political campaigns are using 'geofencing' technology to target catholics at mass
progressive catholics and others who want to keep their church out of politics were dismayed. in an editorial, the national catholic reporter called the exchange between dolan and the president cringe-worthy.
that message is not what president trump wants catholics to hear, however. although the milwaukee rally was postponed because of the coronavirus epidemic, the campaign proceeded with an online appeal to catholic voters, and the effort to win their support remains a top priority.
trump: it's amazing, probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the gsa, general services.
between 2014 and 2019, the number of americans alarmed about climate change nearly tripled, according to the yale program on climate change communication. the pew research center notes a similar recent rise in concern, mostly among democrats, but also republican millennials and some independents.
danforth: absolutely. and that's so much a part of the novel. again, when it was set is that cam doesn't know any other - certainly out queer kids, right? i mean, she's desperately querying any sort of film that she can get her hands on from the local video store that might have some kind of like hint of sapphic attraction in it. i mean, and so the idea that she's like finally meeting queer kids even though it's in the space where they're being told that what they are is a sin and they need to eradicate it, i think it's really powerful. i mean, i didn't know a single out person until i got to college. i mean, obviously, there were queer people in my town, but i did not know anyone who was out.
the most recent pew survey on climate found 90% of democrats think the u.s government is doing too little on climate change. that's compared with 40% of republicans.
mr. sharlet: well, there are a lot of just plain old sad details: doug hampton telling us that john ensign, even when confronted this, told hampton he's going to continue to pursue hampton's wife and that, you know, essentially nothing can stop him. hampton's description of his attempts to work through this c street and the family, which he really respected, to hold ensign accountable. hampton's, really, attempt to do the right thing, and especially according to the ideas that the family promotes: this idea of personal accountability and the reality that the family interpreted that accountability as - they interpret it in financial terms, senator tom coburn saying one thing and then another about the transfer of funds from ensign to hampton's family. hampton really just, i think, i have sort of a newfound respect for him after last night because it does seem like he's sort of seeking transparency on this whole thing.
for individuals and private companies, they include guiding, instructing or raising a foster child in accordance with those three beliefs; refusing to give counseling, fertility services or transition-related medical care; declining to provide wedding-related business services; and establishing sex-specific dress codes and having sex-segregated restrooms and other facilities.
the coronavirus is highly contagious, and people gathered in church may engage in behavior, including singing, that is especially conducive to the spread of the virus. in several instances, outbreaks have been traced to a single religious gathering.
an upset in trump country: democrat doug jones bests roy moore in alabama
cornish: now, you report that, using geofencing, catholicvote has already identified some 200,000 catholics in wisconsin, which of course is a key state heading into 2020. they're able to discover that half of those mass-goers are not registered to vote. help us understand, from there, how does this give them the advantage, so to speak?
running against roy moore: can doug jones win over alabama's weary voters?
margaret marshall: i had a sense it would be momentous in massachusetts.
how did writing this book change you?
mcevers: from there, strange went on to sue the obama administration with other republican attorneys general, fighting the affordable care act, environmental regulations and transgender bathroom directives. then alabama's governor tapped strange to fill the senate seat that jeff sessions left when he joined the trump administration.
klein: b, he was sued by the other mike rowe for his web series, really, really dirty jobs; or c, he regularly made small insults to marginalized groups? you know, mike rowe aggressions.
sasha buchert clearly remembers the relief she felt when that guidance came out. at the time, she was an attorney with the transgender law center in oakland, calif., tracking these issues closely, and watching as the country became consumed with what the new york times editorial board referred to as trans bathroom hysteria.
both developments have fueled new controversy in the courts.
in their joint interview with npr, the two times journalists say they believe boies was genuinely aghast at the texts they showed him.
prof. winston: in 1893 in san francisco, joe mcphee(ph), who worked for the army, wanted to have a christmas banquet. but he didn't have a lot of money. so, he was on the docks and he saw the fishermen in their kettles, and he had a great idea. he grabbed a kettle, he put it on a tripod, and he started ringing a bell and saying, keep the pot boiling, keep the pot boiling. and the idea just took off.
sagal: on tuesday, pioneering gay rights activist edith windsor, whose supreme court challenge overturned the blank act, passed away at the age of 88.

for the past half-century, until justice scalia's death, the supreme court has had a majority of republican-nominated justices, with a 5-to-4 conservative majority prevailing for decades in the majority of closely divided cases. a conservative filling the scalia vacancy would return the court to that narrow, 5-to-4 conservative domination. but with as many as three more vacancies possible in the next four years, that conservative domination could become overwhelming for generations to come.

this dissertation took place between 2010 and 2012 as a three-stage research project aimed at exploring race and racism as a feature in the sexual and romantic lives of gay and bisexual men in australia. the author writes, across stages, it was clear that race is a salient but often unrecognised aspect of people's romantic and sexual interactions, a subtle prejudice that is enacted and felt even if it cannot be readily identified. although many men were ambivalent towards racialised partner discrimination, i found many striking similarities between discriminating among partners on the basis of race and other more general expressions of racism. indeed, some men were highly suspicious of anything that might impede an individual's 'sexual freedom', although arguments of individual liberty fail to recognise that sexual racism is the antithesis of individual thought and freedom.

there were personal connections, however, between the russian government and the nra. a woman, maria butina, and her mentor, russian politician alexander torshin, both made efforts to develop ties at the highest levels of the nra.
and people began to take a closer look at it, and they realized the implications of this bill. and what was so interesting to me was among the opponents, it wasn't just the gay rights activists, though they were, of course, very involved. and it wasn't just sort of civil libertarians. and it wasn't just democrats. it was the republican business establishment in indiana just was in an uproar because this legislation was so reactionary and so discriminatory that it began to give indiana a black eye all cross the country.

since september, the constitution hasn't changed, but the poll numbers have. and i recognize that donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in iowa, cruz continued. i've spent my entire life defending the constitution before the u.s. supreme court, and i tell you, i'm not going to be taking legal advice from donald trump.
so this time, the president will make his choice knowing that he needs only to get a majority of the republican-controlled senate to approve his nominee. and mcconnell has proven adept at keeping his troops in line on judicial nominations.

we did a podcast episode that featured this couple from montana. they were both retirement age, so they weren't working anymore, and the town they lived in was 96 percent white. and the biggest voting issue for them was immigration — even though they weren't competing with anyone for jobs and they lived in a place where there were no immigrants.
there is a lingering discontent in the country that is much more than racial resentment, olsen said. the working-class voters who voted for obama and then for trump were not motivated only by race.
right after the election, i remember just two or three days into the trump transition, there was a change on the transition website that included language about imposing new conscience protections or making sure that life begins at conception, that that was a element that needed to be protected. those weren't issues that trump as a candidate ran on, but those are issues that have influenced what his health department has pursued.
after trump's election, activists on both sides of the issue wondered how his administration might treat legal claims of religious liberty, a phrase that has been invoked by those who oppose lgbtq discrimination protections and, in many cases, gay marriage — and who say that adjusting to new federal laws requires them to compromise their beliefs.
for cuomo, the coronavirus pandemic now presents a whole new type of challenge.
the trump administration is looking to, again, broaden the ability of pharmacists, of others to object to care. there's still - i want to be clear - there's still a law on the books that if i show up to an emergency room and i've got an emergency condition, the doctor has to treat me no matter what - or the hospital has to treat me no matter what, based on just the need to be stabilized as an emergency patient.

lyrically blue communicates both the cool of joan didion and the rawness of sylvia plath, and reminds us that emotional writing is only powerful when it is punishingly precise. the way mitchell made the album was also revolutionary: she produced the sessions herself, directing a small band that included rival/peers like james taylor (one of several lovers honored and exposed by her observations) and stephen stills. mitchell would travel much farther on the lonely road she identifies in all i want, but blue is her crossroads, where she bests her devils and invents a mode of expression that every singer-songwriter must master, but none can truly imitate. —ann powers (npr music)

in the short run, trump will have more than 100 other judicial nominations to make to the lower federal courts. there are 103 judicial vacancies on the federal trial and appellate courts, or roughly an eighth of the entire federal judiciary. there are 59 pending obama nominations to fill a majority of those seats, but republicans have been artful about slow-walking these obama lower court appointments, and the republican senate has confirmed only 11 judges since the beginning of the year. now all of those pending appointments will die.

toobin: well, i think there are a combination of reasons. in part, he is an originalist. he - in the mold of justice scalia and in simple terms, he thinks that the constitution should be interpreted as the meaning of the words were by the framers of the constitution so that if the - james madison didn't think he was establishing a woman's right to choose an abortion and if the authors of the 14th amendment didn't think they were - the meaning of the words then did not establish a right to an abortion, the constitution should never recognize it and the constitution should be frozen in amber in that way. and so in that respect, i think leo believes that the constitution simply does not recognize the right to an abortion.

the risk for those party activists, kondik said, is that good could be a less attractive candidate in the general election. kondik said republicans already have an uphill climb retaking the house of representatives. if the gop has to spend money to boost good in a district that trump won by 13 points, he thinks that climb could be even steeper.

many of us democrats are uncomfortable talking publicly about our faith, coons said. as a result, a lot of younger americans associate christianity and public professions of faith with some of the most politically conservative and theologically conservative views. but some of the most progressive senators are actively worshiping christians. they just don't talk about it. i think that's one of the things i'm able to contribute here in washington.

trump supporters on the religious right sometimes point to trump antecedents in the bible, where the lord used one imperfect vessel after another to work his will. one was the persian conqueror cyrus, who allowed some of the judeans captive in his country to return home and rebuild the temple of solomon around the year 500 b.c.

trump and pence face divide on women's health and lgbt issues
indiana's alternative to medicaid expansion is proving to be a huge success. @jgfortwayne read about it here: https://t.co/ffnujojl2m — mike pence (@mike_pence) june 16, 2015
mayer: so this was when pence was in congress in 2009. he really did the kochs a big favor. there was legislation pending that might have put a tax on carbon pollution, and it would have been terrible for koch industries. and pence took up the cause and tried to help defeat that legislation and specifically carried around a pledge that the kochs had created, trying to get people to sign it. and after he was successful in that, the kochs invited him to come to their secret donor summits. and at that point on, they started showering him in money. so it was - it's really became a working relationship then. and i hadn't realized that until recently.

it deeply concerns me as a transgender person that they're going after our protections, placing our lives at risk. but it's also offensive as an attorney, buchert says. they just are willfully ignoring the rule of law. for instance, she points out the department of justice memo on transgender people and employment discrimination cites a dissent in a sexual orientation case, which she calls very, very sketchy justification.
and so they've - she's given him a special phone, a kind of a hotline that he keeps on his desk and only she has the number. and they have twin treadmills they work out on. and he follows something called the billy graham rule, which is that he will not go out to dinner with any woman other than his wife, and he also will not go to any kind of cocktail party or any place where they're serving alcohol and there's mixed company unless she is there at his side.
jungermann: (as ingrid) well, i can't just leave it here, desiree.
the political fallout from those battles has had a long shelf life. during the democratic debates this summer, joe biden (the democratic front-runner) was called out for his previous vocal opposition to busing by sen. kamala harris, who as a child was bused to her public school.
gross: you don't vote, and - because you want to be neutral. especially when you're covering a candidate, you don't want that candidate to think that you're for them or against them. you're just covering them. and voting is the right that every citizen should have. it's a private thing. you're in the voting booth. no one knows who you voted for unless you tell them. so given all that, why do you choose not to vote?
roberts: his supporters probably don't, but other people do. look, this idea that it's none of your business is really not something that a presidential candidate can say. everything is our business when somebody is running for president. what we know about the vote for president is that it is for the person, not for the policies.

upon taking office, the trump administration rescinded the obama directive, but some leaders at christian schools still fear the cultural and legal trends are in favor of expanded lgbt rights on their campuses, which could mean their policies on sexual behavior could face serious challenges.
and chief among them really has been pence's former chief of staff, marc short, who went - after working for pence in congress, he went to run the koch's political operation, freedom partners. and then when pence was chosen as vice president on the ticket, marc short came back, worked with pence in the campaign and is now the head of congressional liaison in the trump white house. so the man that actually ran the koch's political operation is a key player inside the trump white house.

tur: definitely december 7, 2015. this was a rally in mount pleasant, s.c. it was the day that he announced that he wanted to ban all muslims from coming into america, even muslims - at that point during the day, muslims who might've been serving overseas in our military, muslims who might've been overseas visiting friends or family, muslim athletes who might've been, you know, at a match or a meet overseas, anybody, where there were questions about all sorts of well-known people that might not be able to get back into the country.
and this was one of those rallies where i felt like it was good to keep a lower profile. so i sat down on the stage - not the stage, the press riser. i wasn't standing up in front of my camera. i wasn't easily seen. i was just sitting, taking notes as he was talking. and we're waiting for him to announce the muslim ban. he doesn't get to it yet in the rally. and suddenly, just like the first rally, i hear my name - katy tur. she's back there. little katy, what a lie it was. what a lie she told. and he's pointing at me in the crowd. the entire place turns, and they roar as one. i write like a giant, you know, unchained animal. and i just see men standing on their chairs and yelling at me. the only person, the only friendly face in the crowd that i could find, was this older lady who was right up pressed against the press pen who looked at me horrified, looked at me horrified for my safety. and i just remember thinking, smile and wave because if you smile at them and you wave, i had learned up to this point, then you diminish the tension. you diffuse the situation. you mitigate it, because if you look intimidated, if you look scared, people will take advantage, and people will push harder.
what would you say to people who are fed up with the government and think that it's gone too far on social issues like same-sex marriage and abortion, and feel that trump is the only candidate who is willing to do something about it?

rolling back obama's transgender student guidance was a priority for those groups, anderson says. plus, he adds, rescinding the guidance was simply a return to how things had been less than a year before. i don't think that's a particularly extreme, outrageous, controversial position to hold.
but there they were together, and i have to say, you know, this faustian bargain idea, it goes two ways. it may've been strange for trump to pick pence. it's very strange for pence to say yes because he is supposed to be someone who, as you say, is so puritanical and such a social conservative.

but this week, the court wrapped up the current term, and kennedy, who turns 81 in july, seems to have decided to stay on the job — at least for the coming term.
elving: yes, a turning point in the court's history to be sure. kennedy had often been the swing vote between the court's liberal and conservative blocs, although he usually voted with the conservatives and did so in all the major cases decided in the waning days of this court term. still, his replacement will almost surely be more doctrinaire and less tolerant on issues such as abortion rights and certainly same-sex marriage. i mean, kennedy wrote the decision in four key cases establishing gay rights in america over the last several years. but he also wrote the citizens united decision that has brought more corporate and union and super pac money into campaigns.

mr. sharlet: yeah. there's something wrong with it. a lot of that kind of travel is illegal under the 2007 open government act, which was passed in response to the abramoff scandal, especially when you look at some of these trips that would be sponsored by one nonprofit entity under the family's umbrella, but taken at the behest of another organization like christian embassy, another sort of christian right ministry in washington for elites.

my mother was 19 when she graduated college. she wanted to study science. she went to her father, my grandfather, and my grandmother and said, i want to go and study at one of the best schools for that. and my grandfather, who had an arranged marriage to my grandmother, and this was in the 1950s that my mother approached them, my mother said she wanted to go and study at uc berkeley california and my grandfather said go. and so they put her on a plane, and this is when transcontinental travel was not very common, she had never been to the united states. but my grandfather was really quite progressive, and he said to his eldest child who was his daughter, my mother: you go and you study.

in one day, he turned the conventional political wisdom on its head, recalled adviser wolff.
ms. winston: it says that the army was caught between a rock and a hard place. on the one hand, they wanted to make sure that they were giving toys to children who really needed them, and they thought this would be a good way to make that decision. on the other hand, they probably weren't thinking about the ramifications of that, and how it would look to immigrants and to other folks.

the recommendation also noted that japan has no national lgbt anti-discrimination policy, something that human rights organizations are actively campaigning to change. human rights watch said in january that a coalition of 116 groups had sent a letter to japanese prime minister yoshihide suga urging him to introduce such legislation before the tokyo olympics are scheduled to begin this summer.
mr. boies and mr. pottinger would go from toasting kessler as their 'whistle-blower' and 'informant' to torching him as a 'fraudster' and a 'spy.' kessler was a liar, and he wouldn't expose any sexual abuse. but he would reveal something else: the extraordinary, at times deceitful measures elite lawyers deployed in an effort to get evidence that could be used to win lucrative settlements — and keep misconduct hidden, allowing perpetrators to abuse again. mr. boies has publicly decried such deals as 'rich man's justice,' a way that powerful men buy their way out of legal and reputational jeopardy. this is how it works.
controversy over the billy graham legacy was stirred anew with the 2015 publication of a book said to be graham's final chapter. titled where i am: heaven, eternity, and our life beyond, the book had billy graham's name on the cover, as the author, but skeptics questioned whether he had actually written it. despite the title, the book dealt less with heaven than with hell, describing it as a place of wailing and a furnace of fire; a place of torment, a place of outer darkness, a place where people scream for mercy; ... where many will spend eternity.
justice democrats, the group that helped rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez beat a long-serving democratic incumbent in the 2018 primary, backed newman's bid.
at the time, san bernardino had just happened a week or two before. people were scared about terrorism. this couple had gone into an office party, and shot it up and killed a number of people. and donald trump was saying that the administration in power - the obama administration - was doing nothing to protect americans, that they weren't vetting people properly, that they were putting your life at risk. your family and your sons, your daughters, your wives, your husband, your grandparents are at risk every day because the obama administration is not protecting you, and the media is complicit in this. so they're not only angry at washington, they're angry at us, the journalists.

no one questioned that barack obama's heart was always in the right place on gay rights, socarides said. he just needed the pressure that we put on him and the political support. what seemed like someone who was not willing to act so boldly, to now we see it's probably one of the most important parts of his legacy.
why trump continues to forge an unlikely bond with religious conservatives
gjelten: that's how society is changing. people who say the idea of a same-sex union goes against their religious beliefs have given up on making same-sex marriage illegal. instead they're advocating a right not to go along with it - a government clerk who does not want to issue a marriage license or the baker who doesn't want to make a cake for a gay wedding. jeremy tedesco, senior counsel at the alliance defending freedom, says supporting that right is important because someone opposing same-sex marriage in that way could now face a discrimination suit.
southern baptists also weighed in on another emotional issue at the intersection of race, religion and violence. almost exactly a year after the murder of nine people at emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston, s.c., set off a debate over the confederate battle flag, the southern baptist convention approved a resolution calling on our brothers and sisters in christ to discontinue the display of the confederate battle flag as a sign of solidarity with the whole body of christ, including our african-american brothers and sisters.
barring surprises, kavanaugh appears likely to win confirmation in time to take his place alongside those eight justices when the supreme court begins its fall term next month.
in response to the news that the cases are heading to the newly conservative-leaning supreme court, the human rights campaign called on congress to explicitly add protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity by approving the equality act, which was reintroduced in the house last month.

the turnabout from the trump administration came quickly. in february 2017, just a few weeks after president trump's inauguration, his administration rescinded the transgender student guidance. weeks after that, because of the reversal, the supreme court took transgender plaintiff gavin grimm's case off its calendar.

those two lackluster statewide performances is one reason moore wasn't expected to gain much steam when he first entered this senate race, but with the election of trump, a rise of political outsiders, a reigniting of the culture wars and vulnerabilities by strange, there was a perfect storm for him to finally grasp the nomination.

so let's talk about how mike pence got into politics. he ran for congress for the first time in 1987 when he was 29. he won the primary, lost the general, then lost again in 1990. and i think it was during this time that the press found that he'd used donations - campaign donations - toward personal expenses like mortgage payments and groceries. so how did that affect his political career?
the churches claim they are unfairly targeted, because restaurants and bars are exempted as long as they maintain six feet between tables and bar stools. (in some cases, state or local authorities have held that establishments serving food provide an essential service.)
with tapestry, carole king cemented her place as one of the key architects of 20th-century popular music. here, she fully claims the spotlight, not only as a top-notch composer, but as a deeply soulful lyricist and singer. considered her crowning achievement by critics, record sales of over 25 million confirmed that the public agreed. from i feel the earth move to you've got a friend, the track list is a veritable master class in pop standards with king, one of america's most dependable hitmakers, flexing in a new genre. with her unadorned piano wrapped in plainspoken lyrics about the pulls of kinship and self-actualization, it's no wonder the record stands the test of time as not only a bedrock in the singer-songwriter genre but also as the soundtrack of suburban feminism of the early 1970's. king's evolution as both an artist and woman are perhaps most evident in the grown-up version of will you love me tomorrow? that appears on tapestry. the first major writing credit for the then-teenaged king and lyricist husband gerry goffin, which hit no. 1 for the shirelles in 1961, is transformed from a girl's yearning question into the bittersweet doubts of a woman wise enough to know that even true love doesn't always last til the night meets the morning sun. —jill sternheimer (lincoln center)

then, another landmark decision emerged from the high court in 1998: in oncale v. sundowner offshore services, inc., joseph oncale claimed that he had been harassed on the basis of sex by his male co-workers on an oil platform in the gulf of mexico. the court ruled unanimously that this did constitute sex discrimination.
of course, obama's transgender student guidance wasn't the only one trump quickly reversed. obama's policies in regards to iran, the paris climate accord, many environmental regulations and more have also been reversed. much of that was telegraphed in campaign promises. but the reversals on lgbtq rights and protections were not, buchert says.
what he's accused of: extra-judicial detention, where detainees are tortured and mistreated, including as a tactic against political opponents and activists ... leading the world in executions ... enforced disappearance of critics ... using strong-arm tactics to maintain communist party power. for example, launching an anti-corruption campaign against political opponents and shutting down groups seen as a threat – even ones as seemingly benign as advocating for women's legal counsel against domestic abuse. ...
already, the administration has said biden is preparing to reverse the mexico city policy, which prohibits u.s. funding for organizations that perform or refer patients for abortions in other countries. but a study in the journal the lancet found that the policy actually increased the abortion rate in some countries, most likely because it also reduced access to contraception.
jones also ran a far more visible race than moore in the final stretch. he had outspent moore almost 10-1 and had an active campaign schedule, while moore had been largely absent from the campaign trail in the final stretch — including leaving the state over the weekend to attend the army-navy football game in philadelphia. jones also had an active field operation, while the gop nominee's staff was a skeleton crew.
the family research council described business opposition to the measure as economic blackmail and celebrated bryant's signature. no person should be punished by the government with crippling fines, or face disqualification for simply believing what president obama believed just a few years ago, that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, frc president tony perkins said in a statement.
toobin: well, certainly, the one that will probably attract the most attention - and it's not clear that it will get to the supreme court in the next month or so, although it well might - is donald trump's executive order on immigration, the one barring or temporarily barring immigration from several muslim-majority countries. and several federal judges have struck that down. it's now in the appeals process. of course, it was revised, then the revised version was struck down. that will certainly be a big deal. to be honest, the justices have done their best while they were at eight, you know, to sort of keep the pipeline as clean as possible of really controversial cases.
the ap described the scene on wednesday as ermold, alongside his husband, filled out the paperwork to run for office with davis sitting across from him:
millies: certainly a man of his age is someone who's formed very much by the second vatican council, by that optimism that characterized midcentury catholicism in the 20th century. catholics had spent so much of the late 19th century and the early 20th century living in urban settings, ghettoized in a culture apart here in the united states. world war ii brought catholics into the mainstream. certainly, the cold war brought catholics into the mainstream. and then in the 1960s, we had this wonderful moment of catholic confidence with the election of the first catholic president, john kennedy, the second vatican council, that told us that the church and the modern world can live together and can reinforce one another. joe biden's very much formed by those experiences as a man of his generation would be. it's an ecumenical outlook. it's an interreligious outlook. it's an outlook that sees the modern world as an opportunity rather than a problem.

that said, the army here in america, for a long time, tried not to be activist but in recent years, it has run into this issue regarding gay rights. and specifically, in 2001, the army sought an exception from discriminating against the lgbt community in hiring, and it told the bush administration that it would support the faith-based initiative if they could have that guarantee.

diamond: it was a surreal moment. i think it came at the end of about 10 days of our stories publishing. we'd published five big stories and a bunch of smaller updates in between. so i don't think we really processed it in the moment. and really, the story that we immediately started writing was, what's next? the thousand hours came from not just the source-building, not just camping out at airports and the building of databases about his trips. but we were calling around. i remember we figured out he'd gone to nashville - couldn't figure out what he was doing in nashville. he was only on the ground there for a few hours.

senate minority leader harry reid delivered perhaps the most stinging rebuke of republicans and their presidential nominee, donald trump, that we've seen at the dnc. he said this about the republican majority leader:
as npr's debbie elliott reported at the time, democrat bob vance tried to forge a fragile coalition of democrats and the establishment republicans who aren't comfortable with moore's religious crusades. moore eventually narrowly prevailed with 52 percent of the vote.
among those in opposition are the national association of evangelicals, the u.s. conference of catholic bishops, the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, the seventh-day adventist church and the coalition for jewish values, representing orthodox rabbis. together, the groups represent a broad swath of u.s. religious denominations.
king: yeah, no. those folks aren't comfortable though. and i want to ask you specifically about health care. i mean, one of their main points - people who support bernie sanders - is joe biden simply does not go far enough on health care. now, i hear what you're saying, that people may come around; people will come around. why are you so sure that they'll come around? health care is being fiercely debated in this country, and there are people who say joe biden simply does not have a plan that we want.
sagal: he said, quote, i don't like to bother people if i don't have to. and, you know, i feel pretty good. i mean, other than the nail being there.

gabbard made the announcement in a video posted thursday morning, and said, it's clear that democratic primary voters have chosen former vice president joe biden to be the person to take on president trump in november.
but that has become a very important part of supreme court confirmation hearings, that, you know, i think partisans on both sides recognize that these hearings are political events. and senators respond to political stimuli. and television advertising is something that gets their attention. but also, you know, placing op-ed pieces, you know, getting web pieces up in support of gorsuch, mobilizing conservative intellectuals, mobilizing judge gorsuch's law clerks, some of whom were democrats, mobilizing - you know, establishing support within the american bar association, which gave gorsuch a good rating.
gross: so, jane, the title of your new new yorker piece is the president pence delusion, and the premise of the piece is a lot of people on the left are hoping that president trump will have to exit office, either because of investigations into his ethics and into his campaigns, possible collusion with russia or because he's impeached because of mental health issues or whatever scenario. so the question you're raising is, say that happened, what kind of president would mike pence make if mike pence took over for trump? so my question is, is pence vulnerable? are there investigations that could leave him vulnerable, charges of obstructing justice? what are you talking about there?

southern baptists split with donald trump on refugee resettlement
while serving as a young bishop in chicago, gregory was close to the late cardinal joseph bernardin, the chicago archbishop and one of the most esteemed catholic leaders in the country. bernardin was famous for his pro-life vision, which he defined broadly. abortion in his view was wrong, but so was capital punishment, militarism, and social injustice. a true pro-life commitment, bernardin said, had to be carried like a seamless garment.

gross: and you're saying that the heritage foundation had sway over hhs because they endorsed donald trump when others were not endorsing him, when he was a dark horse candidate during the primary.
during the campaign, trump issued two long lists of potential nominees, put together largely by the conservative heritage foundation. the lists were, to a person, very conservative, but were remarkable for who was missing — some of the most distinguished conservative judges and lawyers in the country. among them: paul clement, the george w. bush administration solicitor general who, as a private lawyer, represented conservative challengers to many of the obama administration's most controversial policies; brett kavanaugh, an appeals court judge who carried the limited government banner on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia; and jeffrey sutton, the judge who wrote the only appeals court decision in the country upholding state laws banning same-sex marriage.
pence's replies were a demonstration in the fine art of giving a long response that doesn't answer the question.

i have worked alongside nine presidents, republican and democrat, all experienced, all believing in the u.s. role in world leadership and i can tell you this — that in this election, there is only one candidate for president who has the experience, the temperament, and the judgment to be commander in chief. and that's hillary clinton, he said before the chants began.

gross: yeah. well, the way you're describing it, it's taking, like - the gay conversion is taking a legitimate form of therapy and group therapy and using it to fight who you are, not to bring out who you are. and it's doing it for harm, and not for your own good. so that's part of your doorway in, is having undergone a group therapy yourself, but feeling like it was a very positive thing, not a destructive thing. but, you know, in the gay conversion centers, what's really, like, unusual, inexplicable in a way, is that these conversion centers, the residential centers, they're trying to convert gay and lesbian kids from being gays and lesbians by surrounding them with other gays and lesbians...

manson: i think it was always official, and i think that the pope liked the good press, to be quite honest with you. and, you know, but i think what's painful is that he gave the sense that he's a bridge builder, and he's going to heal wounds. so i think that's where the disappointment is coming from for a lot of people. and i think it's justified because it was a mixed message for eight years.

as i've traveled this country, through all fifty states; as i've rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what i've also seen, more than anything, is what is right with america, obama will say. i see people working hard and starting businesses; people teaching kids and serving our country. i see a younger generation full of energy and new ideas, unconstrained by what is, and ready to seize what ought to be.

if this actually passes, it will be a great relief, says the rev. tom berlin, a pastor at the floris united methodist church in herndon, va., who signed the protocol and described himself as representing groups who hold a centrist view in the ideological conflict.
and that's a devastating critique from a man who has given his loyalty to this group, who has turned to them in the most painful moment in his life, expected them to stand up for what they say they believe in, and instead was forced to confront the fact that when the family talks about power being the bottom line of the new testament, they really mean it. power trumps love.
elliott: right, since 2010. and i think we're seeing some of the policies that have played out here under that one-party republican rule now making their way to washington. for instance, there was a really tough immigration bill that passed here. make - and now we're seeing that issue bubble up to the federal level. and this is something that i know john has written about a lot.

actually, i'm critical of much of what is called international development. its failures are chronic and multitudinous. the blame for these failures spans all the way from both donor- and developing-country governments to westerners who continue to think of poorer countries in damagingly sensationalistic terms, for instance as hotbeds of modern-day slavery.

if you don't subscribe to the notion of a wedding as the happiest of all possible endings (and listen, i hear you. i mean, whether or not a marriage proves a happy one, the wedding is less of an ending and more of a beginning, by definition), try the gently funny, pulitzer-winning novel less. i've been talking it up a lot, lately, because i recently returned to it and was reminded of how perfectly, and with what gentle, unlooked-for but thoroughly welcome happiness it ends.
kurtis: yeah, we say tor-tuses (ph).
dan diamond: i think that would be an overstatement, but there's certainly much more representation in this administration of those views than in previous republican administrations and certainly a major departure from the obama team. there are a significant cohort of folks who work together as advocates in the anti-abortion, anti-lgbt movements before coming into government. and that's unusual and notable.

roberts: but, you know, i - you always wonder, though, at this stage in the year - in the calendar, why would these rules come out? and yes, the president wants to get a lot done before his time is up. but it also might be a political ploy on the part of the administration to try to get young people excited and remind them that the republicans, in many cases, are against transgender people, gay marriage, that kind of thing, just an attempt to keep the obama coalition together going into the election.
mr. sharlet: well, i think the bombshell comes from doug hampton himself, who in describing this whole process, went to the family thinking that he could trust the - what they say about accountability, what they say they exist for, for holding congressmen accountable. what his relationship with john ensign through the family was supposed to be about. and he attempted to work through them. they told him to, as he put it, be cool, in other words to keep the whole thing quiet. and he took their word for it. and last night he finally sort of came out and said look, this isn't - c street, the family, it's not what they say it is. and if i can just quote him, he puts it very succinctly: he says they - the c street group, the family - they think the consequences don't apply. those need to be dealt with differently, because of the responsibility, because of the pressure. meaning that congressmen have sort of special rules for them, because of the work that needs to be done. this is about preserving john, preserving the republican party. this is about preserving c street. these men care about themselves and their own political careers, period.

to illustrate this idea, anderson from heritage uses the example of how caitlyn jenner, a celebrity who is transgender, might experience sex discrimination in applying for a job: someone could say, i think you're really a man and therefore i'm not going to hire you because only women can do this sort of work, or i think you're a woman and i won't hire you because only men can do this sort of work.

davis smiled and welcomed them, chatting with them about the state retirement system and the upcoming christmas holiday. she made sure ermold had all of his paperwork and signatures to file for office, softly humming the old hymn 'jesus paid it all' as her fingers clacked across a keyboard. when it was over, she stood and shook hands with ermold, telling him: 'may the best candidate win.' 
people who didn't like billy graham spent a lot of time trying to find personal violations of his moral and ethical code, and they couldn't, said grant wacker. they didn't exist. he was a man who maintained absolute marital fidelity and moral and financial integrity. he was an evangelist who lived the way he preached.

justice stephen breyer called him a judge of great vision. justice samuel alito said kennedy will surely be remembered as one of the most important justices in the history of the court. justice sonia sotomayor called him one of the most thoughtful colleagues i have known and added that it is undeniable that he has had a monumental effect on the law. justice elena kagan said his legacy will be of enduring importance and that she would miss his kindness, decency, and warmth.
tur: who knows. who knows what he anticipated. but, you know, if he knew anything about me, if he knew anything about me at all, if he did any sort of research on who i was and what i did and where i've come from, he would have known better.
san francisco has long been regarded as america's gay capital, but a new list seeks to dispel that assumption: atlanta tops advocate magazine's list of the gayest cities in america, followed by burlington, vt.; iowa city, iowa; and bloomington, ind.
and that was a real lesson both for leo and for the republican party, which was that the conservative movement cares so much about these supreme court appointments that they will turn even on their own president, as they turned on george w. bush, because he didn't nominate a true conservative. and heading into the first republican president since george w. bush, that was the political environment that leo both recognized and helped create, which is that we the conservative movement care about this, we expect a nominee who will please us and that has to be a priority.
thomas merrill, a law professor at columbia university and a former deputy u.s. solicitor general (1987-1990), said he's been a little bit skeptical of the idea of term limits for supreme court justices. but, merrill said, his thinking has evolved.
mitchell: i think the tor-toys has it.

moore's explicit use of religion (his campaign events often resembled revival meetings) had been central to his political persona for years. but it became especially critical after multiple women accused him of sexually harassing or assaulting them when they were teenagers (and he was not).
gross: ...unless they're out - like, are you gay enough to...
those issues had caused him to be removed as chief justice of the alabama supreme court — not once, but twice.
and it's clearly focused on the treatment of lgbt people — not on religious freedom writ large.
that's why muslims everywhere are upset at trump's jumping the gun. jews favor jerusalem as the capital, but many also support the notion of a negotiated settlement.
a similar rationale was put forth by the 2nd circuit in the altitude express, inc. v. zarda case. as the american bar association said last spring, indeed, the court found that sexual orientation is doubly delineated by sex because it is a function of both a person's sex and the sex of those to whom he or she is attracted.

a memo that has reportedly been circulating at the department of health and human services aims to narrow the federal government's definition of sex under title ix — a change that could leave transgender people without a number of the legal protections that have become standard in recent years.
trump: she's back there - little katy. she's back there. what a lie it was.
the test has become a key factor in cases addressing abortion in the years since — including in whole woman's health v. hellerstedt, another closely argued decision released nearly a decade and a half later.

what he's accused of: invaded a sovereign country (ukraine) and annexed part of it (crimea). ... aiding syrian president bashar assad militarily. assad is accused by the west of using chemical weapons against his own people. ... meddled in elections, including in the u.s. ... allowed hackings of western bank accounts without prosecution ... some 100 men suspected of being gay have been swept up in chechnya, including three who were killed last month. ... people with disabilities face discrimination, including not studying in mainstream schools ...

the president and senate republicans seem ready to move very quickly to install a new supreme court justice after anthony kennedy made his surprise announcement yesterday that he is retiring. the president said his pick is going to come from a list of conservative judges that his campaign compiled during the presidential election.
gross: since gay rights and, well, lgbtq rights, and since, like, bathroom access for trans people had become such an issue by the time of the campaign, marriage equality had been won. but you just never know what the future's, you know, going to bring. did you feel, like, protective of your father or that somebody would try to use your father's identity as trans against you in some way, since you had people who were looking for ways to weaken you or diminish you or insult you in some way? and some of those people, like some of the trump supporters, i'm sure, were anti-gay rights and anti trans. so yeah, how did that figure into your calculations when you were thinking about - about your safety, about your identity as a reporter and how somebody with, you know, bad intent might try to, you know, use anything against you?
pence later renounced his attack ads as wrong and swore off negative campaigning.
the state senate has overwhelmingly approved a bill that would get rid of marriage licenses altogether. instead, couples would submit a form affirming they've met the legal requirements for getting married and then record a marriage contract at the probate office.

sagal: no, to take their time, as they have plenty of wine and tv. what the hell?
but the date on that pending meeting proved to be inauspicious: sept. 2, 2001. just weeks later, the bush administration would adopt a more comprehensively aggressive posture toward immigrants and foreigners in the united states as the country began the march toward wars in iraq and afghanistan. undocumented immigrants would be rounded up in the name of national security, and travel in and out of the united states became more closely policed.
reaching these voters was a key element of trump's campaign strategy in 2016, both in the primaries and in the general election. from his earliest rallies, he focused on the non-metro americans he would later salute in his inaugural address — the forgotten man, the forgotten woman.

the conflict came to a head last february at a special session of the church's general conference, when 53% of church leaders in attendance voted to uphold the ban on same-sex marriage and clergy. leaders at that conference also introduced tougher measures against clergy who officiate at same-sex marriages. the measures included a one-year suspension for the first offense and removal from the clergy after that and were set to go into effect on jan. 1, 2020.

and for, you know - for living a life that is gay, as you say a word that didn't exist, when your whole purpose is to be at least discreet and protect each other and watch out for dangers, it's not going to be written down somewhere unless things go badly wrong. at the same time, there's a certain amount of record. and, you know, you read the - for instance, i wrote a play about hans christian andersen - was sort of the same period in denmark. hans christian andersen - i mean, hans christian andersen may have died a virgin, but he was certainly incredibly in love with a young danish actor. and that's recorded, and he was in love with the son of his patron, collin, and was distraught and almost self-destructive when he was turned down by this man.

lawyers had helped to shield epstein, silver-greenberg says, creating a financial model in which they could secure big payouts for accusers and fees for themselves from the prominent men their clients accused — but let those men keep their actions secret.
that's the thing that has made so many of [cuomo's] critics quite impressed, greer says.
mayer: well, so this is what was interesting to me - is that pence has been very close with the kochs, and they have just showered money on his campaigns. and he's kind of act as a peacemaker between the kochs and trump. and but in that process, what interested me most was that i really do think that trump ran as a different kind of republican. he ran against the big-donors orthodoxy and kind of libertarian vision of people like the kochs. he said he was going to deliver something for the little guys and build infrastructure all across the country and use the government in various ways that the kochs disapprove of.
gross: so you give a lot of credit to leonard leo for the nominations of justices alito and roberts. what was his role in those nominations and confirmations?

my current cautious endorsement of this is based on the perception that the whole issue of appointments to the supreme court has become incredibly contentious, partisan, political, almost to the point where the political system freezes up, as we're witnessing right now with the scalia death, merrill said. it would be a good thing not to have the type of armageddon it looks like we're about to have.
those three, and sometimes just two, represented the far right of the bench this term, while chief justice john roberts and justice kennedy represented the center right. on the ideological left, justices ruth bader ginsburg and sonia sotomayor voted together most often — 78 percent of the time — and to a somewhat lesser extent with justices stephen breyer and elena kagan, who might be characterized as on the center left.

spencer and other figures on the alt-right often explicitly invoke as their objective a desire to shift the overton window, a wonky concept that until recently was only name-checked by political theorists and media studies types. named for joseph p. overton, the political scientist who first articulated it, it refers to the universe of ideas that are palatable and therefore viable as policy; ideas that lay outside of that window are unthinkable. when the overton window has shifted or expanded or contracted, it has often been the result of sustained political agitation. the most obvious example is the civil rights movement, which was, at its root, a project to fundamentally recast the social norms of the united states. it helped make mainstream once-radioactive ideas like the integration of american public spaces and created powerful new taboos around public expressions of racism.
still, moore remains the favorite in ruby red alabama, and democrats will have to decide whether wading into the contest is a worthwhile investment.
prof. winston: the army is a fundamentalist christian group. they basically believe that jesus died for their sins, and that the bible is inerrant, and it's a word of god. theology is not big in the army. i mean, once you get past that they're rock-hard bible believers, it's what they do that really counts.

(note: while both book and film share a winking meta-narrative structure, in goldman's novel, the layers of asides and inversions and formal invention are more numerous, and go deeper. it makes it the more satisfying version of the story, but also the more intentionally ambiguous, as far as endings go. if you're looking for sheer uplift — the pirate and the princess get married! the kid is less of a jerk to his grampa! — go with the movie.)

so if you're looking for something a little chewier than the princess bride, try a shakespeare comedy, which always end on a high, breezy, comfortingly on-the-nose note. (here's a guy who titled one of his comedies all's well that ends well, spoilers be damned.) my favorite is his final play, the tempest, because it is so resolutely, stubbornly weird.
trump had backed strange then, too, but steve bannon — his former chief strategist who has since returned to lead breitbart news — supported moore and rallied with him in the closing days. bannon had long touted moore as part of the war he had promised to wage on the gop establishment, backing challengers to sitting incumbents who would take on mcconnell and support trump's agenda. but other national strategists warned bannon's civil war would cost them winnable seats — something that came to fruition on tuesday night.
other national republicans had been far less hospitable. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he believes moore's accusers and called on him to step aside, though he had softened his stance in recent weeks by saying the choice was up to alabama voters. a senate ethics investigation into the sexual assault allegations against moore likely also would have followed had he won.
moore has a history of facing off with the federal courts over this issue. in january 2015, u.s. district court judge ginny granade ruled that the state's marriage ban was unconstitutional. the next month, moore instructed probate judges that they weren't bound by granade's decision — leaving probate judges with two contradictory orders.

obama was explicit about one of the reasons he picked garland: for years republicans had suggested him as the democratically appointed lower-court judge they favored, the one they could live with. that solicitude for the opposition party's views is not being replicated now because republicans still control the senate, and have little need for democratic support.
brennan: well, no, i had to - it was between emotional mics or just doing - becoming a mime.

but the potential impact of the policies described in the memo, and the headline under which the times ran its story — 'transgender' could be defined out of existence under trump administration — inspired grave fears and fervent protest.
particularly interesting will be how the supreme court's view of presidential power evolves. in the eight years of the obama administration, the court's conservatives have demonstrated an unusual and deep suspicion about executive power, while the court's liberals have shown relative deference. it will be interesting to see if that changes when the president is a republican with an agenda, instead of a democrat.
montagne: well, let's talk about the democrats for a few minutes now. who ever would've thought, really, that this would be the second nominating contest to be decided this year after the republicans? but as paul ryan points out, speaker of the house, bernie sanders keeps winning primaries, as bernie sanders would point out as well. he also is making the argument that he would do better with clinton against trump in a national election. does he - is there something to that, cokie?
brennan: there are three mics on stage, just, like, mics on stands, and they're just basically spaced out. like, they each have, like, a little area. and i just go from one mic to the other. i basically do, like, 10 minutes of stand-up, then 10 minutes of, like, more emotional honesty, i guess, and then, like, two minutes of one-liners. and then i just repeat.
i think that we missed the ball on the epstein coverage, says enrich, who joined the paper in 2017 and is now its business investigations editor. i am really disappointed in myself and the new york times for not having responded as forcefully and as quickly and as aggressively as we should have.
and sarah, what did all those leaders hear from donald trump today?
however, we should put this into context. public corruption and cronyism are nothing new. former alabama governor don siegelman, a democrat, remains in federal prison today on corruption charges. and then former alabama governor guy hunt, a republican was ousted from office after a conviction in the '90s.
brennan: wait, wait, wait, people don't like that.

i have never seen anything more craven than mitch mcconnell and what he has done to our democracy. his republican party decided that the answer to hardworking americans' dreams is to slander our african-american president, stoke fear of muslims, sow hatred of latinos, insult asians, and, of course, wage war against women.
he says he knows what it's like to live the life of an outcast.

population density is also political because the constitution features a low-density bias that gives disproportionate power to less populous states. the founders negotiated a deal that split congress in two, with one chamber based on population (the house of representatives) and one that was not (the senate). in the senate, with all its special powers, the less populous states would always have clout disproportionate to their size.

diamond: evangelicals haven't supported trump at quite the level that they did during the election. some of the polling has fallen off. but overall, christian conservatives are very happy. there was an interview that tony perkins, the head of the family research council, just did with my colleague at politico, isaac dovere, where he said, and i quote, from a policy standpoint, he has delivered more than any other president in my lifetime. he's talking about donald trump. and tony perkins is 54, so you can do the math. he is saying that donald trump has done more for religious leaders than both bushes, than reagan, than nixon and ford.
montagne: the education department, the justice department warned the states not to discriminate against transgender students or risk losing federal education funds. you're in south carolina today, where there does not seem to be much appetite for a political fight over this issue. but there's plenty in other states like north carolina and texas. do you think this will become a rallying point for either party in the election?
any state punishment or retaliation for such actions, like a person losing a job, a license or a state grant, is deemed discrimination under the bill, with compensation to be available for those so affected.

the combination of changing social attitudes and more complex legal issues were major points of discussion when the cccu assembled representatives of more than 130 of its member institutions in dallas in late january. college chaplains, student counselors and classroom professors reviewed how they were responding to lgbt students, while administrators and financial officers considered whether they need to prepare for more government scrutiny of their positions and policies on sexual orientation and activity.
davis told ermold that it was god's authority that kept her from complying with the supreme court. she spent time in jail for defying a federal judge's order, was sued by ermold and moore and other couples, and rose to international prominence as a symbol of the bitter divide over same-sex marriage, even meeting with the pope in 2015.
update at 7:07 p.m. et. excerpts from obama's speech:
in one recent example, he says a 70-something veteran in utah's coal country wondered about the world that his grandchildren would inherit if the climate is warming and the country can't stop it.
in the universe of popular music, this album exploded like a brand new sun. it took aretha franklin eleven songs to shift the canon of am radio away from the realm of girlish glee to the cataclysms of womanly love. i never loved a man connected with black and white audiences and became the biggest commercial success of her building career. on this atlantic records debut, franklin trucks confidently in the desires of a modern-day woman. in a word, she's real — plain-spoken and passionate, without guile or undue glamour. the album has funky rhythms, of course. and horns. and some of the most memorable hooks in popular music. franklin's re-imagining of the otis redding single respect is now on the national recording registry of the library of congress, reportedly as a feminist anthem. but the song is also redolent of black consciousness and pride. and yet, it's franklin's renderings of vulnerability in love that make the album universal. the title track was her first million-seller. she also wrote or co-wrote some of the best-known songs of her career for the release, including baby, baby, baby and dr. feelgood. for better or worse, each song here sounds like she lived it. producer jerry wexler called the famously private franklin our lady of mysterious sorrows. —gwen thompkins (wwno)
pence was clearly pandering to some extreme players in the party here in indiana, oesterle says, and that was a sign to all of us that he was deviating from what he had told us he was going to do.
mayer: very early as the tea party opposition to obama was brewing, what you've got is mike pence out there. he had a reputation for being kind of more soft-spoken than many republicans and for being kind of, as i said earlier, more affable. but when the tea party rises, he really finds a more aggressive voice. and he's out there at their rallies yelling that the government should be shut down unless planned parenthood is defunded.
he says people have called him weeping because the sign brought them solace.

that example is relevant, because jerusalem and the temple remain live issues today, 25 centuries later. trump's recent decision to recognize jerusalem as the official capital of israel (and to move the u.s. embassy there) has set off deadly riots in much of the region. it has also resonated deeply with some americans who fervently support it.

neal brennan has gone from working the door at comedy clubs to writing and co-creating comedy central's emmy-nominated chappelle's show. he has a new netflix special out called 3 mics so we've decided to ask him questions about three mikes (as in, three guys named mike.)
gross: so how did you find out that bahati is directly connected to the family? you've described him as a core member of the family. and this is the person who introduced the anti-gay legislation in uganda that calls for the death penalty for some gay people.
take, for instance, the obama administration's guidance to schools on transgender students that came out in the spring of 2016. it required schools to protect transgender students from harassment, accommodate their preferred names and pronouns, and give them access to the locker rooms and bathrooms of their choice.
the organization recommended that partners living in new york city consider getting married in city hall before dec. 31. after year's end, the trump administration expects unmarried partners to change visa status or leave in 30 days.
but it's also the party whose 2016 national platform called marriage between a man and woman the foundation for a free society. a 2019 pew poll found around 45% of republican voters support same-sex marriage, a number that has steadily increased over time.
though he spent his final years in failing health and largely silent at his mountaintop cabin in north carolina, graham for more than six decades was in constant motion. he preached to more than 200 million people in 185 countries, counseled presidents and led mass religious rallies that featured professional musicians and huge choirs, in venues ranging from a circus tent in los angeles to yankee stadium in new york.

finally, there was jeffrey mateer, an outspoken supporter of religious liberty, nominated with the strong support of his home state senator, ted cruz of texas. shortly after the nomination was announced, gay rights groups called attention to frequent comments mateer had made calling same-sex marriage disgusting and likening it to polygamy and bestiality. speaking about a lawsuit brought by a transgender student, mateer, said it just shows you how satan's plan is working and the destruction that is going on.
so kobani is this small town in northeastern syria that few outside syria had heard of. and it got thrust onto the global stage by the men of the islamic state who think they're going to just overrun this town and have yet another battlefield victory — because this is 2014 and they haven't had one loss. and there comes this david and goliath story that starts to take hold of people's imaginations about this syrian kurdish force helped by a few other folks, including iraqi kurdish forces, who decide that they're going to fight to the death to stop the islamic state — and women play a central role in that battle. it almost becomes a david versus goliath. only david is a woman.
adams has also noted that minorities are not more predisposed to infection biologically or genetically, but rather they are socially predisposed to it.
an executive order protecting gays and lesbians who work for federal contractors will remain intact at president trump's direction, the white house says. the move could allay concerns that trump might end recently adopted protections against an anti-lgbtq workplace.

the briefings and his performance are getting rave reviews, according to campbell. both from people within his party, [and] even republicans.
i'll give you a crude analysis. i mean, if we had hour upon hours, i could get into much more depth and specificity. but here's my take on it: over the last 10 years in our country, at least, we've seen an incredible amount of change — the great recession, the term great depression was already taken. but in america, then and today, people are literally walking around with the proverbial tin cup. economic upheaval like we have not seen in generations. people lost their homes, they lost their jobs, many of whom will never be able to buy a home or have a permanent job again. people are reading about the browning of america and the immigrants are coming. and we had barack obama as president and then we had a women running as president and we had a jew running for president and gay people can marry and: oh my god, oh my god. and then you talk about the impact of technology and automation ...
burke: that seems way more pro-gay marriage than sean spicer.
ross: the more that i studied myself and the more that i prayed about it and thought about it, my beliefs just did not align with the church of christ.
david enrich, a times business editor who helped to report the story, tells npr, our obligation is to be truthful and as transparent as possible and to tell the truth to our readers as best we can.
trump seeks catholic voters, but some catholics push back
and i think the challenge for christian conservatives and evangelicals is, how do you judge donald trump the president versus donald trump the leader, who has this track record of being involved in lots of things that aren't very christian? trump spoke to the march for life just hours after last week's very seamy interview with stormy daniels, the adult film star, published. and yet he's treated as a hero by evangelicals for what he is doing as president after, they felt, an assault on their positions for eight years by the obama administration.

akhavan: i was happy. and i felt accepted and really liked for the first time in my life in a weird way. also, conveniently, my producing and writing partner lives here. her name is cecilia frugiuele. and we co-wrote cameron post once i moved here. and she optioned the rights. and she pushed me to make the film. i was terrified to make cameron post. appropriate behavior is like 50 percent fart jokes. it's not - - i mean, i love it. i love it. but it's - i thought the miseducation of cameron post as a book was so masterfully done in tone, with the balance of humor and drama. it felt bigger than me. and i thought, you know, i really don't want to mess that up.

separately, the new york times reported on leaked emails from the confidential file. one is an email drafted by kavanaugh in 2003, in which he questioned whether the supreme court's 1973 roe v. wade decision legalizing abortion should be described as settled law of the land.
the controversy over moore's candidacy has given democrats a rare opportunity in a state that hasn't been represented by a democrat in the senate in more than 20 years.

a normal presidential candidate, he said, doesn't ask you to believe him. instead, he tells you how he plans to get things done.
it deeply concerns me that somebody who knows little or nothing about the christian faith would hear mr. trump call himself a christian and then make a decision based on the christian faith, based on his behavior. and so i just felt like i should say something. i did not expect to stir up the dust storm that this blog has stirred up.

king: last question for you - does joe biden need the support of bernie sanders supporters if he's to win in november? does he need them?

we basically looked at the tradition and began to understand that the jewish value of kevod haberiyot, the dignity of every individual, is equal to or even takes precedence over some of our older tradition around attitudes toward homosexuality, blumenthal says.
montagne: well, that's one way of looking at it. and to discuss this and other issues this week in politics, we're joined by columnist and commentator cokie roberts and washington post columnist kathleen parker. good morning to both of you.
my family and extended family thought, at best, it was a curious decision and with some of them i had to defend the decision like one would a thesis.
martin: so, there were stories about them - what, as kind of outliers or as miscreants or what? as trouble makers, what? what was the sort of attitude?
adams: that's right. and so the - when you're dealing with especially sensitive issues inside of schools, whatever the resolution is, it has to be respectful of everyone. and i think there's a way to do it, if, again, you try to look at the legitimate concerns.
lucado took to his website to describe all the reasons he says republican front-runner donald trump's tone and decorum fail the decency test, in a blog post titled decency for president.
mr. sharlet: well, people are certainly talking about the family in a way that they hadn't, and what's been really great is that local press around the country has been asking their representatives tough questions. so you have terrific reporters down in oklahoma, and north carolina, and michigan, and kansas, and mississippi, and tennessee going to their congressmen and saying, look, what's your affiliation with this group? we're not challenging your freedom of religion. you tell us that religion's very important to how you legislate and here's a religious group you're involved with, that does these things. why is secrecy necessary? how does it shape your views? does it help you? does it - is it something we want to know about?
vice presidents are often relegated to the background, and pence's low-key personality might suggest he would experience the same. he made few headlines during the campaign — perhaps the biggest when his plane skidded off a runway upon landing at new york's laguardia airport.

two years later, when a new york times reporter asked him whether he shared his son's judgment on islam, graham answered, let's say, i didn't say it. asked whether he, like franklin, foresaw a clash between christianity and islam, graham said, i think the big conflict is with hunger and starvation and poverty.

when the press found out about that, it caused a great brouhaha, and the salvation army looked quite bad, and it had to do a lot of back-stepping in order to recoup. it had similar run-ins with the gay and lesbian community in san francisco and in new york, when the army tried to prohibit certain domestic-partnership benefits.
he didn't resurrect his ten commandments monument, but when the u.s. supreme court issued a ruling in 2015 legalizing same-sex marriage, moore ordered state judges to defy it and instead enforce the state's ban on such marriages.

once upon a time, there was a group of conservative intellectuals who were agnostic about donald trump.
a yes vote, if the exit polls hold up, would ease the way for irish lawmakers to pass legislation allowing abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. abortion currently is outlawed in all cases except those that could endanger the mother's life, some of the strictest abortion laws in the western world.
diamond: terry, i think there are three or four big questions that we'll be looking to see. one would be this continued administration over the affordable care act, a law that republicans have fiercely fought. it's mostly intact. what will they do to keep it running or look for ways to weaken it? a second issue is the opioid crisis. this is something that donald trump ran on. he promised effects. one year later, there's been very little done. and that is striking when we compare it to the efforts done around birth control, around establishing the new conscience office. it's interesting that there is funding and effort behind establishing a new team devoted to religious conscience, but there have been problems getting funding for the opioid epidemic.
greene: can i just ask you about one of the charges democrats are making, which is of hypocrisy, that the republican leadership and mitch mcconnell decided to hold up president obama's supreme court nomination because it was an election year, which meant merrick garland never came up for a vote? that brought us to having gorsuch on the court. now the democrats are saying that republicans set that standard, so why not use it now? why not wait for this nomination till after the midterms?

unidentified man #1: within five to 10 minutes, there's probably several thousand people, and they're yelling: kill the cops. police brutality. we're not going to take this anymore. let me out.
the abortion issue alone is enough to buy [moore] a win, predicted brent buchanan, an alabama gop pollster and consultant. that's the one nonnegotiable for social conservatives. you're not as hardcore on taxes. 'i can give up on that,' some voters might think. but when you're talking about somebody else's life, that's a whole different ballgame. and i think that's the big difference.
ted cruz has made no secret of his dislike of what he calls new york values. but now cruz needs the support of new york voters if he is to stop donald trump from winning the republican presidential nomination.
tur: you know, i do. and i do miss being out in the field reporting. i would be lying if i said that i didn't. i like being out there and talking to people and traveling and seeing the country and trying new places to eat especially. but i do like this new challenge of being in the anchor chair. and i'm able to really press politicians on what policies they're proposing or the inconsistencies that they've put out. i really enjoy that. and i think you can have nicer, fuller conversations on msnbc with this hour than you can have sometimes when you're doing a prepackaged report for nightly news or the today show or for any network broadcast for that matter 'cause you're so constrained within the limits of time there. so in some ways i miss it, in other ways i don't. but i also - yeah, i can have a life here.
mr. siciliano: it made me angry. it was like, you know, gay street youth created this thing that's made things so much better for so many of us, and yet at that time, there was no shelter of a covenant house. people of that time would get brutally gay-bashed and beaten when they tried to go to covenant house.
katy tur: well, thanks for having me, first of all. and the first time donald trump called me out at a rally was the very first rally i ever went to. it was june 30, 2015. it's around a backyard pool at a private home in new hampshire, and i am this brand new - i guess you could call it - political correspondent.
you know, we've been talking about the federalist society, a conservative judicial group that has a lot of sway and has played a very major role in the appointment of the last three supreme court justices. is there a democratic, liberal counterpart to the federalist society?
when my husband and i made it legal, suddenly they had this piece of evidence — my marriage license — to get me, meredith says. the united methodist church post-separation will be a place where the injury and the harm of lgbtq clergy and of lgbtq couples, their families, their congregations, their communities, will be removed. part of that begins immediately.
gross: let's talk about the family's connection to uganda, where there's a, really a draconian anti-gay bill that has been introduced into parliament. uganda already punishes the practice of homosexuality with life in prison. what would the new legislation do?
people are going to have a stark contrast and a choice, jones says. someone who has been talking to them about issues, about issues they care about every day, or someone who has a sordid history — not only a personal history but a professional history. jones has been burying voters in tv ads, including one featuring the names and faces of moore's accusers.
but what an awful lot of people said to me when i was interviewing them in indiana was, pence had nowhere else to go. it was very likely he would not have been re-elected as governor of indiana. he was kind of - his back was against the wall, and this was a rescue plan for him. i mean, this was a way up and out, and there weren't really any others. so this was a kind of a - pretty soon, people in indiana began to hear that pence would like to be picked. he was in the midst of running for re-election as governor, but he was eager to link up with trump.
the news from moore that he is running again was quickly met with heavy pushback by national republicans, who had long urged him not to run again for fear his candidacy would endanger their chance at flipping democrats' most vulnerable senate seat next year. moore wasn't their first choice in 2017 either, as many lined up behind luther strange, the republican who had been appointed to fill the remainder of former attorney general jeff sessions' term. but moore would go on to beat strange, the former alabama attorney general, in a runoff by more than 9 points.
mr. sharlet: yeah. well, when i first lived with the group, one of the first guys i met was senator john ensign, who was then living in a house the family maintains on capitol hill. senator sam brownback spoke with me extensively about his involvement. senator jim inhofe of oklahoma boasts of traveling around the world, doing the family's political business. senator tom coburn has done the same thing. senator chuck grassley has been very involved in african affairs on behalf of the family. senator mike enzi of wyoming is a part of it.
gross: my guest is jane mayer. her new new yorker article is titled the president pence delusion. after a break, we'll talk about how pence won the support of billionaire funders and what he did in return and how his faith has led him to support legislation many considered extreme and how that backfired when he was governor of indiana. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.
it is a sentiment echoed by one medical doctor, who told alice that while he is very proud to be part of this new ireland and that we've all known women who felt that they've no other options, he supports no, because human rights extend to everybody, not just the strong.

ryan: well, again, i think donald trump's going to provide an avenue for us to really articulate why joe biden is much better than donald trump and why progressives should not want another four years of donald trump. but let's get into the values and the rights that we all believe in, i think, as democrats but most americans.
white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said thursday that president trump believes the allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual assault against alabama gop senate nominee roy moore are very troubling and should be taken seriously but stopped short of calling on him to step aside as other national republican leaders have.

the roman catholic church cannot bless same-sex marriages, no matter how stable or positive the couples' relationships are, the vatican said on monday. the message, approved by pope francis, came in response to questions about whether the church should reflect the increasing social and legal acceptance of same-sex unions.

in his determination to replicate the evangelical style, graham read the sermons of notable preachers and then practiced delivering them himself. according to his biographer, william martin, graham regularly closed himself in a tool shed and preached to oil cans and lawnmowers. or he paddled a canoe to a lonely spot on the river and called on snakes and alligators and tree stumps to repent of their sins and accept jesus.
the racial aspects of this divergence, demonstrated in the current viral crisis, are a salient element in a larger trend toward disunity in america. we typically talk of polarization in terms of red states and blue states, republicans versus democrats, right versus left, your cable tv news channel versus mine. but it is also largely a matter of population density.
diamond: i think the heritage foundation emerged as this policy shop that the trump administration, first as a campaign and now as a white house, was really able to draw on. there was kind of a purity test after the election. not a religious purity test but an ideological and loyalty purity test that ended up weeding out republicans who had criticized trump. and there were quite a few of them. there were also moderate republicans who decided early, they didn't want to work for trump leading up to the election and right after.
though boies had built up a distinguished legal record stretching back more than a half-century, he damaged that reputation badly in two recent episodes, one of which involved the times directly.

elected in 2012, gabbard was the first hindu and one of the first two female combat veterans elected to congress. she began building a national profile during the 2016 election, when she resigned from her post as vice chair of the democratic national committee to endorse sanders for president.
one of rock's most misunderstood artists, janis joplin was often portrayed as victim, a dysfunctional mess who only fronted a band, who didn't have the power to call the shots. until pearl. in 1971, with monterey pop, woodstock, and festival express behind her, the vision of blues, rock and soul coming together with a band that could follow her was realized. it was her high point, and tragically, she didn't live to see it. janis had put the band together — saying it's my band, it's finally my band — and approved all the songs. (it was unusual at the time for a female artist to actually have that control, the very reason we need this list.) she wrote the opening track move over and the a cappella mercedes benz, which was recorded just days before her passing. janis once said, none of us are who we started out as. she was a good girl as a texas kid, in a stable home full of music, with her mom's broadway musicals like porgy and bess as her favorites. bad skin and some extra weight brought the usual social problems once she hit high school, and she drifted toward the creative crowd. once she made it to san francisco, she discovered how her heroes, like bessie smith, could inspire her voice. she became known as pearl — sassy, fearless, sexy, uninhibited, not one to ever hold her tongue. she was fast and free with her sexuality, like bessie. and she called the shots.
shapiro: those voices were senators kamala harris, cory booker and elizabeth warren, and south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg. as these presidential candidates reach out to religious voters, conservative christian leaders are speaking up and questioning their beliefs. npr's sarah mccammon reports.
and it goes further, to say that any kind of promotion of these ideas of homosexuality, including by foreigners, can result in prison terms. talking about same sex-marriage positively can lead you to imprisonment for life. and it's really kind of a perfect case study in the export of a lot of american, largely evangelical ideas about homosexuality exported to uganda, which then takes them to their logical end.

but the whole episode, topped off by his support for the abortion measure, which was denounced by a significant number of pro-life female republican state legislators, had its effect. until he was chosen for the no. 2 spot on the national ticket, polls showed pence only an even bet for re-election.
and i think justice kagan's confirmation is a clear counterexample to that. she was confirmed in the summer of 2010, exactly where we are in comparison to midterm elections, but under president obama. i think the democrats are trying to rewrite history and pretend that the biden standard was something that it's not.
instead, he said, the multiple accusations from women that moore had pursued them romantically as teenagers when he was in his 30s had little impact on the outcome, and washington republicans were too afraid of his staunch conservatism and adherence to the constitution.

trump's invitation came despite duterte's violent crackdown on drugs, that has left more than 7,000 of his countrymen dead since he took power less than a year ago. the white house defended trump's decision, saying the philippines is a key partner in dealing with north korea, but experts say that's a stretch.

but it is unlikely that kennedy will remain on the court for the full four years of the trump presidency. while he long ago hired his law clerks for the coming term, he has not done so for the following term (beginning oct. 2018), and has let applicants for those positions know he is considering retirement.
richard spencer, the white nationalist leader and university of virginia alum who coined the term alt-right, would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. if you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs, spencer told the atlantic last year, not long after the election. by 2015, gay marriage is popular. what is possible has shifted. that's what the alt-right is doing. it's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.

given the completeness with which the lovings won their historical moment — and their victory's symbolic impact not just on race, but as a harbinger for the same-sex marriage battle decades later — a cinematic portrayal of the events risks the potential potholes of recreating recent history. it's a story in which the opposition has already been thoroughly discredited by time, and the outcome of the characters' lives assured by history.
joe biden extends his delegate lead over bernie sanders
billy graham's ministry, however, grew to be larger than himself, and it became harder to separate his views from the views of those who spoke on his behalf. the billy graham evangelistic association (bgea), which he founded in 1950, produced radio and television programs and published books, magazines and pamphlets. a my answer column that focused on moral and theological questions was actually written by association staff members, even though it appeared under billy graham's name.
same-sex marriage remains illegal in the vast majority of united nations member states — some of which, such as saudi arabia, which is on friendly terms with the u.s., punish same-sex relationships with the death penalty.
in contrast, the other six justices, including the chief justice and kennedy, wrote that the court's 2015 decision declaring a right to marry for same-sex couples guaranteed more than a marriage certificate. it also guaranteed the constellation of benefits that the states have linked to marriage. and the majority observed that the states, including arkansas, do not have a paternity requirement for opposite-sex couples to list both names on a birth certificate.

whereas trump leaned more extreme on his views toward muslims, pence might be the more extreme politician when it comes to lgbt rights.

surely the president had every reason to back the nominee of his party when its margin of senate majority is so slim. but he also needed to be in the corner of the people who still passionately believed in moore as a bona fide modern christian martyr.
ted cruz is ahead right now. what we're trying to do is educate the people in the state of iowa. he is the biggest opponent of renewable fuels. he actually introduced a bill in 2013 to immediately eliminate the renewable fuel standard. he's heavily financed by big oil. so we think once iowans realize that fact, they might find other things attractive but he could be very damaging to our state, branstad said at the iowa renewable fuels summit tuesday, according to the des moines register.

rfra has been used in ways that are not what congress intended, says cicilline. it says you must have a compelling state interest if you are to burden the free exercise of religion. we've established that ending discrimination is a compelling state interest. so it wouldn't make sense to apply rfra.
and what you've seen with pence is that in many ways, pence has brought in a ton of people who are allied with the kochs into the government, and he's brought a lot of their policies in - so whether it's on environmental issues or tax policy now where the kochs are working very closely with the trump white house on the trump tax plan. and it is a tax plan that the kochs love, and it's a tax plan that's going to help the super-rich according to many nonpartisan analyses and not do very much for the middle class. so you're beginning to kind of see the government moving in the direction of the kochs.

right now, a majority of americans live in just nine states and so are entitled to just 18 senators (less than one-fifth of the total), according to 2019 census bureau estimates. at the same time, about 18% of the population is spread out over 27 of the least populous states. so less than one-fifth of the nation's population has a 54-seat majority in the senate.

conservative christians in america are undergoing a huge shift in the way we see ourselves in the world, mohler says. we are on the losing side of a massive change that's not going to be reversed, in all likelihood, in our lifetimes. in his view, christians must adapt to the changed cultural circumstance by finding a way to live faithfully in a world in which we're going to be a moral exception. (it is this goal, mohler says, that explains the passage of religious liberty laws to protect people who want to express their opposition to same-sex marriage or transgenderism.)
of the accounts that talked about guns, 60 percent were pro-nra and pro-gun, while only 15 percent were opposed. and of the content the internet research agency produced that mentioned firearms, guns, the second amendment or the nra, 77 percent of the posts were pro-nra and pro-gun.

long ago, a friend who'd seen the original broadway production told me found it depressing. he knew, intellectually, that the show's intent was to dissect the whole notion of happily ever afters, and assert that stories don't truly end — but he soberly advised me to leave at the end of act one. (act two is when all the happy, satisfying, familiar conclusions of act one disintegrate into chaos and darkness.)

the administration also angered some gay rights advocates by initially defending a law that barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages, even in states where they were allowed. at the same time, the white house was working in countless smaller ways to expand gay rights in housing assistance, hospital visitation and other areas.

anderson adds that the trump administration's reversals are entirely appropriate. if you have determined, as the trump administration has, that obama overstepped the authority of the executive branch and misinterpreted the meaning of sex discrimination, anderson says, then all of the various actions that the obama administration took where it interpreted the word sex as gender identity were unlawful. so going back to the original meaning of the word isn't a 'tit for tat,' it's a restoring — upholding the rule of law.

over the course of 10 months in 2016, the researchers surveyed 40,000 people on their attitudes about discrimination — a typical poll sample might have about 1,000 respondents — which gave them enough data to sketch a more pointillist picture of how americans see one another.

sex was added to title vii — the part of the law that prohibits employment discrimination — in an amendment put forward in late stages of debate of the bill that became the civil rights act. the group behind the amendment was what bagenstos calls a weird coalition of southern conservatives (who believed the word would be a poison pill that would doom the whole bill) and women's rights advocates (who thought it was an important and necessary protection).

one of the most recent projects to be part of our new canon, lemonade is a masterful excursion through terrains at once visually fantastical and emotionally all too real, exploring shattered trust in a broken relationship; the singular pain borne by the mothers of men like trayvon martin, eric garner and michael brown; the battering down of black women throughout history; the scars of all of these kinds of trauma; white-hot rage and hopeful, though not blind, reconciliation. the inventive, stunning lemonade film — credited to seven directors, with each dream-like scene lapped atop the next — has already generated a thousand points of exegesis (was that yellow dress and gushing water in honor of the cuban orisha oshun? was it coincidence that while wearing that dress, bey smashes a closed-circuit tv with her baseball bat?). but those visual shifts also provide sinew and shape to the hugely varied sonic palette that beyoncé employs as she flits between genres with everyone from jack white to the weeknd. lemonade is as much a pastiche musically as it is visually, but taken in totality, it is so artfully constructed that it feels right. pop music has only very rarely sprung from the mind or talent of a single auteur, but few solo artists have conceived of collaboration in as wide-ranging, or as dimension-shifting, a way as beyoncé has on this project — and she is the one most definitely in command. —anastasia tsioulcas (npr music)

arguably, the worst impact was the deadening sense of fear we all lived in. i remember the utter terror i felt when i was arrested with my long-term partner in delhi one night in 1988, merely because we lived openly together. the only reason we weren't persecuted further was because of my family's privileged position. few other indians had that kind of protection, and so the wiser course in those dangerous times for most gay indian men and women was to be invisible, to deny themselves normal, fulfilled lives.

the united states and western allies have long turned a blind eye to totalitarian regimes guilty of a long list of human-rights violations. often, it was in the name of stability and at the expense of people suffering in those countries. but american leaders have mostly been mindful to choose their words carefully to maintain some semblance of a moral higher ground. what trump is doing is different — past american leaders would almost never express admiration for bad actors. trump, in many cases, has been doing exactly that.
lgbtq activists, for their part, have expressed alarm that the move will actually harm these couples, many of whom hail from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal. without a legal marriage, and thus without a visa, such partners face the threat of deportation; but activists point out that if they get legally married to stay in the u.s., they could also face persecution upon returning to their home country.
adams: well, the question we were facing as to whether to strengthen our religious liberties and strike back and whether or not to have any type of accommodation for the lgbt community. the lds church stepped forward, to their credit, the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints. and they said rather than try to run those issues separately, they said, we think there ought to be a bill that combines the two issues.
trump has been strongly opposed to the trade deal, a stance that has become one of his most prominent positions. in a june 28 speech on the economy, trump called tpp a death blow to american manufacturing.

ryan: well, it became evident yesterday. he can pull the coalition together in places like texas but yet still win maine and minnesota. i think he's the best person to beat donald trump. and then, i think, even in the last couple days, there were the political maneuvers, you know, with amy klobuchar, mayor pete and beto.

mr. sharlet: yes, it's - i always say that the family is secretive, but not secret. you can go and look at 990s, tax forms and follow the money through these organizations that the family describe as invisible. but you go and you look. you follow that money. you look at their archives. you do interviews where you can. it's not so invisible anymore. so that's how working with some research colleagues we discovered that david bahati, the man behind this legislation, is really deeply, deeply involved in the family's work in uganda, that the ethics minister of uganda, museveni's kind of right-hand man, a guy named nsaba buturo, is also helping to organize the family's national prayer breakfast. and here's a guy who has been the main force for this anti-homosexuality act in uganda's executive office and has been very vocal about what he's doing, in a rather extreme and hateful way. but these guys are not so much under the influence of the family. they are, in uganda, the family.
so it surprises some to see how readily many committed church people flock to his standard. but the explanation is both simple and neat. it is not that evangelicals think trump is one of them, but rather that they believe he is being used by god.
she got ready to drive past the charter jet terminal at the right moment. and i kind of darted out from the main terminal, and there was a little patch of concrete that we had scouted out earlier where i ran over and it gave me a view of the charter jet field. so as rachana was driving by and able to see tom price getting out of the plane - his distinctive shock of white hair - i was able to see the kind of backup view of the overall staff. and then i ran down and saw kellyanne conway, who he was traveling with, and others appeared to be getting into black suvs escorted by secret service. so that was a pretty pivotal moment because we had been working for months and months to confirm it, and we saw it with our own eyes.

deportation counts are complicated numbers, but the obama administration would continue along this same trajectory that began during the clinton years, setting records for deportations from the united states. today, opposition to immigration is a defining feature of the republican party — when just a few decades ago, it was not hard to find elected republicans who were more liberal on immigration than democrats.
the protests surrounding new york city's stonewall inn, 50 years ago this month, were a seminal moment.
since the 2016 election, the democratic party has been wrestling with its demographic strategy — to what degree it should invest its resources in winning white, working-class voters who may have swung toward trump or put those resources elsewhere, like outreach to more reliably democratic groups (like black voters).
mayer: it does. and one of the interesting things to me in writing about pence is it poses such a juxtaposition between the way that trump ran, which was as a populist outsider who was attacking the big-money forces in the republican party as corrupt and saying that they were puppeteers trying to control the candidates as puppets. and trump made a huge point of saying, i'm my own man; i'm so rich; no one controls me. yet as his vice president, he chose mike pence. and you could hardly find a candidate in the american political scene who has closer ties to the big donors and particularly the koch brothers. he's been sponsored by them for years.

appeals court judges are considered particularly important because, although there are fewer of them, they establish legal precedents in the lower courts. trial court judges, by contrast, preside over criminal and civil trials in the federal courts, and must abide by the precedents that appeals courts establish.
kavanaugh was asked repeatedly during the televised hearing about whether he would support opening the supreme court to tv cameras. he promised to keep an open mind, but said he would also want to consider the views of the eight current justices.
diamond: charmaine yoest is the head of public affairs, essentially, at hhs. she's the top spokesperson. any messaging that the agency does, any communications - it all flows through her. and before joining hhs, charmaine was a very prominent anti-abortion advocate. she had suggested that there's a link between having abortions and breast cancer, which the american cancer society and other researchers have said there is no link, at least not scientifically proven. she had questioned whether transgender folks were mentally ill. and now she is running a $1 trillion agency with 80,000 employees, many of whom are career staff who have been there for years and work in health and science fields and may not agree with her policies. when we see the documents coming out of us that do have these subtle cues to the anti-abortion movement, the anti-lgbt folks, it's interesting to look and see how charmaine, someone who hadn't really been in a government public affairs job before, is now the person who gets to sign off on those messages.

let's hear from a state whose leaders wish they could quietly handle the contentious issue of lgbt rights. the state is utah.
diamond: you're hitting on another major victory for this administration, which is the president has appointed a supreme court justice. that was one reason why christian conservatives flocked to support him in the run up to the 2016 election. they were terrified that hillary clinton would almost surely appoint a supreme court justice who would be in favor of abortion rights, in favor of some other policies that republicans and conservatives really did not want to see. and then on the appellate level, trump had a historic year. he appointed 12 judges, more than any president has appointed in a single year. and that has led to the expectation that when these challenges come - because they will - there will be that much more support for the trump administration because the judiciary is being filled out with more judges who are sympathetic to these positions.
the fact that moore is seen as a champion on social issues is nothing new. it's what propelled him to national political stardom — and into plenty of controversy. in 2003 he was first removed from the state bench when he had a statue of the ten commandments erected in the alabama judicial building and refused to remove it even when ordered to do so by a federal court. he was elected again in 2012 but then subsequently suspended when he ordered state judges to defy the u.s. supreme court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide under the federal constitution.

so they come up with this idea of a third way, that they later start calling totalitarianism for christ. and they predict that the united states will pretty quickly embrace this and will get rid of political parties because democracy doesn't work. people arguing and debating doesn't work. they don't want a republican party, a democratic party. they want one big party - theirs.

in general, there is probably no greater example of kennedy's approach to the law, and how it will almost certainly differ from trump's nominee, than the question of how to interpret the constitution: whether the founding fathers intended their creation as a static document, bound by the literal meaning of its words, or whether those words represent concepts of liberty to be interpreted over time.
what happens to this tension over time?
mr. siciliano: one of the things that makes us as a people different than other peoples is that we're even alien from our families.

more than anything else, what's starting to define our political parties is less the left or right spectrum and more a response to the changing demographics in the country — whether it's going to make the country stronger or whether it's, basically, a threat. the republican party has basically doubled down on that change being a threat, and the democratic party is trying to find that way to embrace that and make it a strength. but that's a pretty big divide in worldview.
toobin: as part of its health care coverage. they said that certain forms of birth control, they regarded as tantamount to abortion, so they wouldn't fund it. this is - and gorsuch wrote the lower court opinion, which was upheld 5 to 4 by the supreme court, saying that the company didn't have to pay to provide birth control. i think, you know, the power of religious people both to excuse themselves from government obligations or to get government largesse, you know, parochial schools getting government funds, those sorts of cases are going to be big in the next few years.
it's never going to be the hard sell, where they're going to, you know, twist museveni's arm behind his back and say do this. as the family themselves describes it, you create a prayer cell, or what they call - and this again, this is their language from their documents - an invisible believing group of god-led politicians who get together and talk with one another about what god wants them to do in their leadership capacity. and that's the nature of their relationship with museveni.
green: i think in addition to this context these particular issues of cultural change around, for example, attitudes towards lgbt rights - he's referring to something broader which has been a hallmark of the religious right since it was born. it's this idea that the culture is in decline and that people with traditional religious views are under attack. he's tapping into a deep vein of thinking here, a fear that religious beliefs will no longer be admissible in the public sphere.

the very nature of patti smith's debut album horses rails against what many other best of albums are celebrated for — broad appeal, sonically pleasing aesthetics and hits. horses is confrontational, defiant and completely unafraid of the ugly. and so was its author, who in 1975, for arguably the first time in music, set the lyrical stage for academia and animalism to writhe together; for the sophisticated and heady virtues of capital-p poetry to crash into the visceral, bodily base of rock and roll. any beauty on horses feels like a bi-product of story — from smith's breathless bleating to wailing and warbling against collaborator lenny kaye's characteristically jagged guitar to her historic presentation on the album's cover. as photographed by robert mapplethorpe, smith's unapologetic androgyny predates a time when that was an en vogue or even available option for women, and represents a seminal moment in the reversal of the female gaze. smith is looking at you, and could care less what you think about looking at her. that was radical for a woman in 1975. it is still radical today. there are legions of artists who cite patti smith's horses as an earth-shattering influence, from courtney love to r.e.m's michael stipe to garbage's shirley manson to the smiths' johnny marr — but they don't necessarily reflect smith's influence in terms of sound so much as attitude. it was her unfiltered, fearless singularity that galvanized believers in the church of smith not to become more like her but to become more like themselves.

archibald: well, if america loves jeff sessions, it will love whoever is likely to win this race because you have congressman mo brooks, who is, i guess, most known recently for talking about the war on white people. and you have roy moore who, as you've mentioned, has twice been booted out of the alabama supreme court for failure to follow federal court orders.
sydney harper and peter granitz produced and edited this interview for broadcast. milton guevara adapted it for the web.
mayer: well, and that's according to a study by a group called the checks and balances program. and you can count them. you can see it online. they're - that's in the white house. there are also many, many people who've worked for the kochs in the government at large, in the cabinet, in the other departments. and a tremendous number of people who work with and for pence have gone in and out of working for the kochs to the point that you had politico saying - they quoted a republican operative saying that the koch operation really was the shadow campaign for pence for president.
the latest campaign finance reports came out. trump has about $1.3 million of cash on hand. hillary clinton has $42 million. in a moment, npr's mara liasson will look past that huge gap to see what else republicans are worried about.
in the early days of the obama administration, bagenstos worked in the civil rights division of the justice department, and says it was a clear priority within the white house to try and see where — within existing law — they could extend more protections against discrimination to lgbt individuals.
after a video that detailed his tenure in the white house — his speeches during mass shootings, his handling of the great recession, his supreme court nominations, passage of the affordable care act, and a supreme court decision making same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states — obama took the stage.
the vatican's message cited francis' own words from 2016, when he wrote, there are absolutely no grounds for considering homosexual unions to be in any way similar or even remotely analogous to god's plan for marriage and family.
gross: so who is the head of this new conscience and religious freedom division?
the sense of being persecuted in contemporary america and besieged by global islam is a common conviction among many of the president's backers. these include millions of families who have withdrawn from the public school system, educating their children in church or charter schools or at home to escape the secularism and perceived hostility to religion in the public schools.
lgbtq people of color are six times more likely to say they have avoided calling the police (30 percent) owing to concern about anti-lgbtq discrimination, compared with white lgbtq people (5 percent).
lloyd has opposed contraception. he's been involved in broader issues related to ending life. he had worked with terri schiavo's parents, if your listeners remember that case - terri schiavo, who was essentially brain dead and the issue of whether or not to end her life. but lloyd had gotten involved in that fight too. what is interesting, terry, is he's running this office about refugee resettlement, but up until this point, he had no expertise in refugee resettlement. he was really more known for his cultural beliefs and work in health care around what advocates would say are pro-life issues.
the supreme court's order refers to title vii, the part of the civil rights act of 1964 that prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin. in recent years, lower federal courts have disagreed on whether the same protections should apply to people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. that divide can be seen in the trio of cases now up for review.
that means many teachers would probably skip such courses or use the time for other subjects, liu suspects. i don't think i'm surrounded by many like-minded teachers.

pope francis has been viewed with cautious optimism by lgbtq groups because of remarks like his statement, widely published in 2020, that homosexuals are part of the family and that same-sex and other nontraditional couples need a civil union law. but rights advocates also noted that the pope's remarks didn't promise a change within the church, saying the comment seemed to reflect his own opinions, rather than a shift in catholic doctrine.
klein: neal, i'd like you to just do this for the journey.
the three nominees who have withdrawn are not the only ones who could have problems. damien schiff, nominated for the court of federal claims, wrote a blog post that called supreme court justice anthony kennedy a judicial prostitute. another, thomas farr, has been accused of lying about his role in suppressing the black vote in north carolina. both have been approved by the senate judiciary committee, and are awaiting confirmation.
if you think about it, the numbers are kind of shocking. thirty-two percent of republicans say that african-americans face a lot of discrimination and 77 percent of democrats say the same. it's a 45-point partisan divide.
toobin: it had never been done before. i actually think it's kind of a good idea.
in one of his biggest debate moments of the campaign, trump fired back, calling new york a great place with loving people, wonderful people.
joe biden won primaries in nine of the 14 states that voted yesterday, super tuesday.
eventually, though, the case was dismissed by the alabama supreme court and the plaque got to stay, giving moore a new statewide status, according to the advertiser.
the problem with this campaign is we've been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light, moore said to a dwindling group of supporters tuesday night.

but even as public officials last week decried the racial disparity and its link to social conditions, the emergence of the issue also had a perverse effect. it apparently made it easier for some people living farther away to see the virus as someone else's problem.

trump is surrounded by strangers and political ignoramuses. they embarrassed the president tonight, said former trump adviser sam nunberg, blaming trump's political advisers — including daughter ivanka and son-in-law, jared kushner — for leading him astray in endorsing strange in the first place and later waffling on moore.
overall, our survey found 1.4 percent of americans identify as transgender, genderqueer and gender nonconforming. a june 2016 survey by the williams institute found that 0.6 percent of the adult u.s. population identifies as transgender but did not establish estimates for genderqueer or gender nonconforming adults.
in 2016, there came a point of impasse where the general conference asked for something different to happen. that led to a special general conference in 2019 - february of 2019 in which we were given the responsibility as elected delegates - i was one of those present - to try to find a way forward that would keep the church together but allow us to minister according to our conscience.
i'm michel martin, and this is tell me more from npr news.
as i mentioned before, the obamacare cases were very much structural arguments. congress doesn't have the power to issue the individual mandate. the executive branch doesn't have the power under the law to establish the marketplaces. now, of course, the obamacare cases were won by the obama administration in the supreme court, albeit narrowly. but if you see the trends of where the court is going, certainly those cases might well have come out the other way.

tur: 1992, i was - i think i was 8 when this happened. and it was scary. we - my brother and i couldn't stay in our home without my parents so we ended up having to stay with our grandparents for a little while during - especially during the riots. and my dad did sleep with a gun under his pillow. as a kid i wasn't afraid of ghosts. i wasn't afraid of monsters under my bed. i was afraid of somebody breaking into our home. i didn't sleep well as a child, looking back. i had a hard time getting through the night. it was - it was unnerving.
adams: we did not deal with public accommodations. we bookended this at housing and employment. and yet, i think if you walk down the streets of most cities in utah and ask people whether there was protections for the gay and lesbian community, they would say yes. most people don't differentiate between housing and employment protections and public accommodations.
sagal: ...they determined blank and blank.
he also suggests that the supreme court decision invalidates the marriage bans in michigan, kentucky, ohio and tennessee — that is, the specific laws named in obergefell — but not necessarily in alabama.
trump promised that part of the gop during his presidential campaign that he would appoint judges they like. now he is aggressively seeking to carry out that promise and remake the face of the federal judiciary.
the new traditionalist denomination, once separate, would open the door for the existing united methodist church to repeal the church's ban on same-sex marriages and lgbtq clergy.
we wanted to know more about this enduring institution, so we called diane winston, who tells the history of the salvation army in her book �red-hot and righteous: the urban religion of the salvation army.� diane winston is knight chair in media and religion at the university of southern california's annenberg school for communications. you should know we also extended an invitation to the national leadership of the salvation army, and they said they couldn't join us today because - they reminded us - this is their busiest time of year. makes sense, but we will keep trying.

meet mike pence, 'midwestern polite' with an unrelenting conservative message
prof. winston: i think the army has an iconic spot on the american landscape. i mean, they've been there long enough that you can watch a movie from the 1910s, the 1940s, 1980s, and if they want to evoke a sense of christmas, you will see a salvation army bell ringer. i mean, that's the way - that's a symbol for the holidays. and so i think they've managed to create an image amidst all the clutter because they've kept it simple.
a simple majority of 51 votes is required to confirm a supreme court nominee. senate republicans currently hold 51 seats. sen. john mccain, r-ariz., has been away from washington, d.c., while he is being treated for brain cancer, but vice president pence could cast a tiebreaking vote if needed.
he recognized then that he had probably been used, that he had misunderstood something of the president's character, said biographer william martin. that was a terrible blow to him and caused him to withdraw from the political arena.
it passed and my heart just sank, she says.
biden is catholic. he also supports abortion rights. here's what that could mean
you could view it as the ultimate swing constituency in the country, says matt schlapp, a conservative activist and co-chair of the newly formed catholics for trump coalition. he was speaking last month on ewtn, a catholic cable network.

in this case, as in so many others, justice kennedy's vote is likely to be pivotal. in a case testing partisan gerrymandering in 2004, kennedy said he was amenable to the idea of a limit on partisan gerrymandering, but he couldn't figure out a neutral test to gauge how much is too much. now, in a case from wisconsin, some progressive groups contend they have come up with a test that would work. the outcome will assuredly determine how our democracy functions in the years to come.
toobin: right. he had two - his two - it's really a remarkably sad story. his daughter...
brad harper of multnomah university, which affirms that sexual relationships are designed by god to be expressed solely within a marriage between a man and a woman, says he has seen growing anxiety about the future of federal aid at like-minded schools in recent years.
garcia-navarro: ross eventually left the church. but through a connection on facebook, she found a new religious home in the united methodist church, which she felt was more welcoming to lgbtq members. she joined two months ago. this past week, though, at a national meeting, officials and lay members of the united methodist church voted to maintain a global ban on same-sex marriages in the faith. the vote also affirmed its stance against lgbtq clergy. ross's own church is now wrestling with that decision. i spoke to kathryn ross about the challenges she faces in her new faith and how it's affected her relationship to her son.
(soundbite of the westerlies song, home)
gross: i mean, yes. ok, right.
nevertheless, given the extent to which he has thrown his weight behind yes, many observers regard this vote as a referendum partly on the popularity of his still-young tenure as prime minister. it's also a test of the apparent leftward shift of the electorate recently — also represented by varadkar himself, the first openly gay prime minister in a once-deeply conservative country that had banned homosexuality until just a quarter-century ago.
biden closed his speech by conjuring american exceptionalism.
the plaintiffs' victory was partial. as the times reports, the court said that there was no violation of article 24 because it relates to heterosexual marriage only, and it rejected the plaintiffs' demand for government compensation.
sagal: yes, the defense of marriage act.
and some of the, really the core rhetoric of the family is this idea that most of us misread the new testament, that christ's message - the bottom line of christ's message wasn't really about love or mercy or justice or forgiveness. it was about power. so doug coe, the leader of the group, tries to illustrate this, for instance, by saying, sort of posing a puzzle: name three men in the 20th century who best understood that message of the new testament. and most people are going to say someone like martin luther king, or bonhoeffer; or maybe they're more conservative, they're going to say billy graham. and coe likes to give in answer: hitler, stalin and mao, which just makes your jaw drop. and he will say - he's quick to say these are evil men, but they understood power. and that message recurs again, and again, and again in the family.
danforth: one thing i want to say about the character of lydia marsh is, at least in the novel, she was very informed by a woman named doctor - a doctor is questionable - elizabeth moberly (ph), who gets a lot of dubious credit for her early theories. she coined the term reparative therapy. she was doing a lot of work in this area in the 1980s. she was essentially a self-professed psychoanalyst. and she came up with this theory of part of the reason that people are gay is that they haven't had effective homosocial bonding, homosocial love with their parent. and a lot of this traces back to elizabeth moberly. so when i was thinking of lydia, i was thinking of this woman that loomed large in 1980s and 1990s discussions of reparative or conversion therapy. that's who i was channeling.

as someone who has embraced the pro-life position all of his life, he has a deep compassion for expected mothers and the unborn. the governor believes that it's important to focus on policies, as we advance the sanctity of life on those that are performing the abortions.
he likes being in charge. he has no qualms about telling people what to do and saying what he thinks needs to be done.
the law protects, among other things, state employees who refuse to license marriages, religious organizations who fire or discipline employees and individuals who decline to provide counseling or some medical services based on those oppositions.

and he goes to work at this think tank, and he kind of gets oriented into their ideology. and he gets a steady paycheck from them and then soon discovers his true gift in life, which is to take those policies and sell them to the public on radio. you've got the burgeoning then of sort of right-wing talk radio. and it turns out, mike pence is a great talker. he's been giving speeches since he was a kid in elementary school and winning speaking competitions. and he's really good at talking. and so this becomes the thing that kind of boosts mike pence in indiana. and he's been a loser when he first runs for office. ten years later, after being on talk radio for 10 years, he's on the radio all over the state. he's got big name recognition. he's got a rolodex full of connections. and this time, he wins and gets to congress.
baynes-dunning is a former juvenile court judge and had been on the center's board for a little over a year when fellow board members selected her as interim president and ceo to steer the organization through this crisis.
the presence in such relationships of positive elements, which are in themselves to be valued and appreciated, cannot justify these relationships and render them legitimate objects of an ecclesial blessing, the statement said.
trump and pence may not be soul mates, but they could form a marriage of convenience. pence brings a calmer temperament and popularity with the base that trump may need in a tough election fight. using language from the bible, pence suggested trump had made up his mind days ago, and he said, yes.
the law is not a broad religious-protections law, such as many recent controversial state laws. as we reported last week, the mississippi legislation protects only three beliefs or convictions: that marriage is between a man and a woman, that sex is properly reserved to such a marriage, and that words like male and female are objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at birth.

bryant, she said, became an icon in the fight against gay, lesbian and bisexual rights, traveling across the country to oppose similar ordinances. she formed a homophobic group, save our children, aimed at stopping the passage of lgbtq protections in counties across the u.s. and stopping openly gay, lesbian and bisexual people from teaching in schools.

the phrase, and they lived happily ever after — what we've come to consider the classic fairy tale ending — crops up often enough, with some variation, in the folk tales compiled by the brothers grimm. but while the virtuous and pure of heart in those stories often ended up blissfully co-existing in perpetuity, ol' jacob and wilhelm gleefully doled out some pretty gnarly, grisly and downright grim punishments to their various antagonists. (cinderella's step-sisters, for example. look it up. yowza.)
sagal: but people were like you were supposed to do it.
millies: religion, whether it's catholicism or not, is going to tell us something about a person. it's not going to tell us always something good or something bad, but it's just another piece of information to understand who a person is. who we should want in public life at the end of the day isn't a resume. i don't think certainly a job like president of the united states - there is no resume that can prepare anyone for it, not even someone with as much experience as joe biden. what we're looking for is decency. what we're looking for is empathy. what we're looking for is someone who understands that this job is about the people who are being served and not about the person who's sitting in the office.

inskeep: have people in utah now been talking about trans people and bathrooms?
klein: they tried antifreeze, turpentine, rat poison. later they just tried running him over, but that didn't work either.
my concern is that somebody would make a decision against christianity because of mr. trump's behavior. and that's my high concern here. and to that person i would say, the way he speaks about people is not the way our master, our savior has taught us to speak; it's not the way our scriptures urge us to speak. the bible urges us to be respectful to all people, especially people with whom we have disagreements, to never libel people, to never label people. now, this is a huge deal in scripture, and so i would encourage that person, and the reason i've gone so verbal and vocal with this is because i'm protective of the reputation of christ and the church, and i would ask that person not to interpret the christian faith through the words of mr. trump.
this is one of the pieces of journalism — both the weekly [television show] and the article — that i'm most proud of, silver-greenberg says. and i'm proud of us for showing our process in this.

trump's campaign released a statement on dec. 7, 2015, calling for total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.
now, what does this mean in practical terms? what it means is that the courts are going to limit the power of government in efforts to address problems. the most obvious, dramatic were the obamacare lawsuits. remember, there was one lawsuit that said congress did not have the power under the commerce clause to establish the individual mandate, the requirement that people buy insurance. there was another lawsuit that said the text of the obamacare law didn't allow for the marketplaces to - the insurance marketplaces to work. both of those were very structural arguments that said unless the constitution specifically authorizes the government to do something, the government can't do it. and unless a law specifically authorizes the government to take a certain action, the government can't do it. all of that, traditionally, the courts had said, look, we want to give the government, congress, the executive branch, leeway to operate. we want to give them leeway to address the problems in the society.
saffo says newsom seems to share what he calls their disrespect for authority. the entrepreneurs' creed is that it's always easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.
but as the associated press reports, the sapporo district court found that banning same-sex marriages violates article 14 of the japanese constitution, which prohibits discrimination due to race, creed, sex, social status or family origin. it said that because sexual orientation is not a choice, it is discriminatory not to afford marital benefits to same-sex couples.
you know, the - my way of thinking if there wasn't a one instance of two boys getting a job dressing as girls to dance with minors in a town like daggsville, i'd be very surprised with the great cornucopia of work in america. i mean, it might have died a death hours later, but i'm sure it must have happened.

in recent years, the democrats that they've identified, guys like bart stupak, heath shuler, mike mcintyre, mark pryor, even senator bill nelson down in florida, another conservative democrat, they are a faction within the democratic party that has become an obstacle to many of the core values of the party. that's what the family means when they speak of bipartisanship as this idea that jesus doesn't come to take sides, he comes to take over. the democrats do tend to be folks who get into congress, and i think a lot of them - i think this needs to be emphasized - democrats and republicans get involved with this with the best of intentions.
while the family leader might be an unconventional and uncomfortable forum, democrats should consider it, says christopher hale, a faith adviser to president obama's 2012 campaign.

a bill called the equality act has been kicking around congress for decades — it was first introduced in 1974, just 10 years after the civil rights act became law. the current version of the equality act would enshrine in law many of the protections conferred by the obama administration's rules and policies, by explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in education, federal funding, employment, housing, and more. last year, the democrat-controlled house passed the bill and sent it to the republican-controlled senate, where it is not expected to be brought up for a vote.

there are procedures that trans patients might be seeking that aren't necessarily emergency care - hormonal therapy, fertility treatment, whatever it might be that could be seen as more elective. and those are things that advocacy groups had fought very hard to win and protect. and the trump administration is already backing away from those protections, which is a major blow for trans folks.

that morning, i was assigned donald trump full time. and i sped up there from new york to new hampshire, driving there when a normal person - any political pro - would've flown. i just make it to this rally. it is raining. it is an awkward, curious event. and i'm standing there, writing down what he's saying on my phone, tweeting some of the things that he's saying as well, when suddenly, i hear my name. and i don't look up because i presume he's not talking about me, and my producer nudges me hard in the side. and there he is. he's pointing at me, looking at me, and so is the entire crowd and all the other reporters. and he says, katy, you're not paying attention. and i looked at him, and i yelled back out, i'm tweeting what you're saying, to which he seemed happy to hear. and that was the beginning of my interaction and my relationship with donald trump.
this dynamic holds not only for the mega-metros but for medium-sized and small cities as well. the people who choose to move into town or head for the bright lights are often seeking higher education or greater economic opportunity, wilkinson says, or they are self-sorting as individuals attracted to what cities have to offer — including diversity.

and what they started doing was setting up satellites all across the country. it was something called the state policy network. and it's just a sort of a web of pro-corporate, anti-tax, anti-regulatory think tanks that's spreading across the country. and it was actually reagan's idea to do this. and there was one particular funder named thomas rowe at the heritage foundation who said famously, you take the soviet union, i'm taking over the states. and so there's sort of this corporate-funded right-wing movement in the early '80s to take over the states. and that's the group that bails out pence. he's looking for what to do with his life. his law practice is nothing special. i talked to lawyers about him. he's sort of doing really kind of crummy little cases.

pressed at his confirmation hearing by sen. dianne feinstein, d-calif., bush said he regretted having equated the supreme court's 1857 decision upholding slavery with the court's 1973 roe v. wade abortion decision, and he maintained that he would have no difficulty following the roe ruling.
though the u.s. had a history of discrimination, buchert realized, there is just so much case law holding that trans people are protected when it comes to discrimination on the basis of sex. the obama administration's school guidance — in her view — was correctly applying that existing law.
mohler says the church position on complementary gender roles may seem outdated but comes straight from the bible.
the result could well be the reversal of roe v. wade, the court's 1973 abortion decision; a court more hostile to the regulation of wall street; a court far more deferential to religious objections to anti-discrimination laws; and many more such dramatic legal turns to the right.

he says probate judges have greater responsibility, for instance, they're charged with making sure that couples are old enough and able to consent to marriage.

vice president biden united the crowd simply by walking onstage to the theme of rocky.
democrats likely will have no input — there is no need to extend an olive branch to the other side, as there was when president obama picked merrick garland, in part because republicans controlled the senate.

trump was unusually restrained on twitter late tuesday, congratulating jones and refraining from placing blame.
but actually changing the system could be remarkably difficult for a political system that's already near paralysis. some lawyers said the change could be made by lawmakers, but others have concluded it would require amending the constitution. to do that, the house and senate would need to vote their support, and then three-quarters of the states would have to approve. another path would be for two-thirds of the states to call for a constitutional convention.

to moore and his supporters, that defiance is a badge of honor. and it's a big reason many voters are likely reluctant to believe the sexual misconduct and sexual assault allegations against him too, given the christian nationalist positions he has wholeheartedly embraced in the past. and at the crux of that is a stringent opposition to abortion.

the southern poverty law center called moore's order a dead letter, writing that in no way does his administrative order supersede judge granade's federal injunction.

the dilemma for voters is not dissimilar from the one some republicans faced in last year's presidential election. even if they disliked trump or thought that the sexual assault allegations that had been levied against him were true, for many the abortion issue and the possibility of appointing anti-abortion judges to the supreme court was a major deciding factor.

update at 7:15 p.m. et. harry reid rips republicans:
america's culture war, waged in recent years over gender roles, sexuality and the definition of marriage, is increasingly being fought inside evangelical christian circles. on one side are the christians determined to resist trends in secular society that appear to conflict with biblical teaching. on the other side are the evangelicals willing to live with those trends.
elliott: well, he's facing an impeachment push in the legislature and then multiple investigations by both state and federal authorities. so the legal questions here involve whether governor bentley misused state resources to cover up what was going on. bentley, who is 73, denies a physical affair. but he has admitted to making inappropriate remarks to his 44-year-old former senior political adviser rebekah caldwell mason. and tape recordings of those conversations have been made public. mason resigned, and ever since bentley has been under increasing pressure to resign himself.

still, the 57-year-old pence is, in many ways, the do-no-harm choice as trump's running mate. he may not expand trump's appeal outside the gop base, but establishment republicans are comfortable with him, and social conservatives seem to have forgiven him for the fix.

the court's (obergefell) opinion speaks repeatedly of homosexuals being humiliated, demeaned, and being denied 'equal dignity' by a state's refusal to issue them marriage licenses, moore wrote in response to obergefell v. hodges. the majority seeks to invoke the grief, sorrow and compassion associated with a greek tragedy. riding a tidal wave of emotion, the ensuing tears and pathos then suffice to fertilize a new constitutional right nowhere mentioned in the constitution itself.

the obama administration was working to advance lgbtq rights within the scope of what the law permitted, says anthony kreis, the law professor who studies lgbtq discrimination. the trump administration is — tit for tat — going back and trying to reverse-engineer every single one of those advances.
there was no way to verify that claim, however, because billy graham himself never said a word about the book or its controversial message. in his final years, he appeared to have little control over what was said or done in his name.

the win by jones, projected by the associated press two hours after the polls closed tuesday night, is sure to send shock waves through washington. the special election to replace attorney general jeff sessions, who left the senate in february, was upended in november as multiple women came forward to say moore had pursued them romantically as teenagers when he was in his 30s. some alleged he had sexually assaulted them, including one woman who said he had initiated sexual contact with her when she was just 14. moore has denied the accusations.

the montgomery advertiser wrote in a recent profile of moore that the original lawsuit was dismissed due to lack of standing, but then-gov. fob james — who once pledged to send the national guard to defend the plaque — sued to get a ruling on the constitutionality of moore's actions. in 1996, montgomery county judge charles price initially ordered moore to stop the prayer but allowed the ten commandments plaque to be displayed; however, he ordered the plaque removed after visiting moore's courtroom the following year.
some critics noted, however, that the orlando resolution made no mention of lgbt rights or the fact that many of the victims appear to have been targeted because of their sexuality. the constitution of the southern baptist convention explicitly states that churches that affirm, approve, or endorse homosexual behavior are not in cooperation with the organization as a whole, and the organization has repeatedly passed resolutions condemning homosexuality. this year, a new resolution reiterated the belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.
there is little doubt about kennedy's mark on history. quite simply, he remade the face of marriage in america. more than any other justice, he was responsible for the advancement of lgbt rights. he wrote four of the court's opinions on the subject over nearly two decades and ultimately declared marriage between two people of the same sex a fundamental right protected by the constitution.

the one thing about the army is that they have a genius for marketing and publicity. you asked me about the uniform, and initially booth had done it because he wanted the association with the actual british army. and he wanted to equalize soldiers who might come from different backgrounds. but it also was a branding tool. i mean, i doubt he said branding, but he was a tremendous advertiser. the army developed all these things, from the flag to the uniform to the kettle, which helped stamp the army brand in the public square.

progress on this journey often comes in small increments, sometimes two steps forward, one step back, obama said during a rose garden celebration hours after the high court's decision was announced. and then sometimes, there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.
diamond: it's certainly more in line with what we would see from any republican administration. i do want to clarify, terry, anytime there's a political handoff - and in this case we're coming off the obama administration which had spent eight years advancing abortion rights, changing the definition of protections for transgender patients and other more liberal policies - there was going to be a course correction under a republican president. any republican president would have instituted more of a focus against abortion. i think the question here is are these new leaders plucked by trump from non-traditional roles doing things that are substantively different than their predecessors under previous republican administrations? and there's a lot of evidence that suggests, yes, they are.
the trump administration has also launched a plan to end the hiv epidemic — a commitment that, when achieved, will save lgbt lives across the country, deere says.

green: the doj always has a choice about the types of cases that it's going to prioritize. it can choose to put lawyers on a certain case that's brought in with a complaint or not. it can choose to make statements and make a lot of press releases around certain types of issues or not. what we can see here is a promise, a guarantee that jeff sessions' doj is going to be putting resources, efforts and manpower into litigating cases that have to do with violations of religious liberty in the way that they see it.
toobin: that's right. and he's very open about that and very proud of that. and, you know - and he says, look, this is what we want to do. we want you, when you're a law student, to go to federalist society events, listen to our guest speakers. we want you to then clerk for a judge who had been a federalist society member. and then after you've been practicing for a few years, maybe one of your colleagues will get a job in government and he or she will bring you in. and then ultimately, we will, you know, have a president who will be sympathetic, and that president may appoint you to the bench. and, you know, the pipeline is a very evocative metaphor because leo wants to basically take a young conservative in law school and groom that person throughout his or her career so that they may wind up to be neil gorsuch. and if they don't wind up to be neil gorsuch, they'll wind up to be some judge on the 10th circuit or a district court judge or a member of congress or a member of the city council in their town. they are a full service pipeline of taking conservative law students and turning them into public figures and public servants. and, you know, but there's nothing secretive about it.

as pence noted with this self-deprecating joke at the republican national convention, he and trump couldn't be more different in their styles: you know, he's a man known for a large personality, a colorful style and lots of charisma, pence joked. and so, i guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket.
and when rachana got the first tip and she brought it to me a few days later, we quickly realized that one challenge was going to be, how can we prove this if we didn't even know where he was going until three or four days later? and that's what led to the airport stakeouts. once we started to get a little bit more information about where he was going, we needed to see for ourselves price and his staff getting on and off the plane. and dulles turned out to be a good vantage point to do that, though we had had some failures up until that moment.

toobin: but there are variations. but i think it is certainly on the right of the party overall, and neil gorsuch is on the right of the party. and let me give you an example because this is something that was really a revelation to me in writing the story in the new yorker, which was, you know, i was very familiar with the idea of originalism and the idea that if you follow justice scalia's views of the constitution, james madison didn't think he was recognizing gay rights, so there shouldn't be any recognition of gay rights, abortion rights. but there's something deeper that leonard leo talks about, and gorsuch talks about it a little bit, albeit in coded ways. and that's when he talks about the structure of the constitution. this has become a big buzz word in conservative circles in recent years, the structure of the constitution. and by that, he means that the different branches of government have clearly and narrowly defined roles. and if they stray outside the lines, it's the job of the courts to discipline the other branches of government.

beck: (singing) i've got two turntables and a microphone.
diamond: it's still unclear what the strategic plan will have. and if it does say that life begins at conception, that's a big win symbolically for christian conservatives, evangelical groups who firmly believe that and will be able to tout it and say, look - the trump administration, the government now agree with our position. and there are possible implications down the road because if that's the hhs position, they'll be able to use that to defend different policy outcomes.

and that has been my very strong view about questions of personal behavior with women, with any of those things - that we need to know everything so we can make that judgment.
simone's 1965 album, also entitled i put a spell on you, is the closest you'll ever hear her come to pop. the swaying strings and delicate vocals of marriage is for old folks give you a sense of simone's incredible musical range. plus it's a joyful reminder of the humor people forgot simone possessed once she became the siren of the civil rights movement with searing songs like 1964's mississippi goddam. the standout on this album, feeling good, is a number that simone transformed from a show tune for a barely-remembered british musical into a gold-standard strutter. simone's version trades wide-eyed pouting for unadulterated power, from the opening bars — featuring her voice and nothing else -- to the brass line that bows down to her pipes. by the time she careens towards the climax, you know this woman has indeed put a spell on you — and just about anyone else that dares get in her way. —audie cornish (host, all things considered)

the chief justice of the alabama supreme court has issued an administrative order, directing probate judges that they may not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, despite the u.s. supreme court's decision last year on marriage equality. we have grave concerns about this order, which directs alabama probate judges to disobey the ruling of the supreme court, said u.s. attorneys joyce white vance of the northern district of alabama and kenyen brown of the southern district of alabama. government officials are free to disagree with the law, but not to disobey it. this issue has been decided by the highest court in the land and alabama must follow that law.

and a case that tests whether there is a constitutional limit to the practice of partisan gerrymandering. at issue is whether the party in power can perpetuate and increase its influence by packing its opponents into a small number of legislative districts, or carefully dispersing its opponents into so many different districts that the opposing party has little to no chance of winning in most districts. partisan gerrymandering has existed since the founding of the republic, but with the advent of high-powered computers, the practice has become so refined — and effective — that increasingly, congressional districts and state legislative districts have been all but walled off from competition.

tur: because i don't want to color my own opinion. i think that if i was voting, i would feel like i had a horse in the race, and i don't have a horse in the race. my job during this campaign season was to tell you what was going on as accurately as i could and without bias, without coloring it with a desire that i might have, internally, for a different outcome. and i feel very strongly about that, personally. i know everyone has their own opinions on this, but i feel very strongly about it. so if i am covering politics or if i'm covering, specifically, a presidential race, i don't think it's appropriate to vote.

after gorsuch was confirmed, there still were some steps left for democrats to use to block trump's lower court judges — namely the so-called blue-slip system by which nominees traditionally are not considered unless both home state senators return a blue approval slip.

akhavan: i know. it's from so recently, and yet it feels very dated to me. i guess - but basically that was - it took a journey to get there, and it's changed my life. we were both in grad school at nyu for directing films. and we had just both spent thousands of dollars we didn't have in loan money on making short films and spending a year laboring over these 10-minute films that we shot on 16 mm and, you know, had crews of 40-plus people. and just - and then - i mean, i can't speak for ingrid, but i felt that i had failed with my film. i didn't really know what it was. it didn't feel genuine or authentic. i didn't feel in the driver's seat of it. like, every time i'd look at the frame, i would be paralyzed with fear. i'd think, like - oh, god, would noah baumbach approve that frame?

it seemed like a odd use of tens of thousands of dollars in private jet funds, so i called around to all these different health care leaders in nashville - did you meet with tom price? - just trying to kind of reconstruct his schedule in reverse. and that's how we were able to figure out that he was in nashville in part to have lunch with his son. he was only on the ground for a few hours there, and having the lunch was one of the big focuses of that trip. so that kind of effort was necessary to just build out price's schedule, get the contracts involved, get the dollars, and get to this point where we were able to say, over five months in office, he spent more than a million dollars on charter jet travel, about half of that in the united states and then, you know, a little more than that when he was traveling abroad to events where he brought his wife, which is a little less unusual. cabinet officials will take these charter jets, these gulfstreams that the u.s. air force owns, when they're traveling abroad. but it was notable given that that's what tom price was spending his time on at a moment when republicans were trying to achieve priorities like repeal the aca.
stahl then reminded trump that he had harped on this very vote as evidence of hillary clinton's bad judgment.

but remember, terry, these things get planned well in advance. political candidates get matched up to political correspondents. we know who's running and we know who's going to cover them. high-profile people get high-profile correspondents. donald trump was not a part of anyone's plan. and for that matter, neither was i. it's a political outsider in trump. it's a political outsider in me. so they matched us together and - what they thought would have been six weeks because nobody was taking donald trump seriously. they presumed he would eventually drop out, that it was just an attention-getting stunt. they said, hey, listen, it'll be - it'll be short and then we'll send you back to london. and i signed on saying, ok, you know, if i hate it, at least it will be short. and it just never ended. he was serious and people were not laughing him off stage as some might have expected during a presidential debate. they were cheering him on. and his poll numbers only went up and up and up and up. and i suddenly found myself on a rollercoaster that i could not get off of.
participants voted to approve a resolution urging southern baptist churches and families to welcome refugees, affirming that refugees are people loved by god, made in his image, and that christian love should be extended to them as special objects of god's mercy in a world that has displaced them from their homelands.
in a statement supporting the church, the u.s. justice department said, the city appears to have thereby singled churches out as the only essential service ... that may not operate despite following ... recommendations regarding social distancing. the greenville mayor subsequently lifted the ban on the church's gatherings.

gerg is the code-name that i saved my partner at the time's name in my phone, so that nobody would look through my phone and see that i was dating a man. because when someone sends you a text, the notifications come up on your phone and i didn't want it to come up with a man's name. so it was kind of the pet name that i saved him as in my phone.
the president had come to moore's defense, casting doubt on the women's allegations — much as he has done with the multiple women who have accused him of sexual assault. while trump didn't campaign with moore, he did hold a rally just across the border from alabama in pensacola, fla., on friday evening and recorded a robocall on his behalf, urging voters to choose moore because he would support his agenda in the senate. and after trump reaffirmed his endorsement for moore last week, the republican national committee reinstated its financial support for the gop nominee after having pulled it following the accusations.
in other interviews with christian right publications, he said, i use my role as a u.s. senator to open the doors to power. in other words, he presents himself as representing the united states. he also, frankly, is flying into these countries on military transport, and he is this powerful u.s. senator.

gross: so have women in the administration spoken to you about feeling that they've been left out of certain things because of that rule that mike pence follows?
there has never been any guarantee that trump will limit his choices to his campaign lists. indeed, when released the lists were viewed as a way of quelling the fears of religious and social conservatives.
gross: so that was at a press conference. when you - when he was saying insulting things to you at rallies, what got the biggest, angriest response - angry at you, not at him.

buttigieg could face some hurdles on his record on race issues. for example, a 2015 instance surfaced this week of buttigieg saying all lives matter, a statement often seen as diminishing the black lives matter movement.
martin: so can you just remind us of what brought this to a head? i mean, the fact is, in some parts of the country, there are already lgbtq clergy. and some ministers perform same-sex marriages. others didn't. but then there are also individual ministers who are being sanctioned and even defrocked for doing the same thing. i mean, so what was the status quo? and what brought this all to a head?
gjelten: here's an example. a bakery with fewer than 14 employees could refuse, on the basis of religious beliefs, to design a custom wedding cake for a gay couple. but a bakery with 15 or more employees could not turn a gay couple away. the problem, of course, is that compromises don't please everyone. on the right, the heritage foundation has come out strongly against the legislation.
not only will the tpp undermine our economy, trump said, but it will undermine our independence. that's what's happened. the tpp creates a new international commission that makes decisions the american people are no longer given the right to veto.
klein: we're really selling your stand-up special.
it's just a - you would never have predicted this from the language during the campaign when you had supposedly the kochs at war with trump and vice versa, but there's this huge rapprochement going on. and as sheldon whitehouse, a democratic senator from rhode island, said to me, what you see then is the sort of the agenda items of the kochs are moving up one by one. and the things they complained about about trump are being jettisoned.
toobin: you know, i don't know a lot about his religious views. he was raised a catholic, as i understand it. but he married a british woman, who belonged to the church of england, anglican church. and as a result, they now go to an episcopal church in boulder, colo. i think more significant or in addition to his religious views, you know, the book he wrote about - which was about assisted suicide and the moral dilemmas surrounding right to die laws and the whole issues surrounding, you know, end of life care.

there is something that doesn't connect any more between faith and the democrat party, mulvaney said. you may like democrats, but you put the democrats in charge, and the values that you carry as a roman catholic are going to suffer. the party's near-unanimous support for abortion rights, mulvaney suggested, was by itself disqualifying.
for them, one alternative is ridgewood baptist church in a working-class suburb of louisville. the pastor, matt johnson, grew up as a southern baptist, but his church is one of a group that broke from the southern baptist convention about 25 years ago. it now serves a diverse congregation, and the men and women who make up johnson's lay advisory dawnings committee advocate that it opens doors to everyday people.
akhavan: i think there's something really beautiful in that. your sexual instincts are being kind of beaten out of you with a twisted version of the bible. but at the same time, you're connecting to people who are like you. and you're no longer isolated because you imagine these people who end up in therapy centers aren't able to connect to openly queer kids around them.

doty centers his book around whitman's iconic poetry collection, leaves of grass. whitman anonymously self-published in 1855, revising and re-publishing the collection many times thereafter. grass is printer-speak for dummy pages that test the set and centering of text on a page. this pun adds a wonderful wrinkle to whitman's re-invention of poetry — his overflowing lines that lack rhyme and predictable meter, his use of white space where none had been before.

and pence apparently has a very good sense of humor, too. i was sorry he didn't - he didn't grant an interview with me, but people describe him as, you know, despite his kind of severe views of things, very affable, very likable. and, you know, he often talks about how i'm a conservative, but i'm not in a bad mood about it.
and some defenders say that hhs is right to establish a new division. it's not really a change in policy, it's just strengthening the policy in place. there's some truth to that, but i think it lacks context. the office of civil rights at hhs already had a team devoted to protecting all civil rights which included religious freedom. what this move is essentially doing is carving out an entire new team just focused on religious freedom that is co-equal to the team devoted to all other civil rights issues like age, disability, race, gender. and historically, there have been so many more complaints about those kinds of issues and discrimination than just religious freedom.
i think my mother would want me to do whatever she thought i wanted to do. my mother, i write about it in the book, when she was in the hospital — and it was when i was just starting my race for attorney general — she had, at that point, disassociated from many things. she was turning things off. she was otherwise a voracious reader and passionate. she'd scream at the tv when necessary, when some debate was happening. and she was laying with her face turning the other way so her back was where i was, because i was just spending time with her. and then she said, kamala, how's the race coming along? and i said, well mommy, they say they're gonna kick my ass. and she turned around in the bed and looked at me with this big smile across her face — and that says it all.

tur: so i came home to do that, and it was a wonderful experience. the boy's name was aaron. he and his family are incredible people, really strong and brave people. and then when i was done doing that and when they went home, i went into the newsroom and i said hello to my bosses because i needed to remind them that i existed. when you live in an overseas bureau, you tend to get forgotten if there's not a lot of news happening. and i was literally just standing around the newsroom when business after business started dropping donald trump after his announcement where he talked about mexico sending rapists into the country. and a friend of mine bradd jaffy, who works on nightly news, said katy tur's just standing around. she can do this. and i was. i was just standing around. so i did a couple stories for nightly and i did a couple stories for the today show. and a few days later, the president of nbc news said we need to have - we need to have somebody on donald trump. wherever this goes, we need to have a correspondent on donald trump.

millennials are looking at the issue of gay marriage, and more and more they are saying, 'ok, we know the bible talks about this, but we just don't see this as an essential of the faith,'  says brad harper, a professor of theology and religious history at multnomah university, an evangelical christian institution in portland, ore.

garcia-navarro: so i have to ask you. what was your reaction to the vote this past week against same-sex marriage?
takano: i've always been true blue no matter who, and i would stand behind joe biden if he ends up getting more delegates in - you know, pledged delegates before the convention, absolutely. defeating donald trump is our no. 1 objective. and bernie sanders has - you know, bernie sanders has determined the terms of this debate. and we - joe biden is a far more progressive candidate than he would have been without joe - without bernie sanders.
the california supreme court soon put a stop to the weddings, but four years later, it ruled 4-3 that preventing same-sex couples from marrying violated the state constitution. it helped pave the way for a u.s. supreme court decision 10 years later legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.

since then, trump has been fairly consistent in his call to ban muslims from entering the country, despite widespread criticism at the extreme remark and some in his campaign signaling that it may soften to only include countries that have a record of terrorism.

schlumpf: some people are upset about the general lack of privacy. a number of people have already accepted that that's going to happen, but again, found it problematic that it's being used in churches. now, it's important to note that the churches themselves were not aware and had not consented in any way that the data of their worship attendees was being collected.
moore has to defeat democrat doug jones, a former u.s. attorney, to get to the capitol. republican leadership has warned that a moore victory in the primary would make securing what should be a safe seat more difficult for the party. president trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell backed moore's primary opponent, sen. luther strange.

takano: well, we had other progressives in the race, and i had promised my supporters in my district that i would allow the voters in my district to make that decision. and they did, and they spoke loudly and clearly. they are young voters, many of them latino, and i think the party and all of us need to show them some respect. and they're the future. and, you know, bernie sanders definitely spoke to them loud and clear, and they responded.
toobin: you said it shorter than i did, terry, but that's exactly what he did. i mean - and i think if you listened to conservatives throughout the fall, a lot of whom had a great deal of distaste for trump personally, they you know, his political history was checkered to say the least, his personal history was more than checkered. but you often heard it - i mean, i heard paul ryan say it many times - well, you know, i'm confident that trump will appoint the right people to the supreme court. and they made that bet on trump. trump got enormous support in the republican party - basically the same or better than mitt romney got four years earlier. and i think the fact that he was committed to appointing conservatives to the supreme court was a big factor in that. so i think it was a very clever strategy on trump's part and of course on leonard leo's part in essentially being the person who made the list that the president drew from.
i think that, you know, what's amazing to see is that ... all these people we get to know, the daughters of kobani, they all take their journeys in their families. so one of their uncles, rosja, when she was a girl, her uncle dressed up as a ghost to keep her from playing soccer with her cousin because girls couldn't play soccer without bringing shame on their family. now, that same uncle calls her and asks her for advice and ask her for help settling disputes in the family. and so i think that whole idea of — if you could see it, you can be it, right, this whole idea of women leading, has really infused the area. it's obviously a work in progress and not perfect, but it really does look different than anything i have seen and i've had the privilege of being in many places around the world.
the trump administration already has taken steps to try to disqualify most transgender people from serving in the military.
he said the new law merely reinforces existing religious freedom rights, does not limit any constitutionally protected rights or actions and does not challenge federal law.
i think what's tricky, terry, is historically, the strategic plan was more of a symbolic document than a practical one. but we are watching as this administration is finding new ways, whether it's the office of refugee resettlement, the office of civil rights, some other things that have happened around the agency - finding new ways to use the regulatory structure to support this agenda of anti-abortion moves.

diamond: he basically said that trump should get a mulligan on his previous 70 years or so. and it's a fascinating interview to listen to because the question comes up again and again - how to judge this man who has done things that - things that aren't very christian, who has used language that isn't very christian. as my colleague isaac pointed out, so much for turning the other cheek. and tony perkins said, yeah, but we only have two cheeks; it's good to see someone fighting back and standing up for our kind of beliefs, and whether that means attacking his critics in a way that would not be very biblical - christian conservatives kind of like that he is rallying to their cause.
how are you doing now, may we ask?
mayer: well, so he is probably as stridently anti-abortion as anybody in american politics. and there was a bill passed actually in indiana when he was governor there - which is where he went after being in congress - that really defined the most kind of far-out anti-abortion legislation in the country. it was a bill that said that when women have abortions, they have to bury the fetus in a full burial. the state requires it. and if they have a miscarriage, they have to have a full burial for that. and it also banned the ability of women to have an abortion if the fetus had some kind of developmental anomaly, so something like, you know, down syndrome or something else, something even worse. it was a bill that was so intrusive on women's rights that women took up a protest effort against it in indiana.

behind all of these reversals is the trump administration's position that being gay or transgender is a category of identity that is different from biological sex, and therefore not protected under current law — a complete about-face from the position taken by the obama administration.
change came through the efforts of pioneering individuals and grassroots groups. for instance, in my book i document the life of selvi, one of the very first sex workers to be identified with hiv, back in 1986. she suffered [an] abusive marriage, years of selling sex to support herself and her young son, her hiv diagnosis and then long years of imprisonment because she was an hiv-infected sex worker.

mr. sharlet: well, the new legislation adds to this something called aggravated homosexuality. and this can include, for instance, if a gay man has sex with another man who is disabled, that's aggravated homosexuality, and that man can be - i suppose both, actually, could be put to death for this. the use of any drugs or any intoxicants in seeking gay sex - in other words, you go to a bar and you buy a guy a drink, you're subject to the death penalty if you go home and sleep together after that. what it also does is it extends this outward, so that if you know a gay person and you don't report it, that could mean - you don't report your son or daughter, you can go to prison.

truth be told, i believe that the plan was that she would then get that degree and come back and have a good arranged marriage in india, but my mother being who she was, the daughter of a father who fought for india's independence, she was naturally attracted to the civil rights movement that was exploding all over the united states — but also in the bay area... she became very involved in the civil rights movement, and met my father. instead of going back to india and having an arranged marriage, she had a marriage based on love. and that really was, in many ways, an ultimate act of courage and optimism and really set in place the foundation for how i think of the world.
this is the last song that i wrote for the album. the song talks about a relationship i had while i was living in england where i felt that i had to sneak around and hide this person from everyone in my life, because i grew up in a very religious background. and even though everyone was so good to me, i hadn't come out to them yet in this way, and i was in a same-sex relationship. i kind of did it behind everyone's backs in a way.
in his speech to the breakfast, trump promoted his administration's record in matters of faith, such as his effort to secure the freedom of andrew brunson, an evangelical pastor who spent two years in a turkish prison. turning to brunson, who was in the audience, trump took credit for his release in october 2018.
tur: i guess it - it put me onto the political scene in a significant way. you know, it was a really contentious, intense interview. i didn't realize how angry he was. in the moment while i was interviewing him, i presumed it was all part of his shtick. it was all part of this show that he has. he's a reality tv-show host. he's known for the catchphrase you're fired. he's known for getting in people's faces. so i just thought this was him being tv's donald trump. when i watched it on the air alongside chuck todd - and i'm sitting next to nbc's political director, this is the moderator of meet the press, and i am nobody - and i'm watching it, and i just - i couldn't believe how angry he actually was. he was seething. he never smiled. he was glaring at me the whole time. it was very clear that he had anticipated a much easier interview.

and there's actually a funny quote from steve bannon, of all people, in the story where he describes - he says they're sort of like this mismatched pair of throwbacks from the 1950s. you've got president trump as kind of like dean martin, one of the bad boys from the rat pack. and he's allied and sort of married to pence, who is like the dad on leave it to beaver, ward cleaver. you know, they're just - they're almost comically mismatched, and their politics is very mismatched.
in the video, gabbard speaks about the novel coronavirus, saying: the best way i can be of service at this time is to continue to work for the health and well-being of the people of hawaii and our country in congress, and to stand ready to serve in uniform should the hawaii national guard be activated.
keith: a human who, as the campaign heats up, looks a lot more like any other politician who's been in congress for 26 years and is running for president. he's doing interviews from a charter jet and traversing iowa in a big campaign bus. sanders has begun sounding the part a bit more, too, drawing contrasts with clinton as he did last night at a rally in burlington, iowa.
tur: immigration is down. why is this such a big topic for you right now?
sagal: how many, then, does amy need to win?
sagal: that's - you think you're joking.
bodett: ...revealed this week he was the royal last resort...
the empire state's demographics are less favorable for cruz in comparison, for example, with iowa and wisconsin. and it's home turf for trump, who is way ahead in the polls. while rural and suburban areas may be friendlier to a candidate like cruz, he has to win over a majority of new york republicans. nearly 53 percent live in the new york city metro area, according to current voter registration data.
he conceded that hopes he expressed nearly two decades ago for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled.
i'm not going to take anything for granted, he says, asking harrington to keep spreading the word.

moore has long been a divisive figure in alabama, even before the 2017 race. he had only narrowly won his judicial elections before and had been twice removed from the bench, first for refusing to remove a statue of the ten commandments he'd had erected in the state judiciary building. later, he was reelected to the court, but then suspended after he ordered alabama judges to ignore the u.s. supreme court's 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.
if you're looking for a deeper dive into the science of preferences, racial preference hierarchies and their impact, or the history and politics of asian-american sexuality, here are some of the academic resources we used to research this episode.
sen. kamala harris considers 'a collection of factors' related to possible 2020 bid
in 1979, as now, the country was gearing up for a presidential election that would shape the next decade of american life. ronald reagan, the republican vying for the presidential nomination, was trying to stitch together a coalition made up of religious conservatives and opponents of the civil rights revolution of the 1960s. (reagan, who had been a critic of the voting rights act of 1964 because he thought it was unfair to the south, dogwhistled to anti-integrationists by stumping for states rights in mississippi not far from where three voting rights activists had been killed the decade prior.) but after he won the white house, his administration would grant blanket legalization to millions of people living in america without legal documentation.
schlumpf: thanks so much for having me.
through long hours and days of questioning, judge kavanaugh consistently reinforced his firm belief in the bedrock principles of judicial independence and the rule of law, deputy press secretary raj shah said in the statement.
i feel that, especially my generation, that everyone has to stand for something, and when you do, you have to be very loud about it and you post about it every day. i don't feel like someone beholden to that, really. i'm not performative in the way that i feel like i need to march through the streets or anything. i do feel like i need to exist, and maybe existing as the artist i am will be enough, will be my contribution. but i don't have anything further that i can do in terms of emotionally, physically i don't know what else i can contribute to this cause.
one of the other things you found was that among white republicans, the belief that black people faced discrimination in american life was low — about 30 percent. that number was pretty consistent, regardless of where in the country they lived. but for white democrats, the belief that blacks face discrimination is much higher: 74 percent overall. but there are big regional differences: about 80 percent in the northeast, 80 percent on the west coast, but only about 60 percent felt that way in the south.
elving: not even close. this was supposed to be a compromise written to unite the various factions of the republican majority in the house. and it was once thought to likely get over 200 votes. but instead, it got crushed - only 121 votes for more than 300 votes opposed. so for speaker paul ryan and his leadership team to lose on a bill like this, as you say, with the support of the president and half their own party members voting no - that is simply devastating.

it's a long time ago, and he voted that way and they were also misled, trump answered.
sagal: and at the end of the beautiful ceremony, the officiant presented the couple and said you may now sniff the butt.
barry: i will, and i just say i thought i had to do something. and it is the default action of the middle-aged, irish-catholic person to write to the irish times so that's what i proposed to do, and, you know - as if that could change anything, but, you know, maybe it could. but i had to read it out to him. so the only other time i've read this out is to toby in my workroom when i wrote it to get his approval. and he wept, you know, and he's a very strong young man. he's very mensch-like. he never cries. and i thought, well, maybe it's all right then.
manson: well, there was some murmurings in germany by bishops that they were considering, how can we bless same-sex couples? so i think that put a lot of pressure on the vatican. also, the pope - there was a documentary last year - that the pope suggested support for civil unions. so i think the vatican hates confusion, and they like to clarify things when things get a bit muddy. so i think that probably prompted this.
in the end, the economic pressure pushed the indiana governor to cave, oesterle observes. pence, after pledging not to change the law, signed a so-called fix, a compromise to soften the legislation.
mr. sharlet: i worked with an organization called the military religious freedom foundation to examine the travel records of these politicians who are connected to the c street house, and we discovered that senator ensign, for instance, who had claimed that his residence at c street house was just a purely a personal affair, that there's no political aspect of it, was actually traveling overseas on what he describes on his forms as policy trips on the dime of the family - as is his housemate, senator tom coburn, also traveling overseas.
but trump seems to be positioning pence to do some heavy lifting while the incoming president crafts the vision. in an interview soon after the election, trump told the wall street journal that pence will play a big role, handling policy areas including health care and serving as a liaison to congress. trump noted pence's friendship with house speaker paul ryan, a leader trump has had a sometimes-tense relationship with.
mccammon: trump brought up a hotel his companies are developing in washington, d.c., as an example of his ability to oversee projects.

a gop congressman officiated a same-sex wedding. now he faces a primary challenge
gregory, 71, is generally well regarded in the church, having served as a bishop for 35 years, including a three-year term as president of the u.s. conference of catholic bishops. he is the only living african-american archbishop in the united states, and with his appointment in washington, gregory is poised to become the first african-american cardinal from the united states.
simon: yeah. one last question, if we can. do - you mentioned the possibility that democrats could win the senate seat. you're being realistic now?
so if they ran a restaurant and they felt that they were religious and that their views were anti-gay, they could say to gay customers, i'm sorry, you can't eat here. and when that bill passed, there was just a political explosion in indiana. and it backfired hugely on pence. he had signed the legislation, backed it. and people hadn't paid that much attention until they looked at the signing ceremony. and there in a closed ceremony, a picture sort of leaked out that showed pence standing there with the most virulently anti-gay activists in the state.
this sends a message to every democratic incumbent that if you don't vote like a democrat, you will be held accountable, alexandra rojas, the group's executive director, wrote on twitter.
but in a news conference in montgomery, which opened with both prayer and the pledge of allegiance, the former alabama chief justice was defiant, blaming false flag attacks from democrats spreading misinformation for his narrow loss.
what's next from congress and the supreme court
infighting has plagued the alabama democratic party over a decades-long decline as republicans rose to dominance here. the state hasn't sent a democrat to the u.s. senate in more than a quarter century.
on a court that has become increasingly conservative, kennedy's role has been pivotal. in 5-to-4 decisions, his vote has usually determined the outcome on some of the hottest legal and social issues of the day — not just gay rights, but abortion, campaign finance, gun rights, affirmative action, the war on terrorism and the death penalty.
on abortion, a divide between clergy and laity
describing the background of the harris funeral homes case, amy howe writes for scotusblog:
but there were limitations on that right, the court noted. kennedy was the deciding vote, and it has long been assumed that the caveats in the decision were the price of his vote, totenberg wrote earlier this year.
by 2014, the gop controlled the state legislature and every constitutional office in arkansas as white, socially conservative voters migrated away from the democratic party. bill clinton said in 2015 that he would perhaps lose in arkansas were he running now.
sagal: first, let's hear from helen hong.

russian operatives reconnoitered the united states ahead of the wave of active measures that crested in the 2016 presidential campaign, but it isn't clear how much other information the influence operatives may have been getting from their own colleagues or elsewhere.
keith: sanders drew a crowd of 900 people in a town of only about 9,000. several said he was getting them engaged in politics in a way they haven't been before. and if they show up - if turnout is strong - then sanders says he will win.
so mike pence runs for governor with the backing of the koch brothers. he takes office in january of 2013. and one of his accomplishments as governor is signing the religious freedom restoration act. what's that act, and what was its importance?
economic stress can be hard on marriages, and ridgewood's membership includes several people who have been divorced. i don't know what i would have done without this church, power says. i felt i was the only person in the world that was going through a divorce.
we've grown up more, i think, with this kind of gun violence, so you'd think maybe we'd push for more regulations, she adds.
of course, these are the very things the alt-right wants to roll back. and just as it was in other ideological movements, the rancor among alt-right types — who can disagree over tactics, priorities and objectives — might serve the useful function of carving out more political room for their various revanchist factions to maneuver. the radicals often pull the movement in their ideological direction, but they also draw away fire and opprobrium from folks who less combative approaches to the same ends. that's partly how spencer, who makes a show of being well-mannered, name-dropping novelists and wearing ties, ended up a regular presence in the mainstream news media. his life's goal may be to cleave out of the united states a separate nation meant solely for white people, but at least he doesn't shout.
in your book, you tell us how the aids pandemic affected the lives of women sex workers in india.
akhavan: i'm sorry to cut you off. but as i was co-writing the adaptation, i realized that everything about this world reminded me so much of my time in a rehabilitation center. i had spent time in an outpatient rehabilitation center for an eating disorder in my 20s, and it really changed my life in a fantastic way. it was a great experience and a really painful, difficult one. and i was really familiar with being in group therapy and the dynamics of giving yourself up wholly like to - not holy, h-o-l-y, but w-h-o - to something larger than yourself and blindly trusting other people around you.
such extreme reactions, both negative and positive, tend to leave many news consumers bemused. most americans probably thought jerusalem already was the capital of israel. it's certainly a better-known news dateline than tel aviv.
christopher hale: i don't know a pathway forward for a democratic candidate to win back the states we lost in 2016 without winning a higher percentage of the evangelical vote.
bernie was polling just as well not only nationally as joe biden, not only national polls, but in the swing states as well. and those swing state polls are going to vary according to what's trending at the moment. but i think voters have been overly - have gotten - i do think that's an explanation, that they're so scared of trump that they're going to what they think is a safe choice. i would say to the voters, no, both bernie and joe can beat the president.
gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to my interview with dan diamond about how christian conservative activists now hold several leadership positions at the department of health and human services and how that's affecting policies related to abortion, contraception and lgbtq health care issues. diamond covers hhs for politico. he's one of two political reporters who broke the story that led to the resignation last september of hhs secretary tom price. yesterday, the senate confirmed his replacement, alex azar.
ermold, who is running as a democrat, told the ap that his campaign will be about more than lgbt issues and will focus on fairness and bringing people together.
boies also caught their attention because he represented the hollywood producer harvey weinstein, accused of sexual assault or harassment by 100 women. weinstein was convicted last month of felony sex crime and rape and sentenced wednesday to 23 years in prison.
diamond: alex azar is a more traditional choice for the job than tom price. azar's a george w. bush administration veteran. he was a high-level hhs leader. he was also in the private sector, a pharmaceutical executive at eli lilly. so he has lots of administrative expertise. he's someone that democrats feel they can work with. tom price, his predecessor, who left the agency after the reporting of me and my colleague rachana pradhan, hadn't been a high-level agency official, and he was much more partisan. he had really been an attack dog for the republican party on the affordable care act. so azar is seen, interestingly, as a more moderate choice who's inheriting an agency that has had more partisan bend. he did telegraph in his hearings that he believes, though, in conscience protections. that issue came up. and after he said that, that was seen by the evangelical community, the christian conservative community as a sign that he will continue some of these pushes, if not all of them.
byrd sees a similar sort of privilege in former texas rep. beto o'rourke, who entered the 2020 race after losing a close contest to unseat sen. ted cruz, r-texas.

in a 2001 email, kavanaugh addressed a legal challenge to an affirmative action program within the department of transportation.
first, the vacancy created by the death of justice antonin scalia last february will be filled by president trump's nominee, not by president obama's. obama's nomination of merrick garland died with the election returns, in essence vindicating the unprecedented confirmation policy of obstruction adopted by senate republican leader mitch mcconnell.
a news release issued by the church attributed the policy change to continuing revelation.
enrich doesn't flinch at the criticism.
justice neil gorsuch, who served as a clerk for kennedy a quarter-century ago, praised his integrity and wisdom and called him a great man and a great judge. it was the honor of a lifetime to serve as his law clerk 25 years ago, he said, and it has been an unexpected joy to serve this year as his colleague.
martin: does your candidate still have a path?
lawmakers say they hope to have a new law in place by the end of the year.
while the president will be extolling his 'accomplishments' of the last seven years, kim davis and mat staver will be a visible reminder of the administration's attack on religious liberty and an encouragement for people of faith to stand, the liberty counsel wrote in a press release. staver is davis' attorney and the founder of the group.
franklin: yeah 'cause i don't like shaving either. it's like, you know, for any activity.
now, of course, congress is not an administrative agency. they don't have the resources, the knowledge, the time to evaluate each chemical that might be harmful. they simply say, regulate harmful chemicals. this is what - limiting the power of administrative agencies in the environmental area is a classic demonstration of how the nondelegation doctrine, how these structural arguments could work.
kaine accepted his nomination as the vice presidential nominee and during his speech, he mocked trump.
as billy graham's daughter, anne graham faced a lot of pressure, but she went ahead with her bible class anyway, without her parents' backing. one day, however, they showed up at her class unannounced, and from then on she had their full support. later, billy graham said his daughter was the best preacher in the graham family.
state religious freedom laws surface in opposition to same-sex marriage
by the way, there's also no state in the country where anywhere near a majority supports deportation. even the reddest states that went for trump by a landslide, there are still majorities there preferring one of these two legalizing options for immigrants in the country illegally.
it is not that evangelicals think trump is one of them, but rather that they believe he is being used by god. as the bible says, 'by their fruits ye shall know them,' (matthew 7:20) and so far trump's crop has looked pretty good.
archibald: yeah. my colleague kyle whitmire calls it the alabamafication (ph) of america. i prefer to think of it as neobama (ph). but, i mean, we've tried a lot of these - a lot of the things that are being discussed now, whether it's immigration, whether it's welfare, whether it's incarceration, whether it's corruption. and it hasn't always worked quite the way we hoped it would.
like everyone else, however, catholics are divided. while the church advocates for immigrants and the poor and opposes the death penalty, it vigorously opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. where catholics come down politically depends in large part on which of those issues matter most to them.
gross: desiree, how did you go about casting the teenagers in this? did you want to make sure that a certain number of the teenagers were really gay?
in terms of the ugandan side of it, of course there's a much bigger political conversation around that, because years ago there was a bill that they tried to pass — there was a big lobby for it — to put homosexuals to death. of course, this just strikes fear into the heart of every man who might think that they love another man. and so you don't want to become that to the people that you love and the communities that you love.
tur: horror - it was horror. what is he doing? why is he bragging about kissing me? and i need to really step up my game on this beat. this is not a time to make friends. this is not a time to...
earlier this month, the state department implemented a policy denying visas to same-sex partners of foreign diplomats and the staff of u.s.-based international organizations if they are not legally married. many of the affected couples are from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal.
when he did not show up a week later, i thought, 'well, this guy's a crackpot or, you know, a fabulist,' somebody who just likes to spin stories and just wasted our time, says winchester star reporter evan goodenow. and so i kind of dismissed it.
gross: are there examples of how this new division of conscience and religious freedom has used its power?
dannenfelser is president of the susan b. anthony list, a group that works to elect national politicians who are opposed to abortion rights and to advocate for laws limiting abortion.
gross: i've heard this question posed this week to tony perkins from the family research council. you know, how do you square trump's behavior with your own evangelical views? and he said, basically, the relationship he had with stormy daniels was before he became president. and then the interviewer pointed out, but the payoff he made to her as part of the nondisclosure agreement was right before the election. it was during the presidential campaign. and he sounds like - perkins sounds like he's willing to give the president a pass because it didn't happen during the presidency.
trump: i mean, i don't know if you're going to put this on television, but you don't even know what you're talking about. try getting it out. go ahead.

while there might have been increased diversity over the years, there was still not equity and there is still not inclusion, said dana vickers shelley. she was a director of public affairs at splc from november 2012 to march 2014 and is now executive director of the aclu of maryland. you can hire faces. you can say, 'look, we're diverse,' but if the decisions are still being made by the white people in leadership, then you do not have inclusion.
chris stewart: there's enough space where both of those can be accommodated, and that's what we've tried to do here today.
green: it's not quite clear what the specific bullet points are of this task force, how things will be changed other than offering some general guidelines like new education and resources and renewed efforts to address this issue. but what we can take away from this task force is a symbolic gesture at what the doj is lifting up - religious liberty as that first freedom, the civil right that it is concerned with protecting above all others.
toobin: ...senate judiciary committee. his role was more coordinating the various conservative groups who were supporting gorsuch, who were, you know, the judicial crisis network, which is, you know, which ran television ads in states where they thought the senators might be wavering in support of gorsuch, particularly democrats who are up for re-election in red states in 2018 - indiana, north dakota, florida and the like. those are - so he was more involved in sort of whipping political support for gorsuch rather than doing the preparation for the hearings themselves.

diamond: scott lloyd had been in hhs years ago, but then he went to the knights of columbus, this group that some folks may know because of their ties in local communities. but they also had been very major players in advancing the pregnancy crisis centers, the idea that instead of getting an abortion, women are steered towards these centers where they will be told of the risks of an abortion, and maybe they'll be given an ultrasound of the fetus in an attempt to convince them not to abort their child.
perhaps nowhere is it expected to have a greater impact than among teachers unions, which, as npr's cory turner and anya kamenetz report, stand to lose members, money and influence in debates over education reform, among other things.

sen. mazie hirono, d-hawaii, complained that the supreme court had been unduly deferential to president trump this summer when it upheld his travel ban, despite what she called the administration's obviously bogus justification. she pressed kavanaugh on when the high court should question a president's national security claims.

moore: i will not violate my oath. i cannot forsake my conscience. i will not neglect my duty. and i will never - never - deny the god upon whom our laws and our country...
in addition, buttigieg's economic record in south bend may give some voters pause. one 2017 report found substantial racial economic gaps in the city that mirror those nationwide — much lower black homeownership rates and annual incomes than there are for whites, for example. in an interview with npr, buttigieg said that he hopes to alleviate that via an array of initiatives, like boosting minority entrepreneurship.
during a debate in south carolina in january, cruz defended the ad. he said that there are wonderful working men and women in the state of new york, but everyone understands that the values in new york city are socially liberal, are pro-abortion, are pro-gay marriage, focus around money and the media.
toobin: environmental laws. congress writes laws - the clean air act, the clean water act - but they're, necessarily, very broad laws. and they delegate the powers to administrative agencies to enforce those laws, specifically the environmental protection agency.
briger: is this based on anything historical?
gross: speaking of home, now you're living in london (laughter).
it's - i mean when you take your personal religious convictions or political convictions, even, and claim to represent the united states, but, in fact, are representing an organization like the family as senator coburn was in lebanon, as senator ensign has in jordan and israel, as senator inhofe has in uganda, you are steering foreign policy away from democratic accountability.
no. i don't. but as attorney general of the state of california, i had a constitutional responsibility to represent my clients. and one of my clients happened to be the california department of corrections and the district attorneys of california who did seek, in many jurisdictions, a death penalty sentence.
and we very sensibly, in my view - the american voters take a look and say look, i don't know what's going to happen in the next four years. i don't know that the twin towers are going to be attacked. i don't know that the berlin wall's going to come down. but i'm going to vote for the person that i trust most to handle whatever comes up in the next four years or at least trust more than the other person. and therefore, i need to know everything about that person.
and now, with the senate nearly evenly split and the possibility of another supreme court appointment while trump is in office, that may not be a chance alabama voters who prioritize the abortion issue are willing to take, either.
the law defined marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife and in so doing barred same-sex spouses from receiving federal recognition in matters of tax filing and insurance benefits, among other things.
gross: so since the federalist society and its executive vice president, leonard leo, seem to have such sway in who republican presidents choose as supreme court nominees, when you describe the federalist society as a conservative judicial group, like, where do they fit in the spectrum of conservatism? are the members kind of varied across the spectrum of conservative beliefs, or are they more in the middle or more to the right?
gross: you know, it's interesting to me you perceive the threat of like turning you into a gay conversion therapy center. you perceive the threat as coming from your peers, your fellow eighth graders, not from the adults. and that culture, i think, encouraged snitching on people you suspected were gay. did you feel like your friends were also potential snitches?
faith groups are deeply split over the proposal. despite large majorities of the u.s. population favoring expanded lgbtq rights, many faith groups still hold conservative ideas about marriage and sexuality and fear the equality act would punish them for adhering to those beliefs. mainline protestant denominations and other progressive faith groups have lined up in support of the legislation.
boies stood out. he was a towering figure with an illustrious record as a litigator. he had argued the government's antitrust case against microsoft a generation ago. he was al gore's go-to attorney in the 2000 election recount debacle. boies helped persuade the u.s. supreme court to legalize gay marriage.
new york city officials last week said black and latino residents were dying at twice the rate of white people. in chicago, more than 70% of virus-related fatalities were among african americans — a percentage more than double their share of the population. black residents in milwaukee county, wis., have seen similarly disproportionate rates.
understanding mike pence and his relationship to trump: 'his public role is fawning'
what trump has said about him (emphasis ours): i will tell you, president al-sisi has been somebody that's been very close to me from the first time i met him. i met during the campaign, and at that point there were two of us, and we both met. and hopefully you like me a lot more. but it was very long. it was supposed to be just a quick brief meeting, and we were with each other for a long period of time. we agreed on so many things. i just want to let everybody know, in case there was any doubt, that we are very much behind president al-sisi. he's done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation. we are very much behind egypt and the people of egypt. and the united states has, believe me, backing, and we have strong backing. ... and i just want to say to you, mr. president, that you have a great friend and ally in the united states and in me. (bilateral meeting with egypt's president, april 3)
this, of course, coincided with clinton-era policies such as don't-ask-don't-tell, which effectively forced queer service members to hide their identities lest they lose their careers, and clinton's signature of the defense of marriage act, which effectively defined marriage as between one man and one woman. the 1998 murder of matthew shepard, and the hate crimes bill it helped catalyze, helped shape legal arguments around sexual orientation — that gay people constituted a protected legal class.
a case testing whether police have to get a warrant to track cellphones.
that line comes from amoris laetitia (the joy of love), the papal treatise on families that was widely seen as pope francis' move to make the catholic church more inclusive. when it was published, the document set off disagreements within the church hierarchy over whether catholics who have been divorced and remarried should receive sacraments.
and this was a real turning point in his campaign. it was a real test of whether or not his support would stick with him. we hadn't had any primaries yet. nobody had voted. but he was getting these massive crowds. and he was being excused for anything that he said. and this was a test - will his supporters condone him going after an entire religion?

this graceful sidestepping of america's issues with miscegenation — interracial marriage, sex or procreation — allows the humanity of the loving family to take center stage, and forces their legal battle to be seen through that context.

there are people who have stopped going to church because they think that all that church is is a place where you're being condemned, johnson says, and where you're just told, 'this is what you have to think.'  such people, he says, are among those whom he now hopes to reach with his own ministry.
gross: now, you mentioned that the family thinks it's important to have their people and their concerns represented in both the republican and the democratic party. is there an active strategy to actually have family-affiliated politicians in the democratic party?
simon: i mean, you've got to ask. they have a majority in the house of representatives, and there's probably never been greater public attention to some of the issues being raised about immigration than ever before. why can't they get it passed?
elliott: i think generally there's a sense of embarrassment, although each of these politicians certainly have their own supporters. but it is remarkable to have the top three elected officials all under scrutiny at the same time.
takano: i think that's - i think there's some truth in that. i believe - i came to believe that all of our remaining candidates on the debate stage, last time there were six or seven on the debate stage, could beat donald trump. they all could beat donald trump. and if you believe that, then you don't need to make the safe choice. this safe choice distinction, i think, is really overly done.
jocelyn samuels — the former hhs director — says watching the current administration undo the work that she and other officials labored over is heartbreaking, because it stands to put vulnerable people at risk across a whole spectrum of activities in which they should be able to engage without fear of discrimination.

gross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to my interview with desiree akhavan, the director and co-writer of the new film the miseducation of cameron post, and emily danforth who wrote the novel the film is based on which is also called the miseducation of cameron post. the story is set in the early 90s at a christian gay-conversion residential center where gay teens are sent by their parents or guardians. at the center, the teens are required to accept that homosexuality is a sin and to cleanse themselves of that sin by finding jesus.

the men and women on trump's list of potential replacements disagree with that view, for the most part. they side with the late justice antonin scalia and his successor justice neil gorsuch, as well as other conservatives on the supreme court today, who believe the nation is bound by the original intent of the founders.

now, you know, i don't want to say - i don't want to overstate the case. he's not, like, singlehandedly responsible for a third of the supreme court. but if you look at anyone else, there's no one else with anywhere close to that level of influence. and i think it's indicative of where the republican party is, which is aligned at the hip with the federalist society when it comes to judicial appointments. and their agenda and their belief in political change through the use of the courts is a core of the republican party now and something that leo has led the charge on.

the tax bill might not be the kind of populist piece of legislation trump promised during the campaign, but it does have a lot in it to make conservatives happy. obamacare is unraveled; there are more tax breaks for people who home-school their kids or send them to religious schools; and there are tax hikes for graduate students, university endowments and voters in high-tax states. in other words — democrats.

it seemed another example of how emboldened the loose agglomeration of white nationalists, neo-confederates and fascists that make up the so-called alt-right had become over the past two years, since they had hitched their wagons to donald trump's star. (one of the key architects of trump's long-shot campaign for the white house was steve bannon, who as the head of breitbart news turned it into the alt-right's unofficial propaganda organ.) while the views of the torch carriers in charlottesville weren't exactly mainstream, the protesters clearly no longer felt they had anything to hide. they didn't need the hoods and masks that once shrouded the identities of their ideological forebears.

and the other thing that he did was he waged an extraordinarily negative campaign against the democrat, whose name was phil sharp, and sort of put on these hokey ads that accused sharp of being a tool of arab oil interests. and they had some actor dressed up as an arab sheik in sunglasses, you know, saying that he'd bought off phil sharp. and it wasn't true. anyway, altogether, it was kind of a fiasco. and at the end of the whole thing, pence did something interesting though. he wrote an essay after that 1990 campaign. and he - it's called confessions of a negative campaigner. and he said he didn't have any intention of going back into politics at that point, but if he ever did, he would never run a negative campaign again. he felt that it kind of besmirched himself.
moore has underscored that major divide frequently at his campaign events, where he has continued to deny the accusations against him but also refused to answer questions from the media about the swirling scandal. multiple women have accused the former alabama supreme court chief justice of pursuing them romantically decades ago when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, and one woman has said he initiated sexual contact with her when she was just 14.

parker: yeah, i agree with what cokie has said. i mean, none of your business is never the right answer if you're running for president because as she says, everything is your business. but of course, the reason donald trump doesn't want to have anyone look as his tax returns is because one, he probably does not have as much money as he says he does, doesn't - that's - most people on the republican side who are not trump supporters think that's the case. and then also his tax rate - at least he was honest about that. he doesn't pay enough taxes in the view of people who are looking very closely at raising tax rates on the rich.

but it's worth looking back on how precarious life was and continues to be for many lgbtqia people. in the early 1980s, outbreaks of what was initially — and disparagingly — called gay plague began popping up all over the country. the reagan administration's early inaction helped those early outbreaks explode into the aids crisis, which would define the politics of queer life. (reagan's onetime friend, the movie star rock hudson, would die of the disease; the reagans did not respond to requests from hudson's family for help.) the fear of the poorly understood disease would help further stigmatize queer communities. some religious conservatives attributed the disease to god's wrath for their supposed sinfulness. (the aids crisis has gone on to become increasingly racialized; in recent years, black and latinx men and black women represent the majority of new diagnoses.)

church teaching says that we need to have a consistent ethic of life, where we look at all human life as valuable, she says. that's why we see this cozying up with one party over a specific issue — admittedly an important issue for many catholics — as problematic.
other departments and agencies around the same time were coming to the same conclusion. in 2014, attorney general eric holder wrote in a memorandum: i have determined that the best reading of title vii's prohibition of sex discrimination is that it encompasses discrimination based on gender identity, including transgender status. in 2016, the defense secretary announced that transgender servicemembers could serve openly. the federal bureau of prisons, health and human services, and the department of housing and urban development all issued rules and policies in the same vein in those years.
senator coburn a little more candid about what he's doing, he described going to lebanon - this country torn by religious war for years - and attempting to set up christian prayer cells in the lebanese government. senator james inhofe of oklahoma was the most blunt about this. speaking in an interview with a religious right organization, he said he has taken about 20 missionary trips around the world: africa, middle east, eastern europe. he doesn't actually travel on the family's dime. he travels on your dime. he uses money from the senate armed forces committee - travels over to these countries, and especially uganda, which he says he's adopted. uganda has a very special role for him. and he says what he's there to do is to, quote, promote the political philosophy of jesus as taught to him by doug coe. it's about as candid as can be.

tur: so my parents covered police pursuits, and it was in many ways, you know, the beginnings of reality-show tv in this captivating story that was a lot of flash but not all that much substance. and so when they popularized it and they made it must-see television in the '90s, you couldn't tear yourself away from a police pursuit. there was, you know, cheeky talk, which obviously had a grain of truth to it, that they were responsible for diminishing the seriousness of the nightly broadcast of news. i have mixed feelings about it now because they covered a lot of really serious stories. the reginald denny beating exposed how the lapd had just abandoned the city, and they were risking their lives covering it. they were risking their lives covering fires. they were risking their lives covering - i think my parents, they would search for hours on end for missing planes that had crashed into the santa monica mountains to find and rescue people. so they did - they did a combination of the two.
akhavan: i don't know what people think about me. it's none of my business. in terms of the word bisexual, i hate the word bisexual. and that's why i feel committed to keep saying it about myself because it's factually true. and i guess i want to push myself to say like, well, do i hate the stigma around that word? can i reappropriate the stigma around the word? we were talking earlier, you asked me - so the working title of my tv series was the bisexual.

johnson: right, right. there are two competing narratives, but i got to say i think the gorilla is out of the cage, you know? you're not going to put the toothpaste back in the tube on this issue. i feel like the national legalization of gay marriage really did so much to just sort of justify and to legitimize lgbtq relationships. and with those floodgates open, i felt in the last couple years i started to see so many stories, so many movies, with lgbt storylines. and you saw kids kind of shrugging their shoulders about it, you know, where - my own experience, i've met, you know, my friends who have young teenagers, and they're coming out of the closet in middle school. and they just have role models that i certainly didn't have. so the moment is just based on kind of what i've noticed and what i've seen and what i've felt, again especially over the last couple years.
