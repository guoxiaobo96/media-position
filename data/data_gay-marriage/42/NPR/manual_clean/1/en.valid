Quinn Robinson is only 18 years old, but she has already learned some hard lessons about the world. It's scary being a trans person because I know there are people out there who just hate me for being myself, she says. There's been kids who have approached me and say, 'Hey, you should burn in hell.' 
And so I think he would kind of edge up to it. He didn't want to deny himself that connection with the Godhead that he felt was there. And so he would try to control his seizures internally. At a point, he had a method where he thought that if - when the mandala appeared, if he shifted his eyes hard in the opposite direction, he could stop himself from having a seizure. So he kept trying to control it.
BRENNAN: I was trying to get more women to slide.
TRUMP: If it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states.
TOTENBERG: Both these lists were compiled largely by the conservative Heritage Foundation. And the names range from very conservative to very, very conservative. None is a household name. Indeed, some of the most well-known conservative judges and lawyers in the country aren't on the list. But I'm told this nominee will come from the lists.
TOTENBERG: Actually, the opposite - the longer a decision is in place, the more weight it has. And in the case of abortion, that decision has been repeatedly reaffirmed over a period of 43 years - versus the same-sex marriage decision, which is just 17 months old. And, indeed, while the court has fleshed out how far states can go in regulating abortions, it's not fleshed out how far states go in discriminating against same-sex couples on religious grounds.
This is just raw politics. We don't want somebody who's been nominated by a Democrat — a claim that I would have never made at the time.
BRENNAN: Yes. Oh, I need - you know, what I need is a good woman to save me.
For some conservatives, religious freedom means the right to act on their opposition to same-sex marriage and other practices that go against their beliefs. LGBT advocates and their allies, meanwhile, say no one in the United States should face discrimination because of their sexual orientation.
NEAL BRENNAN: There are three mics on stage, just, like, mics on stands, and they're just basically spaced out. Like, they each have, like, a little area. And I just go from one mic to the other. I basically do, like, 10 minutes of stand-up, then 10 minutes of, like, more emotional honesty, I guess, and then, like, two minutes of one-liners. And then I just repeat.
My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts. In addition, I am responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful. Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so.
I think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. I think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in Washington. I think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.
BRENNAN: I - it's - do it early.

There has always been a large evangelical subculture in U.S. Methodism, says Mark Tooley, president of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, even though the hierarchy of the church for many decades has been more on the liberal side.
DRACE: Oh, yeah. Let's do it.
Things have never come easy to me in life but I have never backed down and I will not back down now, Murray said in his news conference. I will continue to be mayor of this city. I will continue to run for re-election.
VOLZ: In retrospect, sure, of course. I feel in general that marijuana is relatively harmless. It's certainly not something that should be consumed by children. And I want to be clear that I don't think I was tottering around stoned during my childhood. I was certainly discouraged from consuming marijuana as a kid. It was grown-up stuff. That was something that I understood.
Half an hour away, though, people are having these kinds of conversations.
Except for Sen. Lee, Trump's list is drawn from other courts around the country, both state and federal. Friday's additional 10 include:
He declined to take questions, saying this is now a matter for the courts to resolve.
To be on the receiving end of such untrue allegations is very painful for me. It is painful for my husband and for those who are close to us, he told reporters. I understand the person making these accusations is troubled, and that makes me sad as well.

But what's - so my father is a grand mal epileptic, and my mom didn't know he was an epileptic. They had slept together for the first time.

A rally with white nationalists chanting phrases like Jews will not replace us and end immigration, one people, one nation was, as many expressed online, disturbing yet not really all that surprising.
But one Phoenix business argues it cannot in good conscience follow that law — because they say it violates their freedom of speech and religion.
There's this whole myth of, 'Oh, if you're a lesbian, honestly, just, like, go for it 'cause you can't get pregnant LOL!'  jokes Wilson. But it's not true — there's, like, risks and stuff that go into that, and I know that from going here. And like, lesbians wear condoms when they're having sex. People should know that. Lesbians should know that!
John Inazu, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, whose book Confident Pluralism lays out an approach that might help bridge differences between LGBT and religious freedom advocates, says efforts at reconciliation face long odds.
Your base, some of them quietly said, you know, everybody on that list, except Merrick Garland, was a minority or a woman; some of them were both. You picked the oldest person by far, the only white guy, and he's sort of a centrist liberal. He's not, you know, he's not going to — this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the Supreme Court.
I would be a little surprised if any of them really took him up on this offer to engage in this conversation, Hoffman-Zinnel said.
ROSIE PEREZ: New Yorker Jonas Elfin (ph), a top venture capitalist on the Upper West side and proud male cat lady, hated coming home to cat litter strewed throughout his Fifth Avenue high-rise. He especially hated how his two Siamese cats, Bai Ling (ph) and Jackie Chan Ling (ph)...

Goldsmith wrote: she wrote a letter that appears to depart sharply from the usual criteria that an Attorney General would apply in deciding whether to defend an EO in court. As such, the letter seems like an act of insubordination that invites the President to fire her. Which he did.
Not all faith leaders are convinced, however, that the push for LGBT rights is jeopardizing the religious freedom of people who hold conservative beliefs about sexuality and marriage.
In the heat of a presidential campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of Republicans saying that they won't give your nominee a hearing? They clearly don't want to look rude, so they'll meet with him and tell him that they don't want to meet with him. [Laughter]
BRENNAN: It - are you talking about, like, are you going to do some live sliding? Is that what you mean?
Well, first of all what I would say is take a look at the appointments I've made since I've been president of the United States. I've appointed as many African-Americans to the Circuit Court as any president ever; more African-American women on the federal courts than any other president; more Hispanics, more Asian-Americans, more LGBT judges than any president in history.
We had a very candid conversation. He's chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, so I assume that he either reads The Washington Post or listens to NPR, and I think had a pretty good sense of the posture that Majority Leader McConnell took immediately after Justice Scalia's passing — the notion that the Republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.

KLEIN: The answer was A, Mike Rowe Soft. He settled in exchange for an X-Box. Your next Mike is Mike Malloy. He came to prominence in the 1930s and earned a nickname. What was it? Was it A, Mike the Durable - gangsters repeatedly tried to kill him by poisoning his whiskey, but he'd been drinking bad whiskey so long it only made him stronger?
One of the major activities of the [Catholic] church, going way back, was to look after the orphans, says Stanley Carlson-Thies, founder of the Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance. For that to be illegal unless the religious people change their standard, seems to me ... unfortunate.
Did you talk to him about being a piñata, as Sen. Cornyn put it?
Well, sometimes I just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. You learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is.
VOLZ: Sure. We were talking about the I Ching earlier. And suddenly, in mid-1979, my mom goes to throw her usual weekly hexagrams. And the passage is really dark. The results are bad. And the imagery in the passages has to do with imprisonment and punishment and things like that. And she became fairly convinced - well, very convinced very quickly that they were going to be busted. And the business was huge at this time. And, I mean, everybody knew about them. It was a little - maybe a little too high-profile. And she became sure that they were going to get busted. So my parents, taking this extremely seriously, packed up, closed up shop. And we moved out of San Francisco within two weeks.

SAGAL: Bill, how did Landon do on our quiz?
NPR spoke with other LGBTQ+ students who agree with Robinson. Most wanted to remain anonymous because they aren't out to their parents, but they described Willing to Wait as having religious undertones and being shame-based. One student said it left her feeling dirty. Another said, The only thing we learned about gay sex was it gives you STDs and you shouldn't do it.
This year it may be an issue. In fact I think it is, in part because of the circus that has been the presidential campaign season so far.
DAVIES: Your parents were really interested in the occult, both, you know, psychics, I think. They thought of themselves as psychics. Your mom read tarot cards. Your dad was a graduate of the Berkeley Psychic Institute. He at some point describes a vision that he has for a child. You want to describe this?
NINA TOTENBERG: Mr. President, Judge Garland was runner-up twice before. So why now and not twice before?
MARTIN: So take a step back for a moment, if you would, and tell us the background on this case that the Supreme Court is, in fact, preparing to hear.
-- Lowcountry: The more moderate, heavily military and veteran Lowcountry is where Bush, the former Florida governor, is focusing most of his attention. It's where strategists in the state say he could be surprisingly strong.
SHAW: Well, when I wrote that, what I meant was that I was focused on the battles on behalf of African-Americans. Over time, as a civil rights lawyer, I came to realize that we have to be opposed to the subordination of people because of who and what they are, even if we're not part of that group. But I simply think that discrimination against people on the basis of sexual orientation and, in this instance, specifically transgender people, is simply wrong. It should be wrong. It's a matter of law. And I think as a country, we've been growing in our understanding of our values and principles with respect to discrimination and how we treat our fellow citizens and how we want to be treated ourselves, all of us, whether it's on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, age, our religion, on and on. It's just growth.
Two free-spirited psychics who made their way in a city of enormous cultural and social change - the explosion of the counterculture, the growth of the Gay Liberation Movement, the horror of the AIDS epidemic, as well as the assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk and the suicides in Guyana of the followers of Jim Jones, whose Peoples Temple was an influential presence in the city for years. Alia Volz's writing has appeared in The Best American Essays 2017, The New York Times and other publications. Her new book is Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco. Like many of you, I'm working from home these days. I spoke to Alia Volz, who was at her office in San Francisco.
DONALD TRUMP: I'm pro-life. The judges will be pro-life.
VOLZ: Oh, absolutely. So there had been, since maybe the mid-'70s, the beginnings of a medical marijuana movement. But it really had not made it into the press in a significant way. And it was very small. And marijuana was still, in the American consciousness, not considered a medicine. It was considered a party drug. Well, the situation with HIV/AIDS was that the first effective drug treatment didn't come out until 1996. It was 15 years. And this is a disease with an 80-plus percent fatality rate. Let that sink in for a moment.
The ramifications of the General Conference action are not yet fully evident, but fractures are likely — between progressive clergy and conservative laity, between young and old church members, and between Methodists in the United States and those in Africa, Asia and other parts of what's known as the Global South, mostly less-developed countries where conservative social views and a more strict interpretation of the Bible are prevalent.
Thank you, Bill. Thank you, everybody.

Strong says the Party will donate a total of $70,000. Washington Senate Democrats will also donate their contribution from Knight to the campaign to uphold gay marriage. In a statement, the Ramtha School says the release of the videos may violate copyright law and it may sue.

DAVIES: And part of the business was actually finding people who needed the relief that marijuana would bring. There was another woman named Mary Jane Rathbun, who had been making and distributing marijuana brownies. She became known as - what? - Brownie Mary, as supposed to your mom, who was the brownie lady. And they kind of got...
SIEGEL: So, Nina, in one case, he says a Supreme Court decision ought to be overturned. In the other case, the court's decision ends the discussion. Is there anything different about those two issues in Supreme Court rulings?
Well, you know, I'm going to make the case — I'm going to make the case for a fair process. Give Judge Garland a hearing; give him a vote. And look at the qualities of the man. That's what the American people expect. And, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that I've heard from Mitch McConnell and some other Republicans is this notion that the American people should decide — we should let the American people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.
It may very well might end up at the nation's highest court again, Campbell said.
KLEIN: Your dad's not really deaf. He's - it's even worse. Your dad's dead.
SAGAL: All right. Your first quote is from naturally, inevitably, the president of the United States.
After a widely circulated draft order aroused considerable opposition from the LGBT community, no further action was taken. Asked recently whether such an order might still get signed, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said only that Trump will continue to fulfill commitments he had made. Advocates for executive action say they do not expect new developments until Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, has been confirmed.
While both cases make their way through lower courts, both sides anticipate the high court taking the issue up again — for the sake of clarity.
BEYONCE: (Rapping) Yeah, you [expletive] up the first stone, we had to get remarried.
Statements from President-elect Donald Trump raise questions about the incoming administration, big issues before the Supreme Court and progress toward nominating a ninth Supreme Court justice.
NPR reached out to several members of CAST multiple times over a period of months, but no one from the group agreed to be interviewed. They did send a statement, though.
Well, first of all, if you look at what Joe Biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a Supreme Court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.
VOLZ: I don't want to be an apologist, either. So, you know, clearly, this was not an ideal situation.
It potentially could show the audience of The Family Leader a visible, positive representation of an out gay man who's running for the highest office in our land, he said. So maybe it could potentially change people's hearts and minds — or at least get them to think more broadly.

So for - you know, my mom had the first really high-volume delivery service. Now you can use an app to summon a company like Eaze and a complete stranger will show up to your door with a lanyard. You don't exchange more than five words, and you pay for it with a debit card. The community aspect has completely run out of the process. The current canna-business (ph) laws are also extremely harmful to small farmers, who were the ones who kept this all going during the '70s and '80s. So some of the changes have really stripped the community-building feelings out of it. At the same time, I'm glad that people have access, especially those who use it for medicinal purposes.
Under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Congress is barred from enacting an establishment of religion, but neither can it prohibit the free exercise thereof. The question under current debate is what it means to exercise one's religion.
It certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. And I said at the outset I would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base. I said I would play it straight — that my goal was to actually confirm a justice who I thought could do an outstanding job. And Merrick Garland fits that bill.
As you moved into the '80s, the brownie business changed in a way, right? It wasn't just recreational because it became a way to ease the suffering of people afflicted with AIDS. And this was at a time when the epidemic was, you know, poorly understood scientifically. There was little treatment. And it was, you know, deeply associated with homophobia. As your mom made these trips to the city, how did the epidemic present itself to her?

GREENE: We spoke this morning with professor Ted Shaw. He is head of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina School of Law in Chapel Hill. We asked him to help us understand exactly what's being debated when it comes to civil rights. It sounds like discrimination is against federal law when it comes to genders. Is the central question now whether gender should be interpreted as including the gender one chooses for theirself and not the sex based on the birth certificate? Is that what's really in question here?
MARTIN: So in this country, laws saying you can't discriminate against people and offering public services were very hard won, as I think many people will remember. But they've been on the books for decades, so I think some people might ask, why is this any different from someone who is refusing to serve black people at a lunch counter, for example, or at a restaurant? What's the difference?
There were efforts early on about some kind of compromise, he tells NPR in a recent interview. I think those are less and less plausible as time goes on and as sides get factionalized. It's hard to see in some of these cases how there would be an outcome that is amenable to everyone, and so I think we're seeing these cases with us for a long time.
SAGAL: But on Thursday of this week, we heard that the president had really fired Comey because he didn't like him, and he thought that he was making too much noise about the Russia investigation. The White House dismissed that though because it came from a completely unreliable source - President Donald Trump.
FELBER: That's exactly what you mean.
One of the first battles was in New Hampshire in 2009 and started out as, a really very simple extension of nondiscrimination protection to a class that isn't covered and needs to be covered, said state Rep. Ed Butler, a Democrat.
Rundell says the 13 official United Methodist seminaries generally cover between 10 and 20 percent of their operating budget with direct church funding, but he says the loss of that funding is not necessarily the biggest danger.
SIEGEL: And as for overturning Roe v. Wade...
Three sources close to the Justice Department confirmed that Yates, who had been planning to leave the department in a few days anyway after her successor won confirmation, knew her decision to speak out could lead to termination. But, the sources said, after agonizing over the situation, she felt strongly that the immigration order could represent a thinly veiled effort to target a particular religious group, and that was worth taking a stand.
The political world is already turning its attention to South Carolina, where the remaining Republican presidential candidates debate tonight. The Palmetto State votes Feb. 20th in the GOP primary and Feb. 27th for the Democrats.
SIEGEL: Now, if President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland had been confirmed, that would've made an immediate difference in the ideological makeup of the court. But that's not going to be so with this nomination, now that Trump is going to be president, whoever it ends up being, right?
Back in 2017, the day the Supreme Court announced it was taking up the first Masterpiece case, Phillips declined to bake another cake. The cake was requested to be pink on the inside and blue on the outside, celebrating a gender transition.
Well, you know, I — I — that just shows his wisdom once again, because when it comes to things like getting — being nominated for the Supreme Court, it's probably always wise to not count your chickens before they're hatched.
SAGAL: And then he was sent away by his parents, who tried to break up this forbidden romance. And he said, I will return and marry her. And he did it. And everybody's like, whoa, this kind of salacious. But it's covering up the real interesting thing, which is that a drama geek is now the president of a major Western power.
And I would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on Earth.
DAVIES: ...But also for what happened during the night. Tell us about this.
(SOUNDBITE OF GUY VAN DUSER'S VIPER'S DRAG)
Here's the problem we have, though: If in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a Democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, We've got another excuse for not confirming a Democratic president's nominee?
DAVIES: Right. And so he actually, the night of conception - at least he thinks - he told your mom, OK, that's it; you're pregnant.
Less than two weeks after his inauguration, and only hours after Yates sent a message to department lawyers announcing that she would not defend Trump's order restricting travel and immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the new president removed the nation's top law enforcement officer in a move not seen since the Nixon era.

In 2012, two-thirds (65 percent) of GOP primary voters described themselves as born-again, evangelical Christians. But almost one-third also described themselves as moderate. In Iowa this year, a similar 64 percent of caucus-goers were evangelical, but only 14 percent were self-described moderates. In New Hampshire, just 23 percent of voters were white evangelicals, while a lower 24 percent were moderates.
Nan Aron, of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said that the new list, like the first one, consists of ultraconservatives who espouse a backward view of the law. Adding some racial diversity, she said, doesn't change the fact that these individuals' track records suggest they would endanger the cherished rights and freedoms of Americans.
Well, a couple of things. First of all, this speech that they continually quote from Joe Biden when he was on the Judiciary Committee — if you actually read the speech, number one, he was speaking hypothetically. [Cellphone rings]
If a football coach is not allowed to lead his team in a public prayer, or a high school valedictorian is not given permission to read a Bible passage for her graduation speech, or the owner of a private chapel is told he cannot refuse to accommodate a same-sex wedding, they might claim their religious freedom has been infringed. Others might argue that such claims go against the principle of church-state separation, or that they undermine the rights of LGBT people to be free from discrimination.
I can't speak for all the [United Methodist] schools, but one thing we've learned is that we have students who are struggling right now with their church, says Rundell of the Methodist Theology School in Ohio. For our younger students in particular, [LGBTQ equality] is a matter that, in most of their lives, is no longer debated.
SAGAL: Right, different kinds of female physiques. Some companies looked at the failed Pepsi ad campaign of a few weeks ago and said, oh, thank God that wasn't us. But Dove soap said, oh, yeah? Watch this.
DAVIES: And so while you had this secret and you knew that you were an outlaw family, it was illegal, did it ever seem wrong to you?
At that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. And that damages people's faith in the judiciary — because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.
The bill is part of a widespread reaction to the national focus on same-sex marriage and transgender rights. The state's governor is the latest chief executive to be placed at the center of that national debate.
But, you know, I think the way he described it — and I'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself — the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. He has loved being a judge for a very long time. He occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. He's got a great job.

The original story behind the Masterpiece Cakeshop case is both undisputed and well known: a gay couple in Colorado walked into the bakery in 2012 and asked for wedding cake. The owner and master baker Jack Phillips declined to make a custom cake for their party because he said their union violated his religious beliefs.
BRENNAN: So in stand-up you can't really be that honest. And you can kind of just - you're honest a little bit in the set-up where you'll be like, my dad's deaf or whatever, and then you'll go from there. And then my - dad's not really deaf. But you know what I mean.
This moment in our history — a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol — I think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.

Very few would argue that they'd want a man in a girls' bathroom, right? So it becomes very hard to counter them, said Stone, who noted that some of the same language was used by opponents of gay rights in the 1970s.
Clinton has been emphasizing her support in the African-American community, touting the endorsement of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC this week. Civil rights icon and Georgia Rep.

In the middle of the night, my mom wakes up and the bed is shaking like crazy. Here we are in San Francisco. She thinks it's an earthquake. She sits up, realizes that nothing else in the room is moving, that it's Doug shaking wildly in bed, and she thought he might be having a drug overdose. But then he stopped and was sleeping calmly. And it wasn't until weeks later that he told her he had grand mal epilepsy, and he'd had an epileptic seizure in the middle of the night.
The kids write things like, Is gender a social construct? And, For any of our facilitators with dysphoria, how does that affect your sex life? And, How does being sexually active affect you emotionally?
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with writer Alia Volz. She has a new memoir about her mother's business selling pot-laced brownies in San Francisco in the 1970s. It also deals with Volz's parents' relationship and some remarkable events in San Francisco at the time. Her book is called Home Baked.
The current curriculum does not mention sexual or gender identity. But other parents pushed back hard, saying they felt it was important to keep the sex ed message focused on abstinence — saving yourself for marriage.
LANDON GROVE: Hi. This is Landon Grove from Smithsburg, Md.
SAGAL: I know. There's hardly anything in it. Yes, there are some that are tall and thin. There's narrow. There's shapely. There's short and round, pear-shaped, you know. The idea is that it's soap for all types of women, but no woman basically wants to be stopped at the checkout counter and be told, you sure you don't want that fat bottle?
Equality for all is something that we here in Colorado are committed to, the laws will be enforced, Weiser said. We will just have to play a few more innings before we win this game.
A year earlier in Colorado, socially conservative groups such as Focus on the Family used similar language in an unsuccessful attempt to halt a similar transgender rights bill.
JOHNSON: Sure. The owner of a Colorado shop called Masterpiece Cakeshop refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple several years ago. Colorado, like a lot of states, has public accommodation laws that are designed for businesses that interact with the public to prevent discrimination. And this baker, Jack Phillips, said no. He violated the statute on the books in Colorado, saying he didn't want to be compelled to violate his First Amendment rights, his deeply held religious beliefs, by celebrating this gay couple's marriage. But the same-sex couple said the baker was violating their rights.
This is FRESH AIR. The new album Everything Is Love is credited to The Carters - Shawn Carter and Beyonce Knowles Carter, better known as Jay-Z and Beyonce. The married couple has released a new album that's heavily autobiographical and blends hip-hop and R&B in a way that our rock critic Ken Tucker finds very intriguing.
The Carters, who married in 2008, celebrate their union with a heavily autobiographical new album. Critic Ken Tucker is impressed by the record's easy shifts between hip-hop and R&B.
VOLZ: No, but she found out. So apparently, what happened is that my dad - who can't keep a secret - told Cheryl (ph), the other salesperson, at a point. He just had to get it off his chest. And I think that she told my mom. And then he, later on, during a big fight, he told her in an angry way. So my mom found out fairly shortly thereafter. This wasn't something I was told about as a kid. But I think as a teenager - was when I found out. And it is the kind of story that sticks in your craw.
DRACE: They are great. They're wonderful, and I can't complain.
We actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on the Circuit Courts, something that's never happened before. So my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched.
Mr. President, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.
DAVIES: What was your dad's reaction to this? I mean, he was so sure.
The mayor held a brief news conference Friday to deny the allegations.
When we met her, Robinson had long, platinum blond hair with blue tips. Since then she has dyed it a deep brown. A pink and blue transgender pride flag hangs above her bed, which is adorned with a comforter covered with giraffes and zebras.
4 Things To Know About The South Carolina Primaries
KLEIN: Well, Neal, it's time to play a game that we're calling...
VOLZ: OK. So this is kind of, I want to say, a ridiculous part of the story. Although, I think my parents would disagree. But my mom - both of my parents, actually, believed strongly in the occult and specifically the I Ching, which is a 4,000-year-old Chinese divination method rooted in Daoism and Confucianism. And you would consult it in the way that you might consult tarot cards. And my mom believed wholeheartedly in this practice.
KLEIN: That's exactly what I mean.
Here at Code Switch, my teammate Gene Demby wrote about about how white nationalists are edging their movement out of the shadows:
KLEIN: B. In 2012, the Family Research Council accused Mike and Ike of, quote, unquote, sexualizing candy and, quote, chipping away at the value of marriage in an impassioned radio address critiquing the unholy and fruity union of Mike and Ike.
That passage appeared to refer to comments by Trump about the plight of Christians in the Middle East, and to remarks by Rudy Giuliani, who told Fox News that Trump had wanted to impose a Muslim ban but wanted advisers to find a way to do it legally. Immigrants rights advocates said Giuliani's words could offer them evidence to prove the administration had a discriminatory purpose.
So during that span of time when there was just nothing for people to do to take care of themselves, cannabis emerged really early on as helpful with some of the symptoms. Nobody thought weed was going to cure AIDS (laughter). But it helped with the wasting syndrome, which manifested with a total loss of appetite and crushing nausea. Cannabis was good for that. It helped with insomnia, depression, pain. So people began to turn to cannabis to help feel a little better while this horrible, horrible thing was going on. And in the case of the wasting syndrome, it helped them eat. It helped them hang on longer. It became very important.
Jenna Ellis, an evangelical attorney and adviser to Trump's 2020 campaign, said she would like to see Democrats engage in a public conversation about faith. But she doesn't think many conservative white evangelicals would be won over.
BODDEN: Neal, was that the plot behind the whole special?
And when you hear Judge Garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the Oklahoma City bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. And I spent a lot of time on that.
If great words can heal and inspire, base words can corrupt. Trump has been delivering the poison of prejudice in small but increasing doses. In Charlottesville, the effect became fully evident. And the president had no intention of decisively repudiating his work. What do we do with a president who is incapable or unwilling to perform his basic duties? What do we do when he is incapable of outrage at outrageous things? What do we do with a president who provides barely veiled cover for the darkest instincts of the human heart? These questions lead to the dead end of political realism — a hopeless recognition of limited options. But the questions intensify.
KURTIS: I am Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Abravanel Hall in Salt Lake City, Utah, Peter Sagal.
SAGAL: This week we are off at a meditation retreat, staying away from the news, breathing the fresh air and living in a complete fantasy.
SHAW: Well, the state makes an argument, and how strong that argument is is up for grabs. The state cites federal court decisions that say that gender does not include sexual orientation or transgender and that transgender people are not a protected classification of people under federal civil rights laws. So - and it's part of the culture wars that have been going on. For people who are civil rights advocates, they've been clear for some time now that discrimination on the basis of who and what people are goes against our most basic and fundamental laws. And even the Supreme Court, which has been a conservative Supreme Court, has, of course, moved with respect to sexual orientation to ban discrimination in the context of marriage.
SAGAL: Here then are your choices of the cats in the news. Was it, from Amy Dickinson, how the wrong cat litter led to a nuclear meltdown at a nuclear waste facility; from Rosie Perez, how somebody annoyed with cat litter on his floor came up with a business for cat manicures, pedicures and other salon services in New York; or from Adam Felber, how the hero cat of YouTube turns out to be an unreconstructed racist?
BODDEN: Peter, I hate to say it, but we know men, and only one size can was going to sell.
I'm sure that he is aware that, these days, massive advertising campaigns are mounted in opposition to candidates — not just for Supreme Court, but for appellate court judges.
MARTIN: That's NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson. Carrie, thanks so much.
VOLZ: So I have a very intimate relationship with my mom, and it's nothing unusual for us to talk about her very personal feelings about things both from the past and today. But I started this book having been estranged from my dad for many, many years. And really, for the first couple of drafts, I didn't ask his side of the story because I didn't know how.
ROCCA: How - I mean, not that there's anything wrong with it, but Macron's wife is how much older?
KLEIN: You tweeted recently that women are more interested in you since your special. And I wanted to know - how is that manifesting? Like, are women coming up to you and just saying, like, oh, my God, you are so hot when you talk about your lifelong struggle with depression?
Alia Volz, welcome to FRESH AIR. This book is, in part, about the city of San Francisco. And your mom was there, I guess, in the mid and late '70s. It was a city undergoing remarkable change. Just paint a little bit of a picture. What was going on at the scene at Fisherman's Wharf, the performances? Give us a sense of it.
KLEIN: I mean, I think the red flagness (ph) is balanced out by the fact that you do present - and I mean this as a compliment - like, there's a wounded bird quality that I do think - I will say as a woman that I did also find appealing.
The owners are asking the Arizona Supreme Court to excuse them from the city's anti-discrimination law. Those who break it face thousands of dollars in penalties — and even possible jail time.
BRENNAN: Well, no, I had to - it was between emotional mics or just doing - becoming a mime.
The more the debate focused on bathrooms, the more contentious it got. During the debate on the floor of the New Hampshire House, then-state Rep. Nancy Elliot, a Republican, claimed child molesters would be able to choose their gender identity and and prey on small children in restrooms.

JAY-Z: (Rapping) Haters, please forgive me. I let my wife write the will. I pray my children outlive me.
We believe leading our children to explore LGBTQ issues may have significant physical and mental health ramifications, the complaint reads. It goes on to say that including queer and trans kids in the anti-bullying materials may increase discrimination against students in our schools who do not agree with LGBTQ.
BODDEN: The difference is his wife will live with him.
What do you say to that — those folks?
I would explain to them how gender identity is your internal sense of what it is to be male or female. And then, for some people, their gender identity sometimes doesn't align with their biological sex, Harp says. And kids — when they asked those questions — they were like, 'Oh!' Like it made sense to them.

The commission report sparked a protest letter signed by 17 faith leaders, arguing that the report stigmatizes tens of millions of religious Americans, their communities and their faith-based institutions, and threatens the religious freedom of all our citizens.
Colonialism is a real thing. But I also want to point out, having talked to several of my friends in Africa, that not all Africans agree with this decision, she says. I think it's unfair for Americans to blame Africa or South America or the Philippines for this decision.
Growing up in San Francisco in the '70s, Alia Volz's family ran a booming weed-laced brownie business. I had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning, she says.
You've said that neither party comes to this process clean.
A good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a Supreme Court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the Republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.
DAVIES: Alia Volz's new memoir is called Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco.
My mom, upon receiving this information, after only dating the guy for three weeks, was a little taken aback. She wasn't looking to have a child. So there became a little push-pull between them for a while around the idea of this spirit child, which is, obviously, kind of a crazy thing to write about years after the fact, but I wanted to be true to my parents' visions of what was going on in their lives.
The commission's report on the religious freedom vs. anti-discrimination debate, published last September, came down squarely on the anti-discrimination side. The commission recommended that civil rights protections ensuring nondiscrimination were of preeminent importance and that religious exemptions to such policies must be weighed carefully and defined narrowly on a fact-specific basis.
Carlson-Thies is one of several conservatives who support a Fairness For All initiative to forge a compromise between advocates for LGBT rights and religious freedom, but the effort has had little success so far. The LGBT community and their allies have been cool to the notion of compromising their cause, while a group of more strident religious freedom advocates made clear their own opposition to the recognition of sexual orientation as a status worthy of civil rights protection.
Beyond that, Willing to Wait failed to address one issue that weighed heavily on Robinson: how gender dysphoria can make sex for a trans person really complicated — married or not.
What would challenge us financially more is if enrollment is hurt, he says. If we have fewer students seeking ordination in the United Methodist Church, that affects us financially as well. We are living in some pretty serious tension right now.
VOLZ: Well, yeah, San Francisco has changed quite a bit. With respect to cannabis, it is now legal for adult use. And San Francisco and then California were first in denoting cannabis as an essential business during coronavirus, which was a watershed moment. Nothing like that has happened before. So cannabis is very accessible to people. I feel that, at least for adults, that it should be. I think this is a good thing. But the culture has changed so much around it in ways that I find very heartbreaking.
SAGAL: Another difference - you do not have to write a brilliant novel to get on our show, just give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAITWAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. Now, let's welcome our first listener contestant. Hi, you are on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
ROCCA: And Melania. So - OK.
But my relationship with the I Ching as a kid was that I trusted it. And the fact that my mom felt confident using it made me feel confident as well. So I sometimes think about how, you know, the knowledge that my parents could have gone to prison at any time, how that should have been terrifying to me as a kid. And yet, it didn't keep me awake at night because I trusted my mom's decision-making abilities. And I trusted the I Ching then. It was later, more as a teenager, that I was like, oh, no. Wait. Science (laughter), you know? And I started to rebel more against the idea. But it's really only as an adult that I look back at the situation we were in and worry about the kid I was.
These parents formed a group called CAST — Conservatives of Allendale Stand Together. In a 29-page complaint to the school board, they accused liberals of trying to indoctrinate their kids with radical sexual ideology. They demanded that the district ban any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in sex ed — or any other class. Not only that, they also called on the superintendent to throw out a reference to queer and trans kids in the school district's anti-bullying campaign.
KLEIN: So get two right and you'll win our prize for one of our listeners, Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Neal playing for?
We are very clear that we will stand by our LGBTQ students, staff, faculty, alums, and friends, says Jay Rundell, president of the Methodist Theological School in Ohio, one of 13 official United Methodist Church seminaries. We will resist what we see as a narrow misuse of scripture and tradition.
Curry's reference only to freedom to worship, however, missed the point, according to some religious freedom advocates. They say they want the freedom to exercise their faith every day of the week, wherever they are — even if it means occasionally challenging the principle of absolute equality for all.
Justice Scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. But if you think about when the Supreme Court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. And Judge Garland, if you look at his work on the D.C. Circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. And I think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by Republicans.
ROCCA: Yeah. When Macron meets with Justin Trudeau, I mean, gay Twitter is going to explode.

BODDEN: They're kind of like, well, you do.
A majority of U.S. delegates at the United Methodist General Conference opposed the conservative resolutions on sexuality and marriage, but the U.S. share of global Methodism is declining while the church is growing in the Global South, especially Africa.
South Carolina is famous for its rough-and-tumble politics — in 2000, for example, there was a whisper campaign that John McCain had fathered a black child. He wound up losing to eventual President George W. Bush. It derailed his candidacy. With as wide a field as this one, and the stakes being so high, watch out for more dirty tricks. The primary will likely further winnow the GOP side. Donald Trump has a big lead in the polls; Ted Cruz is hoping to win over socially conservative voters in the northwestern part of the state; Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and John Kasich are contending for the significant portion of establishment Republicans.
We can't use equality to just wipe out one of the [First Amendment] rights, Carlson-Thies says, or say you can have the right, as long as you just exercise it in church, but not out in life.
(Rapping) Pull up, hop out, wreck. Got no time, but we got Pateks. I come around stepping around on necks. My chica got nicas (ph) upset. Why? Oh, why these - so mad for? They don't want Yonce on their door, Louis slugger to your 4-door. Careful, you get what you asked for. We go to Cuba, then Aruba...
I knew, of my own friends who were lesbians, this wasn't gonna help them at all, Robinson says. There's no way you can help a lesbian prevent STDs in this kind of format.

The Democratic National Committee blasted Trump for trying to silence Yates and predicted the confirmation of his nominee to lead the Justice Department would get tougher. Many top former DOJ officials, including Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. and civil rights chief Tom Perez, tweeted messages of support. Person of integrity/attorney with great legal skill, Holder wrote. Her judgment should be trusted.
VOLZ: He didn't remember, which seems convenient and perhaps was. But I should say about my dad and his epilepsy that the grand mal seizures would wipe out huge chunks of his memory, and there are many things that he wishes he remembers that he can't. He's a good custodian of the memories that he has, and they check out with my research and with the stories that other people I interviewed told. But there are huge episodes, huge swaths that are simply not there, and this was part of what wasn't there.

The government shouldn't be telling artists what they can and can't say, Breanna Koski, a co-owner of Brush & Nib, said. We're challenging this law not just for us, but for all artists to be able to create freely.
Some United Methodists in Africa say they hear U.S. and European liberals lecturing to them on what positions they should take on issues of sexuality, family and marriage, and it strikes them as the latest example of a colonialist attitude.
The nation is trying to catch up with a rapidly changing world. And people aren't quite sure how to define where we stand.
This is the kind of thing Robinson wishes her sex ed program had talked about.
After the public hearings, it became more of a public discussion. And within that public discussion, the issue of bathrooms became the core of the opposition, said Butler.
SAGAL: That was Derek Thompson, a senior editor at The Atlantic, writing about Dove soap's decision to make their new soap bottles look like what?
That said, Butler notes there has been no recent attempt to add gender identity to New Hampshire's anti-discrimination law.

This week, Franklin Graham, son of the late Rev. Billy Graham, questioned Buttigieg's claim to Christianity in a series of tweets, saying in part, As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized.
TOTENBERG: Right. We get a conservative for a seat previously held by a conservative, as opposed to the centrist liberal Garland likely would have been. This, in some ways, is the dress rehearsal for the next nomination, which, if it happens, will make all the difference in the world. Two of the justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Anthony Kennedy, are over 80. Justice Breyer is 78.
As Democratic presidential hopefuls work to position themselves as the candidate to unify the country and win over supporters of President Trump, an influential Iowa evangelical leader is inviting them to a forum on religion and politics traditionally reserved for Republicans ahead of Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses.
Bob Vander Plaats, president of The Family Leader, said he's sending invitations Friday to the top seven Democratic primary candidates in current polls.
After widespread condemnation, The Family Leader issued an apology and removed language stating that slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an African-American baby born after the election of the USA's first African-American President.
The idea of having sex as a trans person is weird because your brain is disconnected from your physical body, she explains. So when you look at your body, you don't want this, you know? So the idea of having sex in this body is hard ... because maybe I'll just look down and see this disgusting body of mine and cry or something, you know?

As the news was breaking of the directive from Yates, Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller told MSNBC's Greta Van Susteren that Yates' decision was a further demonstration of how politicized our legal system has become.
As Willing to Wait notes, the program does teach about contraceptives and STDs, but Robinson says all the discussion is focused on heterosexual relationships.
Asked about the argument that therapists should have an obligation to serve everyone, Haslam said, Lawyers don't serve everyone. ... Lawyers right now can say, 'I'm not the person to help you on that issue; I don't agree with what you're trying to do'; and they can turn down that person and they can go somewhere else.
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with writer Alia Volz. She has a new memoir about her mother's business selling pot-laced brownies in San Francisco in the 1970s. It also deals with Volz's parents' relationship and some remarkable events in San Francisco in the period. The book is called Home Baked.
The bill was approved by Tennessee lawmakers in April and would stipulate that licensed counselors not be punished if they refer clients to other therapists over sincerely held principles, as Nashville Public Radio has reported. LGBT advocates say the bill would make it harder for gays and lesbians to get counseling.
GREENE: Well, professor, if I might just ask you about an opinion piece that you wrote for the Charlotte Observer, you said your vision for civil rights has shifted over time and that there was a time when you would've watched from the sidelines discrimination against LGBT people and thought that it wasn't your battle. What's changed now?
And in this way, the brownies were really all over town. By late 1977, I think, is when they were doing 10,000 brownies a month. It was smart in that there was no fixed location for police to find. The brownies seemed to come from everywhere. And at the same time, it enabled them to reach all of the little culture pockets that were flourishing in the late '70s.
In response to this story, Willing to Wait sent a statement to NPR, which says that the program includes topics such as reproductive anatomy, STDs, healthy relationships, dating violence, consent laws, setting boundaries, refusal skills, goal setting, contraception methods including efficacy and limitations, and communicates the intrinsic value of every student without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity.
As NPR's Sarah McCammon has explained, there are clear, regional splits in the Palmetto State:

Tooley, who personally identifies with the evangelical tendency in the United Methodist tradition, says the long-standing church positions on matters of sexuality and marriage in the past reflected the influence of conservative Methodists in the United States.
Now what is true, Nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice Scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. And so I understand the politics that Republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.

VOLZ: (Laughter) Yes. And it was very early in there dating, in fact. He told my mom at dinner that he was carrying a child, and she's like, what are you talking about? (Laughter). But he explained that he was carrying a spirit child. This is a spirit that he felt was traveling with him and waiting to be born into the world. Ostensibly, this is me (laughter).
I'm not worried about my religious freedom, Curry said. I get up and go to church on Sunday morning, ain't nobody stopping me.

This week, the Trump administration weighed in on an important civil rights case heading to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Justice Department sided with a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding.

Those conservative doctrinal positions went against prevailing cultural and social trends, at least in the United States, but they didn't split the church into rival conservative and progressive camps because church leaders rarely enforced them.
So she would use the stroller to transport the brownies. And we'd go from business to business. And her customers just absolutely adored me and fawned over me. So I was very little. Obviously, I don't remember much clearly from this period. But I do have these flashes of memory. And there's a certain feeling that comes to me when I think of it. It was a very exuberant period in the city and especially in the Castro, where my mom was mostly working. And there was, I think, a lot of cheek-pinching and fawning and a lot of joy around it is the feeling that I get, anyway.
Despite the opposition Democrats may face in such a crowd, Christopher Hale, a faith adviser to President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign, said he hopes they will reach out to religious voters in surprising places.

But you just told me they were hatched. [Laughter]
SHAW: Well, I think these conversations are good to have. I think they're important to have as we deepen our understanding of what our national values and principles are. The question to me isn't whether we have these conversations. It's how we have these conversations. And I guess what disturbs me - I know what disturbs me - is when some people are treated as if they are not legitimate members of our society. That troubles me and its tone and its tenor. So that's part of a larger problem that we're having as a nation in this strange time in which we find ourselves.
They recently invited us into their home on a cold night, to talk about what's been going on in town. The VanderHelms say for them, this conversation is shaped by their faith. I come from a biblical worldview, says Kim. We were just, as you guys pulled up, we were reading the Bible together as devotions. So we do not believe God created people to have these desires.
On one hand, he points out that the American Counseling Association says you should always counsel from a valueless position. In other words, you don't put your own values into the conversation; you're there to help.
JOHNSON: Well, and the Justice Department briefing anticipated this argument. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall says race is different. There's a compelling government interest in eradicating discrimination based on race. Laws that target racial bias can survive very strict scrutiny, strict review under the First Amendment. But those same classifications aren't so clear, the Trump DOJ says, for sexual orientation. Colorado only began issuing same sex-marriage licenses in 2014. And a divided Supreme Court only ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry. There's still a lot of litigation out there on how and if old civil rights laws that mention sex actually covers sexual orientation too.
But to the LGBT community and its supporters, a refusal to place a child for adoption with a same-sex couple is unacceptable discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation. Those who oppose anti-discrimination efforts are often portrayed as out of step with the growing public acceptance of same-sex unions.
When you're talking about opening up restrooms and schools and in public places, it is just uncomfortable, unnatural and unwelcoming to many, many women and girls out there and I think that's what this really boils down to, said Banfield.
And he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared I think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that I might make. Because he thinks it's important.
Are you taking this on the road?
Legislation either to uphold LGBT rights or to limit them in the name of protecting religious freedom has advanced in several states, and further court battles are likely.
SAGAL: All right. Let's do it. Let's hear from Amy Dickinson first.
DRACE: I am a truck driver. I am a disc golf player. And I'm a father of four cats with my wife.
KLEIN: Neal, I'd like you to just do this for the journey.
I finally realized that I could not write an honest book without spending as much time on his thoughts and feelings and motives as I had with my mom. And what surprised me so much is how ready he was to go there. We dug through boxes together. We talked about some of his actions from back in the day that were really hurtful to other people. And he was, I think, very brave about it, acknowledging his role in it and also having a certain curiosity himself about both how he had acted and what drove him to act that way.
Within hours of the tragedy in Charlottesville, journalists, scholars and other leading voices weighed in around the Internet, with analysis and deeper understanding of how this unfolded.
DRACE: Let's go with the nuclear meltdown.
KLEIN: I don't. I definitely want you to do it.
BEYONCE: (Rapping) Twinning - Blue and Rumi, me and Solo, how fitting.
The only non-judge on the list is Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a Ted Cruz supporter during the primaries who has refused to endorse Trump and continued that position Friday, even in the face of a change from Cruz.
What Trump's comments Monday mean for how, exactly, he will handle the resurgence of white supremacists, remains unclear.
It really happened all the time, Mahoney said.

No, I didn't say you had.
In a bombshell letter to Justice Department attorneys working on cases filed by refugees and visa holders delivered around 5 p.m. Monday, Yates said she was not convinced about the legality of Trump's decision to block travelers from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia for 90 days; to suspend new refugee admissions; and to ban the acceptance of Syrian refugees indefinitely.
But he would have these grand mal seizures. And sometimes they led to psychological instability, as well as memory loss. But I find it fascinating because the idea of a spiritually associated seizure is not new. Dostoyevsky wrote rapturously about seizures. And some pretty interesting historical figures have been posthumously diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. So I don't know if my dad might be in that category. In any case, it was a strong force in his life.
A spokesman for Buttigieg, who was criticized by a prominent conservative Christian leader this week for being gay, said he would consider attending.
DAVIES: You know, your dad had a habit of not taking his medication for epilepsy, which led to some really troubling and bizarre incidents at times. It was one point where he said he had to go off hitchhiking to meet the Dalai Lama. And other things like that happened. Do you have insight into why he chose not to take the medicine for the epilepsy?
Beyoncé And Jay-Z Present A Unified Front On 'Everything Is Love'
Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, said of Yates' action: This is a remarkable but welcome development and sends a powerful message that there's something very wrong with a Muslim ban.
The following day, Jonas called up his good friend Essie Weingarten, president and founder of Essie Nail Polish. She loved the idea of a catnip pedicure. This summer, they will open six cat salons across the city, offering pedicures in 10 toxin-free colors, including Purrfect (ph) Pink, Commonly Calico and Litter Box Lemon.
You couldn't say anything to them, charged Elliot. If you did say something to this person, you could be accused of a hate crime.
PAT MCCRORY: We believe a court, rather than a federal agency, should tell our state, our nation and employers across the country what the law requires.
Let me conclude by asking you sort of a devil's advocate question.
The new list consists of 10 more possible nominees, including a U.S. senator who has refused to endorse Trump.
DRACE: Thank you, Chicago. I love you.
On Monday, Trump responded to the increasing pressure to react more forcefully, and gave a stronger rebuke. Racism is evil, Trump said. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.
TOTENBERG: No. They're both constitutional decisions.
TUCKER: There's been a lot of pop music made about marriage. I'm thinking about Richard and Linda Thompson's corrosive breakup album Shoot Out The Lights, Marvin Gaye's alimony concept album Here, My Dear, and the ups and downs charted in the many songs written separately by split spouses Loudon Wainwright and Kate McGarrigle. This Carters album is very much in that tradition with a significant difference - the classics I just listed were about marriages that fail. This one is about a marriage that prevails years on.
BODDEN: No, he won't. He won't.
KLEIN: Tell me more about your dead dad and your depression.
I just wanted them to understand that I'm a normal person, she says. I want to be treated just the same as everybody else. I want to get some job, and I want to be seen as just the register lady or something, you know what I'm sayin'? I don't wanna be looked at as 'Oh, the trans girl.' I just wanna be me.
DAVIES: ...In a way, they had a place in the sort of recognition of the medical benefits of marijuana, didn't they?
North Carolina, Justice Department Countersue Over 'Bathroom Law'
Haynes himself says LGBT rights and same-sex marriage are very important but that supporters of those causes cannot simply declare that one side wins all.
Our panelists read three purrfectly amusing stories about felines in the news, only one of which is true.
Vander Plaats noted that in recent weeks, several candidates have woven their personal faith into their pitches to voters. Warren has made the case that her Christian faith helped shape her liberal political values. Harris opened her campaign by calling for unity and speaking of her faith in God during her announcement speech in January.
VOLZ: Absolutely. I - you know, I want to say that I was so well cared for and surrounded by love and affection. I was not left to run wild. I was looked after - basically, at my mom's hip through my entire childhood. So there's no neglect in that.
One of the signers, Charles Haynes, director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum Institute in Washington, says religious conservatives are entitled to make claims of conscience.
SAGAL: That was a commentator on deadline.com celebrating the election of whom as president of France?
KLEIN: Neal, where do you rate your special on the Netflix and chill scale? Like, how chillable (ph) is your special?
In the past, the D.C. Circuit, as it is known, has been something of a farm team for the Supreme Court. The current chief justice, John Roberts, and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas, all served on the D.C. Circuit before being elevated to the Supreme Court.
FELBER: Remember Smudge, the hero cat who was caught on video saving his toddler friend from a vicious dog a couple of weeks ago? Of course you do. More than 130 million people watched it on YouTube. Well, the happy story has kind of a sour coda because in addition to being a hero, it now turns out that Smudge is a huge racist.
BRENNAN: Yeah, 'cause my ex said that three mics is the biggest red flag in the history of red flags. Do you agree?
And at that point the process has broken down. Democrats have not been blameless in this process. You cannot point to me a circumstance in which Democrats have left a seat open when a Republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.
KLEIN: B, his nickname was Killer Mike - he wasn't a rapper, though, he just murdered a lot of people?
I have always been a huge admirer of his. I've always felt that the way he approaches cases — the intellect, the care to follow precedent, the consensus building — were qualities that would make him an outstanding Supreme Court justice.
The commission chairman at the time, Martin R. Castro, went further with a statement of his own, saying, The phrases 'religious liberty' and 'religious freedom' will stand for nothing except hypocrisy so long as they remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Christian supremacy or any form of intolerance.
DAVIES: And I guess they both expected that the spirit child was on its way to the earth. You want to share that?
He says this belief is laid out in the Bible and he is following it to the best of his ability. I try to live my best to God's word, he says. But then for somebody that doesn't believe, do they look at me as a bigot? Do they look at me as a hater?
BRENNAN: Sliding into the DMs is when someone on Instagram especially direct messages you and it's of a sexual nature, hence the slide. Do you understand?
SAGAL: Thank you playing with us today. We love you, too. Bye-bye.
SAGAL: Comey's like, well, we have 41 openings - oh, 42.
GROVE: I want to say Macron.
JAY-Z: (Rapping) Vintage frames, I see nobody [expletive] with him.
THE CARTERS: (Singing) Let's make love in the summertime. Yeah. On the sands, beach sands, make plans to be in each other's arms. Let it breathe. Let it breathe. I want to drown in the depth of you, yeah, when the water's so blue, so blue. I need to take my time, oh, yeah, show you something real, so real, so real, so real. Let it breathe. So real. I want to you come inside right now so you know just how I feel, how I feel.
BODDEN: The whole investigation's been going on, and it's getting closer and closer. And then somebody said something to him, he's like, wait, I can just fire him? Done.
TOTENBERG: Well, people around Trump acknowledged that he's no Supreme Court expert. But he knows what he doesn't want. And he doesn't want surprises. And by that, he means somebody like Justice David Souter, who was appointed by the first President George Bush, and Chief Justice John Roberts, who is anathema to many conservatives because he voted to uphold the ACA.
KLEIN: ...B, he was sued by the other Mike Rowe for his web series, Really, Really Dirty Jobs; or C, he regularly made small insults to marginalized groups? You know, Mike Rowe aggressions.
A civil rights case over the state's LGBT law proceeds. David Greene talks to Theodore Shaw, head of the Center for Civil Rights at the University of North Carolina School of Law at Chapel Hill.
We may not like the claim of conscience, Haynes says, but you know, we don't judge claims of conscience on whether we like the content of the claim. We are trying to protect the right of people to do what they feel they must do according to their God. That is a very high value.
SAGAL: This is terrible. Andy, it is nice to have you with us. You're going to play the game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction.
TUCKER: There are sultry grooves all over this album like that one, a song called SUMMER. There's another alluring rhythm in BOSS, a song dominated by Beyonce singing about being successful and in charge. She's the boss of the song title. As a soul music horn section toots affirmatively, she rattles off a verse about how the success and wealth she has is important to her not least for what she can leave behind for future generations of African-American children.
So, I'm Judge Totenberg. I'm here for my interview. What are you going to ask me? What kinds of things do you ask?
KEN TUCKER, BYLINE: You can listen to Everything Is Love as the completion of a trilogy. In 2016, Beyonce released her album, Lemonade, which, among many other things, discussed an extramarital affair committed by a husband commonly thought to be her own. Then in 2017, Jay-Z released his album, 4:44, in which, among many other things, he agonized and apologized for being unfaithful. Now we get an album from The Carters, Jay-Z and Beyonce presenting themselves as a united front. Husband and wife, committed partners and musicians.
VOLZ: I've done a lot of thinking about this. And I think it's pretty interesting. My dad has a spiritual relationship - or had a spiritual relationship with his epilepsy. He described that in the moments leading up to a seizure, his pre-seizure aura would appear in his peripheral vision as a multi-colored mandala with all colors of the spectrum, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. He describes it as being like looking at God. And my dad is such a spiritually serious person that this really attracted him.
Haslam last week vetoed a proposal to make the Bible the official state book. He told NPR it trivializes the Bible. He also successfully urged lawmakers to withdraw a so-called bathroom bill, Tennessee's version of legislation that would require students to use restrooms according to their gender assigned at birth rather than one that matches the gender with which they identify. North Carolina and Mississippi have both approved such laws amid widespread criticism.
The influential Christian law firm also has offices in Washington, D.C. and has become nationally known for challenging nondiscrimination protections. The Alliance has logged nine high court wins in just seven years.
But the illnesses varied a lot. And there was a long time when nobody knew what it was. Some people got the Pneumocystis carinii. Some people had the wasting syndrome and terrible diarrhea. Some people had the Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. The variety of presentations of the symptom made the onset very mysterious. And it didn't get a lot of press at first because it emerged first within the gay male population. And this was a community that broader society was maybe eager not to look at and not to acknowledge.
As Maggie Haberman of The New York Times tweeted shortly after Trump's remarks on Monday:
Nathan Guttman, a reporter with Forward, an online news site aimed at Jewish Americans, penned a vivid piece about covering the march. He recounted watching as Spencer launched into a rant about the mayor of Charlottesville, Michael Signer.
Mahoney eventually took his own advice.
So I talk about my father and I reconciling, and confronting him about this moment was very difficult. It was difficult for me, and it was difficult for him. It upset him. And one of the things that I think really helped us come back together is that when this happened, he got very quiet, and he asked who was saying it. And when I said that it was both Cheryl and my mom who had told me this, he accepted it and took some ownership for the action. It made him very sad, you know, to think of having done that, right? I thought it was very brave of him to allow that to be the story.
VOLZ: Yeah. Of course. So as a kid, it was something that I was - of course I was aware of it. You would see - the presentation of AIDS was so dramatic physically. And it could happen very quickly. We'd be gone for a month and come back the next month. And somebody who had been a beautiful 30-year-old would look 70.
When Massachusetts (and other jurisdictions) redefined marriage to include same-sex couples, making it illegal to deny adoption to them., the Catholic agencies closed down their adoption services and argued that their religious freedom had been infringed.
In 2009, he proposed the state expand its anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression to address transgender citizens' concerns about housing, employment, even physical safety.
OLYMPIA, Wash. – The Washington Democratic Party says it will donate contributions from controversial spiritual leader JZ Knight to the Anti-Defamation League and the campaign to uphold gay marriage. That announcement late Friday follows the release of new video clips that show Knight making offensive and at times bizarre comments about gay people and people from Mexico.
During a recent appearance before the Council on Foreign Relations, Bishop Michael Curry, leader of the Episcopal Church in the United States, said he has witnessed the persecution of Christians in other parts of the world and doesn't see anything comparable in the United States.
By the way, when did you offer him the job?
But because it didn't settle the looming question on whether the First Amendment guarantees of religious freedom are more important than a state or city's anti-discrimination laws, similar cases are again simmering in lower courts — including Arizona and Colorado.
But some DOJ veterans and law professors found some fault with how she handled the conflict over the immigration order. On the Lawfare blog, professor Jack Goldsmith pointed out that Yates had not clearly determined the immigration order was unconstitutional or cited other legitimate bases for refusing to defend it.
VOLZ: (Laughter) That question makes me laugh a little bit. So as a child, I was pretty accepting of especially my mom's worldview. I had a lot of trust in her. She was always cool in a crisis. And I believed that she knew what she was doing. My parents, I would say, did not use the I Ching to decide what I should or shouldn't be allowed to do. I didn't have a whole lot of rules as a child. I kind of felt like I was part of the decision-making process to a degree that, I think, is pretty unusual.
DAVIES: Was your mom ever recognized, officially, for any of this stuff?
In New Hampshire, Stone said the opponents' framing of the issue became a powerful shorthand in the debate about the transgender rights bill.

The focal point of Robinson's room is a massive, flat-screen TV, where she spends hours each day playing video games. Her most recent obsession is a Western-themed, action-adventure game, where she can play other gamers remotely.
SAGAL: Thank you so much for playing.
ROCCA: Comey found out by - right - somebody was watching TV right behind us him or something, right?
LORETTA LYNCH: This law provides no benefit to society, and all it does is harm innocent Americans.

You can choose to have whatever opinion you have on the president's statement today condemning white supremacists, but it's hard to believe he would have read it out if he'd had his druthers. No, the real Donald Trump was the one we saw on Saturday when he decided to condemn violence 'on many sides' in response to the deliberately provocative and intentionally violent neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia; when he decided to refer to the events as 'sad' in tweets; when he wished 'best regards' to those injured by the car that was deliberately smashed into them, killing 1 and injuring 20. When he acted in that way, he was operating according to his instinct. And his instinct said: Do not attack the white supremacists.

Well, he's a very good actor because I had dinner with him Sunday night [at a small charity event], and he looked like — he kept just was saying he wasn't going to get it. [Laughter]
KURTIS: Finally, consumers without arms, legs or heads can buy a soap that truly represents them.
There's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the Supreme Court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. George Washington nominated a couple of Supreme Court justices in his last year. And obviously George Washington had better poll numbers, I'm sure, than I did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, I think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.
Justice lawyers had been in courts all over the country this past weekend on the opposing side of refugees and travelers, sometimes making weak arguments and stating they didn't have enough information about the executive order and its legal underpinnings.
South Carolina prides itself on being the decider in GOP politics. Before 2012, it had correctly picked every eventual since 1980. But struggling former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had a breakout debate performance just days before the primary there in 2012. He defended against questions about his personal life and wound up breaking the streak. That helped sway much of the support statewide toward him and helped him earn a decisive victory. (Gingrich looked like he had momentum coming out of South Carolina, but a flush-with-cash superPAC supporting Romney, tore down Gingrich as the contest moved to Florida.)
Mahoney, who was openly gay, would explain the reality of the law in Arizona.
And I think he is convinced that he can do a really good job, partly because he has relationships with the judges that are already on the court, and he's shown himself to be a consensus builder. And he believes, rightly, that we're at a time where the more consensus we can forge, the better off we're going to be.
Another split may occur between the United Methodist Church as a whole and some of the 13 official Methodist seminaries, many of which are institutionally committed to an LGBTQ-inclusive approach.
The environment for LGBT rights in New Hampshire has changed in the intervening years, said Butler. The LGBT community is more visible and better organized, and public attitudes are changing about transgender people.
DAVIES: The description of the delivery is really something. I mean, your mom wanted a natural childbirth, and it turns out you were breached. And it was long and arduous and painful. And then the doctor declares, she's a girl.
They also represent Colorado's baker Jack Phillips, who is again suing Colorado's commission on civil rights for harassment.
News outlets in New Hampshire media began using the phrase bathroom bill in their coverage of the bill, which focused the debate even further on bathrooms.
Trump Fires Acting Attorney General For Refusing To Defend Immigration Order
And now some questions about the incoming Trump administration - some potentially big issues before the Supreme Court and Trump's progress toward nominating a ninth Supreme Court justice. For this, I'm joined by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg. Hi, Nina.
(SOUNDBITE OF BROTHERS OSBORNE SONG, 21 SUMMER)
BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. U-tah (ph), me-Bill (ph).
I'm tired of being called a child molester, because I'm not. I've never met a transgender person who is or have been. And I know that if I was in a bathroom and some pervert came in, he would be sorry about it, said Gerri Cannon, a transgender woman who met with lawmakers every day to keep the bill moving forward.
GREENE: Now the state of North Carolina is basically accusing the Obama administration of trying to rewrite laws, suggesting that this should be left to Congress and that the Obama administration has an agenda here that they're trying to put forth. I mean, does the state have an argument there?
SIEGEL: Now, during the campaign, Trump actually released lists of people who would be the kind of people he would nominate to the Supreme Court - 21 names I believe. What - who are they?
The state House eventually passed the bill by a single vote, but the tide was turning and a month later the state Senate voted unanimously to kill the bill.
Weiser was elected in a giant blue wave that swept the state last year, along with a new, and openly gay, Gov. Jared Polis. Weiser says the high court, in its opinion, never challenged the state's anti-discrimination laws.
DAVIES: Well, and what's fascinating is that, you know, your dad - I mean, you write about this in the book - because he would sometimes not take his medication, he's had some really difficult mental episodes, and his memory is not reliable. And when you went to ask him, is this true that you went to a gay bathhouse after your child was born, what was his reaction?
SIEGEL: NPR's Nina Totenberg, thank you.
The VanderHelms say they believe that being gay or trans is a sin — a sin that a person can resist. Steve compares being homosexual to lying, overeating, lust. He says it's no different than me in my younger days looking at pornography.
BODDEN: Do you think it took Trump this long to fire Comey because he just found out he could?

SAGAL: So who did our modest, thoughtful president fire for being a, quote, showboat?
SIEGEL: And what do you know about what Donald Trump really wants in the way of a Supreme Court justice?
DAVIES: Well, Alia Volz, thanks so much for speaking with us.
VOLZ: It has been an absolute pleasure, Dave.
Allendale Public Schools maintains that the sex education program it has used for a decade, called Willing to Wait, meets the requirements of Michigan law, emphasizing the benefits of abstaining from sex until marriage. The superintendent, Garth Cooper, believes that LGBTQ+ kids get the same thing from it as everybody else.
THE CARTERS: (Singing) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Stack my money fast and go fast, fast. Fast like a Lambo. Scoot, scoot, scoot. Jumping off the stage. Crowd better savor. I can't believe we made it. This is what we made, made. This is what we're thankful. This is what we made. I can't believe we made it. This a different thing. Have you ever seen a crowd going ape [expletive]? Give me my chain.
The latest video clips were released by the conservative Freedom Foundation. In them Knight says gay men were once Catholic women. And attacks people from Mexico.
VOLZ: No. And I know that seems strange. But it was something that I learned so young that I don't have a specific memory about it. It was always who we are. So I had this understanding of my family as an outlaw family from the very beginning.
SIEGEL: And first, I'd like you to sort out for us two apparently conflicting statements that Donald Trump made on 60 Minutes. One was about the Supreme Court and abortion.
VOLZ: He takes, not Dilantin, but another medication. I think it's Tegretol. And he says he hasn't had a seizure in 20 years.
SAGAL: And we do hope that cats are listening because a short while ago with special guest panelist Rosie Perez, we featured a Bluff The Listener game about cats.
In a statement to NPR, a spokesman for O'Rourke said the former congressman would not accept the invitation. Vander Plaats and the Family Leader have unapologetically provided a forum for dangerous anti-LGBTQ hate speech on numerous occasions, Chris Evans said. They are the antithesis of the unifying, inclusive, welcoming atmosphere that our campaign prides itself on in Iowa and across the country. We will not be participating in this forum.
Justice Kennedy was confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and I'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of Democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's office. So we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that Democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the Supreme Court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the Supreme Court, but the integrity of the Senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.
SAGAL: Emmanuel Macron, the new president, he's a rich businessman who has never held office before. And he ran for the presidency saying that politicians have failed the people, and it was time to return when France was great. All true. He's just like Donald Trump, except Macron can speak better English.
3. Debates could sway the race
Her successor, Boente, pledged to defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected, including the immigration order, which his office in Virginia has been working on for days.
KLEIN: OK, Neal, your first Mike is a Canadian 17-year-old high school student named Mike Rowe. Young Mike Rowe ended up in court why? A, he started a software company called Mike Rowe Soft and he was sued by Microsoft...
The debate didn't play out the way he expected.
CHRISTINA AGUILERA: Come on. Come on. Yeah. (Vocalizing). Come on. Come on.
I agree with what Franklin tweeted; my guess is the base that is gonna show up at the Family Leadership Summit is gonna agree with what Franklin tweeted, Vander Plaats said. But why run from that conversation?
It's the first time The Family Leader has invited candidates actively seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to the event, a spokesman said. Vander Plaats acknowledged that the group – known for fighting same-sex marriage – is an unlikely venue for Democrats, but added, If you're going to cast a vision of unity, I think you need to be able to have the courage then to go to that venue ... and cast that vision.
FELBER: In appearance after appearance since, Smudge has consistently bristled and spat at blacks, Latinos and even his local Bakersfield news anchor who is Asian.
Trump Administration's Stance In Cake Refusal Case Is The Latest Letdown For LGBT Advocates
You get points just for showing up, Vander Plaats said. And so I think our audience would embrace them.
But he's not — he's not a pol.
I think being behind a screen when people don't see my face, it's way easier to talk to people, she explains. So I can just be this Westerner running around and no one cares — like that's just me now.
ROCCA: Wait, what are you guys shaving?
VOLZ: Well, first of all, so Harvey was not a customer. He had sworn off drugs. But his camera shop, which was also his campaign headquarters, was one of my mom's regular stops because other people around him and who were working on his campaign were customers. So that was how that connection happened. But he was very much out in the neighborhood walking around, talking to people. He was very personable and very connected to the community. And so my mom knew him.
ANDY DRACE: Hey, this is Andy Drace from Hickory, N.C.
And when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the Senate saying, I won't meet with a nominee; I won't provide a nominee a hearing; I will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. That matters to people.
FARSAD: But the thing about Marine Le Pen, she didn't ever scare me as much as Trump, I think, because she spoke in complete sentences. And her, like, white nationalism had a certain je ne sais quoi.
BRENNAN: I - yeah, I get it and I love it.
During a recent visit to Iowa, Hoffman-Zinnel noted, Buttigieg was met with anti-gay hecklers. At one stop, a protester dressed as Buttigieg pretended to whip a man dressed as Jesus Christ while he carried a wooden cross, while another protester dressed as the devil looked on.
It is every parent's natural right to teach their OWN children what they believe in regards to sexuality, part of the statement reads. It is not the right of a minority of our community to impose their desire for comprehensive sexuality education inclusive of LGBTQ subjects to be taught to OTHER people's children.
There are no federal protections, no state or city protections, Mahoney said. Your best solution is to get involved and change the law.
Do they look at me as a bigot?
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're listening to my interview with writer Alia Volz. Her new memoir describes her mother's successful business serving marijuana-laced brownies in the 1970s in San Francisco and her parents' relationship at a time of cultural and social change in the city. Volz's book is Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco.
JAY-Z: (Rapping) Sir acid, like his dad's, [expletive] is trippy.
He went to work for the city and advocated for a Phoenix law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The ordinance would apply to housing, employment and other public accommodations — just as the law already did for categories like race, sex, marital status and religion.
GROSS: Fresh AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our interviews and reviews are produced and edited by Amy Salit, Phyllis Myers, Sam Briger, Lauren Krenzel, Heidi Saman, Therese Madden, Mooj Zadie, Thea Chaloner and Seth Kelley. I'm Terry Gross.
Well in fact, the American people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the United States with sufficient electoral votes. And they also decided that the Republicans would be in the majority. They didn't say, We're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. They said, No, you're the president for four years, and Mr. McConnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the Senate.
I can't think of a single civil rights law that doesn't have some people who are unhappy about it, says Karen Narasaki, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. But once the country has said, 'Well, we believe that people who are LGBT need to be protected from discrimination,' then how do you make sure that happens?
DAVIES: As you and your mom made these deliveries, did you find people who you had known for years and years getting sicker and sicker?
SAGAL: How do I know it's not Smith Burg from Landon Grove? So where is Smithburg, Md.?
Well, I'm not sure about that.
GREENE: OK, we've been speaking with Ted Shaw. He's a distinguished professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, where he also directs the Center for Civil Rights. Professor, thanks so much for joining us this morning.
BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR News quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.
If the seminaries refuse to abide by the church's more stringent positions, they could conceivably lose some of their church funding. On the other hand, if they go along with those positions and alienate prospective students, they could also suffer.
The debate over bathrooms and who should use them picked up steam after North Carolina's recent law requiring people to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. But the debate started years before North Carolina took it up.
BODDEN: Just to get more women?
It did not make sense to a lot of other people. Outraged parents started showing up at public hearings to protest, forming long lines to speak in front of the school board and sex ed advisory board. At one meeting, a parent named Sylvia Rhodea stood at the podium and said, When you fundamentally discredit the very nature of God's creation of our youth as male and female, you are seeking to discredit God.
SAGAL: If you are a man - and I know some of you are - and you're finding it hard to understand why this is so offensive to women, just imagine going into the shaving cream aisle where they have those tubes of shaving cream. And imagine that in order to represent different kinds of men, all the cans are different lengths.
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in today for Terry Gross. Our guest, Alia Volz, writes that before she could spell her own name, she knew she was from an outlaw family. In the late '70s when she was a baby and a toddler, her parents had a roaring business baking and selling marijuana-laced brownies. Thousands a month to hippies, artists, office workers and activists in San Francisco. Volz often made the rounds with her mom, selling their wares to grateful customers every Friday. As colorful as that sounds - and it was - it's no less interesting than another story told in her new memoir, the tale of her parents' relationship.
Only two justices would have held that the baking of a custom wedding cake is protected as speech by the First Amendment, said Kaipo Matsumura, who teaches law at Arizona State University.The other justices refrained from commenting on the issue and just reserved that question for future decisions in other cases.
Hale noted that more than 80% of white evangelicals supported Trump in 2016 — and evangelicals make up a significant share of voters in many key Midwestern states.
SIEGEL: So how soon do you think it'll be before the incoming president announces his nominee to fill the current vacancy?
Delegates at the church's General Conference, meeting in St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 23 to Feb. 26, adopted several resolutions that not only reaffirmed the church's longstanding conservative positions but also introduced tough new measures for their enforcement. Methodist clergy who officiate at any marriage not involving a man and a woman will now face a one-year suspension for the first offense and permanent removal from the ministry for any subsequent offense.
DAVIES: Right. And then, through all this, there was your mom with Sticky Fingers Brownies, the marijuana-laced brownies, which, at its height, was, you know, moving something like 2,800 brownies a week - your mom and an interesting crew of others that distributed these. What's interesting is that this wasn't the kind of operation where you'd knock on the door and get a password. Explain how this enterprise connected with its customers.
2020 Democrats Talk Faith; Conservative Christian Leaders Respond
Many writers also took on the response from President Trump, whose initial reaction to the violence in Charlottesville criticized equally both sides of the protest. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, Trump said, in remarks that brought condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans.
It's a much different political reality in Colorado where the state's new Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser will defend the state against Phillips.
PEREZ: ...Kept getting kitty litter stuck in between their toes. Knowing that his beloved felines hated water and would freak out every time he dug into their little paws, he was perplexed.
The South Carolina primary for Democrats will be the first significant measure of African-American voters in a state. Eight years ago, black voters made up 55 percent of the Democratic electorate in the state. Polls have shown that's a demographic Sanders, the Vermont independent, has struggled with compared to Clinton. But coming off strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, and closing the gap with Clinton nationally, Sanders could well be competitive.
ALIA VOLZ: Of course. Well, San Francisco in the 1970s was coming out of the Summer of Love, this huge influx of young people who'd come out to experiment with new lifestyles. That was very much over. But all kinds of new subcultures were flourishing. The way that I think about it sometimes is if the '60s were a sketchpad, the '70s would be the box of crayons. There was just wonderful and crazy experimentation. Some of it went horribly awry. And some of it was spectacular.
But most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. And they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.
SAGAL: You know what? They were right. We have gay marriage, now everything's gone to hell.
DAVIES: On the other hand, I mean, it sounds like you felt very much loved and accepted, which probably has a lot more to do with how a kid grows up than what they necessarily inhale or eat.
Democrats head to Nevada first, Feb. 20th, but they are already trying to appeal to the largest block of voters in the state — African Americans. That was apparent at the Democrats' debate Thursday night. Hillary Clinton hopes to rebound from a drubbing in New Hampshire at the hands of Bernie Sanders.
It's very rare to find a purely conservative or a purely liberal congregation, Tooley says. So if there is some sort of a division, or if there's the creation of a new liberal Methodist church, that almost inevitably will generate painful divisions in local congregations. Often the clergy are more liberal than the laity. So in many situations, you may have pastors who would like to join the new, more liberal denomination, but a majority of the lay people in their church may prefer to stay in the old denomination.
VOLZ: Not in a very conscious way. Although, I think it did affect me. I was a child who always enjoyed hanging out with adults and was awkward around other children. And I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. As an adult, I look back at it and wonder how much of that might have come out of the idea of carrying a big secret and how that makes you build walls around it and how that makes you shut down, in some ways. At the time, I wasn't very conscious of it. I just - I had a pat answer for when people asked what my parents did. And I knew very clearly that there were huge parts of our home life that I couldn't talk about.
DAVIES: Which meant that you as a kid had to keep a really big, important secret, a family secret. Do you remember being told what the stakes were or how you knew?

TED SHAW: That certainly is in question. And I guess that transgender people would say that they don't really choose their gender, that their gender is a matter of both biology but some other matters that go beyond genitalia. But that's - yeah, that's at the core of this confrontation.
VOLZ: I think it was a blow to him. I think it was a blow to his ego. And the story that I had grown up with in my family - and I don't - I'm not even sure when I was told this - but was that he left the hospital and went to a gay bathhouse and spent the day there, which is a difficult moment to begin with. That was one of the more challenging conversations I had with my father in writing this book, I have to admit.
One of the things that you do in the book is you talk about kind of the history of San Francisco. And in the 1970s, there was all of this kind of explosion of creativity and art and experimentation. But there was also some really dark stuff. You know, the Peoples Temple, which was led by Jim Jones, was active in the city and very connected to a lot of the liberal politicians. And then there was the horrific assassinations of the mayor, Moscone, and then the supervisor, the councilman, Harvey Milk that, I guess, was not a customer of your mom, but somebody that she met on her rounds a lot. How did all of that affect her?
VOLZ: Which is also true. So it wasn't an outright lie. It was a withholding of information.
Trump's additional list, coming just days before the first debate, suggests he wants to add diversity to his earlier all-white list of eight men and three women. The second list, like the first, consists of bedrock conservatives, many with records hostile to abortion rights, same-sex marriage and federal regulations.
KLEIN: Now, at what point in your stand-up did you start thinking, I got to start adding mics? One mic can't hold everything Neal Brennan has to offer.
VOLZ: Sure. And I want to say that my mom also confirms and describes that my dad identified the moment of conception and didn't even bother getting a pregnancy test. She believed him, and it turned out that he was right. She began to show. It became obvious. So that is a kind of a story, kind of a myth that I grew up with. I don't know how many people have these really high and magical myths about their births (laughter), but I sure had one. My dad, however, was convinced that I was going to be a boy - absolutely certain. And because he'd been right about everything else, my mom went along with it, too.
-- Midlands: In 2008, conservative candidates split support in the Upstate, and Arizona Sen. John McCain ran strong in the establishment-minded Midlands and Lowcountry for a win. In 2000, McCain was also strong in the Lowcountry, which includes Charleston and Hilton Head, but George W. Bush beat him out in the rest of the state to claim victory.
And so although I've always believed that he would make an outstanding Supreme Court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the Supreme Court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring — or at least increasing — the American people's confidence in our justice system.
DAVIES: You're in San Francisco today, when the rules are all so different. I don't know. Just reflect on that, how different it is, the attitude towards cannabis and its availability.
The pending case is an obvious attempt to harass the baker, said Jim Campbell, Phillips' attorney from the Alliance Defending Freedom.
For her part, Robinson cannot wait to leave. She is headed to Chicago for college, where she says she hopes to finally find a community that will accept her for who she is.
To those among you who repeatedly used the label 'the bathroom bill,' who incorporated this into every headline and story lead and failed to tell the whole and complete truth of this legislation, I say you are not journalists. You have served merely as stenographers to ignorance, hatred and discrimination, said then-state Sen. Jackie Cilley.
GROVE: Thank you very much for having me.
It's pretty clear that the vitriol in this is not the kind of thing that we support as a Democratic Party. We strongly believe in equality and inclusiveness, Strong says.
But it was around. It was so much a part of the environment that it would be unreasonable to assume that I didn't inhale it as secondhand smoke. And of course, the brownies taste like chocolate, so I'm sure I snuck some. But it's not like I was - you know, it's not like my parents were feeding me pot brownies. I want to be really clear about that. Where I think it might be more damaging is with the harder drugs. Cocaine is a substance that alters one's personality in a fairly significant way. So there's that. But I also want to say that all of the kids growing up in the Sticky Fingers warehouse came out just fine. We're all responsible adults and contributors to society. So...
The chickens have come home to roost, says Valerie Bridgeman, the academic dean of the Methodist Theological School in Ohio.

And I have confidence that — without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case — he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the Constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.
VOLZ: It did. And I think that by the time I was maybe old enough to really question those ideas myself, the role of marijuana had changed so much culturally that I had a whole different answer.
SAGAL: You earned a point for Amy Dickinson. You've won our prize. Carl Kasell will record the greeting on your home answering device, whatever it may be. Congratulations, Andy.
The state found Phillips had violated the state's anti-discrimination law and filed an administrative complaint against him. Phillips' attorneys are seeking an injunction to halt the state from moving forward on that complaint.
KLEIN: Bill, how did Neal do on our quiz?
Phillips said the message about sex and gender identity conflicted with his Christian religious beliefs.
The Justice Department confirmed its Office of Legal Counsel had done a review of the order to determine whether it was on its face, lawful, and properly drafted.

JOHNSON: More than 80 Republican members of Congress say they're going to file their own briefs supporting this cake shop owner. He even appeared on Capitol Hill this past week with Utah Senator Mike Lee. But this matter has been getting a very different reception in the LGBT community. The American Civil Liberties Union says it was shocked that the Justice Department would support what it calls a constitutional right to discriminate. And at Lambda Legal, which fights for LGBT people, Sharon McGowan, who directs strategy for Lambda Legal, says the Trump White House has put a target on the backs of LGBT people in order to score points with its political base.
TUCKER: It's very impressive the way the music here shifts easily between hip-hop rapping and R&B vocalizing, between Beyonce's deep-voice croon and Jay-Z's high-pitched exclamations. On LOVEHAPPY, the duo swaps lines back and forth, the lyrics playfully pointed. The first words of the song are happily in love, and they seem to have reached a point in their relationship where they can joke - very ruefully - about Jay-Z's infidelity.
JAY-Z: (Rapping) Sitting - dock of the bay with a big yacht.
Last summer, the court narrowly sided with Phillips — and admonished the state's commission for showing animus against religion.
Legal analysts are divided in their assessment of the debate. A federal judge, ruling on a Mississippi religious freedom law, concluded that by protecting specific beliefs, the bill constitutes an official preference for certain religious tenets, and may therefore be unconstitutional. Other laws and proposals, however, are written in support of beliefs held by several different religions and thus may not run afoul of the First Amendment's bar on an establishment of religion.
Washington Democrats Reverse Course, Shed JZ Knight Contributions
When it comes to the Supreme Court, I've appointed two women, one Hispanic. And in each case, the good news is that I appointed the person who I absolutely thought was the best person for the job. In this case, Merrick Garland is the best person for the job.
GROVE: A jar of margarine? I have no idea.
Other parents agreed, insisting that the idea of gender fluidity didn't match the values of the vast majority of the town. They said discussing LGBTQ+ issues with kids could put ideas in their heads and argued that families — not schools — should be responsible for these conversations.
Robinson remembers taking Willing to Wait in eighth grade and believes the program is tone-deaf. She says it sent a message of, Don't have sex — or else. Even though it's called sex ed, she says, no one wanted to say the 'sex' word.
DAVIES: We're speaking with Alia Volz. Her new memoir is called Home Baked: My Mom, Marijuana, And The Stoning Of San Francisco. We will talk more after a short break.

Brush & Nib Studio designs custom invitations for events like weddings. The shop owners say making an invitation for a same-sex wedding would violate their Christian belief that marriage is only between a man and a woman.

A lot of them are using faith as kind of a focal point, as a centerpiece, Vander Plaats said. So we'd like to find out what makes them tick.

Trump's list includes none of the conservative lawyers who practice regularly before the Supreme Court, nor does it include any of the highly regarded conservative judges who sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the court that the late Justice Antonin Scalia served on, and on which Obama nominee Garland now serves as Chief Judge.
And Jia Tolentino, a writer for The New Yorker and a graduate of the University of Virginia, meditated on Charlottesville's progressive guise and ability to hide its dark racial past. While I was at U.V.A., the fact that slaves had built the school was hardly discussed, and the most prominent acknowledgment that Jefferson was a slave owner came on Valentine's Day, when signs went up all over campus that said 'TJ ♥s Sally.' 
The Seattle Times has investigated this claim in depth, along with the stories of two other men who also say Murray abused them when they were young. According to the Times report, too much time has passed to file criminal charges, but the same is not true for a civil suit.
 '[L]ittle Mayor Signer — SEE-NER — how do you pronounce this little creep's name?' asked Richard Spencer, a right-wing leader who dreams of a 'white ethnostate,' as he stood on a bench under a tree to rally his troops, deprived of their protest. The crowd knew exactly how to pronounce his name: 'Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew' some shouted out. The rest burst out in laughter. And that was one of the only moments of levity the alt-right audience gathered under the tree enjoyed.

The event has loomed large in past Republican caucus campaigns, drawing about 3,000 voters in 2015, when then-candidate Donald Trump famously criticized the late Republican Sen. John McCain's military service at the event.
Number two, with respect to my actions when I was a junior senator, you will recall that I never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. I never said that a nominee should not get a vote. And what I also said at the time was that I was concerned about some of Judge Alito's views that I considered more troubling. But in the case of Merrick Garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.
In the aftermath of the conference action, the United Methodist Church is likely to lose some of its unity.

President Trump has fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, concluding she has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to defend his executive order that imposes a temporary ban on refugees and visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries.
The collision of two core American values — freedom of religion and freedom from discrimination — is prompting a showdown in legislatures and courts across the country.
Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader and University of Virginia alum who coined the term 'alt-right,' would likely count that openness as its own incremental success. 'If you greeted someone in 1985 and you said, 'all gays should marry,' you actually would get a lot of laughs,' Spencer told The Atlantic last year, not long after the election. 'By 2015, gay marriage is popular. What is possible has shifted. That's what the alt-right is doing. It's shifting the reality of what's possible, and imagining a reality in which they are.'

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump expanded his list of potential Supreme Court nominees Friday.
VOLZ: To an extent. My parents weren't trying to scare me with it. But from a practical standpoint, they needed me to understand that what we were doing was illegal and that if I told anyone, including other children - who might tell an adult - it could have very serious consequences for our family. So I did know from the very beginning that if I told anyone what my parents really did that they could go to prison.

And if there's one thing we know about Donald Trump, when there's a woman being mistreated, he won't be far away.
This kind of struggle is playing out in communities across the country. In a recent national survey by the nonprofit GLSEN, less than 1 in 10 LGBTQ+ students said they received sex ed that was inclusive of their identities. In some places, laws expressly prohibit teachers from discussing LGBTQ+ people or topics in a positive way — in other words, promoting homosexuality. Activists commonly refer to these as no promo homo laws.

But can you blame the Republicans who look at this nomination and say, There's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court.

KLEIN: You do have a lot of red flags just up and down.
KURTIS: Look. He's a showboat. He's a grandstander. You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that.
In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition, he said he is talking to a lot of folks to get some input on the bill and that he had boiled his thinking down to this central question: whether therapists could truly leave their values out of their work.
But one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. And sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the American people actually matter more than your short-term politics. They actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. And there have been a number of times where, as president of the United States, I've had to do things that I knew were bad politics but I understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.
Daniel Hoffman-Zinnel, executive director of One Iowa, an LGBTQ rights group, expressed mixed feelings about the invitation to Democratic candidates.
DAVIES: You know, you mentioned that your mom would often make business decisions and life decisions often by consulting the I Ching, you know, this way of tossing these coins to get a reading on what should be done. I'm wondering, as a kid, did you ever feel like your life was being governed by these forces that couldn't be seen? That ever bother you?
Their position is completely hypocritical to what it actually means to be a Christian, she said. If they're reaching out to evangelicals and saying, 'I am a Christian, but I support gay marriage; I am a Christian, but I support abortion,' that's being hypocritical.
FELBER: (Laughter) And now you're just trolling for them.
DAVIES: You know, you write in the book that brownie crumbs blanketed the floor where you played. Between secondhand smoke, secret finger swipes of batter and stolen crumbs, you - the tots probably consumed a significant amount of cannabis. And there was some drug use among your parents and your friends beyond marijuana, you know, a lot of cocaine. You know, there are people who would be appalled reading this. What's your take on this? Did you ever feel like any of this seemed irresponsible in retrospect?
ROCCA: He fired Gary Busey with more tact.
The bill's original sponsor, Ed Butler, notes that while the focus on bathrooms certainly didn't help his bill, it wasn't the only factor in its defeat. New Hampshire lawmakers were also passing a marriage equality law at the time. For some, Butler said, also passing a transgender rights bill as well was too much, too soon.
It's very unusual for the Justice Department to refuse to defend a law or an executive order, though it isn't unprecedented. During the Obama administration, for example, top officials decided not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. The Supreme Court eventually ruled in favor of same-sex marriage.
BEYONCE: (Rapping) In a glass house still throwing stones.
Her letter cited a sense of responsibility for both law and justice:
So did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that Republicans really do like him?
The bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. The real argument is the one that you made, Nina, which is that they don't want a Democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a Democrat to fill the seat.
Last year, the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled against the duo, which is represented by the Scottsdale-based Alliance Defending Freedom.
But he added that if a candidate like Buttigieg were to accept, it could open a door to important conversations.
Mabry says he didn't know about PrEP, an HIV-prevention pill.
Clinton also led in South Carolina in 2008, but those leads evaporated once Barack Obama proved he could win in lily-white Iowa. He not only carried the black vote 78 percent to 19 percent over Clinton, but he also won with women (also a majority) and young voters. Sanders has been beating Clinton by huge margins with young voters, and even won women in New Hampshire.
We have seen a great number of false equivalencies in the past two years, and the most recent Presidential election was defined by them. Yet it remains striking to hear Trump imply that Nazis and the interracial group of demonstrators who gathered to oppose them were, in essence, equally wrong. It would have been naïve to expect the President to unambiguously condemn neo-Confederates (Heritage, not hate, etc.), but Nazis? For reasons that are not hard to discern, the swastika, at least in the United States, has always been more clearly legible as a symbol of racial bigotry than the Confederate flag.
Coming up, Maureen Corrigan reviews the compelling memoir of a Vietnamese refugee who fled the fall of Saigon with his family and grew up in a Pennsylvania town. This is FRESH AIR.
SAGAL: Now what do you do there in Hickory?
Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam says he is deciding whether to sign legislation that would allow therapists to refuse service based on religious objections.
BRENNAN: ...I'm going to go with A.
VOLZ: She remembers one day in December of 1981 walking down Castro Street, making her deliveries. And in the window of Star Pharmacy, there was a poster that said gay cancer. And it had photographs of a man's legs and feet with little purple spots on them, which turned out to be Kaposi's sarcoma. And my mom saw that poster and just thought, that's strange. I saw one of those spots on one of my friend's wrist today. It just was a little thing. And then, pretty quickly, people started to get sick.

And now we're into this tug of war. This week, the Justice Department and the Trump administration sided with the baker, said the government couldn't compel him to engage in free speech. And in their brief, said an artist cannot be forced to paint. A musician cannot be forced to play, and a poet cannot be forced to write. A baker can't be forced to make a wedding cake.
After those protests, The Family Leader said in a tweet, Shouting protests, namecalling are NOT how Christians are called to engage with our culture.
JOHNSON: His record in office has not quite backed that up according to gay rights advocates. Early on in this administration, the Justice Department revoked guidelines for how schools should treat access to bathrooms and locker rooms for transgender people. In July. The president tweeted would ban transgender people from the military. And his Justice Department also went out of the way to file a brief in another case. That case said the Civil Rights Act, which provides protections against discrimination for people in the workplace, did not cover sexual orientation according to Trump's DOJ.
The main question is do you get to object to that kind of anti-discrimination law because it's forcing you to convey a message? said Ilya Shapiro with the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank that has supported some businesses that have turned customers away.
DICKINSON: Contractors at Los Alamos made the big switch recently from clay-based litter to the organic green kind. And like so many well-intentioned ideas, this one blew up, literally, in a mini mushroom cloud of blame.
With respect to judicial philosophy, I have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so I don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases — because I can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and I have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.
The Jonestown Massacre and the assassinations of Milk and Moscone happened within 10 days of each other. It was like a one-two punch. It just knocked San Francisco completely sideways. I mean, 918 people dead in one day. And then these two very important and beloved civic leaders ten days later. For my mom, it was a seismic shift, a feeling of everything is changing. She describes becoming aware, in an instant, that the wave that they had been riding was about to crash.
FARSAD: Eventually he'll read the entire Constitution, and then we'll really be screwed.
Supporters of the bill tried to push back against the rhetoric, noting that the bill permitted no such thing.
BRENNAN: I'm - I don't think you can sue for microaggressions even in Canada. So...
And my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. I'm not demanding that Republicans vote for Merrick Garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. And at some point, it's got to stop.
Bathrooms have been a regular site of political conflict around gender and sexuality issues, said Amy Stone, an associate professor of sociology and anthropology at Trinity University in Texas who studies political rhetoric.
It doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is, says Cooper. The bottom line is that abstinence is the best and only proven way to keep yourself from getting a sexually transmitted infection or from getting pregnant. And so whether you're straight or trans or bi, the message is the same.

No, he isn't. And so we discussed that, and I wanted to make sure that not only he felt comfortable with it, but his family felt comfortable with it. You know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we're — we call folks like Judge Garland civilians. And so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of.
I think the impact was profound, he said.
BRENNAN: If you're going to do it.
SAGAL: Oh, congratulations. Well, Landon, welcome to our show. Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First up, it's a comedian performing this upcoming week - May 15 to the 21 - at the Brad Garrett Comedy Club at the MGM Las Vegas. It's Alonzo Bodden.
Vander Plaats said that it would not be our intent for candidates to face a hostile audience and that he hopes to model civil conversation, even in areas where we have deep disagreements.
BRENNAN: Yeah. Yeah. I was doing - I didn't - someone came to my show in Chicago and a woman didn't know what the premise of the show was, so she went on my Instagram, my Facebook and my Twitter during the show and was basically like, dude, you got to stop doing this emotional stuff, thinking that I would somehow, like, get a note on stage and be like, you know what? She's right.
KURTIS: Jon Paddock of Portland, Maine.
Murray, 61, is a progressive mayor, and has been serving in that role since 2014. He had previously served in the state legislature for 18 years, where he led a long campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington. As mayor, he pushed through a measure to raise Seattle's minimum wage to $15 an hour.

One of the thorniest cases involves Catholic Charities, whose agencies long have provided adoption and foster care services to children in need, including orphans. Under Catholic doctrine, the sacrament of marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman, and Catholic adoption agencies therefore have declined to place children with same-sex couples.
NEGIN FARSAD: And can you imagine, like, Hillary Clinton having fired James Comey if she was president? People would like, oh, my God, emails, Benghazi, evil lady. She would have had to wear like a scarlet letter C on her pantsuit. There would have been like a burning at the stake. Like, it would've been a whole thing. But with Donnie, we're just like, it's kind of funny, you know?

VOLZ: Not back then, and I'll tell you why - she never got busted. And so she certainly wasn't going to announce herself in the press. And one of the things that's interesting in the Brownie Mary and Mer the Brownie Lady confusion - so they were both part of the same zeitgeist. Well, poor Brownie Mary kept getting busted. And she had a wonderful way of handling the press. She was grandmotherly and funny, very, very witty and adorable. And the press just loved her. They just ate it up. And so she, possibly more than anyone, was responsible for bringing the concept of medical marijuana to broader society. And my mom, meanwhile, stayed underground. She didn't get busted. She didn't go to the press. But she worked throughout all of these years to get edibles to people who needed them.
For most of these teens, the Pride Center is the only place they can ask these questions.

GREENE: When you say it's just growth, it makes me want to ask you if conversations around, you know, same-sex marriage that we've seen in recent years and the Supreme Court decision on that and the conversations around this law, I mean, are - as sensitive and infuriating as some of these conversations can be to some people on both sides, I mean, is there an argument that these conversations are just good for society to have as time evolves?

Then, one stormy night, while sipping a glass of Malbec, as Ling and Chan were enjoying their catnip, Ling jumped up on Jonas and rolled over on her back, paws up. Taking advantage of the situation, Jonas grabbed a Q-tip and some Wet Ones and figured out a way to give Ling a waterless pedicure. He was elated, but felt that something was missing. What his cats needed was a nice color of nail polish to complete the look.
Rubio's poor performance last Saturday hurt him in New Hampshire, where he finished a disappointing fifth. He needs a strong performance tonight to assuage concerns he's too scripted and too inexperienced. But if another candidate has a breakout performance, they could grab the momentum in South Carolina. Trump, for example, is already being attacked over his own personal life, much like Gingrich was, but good parrying of those attacks could give him a lock in a state where he's already leading in polls.
President Obama spoke with NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg on Thursday about why he selected Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, why he thinks the judge deserves a hearing from the Senate and the impact Obama sees for the U.S. judiciary if that doesn't happen. Nina writes about the conversation here; a full transcript is below.

And she would hang duffel bags of brownies from the back bars of the stroller because they were very heavy.
High-schoolers Siona Wilson and Everett Mabry met here, and they affectionately call each other besties. Wilson (whose pronouns are they/them) is a high school freshman with a shock of pink hair, who says sexuality-wise, they're questioning, and gender-wise, they're nonbinary. Mabry's a sophomore with a big smile, who is gay and cisgender. They both say that the sex ed they have gotten at the center has made them realize they used to be clueless about some of the most basic things.

Vander Plaats is a controversial figure, who has been regarded as a kingmaker among white evangelicals in Iowa, where the conservative Christian vote is a vital voting bloc for Republicans. During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Vander Plaats sparked criticism — including from within the Republican Party — for asking candidates for the GOP nomination to sign a marriage vow promising fidelity to one's spouse, rejection of Sharia Islam and support for robust childbearing and reproduction, among other things.

And let's turn to that confrontation between the Department of Justice and the state of North Carolina. Each filed lawsuits against the other yesterday over a law known as House Bill Two. That state law says government buildings plus public schools and universities must restrict bathrooms and locker rooms according to one's sex on a birth certificate. Yesterday, North Carolina's Republican Gov. Patrick McCrory announced his lawsuit, saying the Justice Department lacks the authority to intervene.
VOLZ: My mom came up with this really innovative business plan where she sold exclusively to people on the job. So she would go around to boutiques and restaurants and real estate offices and even medical offices and only sell to the people who were working.

The invitees to the Family Leadership Summit, scheduled for July 12 near Des Moines, are California Sen. Kamala Harris; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; former Vice President Joe Biden; Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. NPR reached out for comment to all seven campaigns, but most declined to respond on the record.
But — but how do you keep it up there? When the Supreme Court, frankly — I've written more pieces in my life saying, This year it may be an issue, and then it never really is.
I'm assuming you can just splice the question and I'll just answer it, so Nina doesn't have to answer — ask it again.

Though no one from CAST agreed to be interviewed, one family who sympathizes with the group's views did agree to share its perspective.

The VanderHelms still care a lot about what the district is teaching.
You know, the relationship between your parents, as described in the book, is just fascinating. These are two really interesting people, and this is a very intimate portrait of them - their courtship, their marriage - involving events that were, in many cases, before you were born. And I know you did lots of interviews. I'm wondering what it was like to kind of get in your parents' heads, your parents-in-their-20s' heads, and kind of - almost, like, kind of reconstructing a 360-degree view of your early life a little at a time.

Transcript And Video: President Obama's Interview With NPR's Nina Totenberg
Writing for The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb parsed Trump's initial response further:
TRUMP: It's irrelevant because it was already settled. It's law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it's done.
I might have called him right after dinner.
In a statement, the White House called Yates, an Obama administration holdover with 27 years of experience prosecuting corrupt public officials and the man who bombed the Atlanta Olympic park, weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.
VOLZ: No. My parents, I think, like a lot of hippies, a lot of people from their generation, saw marijuana as wholesome and harmless. And I was taught that the legislation around it and the government's view of it was wrong and that what they were doing was right. So I grew up with that idea that we were outlaws, but good outlaws - kind of like Robin Hood outlaws. And I didn't question that for a long time.
But the objections Yates raised in her letter pointed out that the OLC review didn't consider statements made by an administration or its surrogates...that may bear on the order's purpose.
The Trump administration immediately named Dana Boente, the top federal prosecutor in suburban Virginia, the interim attorney general. Boente, a veteran government lawyer with decades of experience, will serve until Trump's nominee, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, is confirmed by the Senate.

President Trump is said to be considering an executive order to bar the federal government from punishing people or institutions that support marriage exclusively as the union of one man and one woman. The language is similar to a bill expected to be reintroduced by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah called the First Amendment Defense Act.
Democratic candidates oftentimes talk about Jefferson, and Madison, and founding ideals – but we need candidates that can talk about Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Hale said, referring to the first four books of the Christian New Testament. A Democrat's not going to win a majority of the evangelical vote, but you can't win 10 or 15% and expect to win this election.
KURTIS: She interviewed comedian Neal Brennan, whose new special, 3 Mics, had just come out on Netflix.

The debate's heart: What exercising one's religion means
The fight began last spring, when some parents agitated to update the district's current sex ed program with something that they hoped would be more science-based and inclusive of LGBTQ+ people. (LGBTQ+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer, with the + denoting a broader inclusion of sexual and gender minorities.)

Iowa was tailored for a Christian-conservative candidate, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and New Hampshire gave a jolt to centrist, establishment figures like Kasich, the Ohio governor, and it solidified Trump's dominance across the board. In South Carolina, all of those elements combine.
-- The Upstate: The most socially conservative, religious voters are clustered in the Upstate, anchored by Greenville and Spartanburg and home to fundamentalist Bob Jones University. On Friday, most GOP candidates were at the famed college for a Faith and Family Presidential Forum, talking up their socially conservative values on abortion and same-sex marriage. Only Trump, who's come under fire for his obscenities and previous support of same-sex marriage, didn't attend.
KLEIN: A, he started a software company called Mike Rowe Soft?
BEYONCE: (Rapping) Beysus. Watch the thrones.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, HEARD ABOUT US)
And so I — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just Democrats, but a sizable number of Republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government. And what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the Constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.
DAVIES: The business was still going when you were a toddler and, I guess, into kindergarten, right?
BRENNAN: Well, by the way, this is - we already won the game. So this is just - we're - now we're just having fun, right?
BEYONCE: (Rapping) We keeping it real with these people, right? Lucky I ain't kill you when I met that...
BRENNAN: So - but it's - but how he died is hilarious.
VOLZ: Yes. Well, in some form or another, it continued until I was an adult. But this original iteration carried on until about second or third grade.
Earlier in the week, the mayor's spokesman said the suit was politically motivated. It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline, Jeff Reading said in a statement reported by The Associated Press.
When The Conversation Doesn't Include You: LGBTQ+ Sex Ed In A Small Town
I don't know a pathway forward for a Democratic candidate to win back the states we lost in 2016 without winning a higher percentage of the evangelical vote, Hale said.
KLEIN: Or C, he actually invented the Hitler mustache, earning him the name Third Reich Mike?
SAGAL: Leaky nuclear waste caused by the wrong kitty litter. Your next story of extreme cattiness comes from Rosie Perez.
His campaign believes the more non-white voters hear his message, the more they'll be open to voting for him. There's at least some evidence that Sanders is benefiting from a generational divide even among non-white voters, NPR's Sam Sanders reports. There hasn't been any South Carolina polling on the Democratic side yet after Iowa and New Hampshire, though.
And inside the White House, Trump tweeted about Democratic obstruction of his nominees, Now have an Obama AG. Less than two hours later, Yates was out of a job, notified of the White House decision via a typed letter from an assistant to the president.
Should we start that one over? [Laughter]
Ginsburg and Breyer are among the court's liberals. The third, Justice Kennedy, is a generally conservative justice. But he's the author of the court's same-sex marriage decision. And he's been the deciding vote in upholding the right to abortion. So if any of those three goes, you will see dramatically more conservative rulings on these and other issues for a generation to come, at least.
For decades, the United Methodist Church has officially judged homosexual activity to be immoral, barred gays and lesbians from serving as clergy, and opposed same sex marriage.
Before North Carolina, There Were Other Contentious 'Bathroom Bill' Fights
DAVIES: You moved out of San Francisco. And there's an eight-year stretch of your childhood. And you described them as pretty tough. You know, your parents' relationship fell apart, in part, because, you know, your dad would not take the medicine for his epilepsy and had some pretty strange experiences. Your mom ends up reviving the business kind of with once-a-month trips into San Francisco from where they were living outside of town.
Butler's legislation quickly became dubbed the bathroom bill by socially conservative opponents such as Ann Marie Banfield, who characterized the backlash in terms of privacy.
SAGAL: Yes. He was in an event in Los Angeles. He was speaking to the agents. And there was a TV on, and it said, you know, Comey fired. And apparently Comey thought it was a prank. You know, one of those jolly little jokes where you sneak up behind somebody with an inflated balloon and then subvert the rule of law.
VanderPlaats also has been, at times, a critic of Trump's character and rhetoric — though he has largely supported Trump's policies on issues like restricting abortion.
Seattle Mayor Ed Murray is being sued by a man who claims Murray raped and molested him three decades ago, when the man was 15 years old.
So the scene down at Fisherman's Wharf was one of the spectacular emergences. There were, actually, at the time, thousands of artists and crafts people who sold to tourists on the street all kinds of things they made themselves. And there was a busking scene of people like Robin Williams and Penn and Teller and magicians and tap dancers and musicians and whole dance troupes - this really elaborate scene that was called the New Vaudeville.
KLEIN: And I will say when I read that the first time I was, like, oh, that doesn't seem funny to me. And they were like, no, that really happened. They tried to run him over. So here is your last question, Neal, about a Mike. Famous candy brand Mike and Ike caused a religious outcry when they did what? A, briefly ran an ad campaign where a nun prayed to a rosary made out of Mike and Ikes; B, implied that Mike and Ike were a gay couple; or C, were used in a public school sex ed class to illustrate conception?
SIEGEL: Marriage equality was taken up a lot more recently than abortion. Is there any typical bias in favor of recent rulings, as opposed to old ones?
Code Switch alum Matt Thompson, now executive editor at The Atlantic, riffed on the brazenness of the white supremacists who marched this weekend, compared with Klan members of decades past who hid under white hoods. The shameless return of white supremacy into America's public spaces seems to be happening by degrees, and quickly, Thompson wrote.
I'm not — I'm supposed to be a pro.
The evangelicals and institutional moderates voted to reaffirm the church's teachings, and then the institutional moderates moved to the more liberal side, Tooley says. But then they were replaced by the rising global church, especially in Africa.
So we've reported that Republican — leading Republican senators sent a message sort of back-channel: OK, if you appoint Merrick Garland, we — we still will oppose him now, but we would confirm him in the lame-duck session after the election if there's a Democratic president. Did that play any role in your decision?
At the Grand Rapids Pride Center, a rowdy group of about 40 teens gathers every week, and they talk about sex, gender and relationships. They have a rotating cast of adults called facilitators, who lead discussions and pull questions out of a hot pink box.
DAVIES: And do you remember ever finding that hard, you know, as you got a little older and had friends?
