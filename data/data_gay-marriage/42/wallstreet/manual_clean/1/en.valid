along with anti-animal cruelty, there are a myriad of other ways people can invest with their core values. religion-based investing has grown in popularity, and a new exchange-traded fund (etf) recently joined the market, and is based on the bible — it excludes companies that support abortion or support same-sex marriage. environment, social and governance (known as esg) investing looks at climate change, equal pay and executive compensation. there are also islamic-inspired funds that exclude anything to do with alcohol, tobacco and gambling, said david kathman, a mutual fund analyst at chicago-based investment research and management firm morningstar.
another new company hopes to find a place amid investors' ever-changing values. motif, an online brokerage platform for investing in specific themes, such as biotech and health, introduced motif impact portfolios in march, where people invest in their beliefs and customize the list of funds put in those thematic buckets. investors may be particularly passionate about a subject, such as climate change or corporate governance, but if there are funds for companies investors don't believe are aligned, they can change those allocations. we are constantly voting with our consumer dollars, but not with our investing dollars, said hardeep walia, chief executive officer of motif.
georgia republican gov. brian kemp over the weekend reportedly mocked c-list celebrities vowing to boycott over the state's heartbeat abortion law. the republican party is the party of freedom and opportunity, he said. we value and protect innocent life — even though that makes c-list celebrities squawk.
he says he believes the best way for americans to defend the constitution would be to boycott the offending states.

that's nba hall-of-famer kareem abdul-jabbar adding his voice to those across the country opposing recent bills to ban abortions.

value-led investing is a growing, long-term trend, according to casey clark, director of sustainable and impact investing at philadelphia-based wealth management firm glenmede trust, though it is more so for young investors than older generations. etfs have been popping up to support other beliefs — there's one that focuses on lgbt-friendly companies and another etf that believes companies with female leadership will see better performance than those without. according to msci research, companies with strong female leadership generated a return on equity of 10.1% a year, compared with 7.4% returns for those without.
abdul-jabbar isn't the first celebrity to speak out on the issue. sean penn, alec baldwin, mia farrow, don cheadle, jason bateman and ben stiller are just some of the high-profile names that have signed a boycott petition.
a boycott is a clear statement that we value conscience over commerce. it means stop doing business with or in these states, abdul-jabbar wrote. for hollywood, stop making films there. for businesses, stop buying their products or holding conventions or building there. for the average person, don't visit. no tourism dollars. the boycott, he urged, must continue until legislators reverse the policies or are removed from office.
in a column for the hollywood reporter, abdul-jabbar says the u.s. is getting sucked back to a time when pretty much everyone who wasn't a straight, white christian male was considered a second-class citizen whose rights and future depended on the patriarchs' whims and largesse.
investing isn't all about the nuances of stocks and bonds and the twists and turns of the market — sometimes, it involves matters of the heart. on monday, ubs announced it had raised $325 million for the rise fund, which was co-founded by bono and hopes to combine financial returns and support a range of social and environmental causes. the fund's total size is $2 billion and is managed by bill mcglashan, founder and managing partner of tpg growth, reuters reports. its investments include everfi, a provider of subscription-based digital learning to k-12 schools, universities, corporations, sports teams and ngos, and dodla, an indian dairy business.
values-based investing is growing in popularity, where investment strategies are tied to investors' core beliefs. this can be broken down in a variety of ways: sustainable, responsible and impact investing (sri) excludes companies from an investment portfolio that do not align with core values, such as the environment or corporate governance practices. impacting investing is similar, but tracks the progress of these goals. more than half of millennials (51%) find impact investing appealing, and 54% believe investments' effects on society are important, according to a recent survey by kansas city, mo.-based investment management firm american century investments.

the new offering is intended to provide investors with more transparency on their holdings — 73% of investors don't know if their investments are aligned with their personal beliefs, a motif survey found. (and 40% of americans don't know what's in their retirement accounts at all). motif charges $9.95 a month with a minimum investment of $1,000 (there are no fees for security transactions). the environment, for instance, is important to some investors concerned about climate change. sustainable investing funds rose 33% from 2014 to 2016, according to the forum for sustainable and responsible investment, thanks mostly to millennials: 70% say they prefer this type of investing.

there are many misconceptions about investing based on your values, namely that you won't see much of a return. but that's largely a myth, experts say. it is not as much a choice of do good or do well, said greg vigrass, president and chief executive of folio institutional, which builds robo-adviser technology for financial advisers. it is very possible these days to invest along the lines of your beliefs and value system and not give up anything in investment returns. folio allows investors to invest in their beliefs by, for example, excluding securities of companies that participate in factory farming or alcohol. performance depends on funds, though some asset managers believe these types of funds do better than the s&p 500 and others do not.
