It is very possible these days to invest along the lines of your beliefs and value system and not give up anything in investment returns. Folio allows investors to invest in their beliefs by, for example, excluding securities of companies that participate in factory farming or alcohol. Performance depends on funds, though some asset managers believe these types of funds do better than the S&P 500 and others do not."}
