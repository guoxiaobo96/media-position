2021 is starting off with a big-time celebrity shake-up: kim kardashian west and kanye west are getting divorced.\n\nindeed, according to page six, the a-list couple have finally called it quits after six years, four children, and who knows how many disagreements about where to spend their time, energy, and celebrity capital.\n\naccording to reports, kardashian west is intent on continuing to work on her prison reform project, while west's political ambitions (including a fanciful bid for the oval office) have kept him rather busy, too. another source says west has become increasingly frustrated with the kardashian family's reality tv star lifestyle. alas, there also seems to be the issue of west's mental state, which can test the strongest of unions.\n\nbut what inquiring minds really want to know is this: how will their massive real estate holdings be divided?\n\njennifer lenz, a real estate agent at dolly lenz real estate in new york city, has been privy to many high-profile splits and shares that divorce settlement details typically hinge on the prenups and other contractual obligations that were in place before the marriage.\n\nhowever, most prenup terms well exceed the final settlement in order to get a signoff on the divorce, and the properties are divvied up to avoid the appearance of a fire sale, she says.\n\nfor example, one billionaire couple that lenz's firm worked with had a $10 million prenup, but the ex-wife was able to get a $60 million settlement to secure her signature — which included two homes and seed money to start her new business venture.\n\nin the case with kardashian west and west, however, money like this is probably no big object. kardashian west is the richest of her famous family, and the couple's combined wealth exceeds $3 billion, which means dividing the properties they share might take on more meaning.\n\nbut california divorces sometimes turn out to be quite equitable as all assets acquired during the marriage are to be divided 50/50. in community property states, like california, division of homes purchased while together belong to both parties and are divided equally as well, says bruce ailion, a real estate agent in the atlanta metro area.\n\nso, looking at kardashian west and west's biggest real estate assets, here's how we think the properties will be divided.\n\nhidden hills estate: kardashian west\n\nthe hidden hills, ca, home of kim kardashian west and kanye west google maps\n\nfirst up, the couple's mansion in the star-studded community of hidden hills in los angeles, which was purchased for $20 million in 2014. kardashian west reportedly wants to own it outright since this is the one place their children are settled into and call home. it's also near her mother kris jenner's home and her sister kourtney kardashian's place.\n\ncourts want to minimize the impact of divorce on the couple's children, so often this means the custodial spouse will retain use of the marital residence, says ailion.\n\nbefore (left) and after shots of a hallway in the hidden hills, ca realtor.com/kanye west\n\nthe sticking point? it seems that kardashian west owns the land in and around the house, but the actual structure belongs to her soon-to-be ex. complicated!\n\nthe couple also reportedly poured a ton of cash (upward of $20 million) into an extensive renovation over the years. west engaged the exclusive belgian designer axel vervoordt to handle the rehab and installed a completely white, monastic-style aesthetic throughout the home. should kardashian west take it over, it's possible she might rip out some of the cold marble and make it a bit homier.\n\nsince west oversaw the redesign and owns the home, a sensible compromise would be for him to keep it and for her to build on the surrounding land for herself and stay in the home via some type of rent-back until the project is done, says cedric stewart, a real estate agent with keller williams capital properties in washington, dc.\n\nwyoming ranch: west\n\nkimye's ranch sits on 9,000 acres near cody, wy. realtor.com\n\nsomehow we just don't see kardashian west feeling at home in a very remote part of wyoming — so monster lake ranch, purchased in fall 2019, seems to have west's name written all over it.\n\nthe wyoming property will go to kanye as this is where he plans to build his technology, design, and innovation epicenter, says stewart.\n\nthe spot, which features two houses, eight cabins, plus several barns and corrals for horses, will require a herculean effort to transform it into a livable space for a celebrity of west's level. not only is the wyoming ranch pretty much in the middle of nowhere, but transporting contractors and all the materials needed to build in a barren part of the country is a giant headache.\n\nwest's plans for this compound apparently include a 10-bedroom, 52,000 square-foot mansion and two 10,000-square-foot underground garages, which will likely run him into the $50 million range, according to real estate experts.\n\nthe upside for west: the spot is extremely quiet and private (no paparazzi for miles).\n\nthe house next door to hidden hills: kardashian west\n\nthe couple purchased this ranch home in 2019. realtor.com\n\nthis fixer-upper ranch home isn't exactly posh, but it's directly next door to the couple's hidden hills compound, bringing their total property ownership in this area to 8 acres. they bought it in 2019 for $3 million and apparently had plans to create a guest compound here and live off the land, growing organic vegetables and fruit.\n\nthis property sports four bedrooms, a pool, and gardens, plus a horse barn and corral. since this one is also close to some kardashian family members, we bet it'll slide her way.\n\n2 acres in la quinta, ca: west\n\nlast up, an undeveloped 2-acre parcel with a whopping price tag of $6.3 million. the plot was quietly purchased through a trust at the end of 2019.\n\nlocated two hours from los angeles in la quinta's madison club (a golf and tennis community), this area is a playground for the ultrarich and famous. it's also close to the location of the coachella music festival where west performed in 2019, so we're moving this property to his portfolio.\n\nhowever, both kris jenner and kardashian's little sister kylie jenner have homes nearby, so this particular real estate holding might cause a tussle in the end.
it's been said that behind every great man is a great woman. in prince harry's case, it's three wealthy and media-savvy women.\n\non saturday, buckingham palace announced a deal had been reached for harry and meghan markle to relinquish their official duties as members of the british royal family. they have agreed not to use his/her royal highness, and will repay the state the costs of renovating their u.k. base, frogmore cottage. but they're now free to pursue their own business opportunities overseas.\n\nin a statement, queen elizabeth said she was proud of how quickly meghan had become one of the family, adding: following many months of conversations and more recent discussions, i am pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family. harry, meghan and archie will always be much loved members of my family.\n\n netflix would give the sussexes a platform of 158 million paid subscribers and be a coup for the streaming service. \n\nlast week, the couple announced they work to become financially independent and live between u.k. and north america. free from the ribbon-cutting duties of royal life, the duke and duchess of sussex are on the brink of becoming a global-media power couple, with or without their royal titles. their instagram fb, +2.02% account has 10.9 million followers, adding 700,000 in one week.\n\npearson said that the couple — stripped of their ability to use hrh on their website and products — will do their best to leverage their fame and royal connections in the u.s. to build a personal brand much like gwyneth paltrow's goop, and as markle previously did with tig. (forbes recently named reality tv star kylie jenner, 22, the youngest self-made billionaire ever.)\n\nharry receives an income from his father prince charles. harry, who is already worth several million dollars, owes his fortune to three famous women: his mother, the late princess diana, who became a global superstar; his grandmother, queen elizabeth ii, who steered the royals into the 20th and 21s centuries, and his wife, meghan markle, an american-born self-made former actress.\n\nalso see: queen elizabeth's statement on harry and meghan: 'we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family'\n\nmultiple newspapers, including the daily telegraph in the u.k., have reported that the queen was disappointed with the surprise announcement, and had asked the sussexes to hold off on issuing a statement. when the sun newspaper published a front-page story that the couple was contemplating a move to canada, the sussexes pushed the button on their statement.\n\nquestions now linger over whether they will qualify for armed security if they live in canada, a member of the british commonwealth, or the u.s. markle previously lived in toronto, where she still has a home, and los angeles. their hrh titles would certainly have burnished their personal brands and commercial appeal, but they will remain the duke and duchess of sussex.\n\nnetflix says it's open to talks with the sussexes\n\nted sarandos, netflix's chief content officer, said he would be interested in speaking to the sussexes about working together. speaking at an event in los angeles over the weekend, he told the press association: who wouldn't be interested? yes, sure. harry and meghan will no longer be working members of the royal family after april, and will split their time between the u.k. and north america.\n\nharry is friends with former u.s. president barack obama, and will consider adopting the obamas' post-white house career model, some royal observers say. barack and michelle obama reportedly signed an eight-figure deal with netflix nflx, +0.73% to produce high-brow historical, biographical and social-justice programming with their company, higher ground productions.\n\n 'one of the reasons they broke off from the royals is, in part, because they want to build their own brand.'  — —ashley pearson, an american-born writer based in london\n\nnetflix would give the sussexes a platform of 158 million paid subscribers and be a coup for the streaming service, which won critical praise for, the crown, chronicling the life of queen elizabeth. (netflix did not respond to request for comment.) harry has already participated in a documentary on mental health with oprah winfrey, a friend of the couple, for apple tv aapl, +1.27% .\n\nthe media mogul responded to reports that she had helped the sussexes navigate and negotiate their #megxit — as the royal scandal has been described in the u.k. press, a riff on #brexit, the u.k.'s protracted exit from the european union. meg and harry do not need my help figuring out what is best for them, oprah said in a statement, according to the new york post.\n\nashley pearson, an american-born writer based in london who has been a royal commentator for two decades, said their powerful political and media connections will serve them well. she sees them leveraging their circle of boldfaced names: their kind of lifestyle costs a fortune. however, one of the reasons they broke off from the royals is, in part, because they want to build their own brand.\n\n 'you know she does voiceovers? you seem surprised. but, yeah, she's really interested.'  — —prince harry speaking to disney ceo bob iger at the opening of 'the lion king' in london in july 2019.\n\npearson believes markle is the driving force to break free from the house of windsor, suggesting that — despite the privileges of royal life — the negative press coverage was too much to bear. she had no idea how un-glamorous it really is to be a royal and, when she found out she would be a civil servant in a tiara she was, like, 'no way.' the couple's website is similar in tone to obama.org.\n\nthe sussexes have already cut their teeth in broadcast media. in 2017, harry interviewed barack obama when he was the guest editor of bbc radio 4's today program and, last year, itv in the u.k. broadcast harry & meghan: an african journey, which aired in the u.s. on abc dis, -1.28% another route: the obamas reportedly inked a book deal for more than $65 million.\n\nin a recently resurfaced video, as meghan greeted beyonce and jay z in a line at the opening of the movie the lion king in london last july, prince harry told disney chairman and chief executive bob iger, you know she does voiceovers? iger responded, oh, really? ah, i did not know that, and laughed. harry responded, you seem surprised. but, yeah, she's really interested.\n\nnetflix is broadly unchanged at $339.7 over the last 12 months. however, disney rose by 30% to $144.5 and apple is up 103% at $318.5 over the same period, both outperforming the overall market. the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% is up 18.8% at 29,348.10 over the last 12 months, while the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% increased 24.7% at 3,329.62.\n\nmeghan markle was already a self-made millionaire\n\nwhile the couple's break for the border releases them from the drab ribbon-cutting, handshaking daily duties of royal life in the u.k., and should better shield themselves from the jaundiced coverage they have received at the hands of the british tabloids, their bid for financial independence is somewhat more complicated and will not require them to take up full-time jobs.\n\nfor a start, they will keep their u.k. base, frogmore cottage, their historic grade ii-listed house in windsor, which was renovated for 2.4 british pounds ($3 million) by the british taxpayer. they have already built a strong royal/celebrity personal brand, breaking the traditional mold of the royal family. their 2018 wedding was an unusual mixture of hollywood and english aristocracy.\n\n 'harry & meghan: an african journey' aired in the u.s. on abc and was sold to several networks around the world. \n\nharry, 35, on the other hand, inherited a sizable fortune after the death of his mother. he inherited approximately 7 million british pounds ($9.2 million) from his mother's estate, the bbc estimated. his father's side of the family is far richer — worth more than $88 billion, according to forbes — including investments, properties, castles and land.\n\nharry, 35, on the other hand, inherited a sizable fortune after the death of his mother. he inherited approximately 7 million british pounds ($9.2 million) from his mother's estate, the bbc estimated. his father's side of the family is far richer — worth more than $88 billion, according to forbes — including investments, properties, castles and land.\n\nto be fair, harry also reportedly earned an annual salary of $45,000 when he served as an officer in the army air corps and approximately $52,000 a year while working as a helicopter pilot for the army air corps, according to separate estimates by forbes and fortune magazines based on publicly available figures for salaries in the u.k. army.\n\nharry also has had a military career on the front lines. prince harry served in the army for ten years, rising to the rank of captain and undertaking two tours of afghanistan, according to buckingham palace. he continues to work in support of his fellow servicemen, promoting support for wounded men and women as they adapt to life post-injury.\n\nalso see: this entrepreneur landed funding from a male venture capitalist — but she told him to take a hike after he texted her nude selfies\n\nthe sussexes rely on prince charles — first in line to the british throne — for approximately 95% of their income. prince charles earns $23 million a year from the duchy of cornwall, a private estate with more than $1.3 billion in assets. the duchy's financial accounts reveal a total income for fiscal 2017 of 37.2 million british pounds ($48.7 million), up 2.5% on the previous year.\n\nchoosing toronto or vancouver as their overseas residence may make more financial sense than, say, l.a. or new york. in canada, they are close enough to the u.s. without becoming embroiled in complex web of american tax law. canada, for instance, does not impose a capital gains tax for homes that increase in value.\n\nmarkle lived there while filming suits, and the couple spent the holidays in canada, reportedly at a waterfront mansion on vancouver island. as canada is part of the u.k. commonwealth, it may be required to pay for security for the couple and their son, archie. (of possible interest for other couples moving there: canadian divorce law generally splits all new marital wealth equally.)\n\nthey will hope to take control of their public brand\n\nharry's late mother, princess diana — who died at 36 in a car crash in paris in 1997 while being pursued by photographers — had long battled the relentless, prying eyes of the british red tops, which dissected her every move in the years following her 1981 marriage to prince charles, and 1996 divorce. she had reportedly long dreamed of starting a new life in the u.s.\n\nin a widely circulated article, ellie hall, a buzzfeed reporter, compared kate's morning sickness cure? prince william gifted with an avocado for pregnant duchess with meghan markle's beloved avocado linked to human rights abuse and drought, millennial shame, in the express. the contrasting headlines appeared in the same papers and, sometimes, with the same bylines.\n\n princess diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, had reportedly long said she dreamed of starting anew overseas. \n\ntwo more appearing in the daily mail went thus, hall reported. kate and wills inc: duke and duchess secretly set up companies to protect their brand — just like the beckhams and, a right royal cash in! how prince harry and meghan markle trademarked over 100 items from hoodies to socks six months before split with monarchy — with new empire worth up to £400m.\n\nmarkle flew back to canada earlier this month amid reports she was driven out by, among other things, press coverage regarded as both overtly and covertly racist. highlighting 20 headlines, buzzfeed pointed to the different standards used to report on kate middleton — wife of prince william, second in line to the british throne — and markle, from child-rearing to eating avocado.\n\nmarkle acknowledged that she had a difficult time adapting to life with the often critical media attention in the u.k. i've really tried to adopt this british sensibility of a stiff upper lip. i've tried, i've really tried, i think that what that does internally is probably really damaging, she said. the biggest thing that i know is that i never thought this would be easy, but i thought it would be fair.\n\nthe queen acknowledged the difficulties in her statement saturday: i recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life, her statement read, adding, it is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.\n\nthere appears to push back from harry's circle to the avalanche of press in the u.k. criticizing the couple's decision. writing in the sunday times, tom bradby, a friend of harry's who directed a documentary about the couple in africa last year, said buckingham palace claimed to be blindsided by the couple's announcement, but bradby threw doubt on the palace line.\n\nbradby wrote that harry was asked by senior members of the royal family to write a plan to move away. he was reluctant, on the grounds that such documents normally leak, bradby wrote in a 1,600-word essay, escape from the poisonous palace. he was persuaded and did as he was asked. (buckingham palace did not respond to a request for comment from marketwatch.)\n\nthe document, or its details, was shortly afterwards leaked to the sun, bradby added. he said the sussexes had long faced unpleasantness from the family, saying some members were jealous and, at times, unfriendly, although excluded queen elizabeth and her husband, the duke of edinburgh from that assessment. the fallout began at the time of the wedding in 2018.\n\nspeaking to bradby for his documentary last year, she thanked him for asking how she was, and said not many people had asked if she were ok. in his essay sunday, bradby wrote that some members of the family (with the exception of the queen and the duke of edinburgh) were jealous and, at times, unfriendly: really damaging things were said and done. the atmosphere soured hard and early.\n\n(this story was originally published on jan. 8 and was updated on jan. 19.)
 'by emboldening the right wing through vitriolic rhetoric, the donald trump administration has become the uv light in sleazy motel rooms that illuminates these hidden stains on our democracy.' \n\nthat's nba hall-of-famer kareem abdul-jabbar adding his voice to those across the country opposing recent bills to ban abortions.\n\nand by stains, abdul-jabbar is referring to alabama, missouri, georgia and any other states passing restrictive abortion legislation.\n\nin a column for the hollywood reporter, abdul-jabbar says the u.s. is getting sucked back to a time when pretty much everyone who wasn't a straight, white christian male was considered a second-class citizen whose rights and future depended on the patriarchs' whims and largesse.\n\nhe says he believes the best way for americans to defend the constitution would be to boycott the offending states.\n\nread:alabama public television refuses to air cartoon gay marriage\n\na boycott is a clear statement that we value conscience over commerce. it means stop doing business with or in these states, abdul-jabbar wrote. for hollywood, stop making films there. for businesses, stop buying their products or holding conventions or building there. for the average person, don't visit. no tourism dollars. the boycott, he urged, must continue until legislators reverse the policies or are removed from office.\n\nabdul-jabbar isn't the first celebrity to speak out on the issue. sean penn, alec baldwin, mia farrow, don cheadle, jason bateman and ben stiller are just some of the high-profile names that have signed a boycott petition.\n\ngeorgia republican gov. brian kemp over the weekend reportedly mocked c-list celebrities vowing to boycott over the state's heartbeat abortion law. the republican party is the party of freedom and opportunity, he said. we value and protect innocent life — even though that makes c-list celebrities squawk.
there's something extra special about the holiday season when you're a parent, watching your kids excitedly open presents and enjoy quality time with extended family. but, of course, that's just half the story. on the other side of that coin is the financial stress of having to buy those gifts and coordinate travel to meet that extended family.\n\nand, honestly, the holidays are the least of your financial worries with kids. the latest estimates put the average cost of raising one child at $233,610. and an estimated one-third of american families devote at least 20% of their annual income to child care. these stats can feel pretty daunting for those of us already grappling with other major financial commitments.\n\nit's safe to say that millennials are juggling more financial priorities and hurdles than prior generations, says certified financial planner natalie colley of francis financial. these hurdles include paying off student loans and credit card debt to struggling to accumulate enough savings to one day buy a home.\n\nread: are kids a good investment? will they make you happier?\n\nindeed, in a july new york times survey, about a quarter of millennials said they'll have fewer children than they'd hoped because of the high costs associated with parenthood.\n\nas a millennial with a mortgage, student debt and a fluctuating income, i can relate to that stress—but it didn't stop me from starting a family nearly three years ago. while it may not make financial sense, my husband and i make it work. because, like anything worth having, some sacrifices are necessary in the pursuit of bigger dreams.\n\nwe've only just begun our journey of balancing parenthood and financial goals, but it's been a real crash course, especially now that we have two kids under the age of 3. here are some lessons we've learned so far.\n\nthere's no perfect time to have a baby\n\ni got married at 20, so there was no urgency to rush into parenthood. instead, we spent the first years of marriage finishing college, enjoying (a little) disposable income and buying a house. but did we manage to check everything off our financial to-do list before having our first kid? not even close.\n\nalso see: how overparenting in america has created a generation of snowflakes\n\nwe still have student loan payments topping $800 a month. we're paying them down as aggressively as possible, but we'd certainly be making faster progress without kids in the mix. plus, my work as a freelance writer means i don't have a steady paycheck or benefits like maternity leave.\n\nwe weren't blind to these downsides, but life decisions can't always be based on what looks best on paper. starting a family in our mid-20s was aligned with our long-term goals, like traveling later in life and enjoying more years with our kids. if that required finding a way to budget and saving for the future on a tighter budget, we were up for it.\n\nfor us, that looked like putting a focus on building our emergency fund as much as possible from the moment i got that positive pregnancy test. from that point on, we knew to expect the unexpected—and wanted to give ourselves as much of a cushion as possible, even if it meant scaling back on our other loan payments in the short-term.\n\nfamily money decisions aren't always black and white\n\ndespite our best intentions, we had a lot to learn, especially when it came to weighing our day-to-day expenses against long-term goals. for example, we initially decided not to pay for regular child care because my unpredictable earnings weren't guaranteed to cover the expense with anything leftover to save. it didn't feel worth it.\n\nbut by my child's first birthday, my kid's schedule didn't leave enough time for me to get work done, and i was actually leaving money on the table. faced with the decision to invest in child care or take a step back from work, i did some (overdue) research: was it enough to only consider today's earnings, or was i missing something by not factoring in potential earnings and long-term professional goals?\n\nthe answer was clear. continuing to grow my business would yield more money over time and allow us to save more—and it made me happy. this was a lightbulb moment that prompted us to get creative about finding affordable child care that was compatible with my career. we ended up organizing an in-home nanny share with another family, which gave the kids a playmate and us moms reliable work hours.\n\nit's ok to say 'no' to some baby purchases\n\nthere's a real temptation to buy all the baby things—especially on birthdays and around the holidays. but as my first kid's closet filled up and our storage space overflowed with toys, i hit the pause button to redefine what was a necessity, what was extra and where our money would have the highest impact.\n\ndressing up a baby in an adorable new outfit is definitely more fun than saving that money. and, as our kids have grown and begun to express interest in pricey activities like gymnastics classes and swim lessons, we've had to explain in their terms that we can't do it all at once.\n\nbut i'm grateful for this perspective, which has helped us pad our long-term savings and travel fund. now, when i'm tempted to make an impulse purchase, i think about spending that money on our coming family trip instead…and then step away from the baby bows.\n\nin the end, you can have anything, but you can't have everything\n\nhere's colley's bottom line about affording to start a family: each couple's unique circumstances, values and priorities will impact how they decide to arrange their lives to accommodate a new family member.\n\nin other words, it's all about trade-offs. it's about saying no to all the vacations we wish we could take and things we wish we could buy in lieu of the opportunity to build our family. but these are trade-offs i'm glad to make for my personal life and for the example it's setting for my children about being grateful for what we have.\n\nand thankfully, the happiest memories of being with your family during the holidays don't cost a cent.
dear moneyist,\n\ni'm an upper middle-aged male and seven years into a happy second marriage to my early-senior-aged wife. my first marriage ended after 30 years and produced four children, all now adults. the divorce went quickly. the equitable distribution was a bitter, expensive two-year process leading to a significant estrangement from two of my children. the other two are kind to me, but only one of that pair is kind to their stepmother (who has been kind to those who would let her).\n\ni will obviously leave retirement savings, work pension, and any additional savings and property to my second wife. she's not in the best of health and wouldn't do well on her current social security award. however, i disinherited my children in my will. at the time i made my will there were significant reasons to disinherit my children by default: three were quite hostile to me, and the fourth had difficulties with managing her mother's manipulations and greedy demands on her.\n\ni'm reconsidering this stance.\n\ndon't miss:did my sister have the right to sell our parents' home and pocket the cash?\n\ni'm feeling some sense of recognizing them in a final estate. this could best occur by designating them as beneficiaries to one of my life insurance policies. it would also be a discreet (and discrete) method that would avoid probate and keep some hostile adult kids from their scorned stepmother.\n\nhowever, i don't want to sneak behind my wife's back to do so. i also don't like the discord in my marriage this would bring. but there's no way i've found to square this circle, apart from just waiting. and i find it ghoulish to mentally calculate on my wife's passing as necessary to bequeath without noise. i also need to admit most of my adult kids continue to be estranged and nasty, despite my reaching out.\n\nthat leads to another question: if i bequeath, do i do so evenly? or proportionally, recognizing those who have tried to maintain a relationship?\n\nperplexed\n\ndear perplexed,\n\ni'm sorry you've fallen out with your children or, at least, they have fallen out with you and i take my hat off to you for wanting to leave them something. that's a good instinct. at some point in their lives, they will remember the good times, even for a moment. this will be a testament to the fact that — despite everything that went down — you are still their father.\n\nin that spirit, follow your gut. include them in some way, and do so equitably. if you pass away after 10 years of marriage, your wife will have rights to a widow's payments from your social security, rather than receive the lower sum from her own. your spouse is entitled to the money in your retirement account unless she signs a waiver, giving up her rights as a beneficiary.\n\nalso see:my husband is either giving $300,000 to a religious cult, being blackmailed — or plotting a divorce\n\nas for those assets that will go through probate, such as a large sum of money in your bank account, i advise you to consult your wife, and proceed with honesty and transparency. as for your wife? even if you decide to do this quietly, it will always prey on your conscience and, if you predeceased her, she would find out after you've gone. that may leave her with many unanswered questions.\n\ninclude her in the conversation and on the amount you decide to leave them. if you don't, that would defeat the purpose of doing this good deed in the first instance. preface any discussion by telling your wife that she need not worry about her own financial security. she may or may not agree, but i'm betting that your transparency and open heart is what drew her to you in the first place.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear quentin,\n\ni am married, but my home is in my name only. when i bought it in 2010, i was the only one eligible to apply for a mortgage because my husband was working a temporary job, having been laid off in the recession.\n\nmy previous home, which i bought when i was single, had substantial equity in it. but i wasn't able to sell it right away, due to needed repairs and no funds to get them done while my husband was working sporadically. i subsequently took a loan out of my retirement fund to pay for the repairs.\n\nwhen the old home sold, the money was used to refinance and pay down the current house's mortgage, again in my name only. i am the one who pays for the home mortgage. (we live in georgia.)\n\n 'i am the one who pays for the home mortgage.' \n\nmy husband is 62 and i am 61. we both have chronic health conditions, though i've had more serious hospitalizations, including a pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, cerebral spinal fluid leak, etc.\n\nmy husband's son is almost 29 and still lives with us. he does not pay rent nor contribute much toward household chores, and is a most aggravating total slob, as well as disrespectful, rude, physically and mentally abusive and menacing to me in particular.\n\nsorry, but that is the truth of the matter. i feel i am held hostage in my own home, which he treats like a garbage dump. because my stepson has mental-health issues, my husband thinks we cannot kick him out of the house until he is able to sustain himself.\n\ni am concerned my husband will outlive me, and while i have no problem with my husband receiving the house if i die first, i am adamantly opposed to my stepson ultimately inheriting my home under any circumstances.\n\nhow can i structure my will to enforce my wishes regarding my home to prevent it from being inherited by my stepson?\n\ntrapped\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear trapped,\n\nlet's talk about the here and now before we talk about what happens after you're gone.\n\nyou are in a house of danger and surrounded by wall of trauma. you need a team to deal with the effects of living with a man who is a bully and a perpetrator of elder abuse, and then you can deal with your and his living situation. once you start to break down the walls of your own fear and abuse with the help of a lawyer, financial planner, doctors and therapist, you will be able to deal with the brick-and-mortar problem of what happens to your home if you predecease your husband.\n\nbut why put all your focus on ensuring that this man does not inherit your home? i agree that you should do everything in your power to make that happen, but you could have another 10 or 20 or more years left, so why suffer because your husband is unable or unwilling to kick him out? you do not have to live with abuse. there is no excuse for abuse. it is time to end your stepson's rent-free rule of terror in your home. you have a right to live safely and happily.\n\n you have a right to live safely and happily.  — — the moneyist\n\ngeorgia is an equitable distribution state. for instance, both spouses generally have some property ownership despite not being named on the deed, according to abbott & abbott, a law firm with offices in marietta and canton, ga. talk to an estate-planning lawyer about whether or not you can leave your husband a life estate (he lives there after you die, but does not own the home), given that you paid off a home you brought into this marriage and used the proceeds to buy a new one.\n\ncontact georgia adult protective services to report abuse, and find an organization that can help you navigate the last years of your life so they are free from harassment and abuse. talk to a lawyer, financial planner, therapist, doctor and even the police if you have to. you didn't sign up for this when you married and the price you paid should not have been a peaceful life. if your husband stands by and allows this to happen, he is helping to facilitate your stepson's abusive behavior.\n\nneither your husband or stepson are unlikely to change. but you can take actions to ensure that you wake up in the morning and go to sleep at night feeling safe in your own home. what happens to your home after you're gone is an important consideration for you. however, given what you have revealed in your letter, it should be way down on your list of priorities. i believe you can do it — and, with the right amount of outside support, i feel confident that you will begin to believe that too.\n\napproximately one in four people aged 65 years old will live beyond 90, and one out of 10 will live past 95, according to the social security administration; more than half of those who reach the age of 65 will require some form of long-term care. you don't want to be in a position where both your health and the health of your husband have declined to such a degree that you are dependent and at the mercy of your stepson. unless you force your stepson to move out, he will never leave.\n\nthe time for action is now.\n\nthe moneyist:when my parents died, my sisters and i split their estate. i chose a painting that may be worth $50,000. should i tell them?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch. by submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
facebook's latest virtual reality (vr) device, called oculus quest, gets good reviews. it offers six degrees of freedom of movement, which pushes the boundaries of user interaction with content. there are no messy wires. apps download straight to the device and wifi connects users for multiplayer games.\n\nbut there's a glaring flaw. comic book superheroes are notably scarce in vr content, which seems odd because comic book fans are super-passionate about their make-believe worlds. that makes comic books one of the original vr formats. as anyone who's been to comic con knows, fans love interacting with their superheroes.\n\nthe oculus content line up isn't the only evidence that superheroes aren't yet at home in vr. panel discussions on comics in the digital age at the new york comic con focus on web-based platforms supporting the traditional panel format, like line webtoon, which feels like the stone age at this point.\n\nexperts cite two reasons why comic book heroes can't yet find a home in the brave new world of vr.\n\n1. game developers need coding skills, and those skills readily carry over into vr, says chris pruett, who works with third-party content developers as the director of ecosystem at oculus. comic book creators, in contrast, are artists and writers, not coders.\n\n2. the big entertainment companies that own the most successful comic book content don't want to give up control of characters and story lines, says jaron lanier, author of dawn of the new everything: encounters with reality and virtual reality.\n\nearly on, vr pioneers like lanier talked with hollywood studios about a potential marriage. the studios loved the idea of putting viewers in a 3d landscape. i said that is not really the spirit of vr. in the spirit of vr you become the character, lanier said. hollywood's response: forget about it because that takes the story away from us.\n\nread: if you like 'game of thrones,' you'll love this stock\n\nsigns of progress\n\nstill, this mindset is slowly evolving — to the delight of comic book fans. progress should continue thanks to oculus and private companies paving new ground. consider the following three trends — which likely will ultimately support revenue growth at entertainment content and platform companies ranging from walt disney co. dis, -1.28% and sony sne, +1.11% , to facebook fb, +2.02% , netflix nflx, +0.73% , amazon.com amzn, +0.33% , apple aapl, +1.27% , and at&t t, +0.20% .\n\n1. marvel entertainment, a division of disney, collaborates with oculus to offer playable characters through a lineup called marvel powers united vr. multiplayer games lets users turn into superheroes to carry out missions, battling marvel villains along the way. superheroes also are leaping into video games. a sony video game called marvel's spider-man is one of the company's most successful titles. it has helped power profits at sony's videogame business, picking up where hardware left off.\n\n2. indie comic book creators should see oculus as a playground. the device ships with a browser that can play third-party content rendered in a 3d vr format, says pruett. browsers aren't built for speed, so the vr quality is not as good as with native apps written to run directly on the oculus device.\n\nbut indie comic book creators also can go the native code route, pruett says. a thriving indie developer community of smallish teams of a half a dozen people or less produce some of the most successful vr games, without financial backing from big studios. the popular beat saber and superhot vr games are examples. small indie teams are the authors of some of the best content we have today, pruett says.\n\nthere's no reason to think this can't happen for comic books, in time. when we take a media from traditional sources into vr we have to reinvent how it works. we understand how video games translate into vr. we don't understand it for comic books yet, says pruett. artists and developers are still feeling their way, but there's probably someone in a garage somewhere right now who is inventing the new model.\n\n3. upstart private companies are developing technology to help comic book artists pave the way and make some money in the process. for example, madefire — which presented at new york comic con last year — offers a basic vr platform for comic book artists to develop ideas, in a format called motion books. madefire ceo and co-founder ben wolstenholme likens the final product to walking through a popup book.\n\nmadefire tools are free, but if creators charge money for content they split it with madefire. the company has tens of thousands of books on its platform, including content from marvel and dc comics, a division of at&t. dave gibbons, an artist who worked on popular watchmen and superman books, explains what madefire does in this short video. .\n\nmadefire collaborates with a private vr headset maker called magic leap, to put content into magic leap's augmented reality (ar) format. ar creates the illusion of 3d images projected into the real world that users can interact with. think holograms. the magic leap one device is similar to microsoft's msft, +1.24% hololens headset.\n\ninvesting angles\n\nunless you are a big investor like alphabet googl, +1.43% , which has pumped money into magic leap, it is difficult to invest in private companies like madefire or magic leap. but they're worth watching, because they might go public some day.\n\nlike oculus, these companies serve as content farms for entertainment giants hungry for content, as their business model shifts towards the over the top subscription revenue streams, said madefire's wolstenholme. comics are a source of new intellectual property (ip), franchises and storytelling material, he added. public companies are interested in comics because they are building subscription services that need new ip.\n\nmarvel, for example, is pulling its content from netflix to put on the disney+ platform. that means netflix will have a big hole to fill. amazon has a similar need on its video platform and apple is a player in the content game. to the extent that oculus and companies like madefire welcome superheroes into the world of vr, they'll play a role filling the content gap at these giants. said wolstenholme: we believe this era is all about new and original ip, and we are built to create that. .\n\nat the time of publication, michael brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. brush has suggested fb, dis, nflx, amzn and t in his stock newsletter

dear moneyist,\n\nmy stepfather recently passed away. he and my mother were each receiving social security, and he had two pensions that were fully paid out during his lifetime. this leaves my mother with about 50% of her original income. she is left with savings and investments with a value of about $150,000.\n\neventually, my mother is set to inherit my grandmother's house, where she currently lives and pays monthly rent of $2,500 to my grandmother, but i am uncertain when that will happen (possibly in about five years or longer, depending on my grandmother's health).\n\nmy mother's only income is equal to her housing expenses, so she will need to rely on her savings to pay her bills of about $1,500 to $2,000 a month. they are high, mainly because she pays for my 23-year-old sister's bills,which amount to $500 to $600 per month.\n\nthe moneyist:my sister became my late father's power of attorney, took out a reverse mortgage on his home, and drained his equity. what can i do?\n\ni've been able to reduce her bills by canceling things she doesn't use, and negotiating for discounts for her cellphone and tv. i've told my mother that my sister should be paying her own bills as she lives rent-free in my mother's home, and just spends her money on whatever she likes.\n\ni thought we were on the same page, but my mother seems reluctant to have this discussion and continues to pay her way. i'm worried that my mother will run through her savings before she gets her inheritance, and then she will be in dire circumstances due to my sister's indulgence.\n\nshould i push for my sister to be a big girl and learn the concept of responsibility, or should i keep my mouth shut?\n\ndisgruntled sister\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\ndear disgruntled,\n\ni join you, your sister and your mother in wishing your grandmother a long and healthy life. and, of course, i wish the same for your mother too. i understand that it must be hard to watch your mother give hundreds of dollars to your sister every month, especially as she only has a finite amount of savings. but this is her decision to make, as long as she is of sound mind and not under undue influence.\n\nyou need an outside voice, preferably a financial adviser, to outline your mother's financial situation and goals as she faces a life without her husband. it would make a nice new year's gift, and you could pitch it as a way of putting your and your mother's minds at ease. the adviser would then form an opinion on your sister's role in your mother's life and finances. your mother would not suspect the adviser of being anything other than objective.\n\nit's unlikely that your sister will, upon hearing your opinion, suddenly start paying her way. she will accept money from your mother as long as your mother gives it to her. it's hard to undo such an arrangement. when someone is used to being given special or preferential treatment, they often believe that this is their due. the more pressure you put on both of them, the more defensive they are likely to become.\n\nyou need a third party to intervene who does not have a horse in this race.\n\nthe moneyist:my wife and i have 3 kids. i also have 3 kids from a previous marriage. how should we split our house among these 6 children?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. by emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch.
dear quentin,\n\ni am a 49-year-old woman with four adult children aged 19 to 29. i bought my home in 1998 as a single mother and my children grew up here. i now have a live-in boyfriend who has done extensive repairs and upgrades to the home over the last 3 years — he performed all the labor himself while i purchased all materials.\n\nwhen he was working, he contributed his fair share to our expenses. however, he works in the oil and gas industry, and was laid off about a year ago and has not worked since then. his employment outlook is uncertain as oil and gas is not rebounding, and he may need to get additional training to change careers.\n\nalthough we are in a committed relationship and intend to remain together as life partners until one of us dies, we are unlikely to ever formally marry as we both had very bad experiences.\n\n 'i am at an absolute loss as to the fair way to address the home in my will.' \n\nhe is 9 years younger than i am, and has three children from his previous marriage who are considerably younger than my children (7 to 12). they will likely spend a good portion of their childhood in this home over the coming years.\n\nother than my home, i have little in the way of assets — a car and some insurance policies — but very little in liquid cash. i am at an absolute loss as to the fair way to address the home in my will. three of my children want the house to go to them, if i should die. the other said i should leave it to my oldest daughter.\n\nmy boyfriend does not want to leave this home should i pass away, but he also says the house should go to my kids since it is their family home. of course, i hope to live long enough that all the kids are grown and settled, in which case i can make a new will.\n\nin the meantime, i need to have a will that makes sense should i expire early.\n\ni am very concerned with treating everyone fairly. the last thing i want when i die is for one of my kids (or my boyfriend) to feel as if i didn't love them because of how i divide things. please help!\n\ngirlfriend, mother & home owner\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear gmho,\n\nyou worked hard for this house. you raised four children as a single mother. you have every right to exhale and reflect on a life well lived, and a job well done. you succeeded where many others may have fallen apart. it's also great that you have a hard-working man in your life, and i hope he finds work in his chosen industry, or another. sit back and take a moment to enjoy all that you have accomplished. your job is done.\n\nand now that i have said that, i feel compelled to tell you what is not your responsibility. you met a man nine years younger than you are, and you clearly love each other and he has fallen on some difficult times. i understand that he has helped you with the renovations, but it's not your job to acquiesce to his demands or the needs of your adult children regarding what happens to your estate.\n\n this house should be a source of peace and contentment for you, not one that creates ongoing anxiety. \n\nthis house should be a source of peace and contentment for you, not one that creates ongoing anxiety. it's not your job to fix everybody. it's not your job to split your estate according to your children's wishes. it's not your job to make everything right for everybody all the time. this is your moment. do not give up your happiness to the ill-winds of other people's wishes, wants and what-ifs.\n\nyou can't control how other people will feel after you make a decision. there is a great freedom to be had in making decisions that you believe are right for you, and allowing others to feel as they are going to feel. some people will be mad at you in this life, others will try to bend you to their will, and some will sit in the lawyer's office while your last will and testament is being read out, and will curse you from the other side.\n\ncaring too much about what people think of you while you're here is exhausting enough. worrying about how they will feel about you after you're gone is an unheavenly form of co-dependency that only serves to muddle your financial decisions now and later. after all, you'll be gone, so you won't have to worry about it! you want to make sure your loved ones are taken care of, of course, but do what you believe is right, not what others tell you to do.\n\ntrust your gut, and consult an estate lawyer. your boyfriend is responsible for himself. your children are responsible for themselves. you could give your boyfriend a tenancy for life, only if this is what you believe to be the right thing to do. after he dies, you could split your estate equally between your children. are you ok with him living there with a new wife or girlfriend should you die before he does? you have earned the right to make estate plans both before and after you're gone.\n\nthe moneyist: my daughter-in-law will only have a second child by surrogacy — and wants to use $200k of my son's inheritance to pay for it
marriage problems are more likely for people in some career paths than others.\n\nworkers in certain fields are seeing higher divorce rates by age 30, a recent analysis of u.s. census data from career website zippia found. the highest divorce rate was for first-line enlisted military supervisors, its analysis of census bureau's public use microdata sample, or pums, data found. they had a divorce rate of 30%. the occupation involves leading operations and coordinating the activities of enlisted military personnel.\n\nthe next highest rates came from careers including logisticians, automotive service technicians and mechanics, followed by military-enlisted tactical operations and air weapons. in fact, military jobs took three of the top 10 spots in its listing. across all fields, military workers of all ranks were most likely to be divorced by age 30, at a rate of 15%. (the average age for divorce is 30 and roughly 41% of first marriages end in divorce, studies show.)\n\npeople who serve often face a unique set of circumstances that can impact their home life. some of the most demanding professions can be hardest on marriage, either because of time spent away, persistent danger or insufficient pay, said mark hamrick, a senior economic analyst at personal-finance site bankrate.com. these challenges can certainly pertain to those who serve in the armed forces, making or either willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nmilitary deployments have a profound effect on marriage, according to a separate study published last year in the journal of population economics. it found divorce rates increased significantly when spouses spent each month away. divorce rates for military members who have been deployed are higher:it's 12.52% for those in the u.s. navy, 8.9% in the marines, 8.48% in the army and 14.6% in air force, according to armed forces health surveillance branch data.\n\nthe moneyist: what to do about your finances during a divorce\n\ndon't miss:the bigger the age gap, the shorter the marriage\n\nmental health issues put additional strain on marriage, with 20% of iraq and afghanistan veterans reporting experiences with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, experts say. another study from military.com — a website that gives people with a connection to the military access to jobs, benefits and discounts — found that even non-deployed military members found their relationships struggled due to marrying too young and moving too often.\n\nof course, career stress affects all couples, hamrick said. money troubles can create additional divides. the overall divorce rate in the u.s. peaked in 1980 at 23 divorces per 1,000 married women and has been falling ever since. in 2016, the divorce rate was at 16.9 divorces per 1,000 married women. careers with lower rates of divorce listed by zippia included religious workers, speech language pathologists, and dentists.\n\nbaby boomers in particular have seen divorce rates double in the last 25 years, a pew research center report found, increasing 109% since 1990 as people are living longer and the cultural and religious stigma of divorce has declined in recent years. gray divorcées tend to be less financially secure than married and widowed adults, particularly among women, pew said. and living alone at older ages can be detrimental to one's financial comfort.
a new budweiser ad campaign has attempted to catch the attention of consumers with splashy newspaper spreads re-imagining late 1950s and early 1960 ads with a 2019 spin.\n\nappearing in several national newspapers, the three ads show real budweiser ads from 50 years ago of women serving up sudsy domestic bliss to their husbands next to new versions depicting empowered women deciding how they spend their time and who they spend it with — all while catching a cold brew.\n\nthe three ads were created by three female illustrators and each has a different theme: independence, equality and fulfillment, according to the company. they were done in partnership with #seeher, an effort led by the association of national advertisers to ensure every woman and every girl see themselves as they really are in advertising and media.\n\nthe campaign follows in the recent footsteps of gillette pg, +0.30% , which said its razors were the best a man can get. a recent provocative advertising campaign urged customers to shave off toxic masculinity, which gained worldwide press attention and appeared to polarize critics.\n\nis this the best a man can get? is it? we can't hide from it. it has been going on far too long. we can't laugh it off, making the same old excuses, a narrator said.\n\nbut does representation for women start at home? the top leadership of the company that owns budweiser, ab inbev bud, -1.31% , is predominantly male. only two of the company's 15 board of directors are women, and one of those women is a non-executive board member. ab inbev's 18-strong leadership team are all men, from the chief executive carlos brito and chief financial and solutions officer felipe dutra to the chief sales officer ricardo tadeu and zone president europe jason warner.\n\nbudweiser told marketwatch it was serious about female empowerment and had the numbers to show it. as a leader in advertising, it's our responsibility to showcase women in more balanced and empowered roles, said monica rustgi, vice president of marketing for budweiser.\n\ntwo of the ads subtract the husband from the frame of the 1956 and 1962 images and put the woman front and center, either with her favorite takeout for a friday night or ready to have a budweiser with friends.\n\nanheuser-busch/budweiser\n\nanheuser-busch/budweiser\n\nthat's in line with reality. the pew research center found that 40% of households with children under age 18 counted mothers as the sole or main source of income, up from 11% in 1960.\n\nthere are signs even more women are the main wage earner. an nbc news/wall street journal poll last year said 49% of women participating in the survey were their family's main earner, an increase from the 37% in 2000.\n\ndon't miss:when wives earn more than their husbands, they both do something pretty terrible\n\nanother 1958 ad shows a woman pouring a drink for her man, with the wording mentioning the king's credentials and talking about ingredients.\n\nanheuser-busch/budweiser\n\nthe updated ad shows the man and woman together, budweisers in hand and a pizza in front of them. home is where life happens. and life happens when you build it together, the wording says.\n\nmarriage rates have dropped over the decades while unmarried cohabitation is on the rise, which is something borne out in national health statistics reports and the pew research center.\n\nbudweiser is one of the many ab inbev brands. the company's board of directors is comprised of 15 members, its website explains. two of the members are women. listings of other leaders across the company show many — though not exclusively — male faces.\n\nbudweiser takes female empowerment very seriously, beyond leading in advertising and reflecting culture, a spokesman said, noting that over 80% of the company's brand team was female. nearly half of our us breweries are led by female head brewmasters, who play a crucial role in brewing our best-known products. as an advertising leader, it is our responsibility to equally represent and celebrate culture, including championing women.\n\nlast year, ab inbev issued its first global diversity and inclusion policy to encourage diversity and inclusion.\n\nmany companies are grappling with the predominance of men at the top of the ladder. a study last year from mckinsey & company and leanin.org showed patterns across all sorts of industries: an ever-shrinking number of women the higher in a company.\n\nin the food and beverage distribution sector, women made up 42% of entry-level workers but accounted for 9% of the headcount at the c-suite. that was the smallest percentage of women at the topmost levels among the 18 industries analyzed.\n\nlast year, heineken usa tapped maggie timoney as its ceo. she's the first woman to lead a major american beer producer.\n\nother companies have recently taken a look at their old messages to consumers and updated them.
are you being underpaid?\n\nsharing pay data is probably the easiest way to ensure every employee gets the same pay for the same job. but new research suggests that employers may claw back those gains made by underpaid staff over time. economists from the university of toronto, princeton university and the social analysis and modelling division from statistics canada, the country's national statistics agency, examined the impact of public-sector salary disclosure laws on university faculty salaries.\n\nusing administrative data covering the universe of faculty in canada, they came to three conclusions: firstly, the laws reduced the gender-pay gap. that's good news for a persistent problem that has dogged generations of workers. secondly, the closure of the gender wage gap occurred primarily in universities where faculty are unionized. that's a wrinkle in how widely this study may be applied. thirdly, pay disclosures ultimately reduced all salaries on average.\n\nin other words, increased transparency appeared to decrease the gender-pay gap in the short term by nudging employers to pay female employees more money so they would earn equal pay for equal work. any gap in pay, regardless of gender, was used as leverage when they negotiated their salaries. but sharing information on salaries over the long term may have led employers to lower overall salaries rather than lifting women's salaries to the level of their male co-workers, the study suggests.\n\nthe gender pay gap was around 15% in 1970 and reduced to 4% to 5% in 2017. the study looked at 101,103 individual university employees across canada. individuals were on average 48 years old and one quarter of them were women. the women in the sample were nearly 10% more likely to be unionized than men; this may be because they're more likely to work at organizations where there are labor unions and/or the share of women increased in the workforce alongside the gradual increase in unionization in the 1970s.\n\ndon't miss: why male uber drivers earn more than their female colleagues\n\nthe researchers said it's possible that the gender wage gap is unaffected by transparency laws. while learning about co-workers' wages might reveal something about the nature of firm-specific rents, if men and women use this information in a symmetric fashion in bargaining, one should not expect to see any impact on the gender pay gap. put simply: if men, but not women, use the information in bargaining, it could exacerbate the gap.\n\n\n\npay transparency is a big issue in the u.s. u.s. companies with at least 100 employees have until the end of september to turn over worker salary information to federal regulators, a federal judge ruled last month. companies are already required to give the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission breakdowns of race, sex and ethnicity. these companies will have to supply the agency with information on how much they paid men and women in 2018 by sept. 30.\n\ncompanies including google goog, +1.26% , disney dis, -1.28% and nike nke, -0.20% have faced allegations recently of failing to pay women fairly. google has previously said that it works hard to ensure there are no disparities and has installed an annual pay-parity review. similarly, nike defended itself against such complaints, saying that it's committed to competitive pay and benefits for our employees, and disney has called the allegations without merit.\n\nalso see: when wives earn more than their husbands, their marriage is less likely to last\n\nprevious research on pay transparency found that people were more concerned with pay ranks than differences pay levels. workers earning below the median for their pay unit and occupation reported lower pay and job satisfaction, while those earning above the median report no higher satisfaction, it found. workers with salaries below the median for their pay unit and occupation report lower pay and job satisfaction, it added, while those earning above the median report no higher satisfaction.\n\nnationally, women earn 83% that of men, according to the pew research center in washington, d.c. in the 1970s, women were paid closer to 58% the salary of men. men and women acquire more experience the longer they work and, therefore, become more valuable and productive. after 50, however, they either slow down and learn fewer new skills, economists say, or they are competing with younger, less expensive but equally skilled, employees for the same jobs.\n\nthere are only two occupations where women's median earnings are slightly higher than men's, while there are 107 occupations in which women's median earnings were 95% or less than men's for the same jobs, according to the institute for women's policy research. women working as dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers and wholesale and retail buyers, slightly out-earned men, it found. that is, the lowest paid occupations had the smallest gaps.\n\nand it doesn't always get better when women climb up in the ranks. female managers are not only under-represented in tech companies, they're paid significantly less than men. in the bay area, they're paid $172,585 per year, 10% less than men. in seattle, they are paid an average of $158,858 per year, also 10% less than men. that pattern is similar across tech companies in los angeles, boston and new york city, according to this analysis of 6.5 million employee profiles.
good grief. as if the covid-19 crisis has not already done enough damage, all the extra stress and forced togetherness may be causing some married couples to call it quits. if you're going down that road, anecdotal evidence suggests you'll have plenty of company. sad, but apparently true.\n\non top of all the other stuff, getting divorced can be a major financial transaction. as such, it can have major tax consequences. and there are tax pitfalls to avoid — if you know about them. don't expect your lawyer to understand all the tax implications of your impending marital split. some otherwise-competent divorce attorneys are not fully up to speed on divorce-related tax issues.\n\nin this column, we address one very important divorce-related tax issue: how to divide up ira and qualified retirement plan balances between you and your soon-to-be ex without triggering unexpected and unfair tax outcomes. bottom line: you need to plan ahead to make sure the federal income tax results turn out ok for you. if you don't plan ahead, the tax results can be dire. here's what you need to know to avoid that fate.\n\ndivide up ira balances the tax-smart way\n\nour beloved internal revenue code allows divorcing couples to divide up ira balances without adverse federal income tax consequences. say you'll be transferring ira money to your soon-to-be-ex as part of the divorce settlement. you should arrange for a tax-free transfer of money from your ira into an ira set up in your ex's name. do this via a direct transfer (aka trustee-to-trustee transfer) from your ira into your ex's receiving ira. that way, the transferred funds never pass through your hands, which is what makes it a tax-free deal for you.\n\nafter the transfer, your ex can manage the receiving ira and defer taxes until he or she begins taking money out of the account.\n\nthis drill applies equally to traditional iras, sep accounts, and simple iras. they are all considered traditional iras for this purpose.\n\nso far, so good. but you must be very careful here. the aforementioned tax-free transfer drill is only allowed when your divorce agreement requires the transfer.\n\nwhat happens if money from your ira gets into your ex's hands — before or after the divorce — without such a requirement? you'll be treated as if you received the ira money in a taxable distribution and then gave the money to your ex. that means you'll be on the hook for the income tax bill from the deemed taxable distribution — even though your ex wound up with all the money. to add insult to injury, you'll usually owe the dreaded 10% early withdrawal penalty tax if this happens before you've reached age 59½. your ex won't have any complaints, because the money from your ira is received without any tax consequences for your ex. all the tax consequences are on your side of the deal, and they are all bad news for you.\n\nto avoid this unexpected and unfair tax fate, never transfer ira money to your ex in advance of a legal requirement in your divorce agreement to do so.\n\ndivide up qualified retirement plan money the tax-smart way\n\nsay you participate in a qualified retirement plan at work — such as a 401(k) plan or profit-sharing plan. or you are self-employed and have a small business qualified plan, such as a keogh plan or solo 401(k) plan.\n\nto divide up qualified retirement plan accounts the tax-smart way in a divorce, you need to establish a qualified domestic relations order, or qdro. a qdro is boilerplate language that should be included in your divorce papers. first and foremost, the qdro establishes your soon-to-be-ex's legal right to receive a designated percentage of your qualified retirement plan account balance or designated benefit payments from your plan. the good news for you is that the qdro also ensures that your ex, and not you, will be responsible for the related income taxes when he or she receives payouts from the plan.\n\nthe qdro arrangement also permits your ex-spouse to withdraw his or her share of the retirement plan money and roll it over tax-free into an ira (assuming the plan permits such a withdrawal). that way, your ex can take over management of the money while postponing income taxes until distributions are taken from the rollover ira.\n\nbottom line: with a qdro in place, both you and your ex are treated fairly tax-wise, because the person who gets retirement plan payouts owes the related income taxes. who can argue with that?\n\nhere's the rub. if money from your qualified retirement plan account gets into your ex's hands without a qdro in place, you face a dire tax outcome. you'll be treated as if you received a taxable payout from the plan and then turned the money over to your ex. so, you'll owe the tax bill while your ex gets the money tax-free. to boot, you'll usually owe the dreaded 10% early withdrawal penalty tax if this happens before you've reached age 59½. to sum up: in the absence of a qdro, all the tax consequences are on your side of the deal, and they are all bad news for you. so please make sure that your divorce agreement includes the tax-saving qdro language.\n\nthe no-more-deductible-alimony factor\n\nbefore the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja), you could deduct properly structured alimony payments made to your ex, and your ex had to include the payments in his or her taxable income. but the tcja permanently eliminated deductions for alimony payments required by post-2018 divorce agreements. these payments may also be called spousal support or spousal maintenance. whatever they are called, you can't deduct them anymore under the federal income tax rules, and your ex receives these payments federal-income-tax-free.\n\nthe message: when structuring your divorce settlement, consider giving your soon-to-be-ex a share (or a bigger share) of your ira and/or retirement plan money in lieu of making now-nondeductible alimony, spousal support, or spousal maintenance payments. if you follow the advice given here, your ex will owe the taxes on the ira or retirement plan money that he or she receives under the divorce agreement. tax-wise, that may be a better deal for you than making a bunch of non-deductible payments and still being on the hook for taxes on your ira and retirement plan money when you eventually take distributions.\n\nthe last word\n\nin divorce, you can divide up ira and qualified retirement plan money the tax-smart way or the tax-dumb way. please go with the first option. as stated earlier, some otherwise-competent divorce attorneys are not so great on the tax stuff, but they might not admit it. you need a tax pro who has done lots of divorce-related work on your side. while your divorce attorney might be able to fill that role, don't take it for granted.\n\nfinally, don't let all the covid-19 stress cause you to drop the ball on important divorce-related considerations, whether they have to do with taxes or other matters. stay focused, keep your eye on the ball, and be careful out there.\n\nnote: for some good general advice for divorcing couples in the covid-19 era, see this previous marketwatch story.
investing isn't all about the nuances of stocks and bonds and the twists and turns of the market — sometimes, it involves matters of the heart. on monday, ubs announced it had raised $325 million for the rise fund, which was co-founded by bono and hopes to combine financial returns and support a range of social and environmental causes. the fund's total size is $2 billion and is managed by bill mcglashan, founder and managing partner of tpg growth, reuters reports. its investments include everfi, a provider of subscription-based digital learning to k-12 schools, universities, corporations, sports teams and ngos, and dodla, an indian dairy business.\n\nvalues-based investing is growing in popularity, where investment strategies are tied to investors' core beliefs. this can be broken down in a variety of ways: sustainable, responsible and impact investing (sri) excludes companies from an investment portfolio that do not align with core values, such as the environment or corporate governance practices. impacting investing is similar, but tracks the progress of these goals. more than half of millennials (51%) find impact investing appealing, and 54% believe investments' effects on society are important, according to a recent survey by kansas city, mo.-based investment management firm american century investments.\n\ndon't miss:investing during a donald trump presidency — don't follow your gut\n\nanother new company hopes to find a place amid investors' ever-changing values. motif, an online brokerage platform for investing in specific themes, such as biotech and health, introduced motif impact portfolios in march, where people invest in their beliefs and customize the list of funds put in those thematic buckets. investors may be particularly passionate about a subject, such as climate change or corporate governance, but if there are funds for companies investors don't believe are aligned, they can change those allocations. we are constantly voting with our consumer dollars, but not with our investing dollars, said hardeep walia, chief executive officer of motif.\n\nthe new offering is intended to provide investors with more transparency on their holdings — 73% of investors don't know if their investments are aligned with their personal beliefs, a motif survey found. (and 40% of americans don't know what's in their retirement accounts at all). motif charges $9.95 a month with a minimum investment of $1,000 (there are no fees for security transactions). the environment, for instance, is important to some investors concerned about climate change. sustainable investing funds rose 33% from 2014 to 2016, according to the forum for sustainable and responsible investment, thanks mostly to millennials: 70% say they prefer this type of investing.\n\nthe new frontier for vision companies: colorblindness\n\nthere are many misconceptions about investing based on your values, namely that you won't see much of a return. but that's largely a myth, experts say. it is not as much a choice of do good or do well, said greg vigrass, president and chief executive of folio institutional, which builds robo-adviser technology for financial advisers. it is very possible these days to invest along the lines of your beliefs and value system and not give up anything in investment returns. folio allows investors to invest in their beliefs by, for example, excluding securities of companies that participate in factory farming or alcohol. performance depends on funds, though some asset managers believe these types of funds do better than the s&p 500 and others do not.\n\nsee also:can you do well as an investor and still do good?\n\nalong with anti-animal cruelty, there are a myriad of other ways people can invest with their core values. religion-based investing has grown in popularity, and a new exchange-traded fund (etf) recently joined the market, and is based on the bible — it excludes companies that support abortion or support same-sex marriage. environment, social and governance (known as esg) investing looks at climate change, equal pay and executive compensation. there are also islamic-inspired funds that exclude anything to do with alcohol, tobacco and gambling, said david kathman, a mutual fund analyst at chicago-based investment research and management firm morningstar.\n\nvalue-led investing is a growing, long-term trend, according to casey clark, director of sustainable and impact investing at philadelphia-based wealth management firm glenmede trust, though it is more so for young investors than older generations. etfs have been popping up to support other beliefs — there's one that focuses on lgbt-friendly companies and another etf that believes companies with female leadership will see better performance than those without. according to msci research, companies with strong female leadership generated a return on equity of 10.1% a year, compared with 7.4% returns for those without.
why are so many americans over 65 self-employed? if you're thinking the answer lies in nelly's lyrics, hey, must be the money! you are mistaken.\n\nat least that's what three researchers found in their recent research looking at self-employment and contract work by age.\n\nin some cases, financial necessity is the primary driver, wrote katharine g. abraham, brad hershbein and susan houseman in their national bureau of economic research (nber) paper, contract work at older ages. in other cases, motivations such as the desire to stay active, connect with others, or pursue a hobby may be more important.\n\nthat's exactly what i heard when i spoke with a variety of people in their late 60s and early 70s about what led them to become self-employed at this time of life. (of course, many others work after 65+ because they need the money.) as much as those i talked to said they're glad about the self-employment income, the psychic rewards are even greater.\n\nfun as a professional photographer\n\ni'm having fun. i'm as happy in my work as i ever have been, said frank gallagher, 65, of silver spring, md. he spent 25 years working as an executive in nonprofit educational technology and is now a part-time photographer as well as a blog editor.\n\ngallagher calls his new life a marriage of two of my passions: photography and making the world a better place through nonprofit and volunteer work.\n\njudith henry, of tampa, fla., had a successful career in management and left it in 2017 at 65. she then wrote the dutiful daughter's guide to caregiving: a practical memoir, which she calls the book i could have used during my six years caring for my parents. these days, henry — who blogs at late bloomer and calls herself a bohemian soul with a bean counter's brain — is selling her artwork: paintings, collages, stitchery and cards.\n\nwriting the book was not about the money. if you write a book you find that out very quickly, said henry. now as an artist, she noted: when someone buys one of my pieces, it's like having a heart-to-heart conversation. that's gold, baby!\n\nthe dramatic rise in self-employment by age\n\nself-employment in america now rises sharply with age, especially after 65, the nber researchers noted in their report. while just under 20% of workers age 18 to 49 are self-employed, 25% of those 55 to 59 are, 46% of those 65 to 69 are and 68% of those 75 to 79 are. self-employment among older workers is a lot more common than we think it is, said hershbein, a senior economist at the w.e. upjohn institute for employment research and one of the paper's authors.\n\nthe older self-employed aren't always what you might think of as traditional small-business owners, running brick-and-mortar enterprises. often, as the nber economists learned after conducting a gallup survey of 61,000 americans, they're independent contractors working from home.\n\nmost of the rise in self-employment rates at older ages is due to independent contracting work, not small businesses in the conventional sense, said hershbein.\n\nand less than half of independent contractors age 65 to 69 that gallup surveyed said earning income was the main reason; about a third of those age 70 to 79 said that.\n\nwho older independent contractors typically are\n\nsaid hershbein: independent-contractor work as people get older is because they want to do it, not to make ends meet.\n\nbut that's a rarefied world.\n\nthe older independent contractors, hershbein noted, are overwhelming highly educated and often come from managerial or professional occupations. what they're frequently looking for, he said, is more control over their life.\n\nthat rings a bell with janine vanderburg, 67, of denver, who left the consulting firm she ran in 2017. now, vanderburg is director and chief catalyst at changing the narrative colorado, a campaign to increase understanding of ageism and shift how coloradans think about aging.\n\none of the things that has become really important to me is to never have to do the things i hated doing, says vanderburg. i didn't want to manage staff or operate according to any schedule outside of my own or deal with administrative stuff or work with people i didn't want to work with.\n\nwhat about the money?\n\nwhat she did want to do was find a way to be useful in the fields she has dedicated herself to over the years: social justice and social change. as for the money part…\n\nmoney is a way we measure value in society. i think it's important as we age to get paid for our work. often, there's a big push telling older people to just step to the side and volunteer. we should be paid for the value we bring to the table, said vanderburg.\n\nrosemary cass, of fairfield, conn., retired from her executive search business to follow her passion for writing. she then published a print magazine for three years and has converted it into the blog for boomers, seniors and caregivers, seeing it clearly now. love it! meets many needs other than money, she said in an email.\n\nrelated: working for yourself? open your eyes to this great deal from the irs\n\nroughly a quarter of older independent contractors work at least some of the time for their former employers, according to the nber research. they have a lot of skill sets that their former employers still want, said hershbein.\n\nand these independent contractor boomerangers are why government figures for the number of older self-employed americans are lower than reality, said hershbein. the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, he noted, assumes that if people say they're working for an employer, they must be employees.\n\nwhat will the coronavirus outbreak mean for the future?\n\ngiven that 57% of workers plan to work full time or part time in retirement, according to a new transamerica center for retirement studies survey, what will the pandemic mean for self-employment and independent contractor work for people 65+?\n\nthat will be a really interesting question, said hershbein. my sense is that people who are employees now will probably be reluctant to retire or quit if they can keep their job. but quite possibly, for those who are 65+ who were working and got the news of possibly being laid off, rather than waiting for that, they might think, 'now's the time' [to retire]. that's more 'i see the writing on the wall.'\n\nhershbein thinks some employers will use the coronavirus outbreak to retool and start using more independent contractors, rather than full-time employees.\n\nsee: pre-covid-19 survey shows employers positive on older workers\n\nsome older self-employed people have learned or improved skills during the pandemic to keep their operations running.\n\nover the last two months, i regret my january resolution for the year to become an expert in [the videoconferencing service] zoom, vanderburg joked. in reality, she has switched her in-person events to zoom zm, -4.26% conversations.\n\nbut the pandemic is already cutting into the work availability for many older self-employed people and causing others in their 60s to postpone launches.\n\nprototypical gig-economy independent contractor jobs, like uber uber, -2.23% or lyft lyft, -4.05% driver, have shriveled, though they're a small share of all independent contractor work. only 2% to 2.6% of workers ages 65 to 79 are employed through a platform or mobile app, according to the gallup survey.\n\nalso see: joe biden's retirement reforms are the boldest we've seen in generations\n\nin normal circumstances, i'd work 20 hours a week on my photography business, said gallagher. in the pandemic, it's more like 10 hours.\n\na great new life after the great recession\n\ncheryl comento, 73, of campbell, calif., was laid off from her home design job during the 2007-09 recession. so, she opened a senior-move management business and now runs two part-time businesses to help older adults and their families: living thru transition and above n beyond senior placement.\n\nfor comento, it's all about pursuing her passion and interacting with people. ever since i was a child, i liked talking to seniors and listening to their stories and connecting with them. i thought this is a good time of life to do that, she said.\n\nalso, comento added, as a solo ager with no family near her, my social interaction is through my business. i love talking to people and helping people. when the money comes in, that's nice as well.\n\nvanderburg told me she couldn't be happier. i wake up every day to do something fun and enjoyable, she said.
like many of my fellow cohabitating millennials, i was relatively naive about the realities of getting married. i assumed not a ton would change between my now-husband and me once we made it official.\n\nwhen we got engaged i was suddenly bombarded with questions ranging from silly — what are your thoughts on a sweetheart table? — to the more serious (at least by comparison): where will you be spending thanksgiving this year?\n\nto be honest, we hadn't given this much thought. over the course of our relationship we'd opted to spend thanksgiving separately, even as we tried to rotate where we celebrated various jewish holidays. but if a practical reason meant a change in routine, we didn't give it too much thought.\n\nnow the question of where to spend the holidays looms larger and answering it was one of the first times that i truly began to understand the difference between living together in a committed relationship and deciding to get married.\n\nyou're not just marrying your partner, you're ending up with this big system of people, said liz higgins, a licensed marriage and family therapist associate, who deals largely with millennial clients. the conversation needs to become how can we make sure we're prioritizing our relationship values but still maintaining relationships with these other people?\n\nfor now, we're avoiding that new conversation for at least one more year, instead basking in the glow of childhood traditions with our own families. but for those of you who aren't procrastinating, several experts give tips on how best to navigate this touchy territory:\n\nstart planning thanksgiving in july\n\neven if negotiating the holidays is a conversation we all dread, couples should try to get to it as soon as possible, experts say. though it can be awkward to talk christmas in july, couples may be happier with their plans if they discuss them while the weather is warm — before other family members' plans have a chance to influence their own, said sharon naylor, the author of more than 35 wedding and celebration books.\n\nby making decisions early, the couple can also help soften the blow of their choice for any family members who they won't be seeing and take time to prepare an alternative celebration, said diane gottsman, an etiquette expert and the owner of the protocol school of texas. you don't want to surprise your family members at the last minute, she said.\n\nbe open to suggestions from your partner\n\nthis might seem like obvious advice, but it can be hard to remember in the midst of calls and texts from relatives seeking to learn your holiday plans: partners need to make sure they don't commit to either family before discussing the choice with each other, said naylor.\n\nthey should consider one another, have a conversation and be open to suggestions from your mate, said elaine swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert.\n\nduring these conversations, partners should remember that while their family is important the feelings of the couple are paramount when determining their plans, said gottsman. it really is first and foremost about the couple and respecting each other, she said. that's not to say that you don't take your family into consideration, but often times we [go somewhere] for the family and we end up resenting it.\n\nfactors to consider when setting your routine\n\nit can be helpful to set a routine where you either alternate holidays or spend a certain holiday with a certain set of relatives each year. that way you manage relatives' expectations, so that you don't have to have the same conversation every time certain holidays roll around, said swann.\n\nteach them how you celebrate the holidays, so they'll get used to it, she said.\n\nwhen deciding where you're going to spend each holiday, it's important to consider whether a given celebration, say christmas eve, is more important to one partner than the other. that's kind of a compromise in itself, said swann. if one celebration is very important to both families, then couples either have to rotate or find a way to be with both sets of relatives.\n\nbut of course, it isn't all about feelings — money plays a role as well, experts agree. it may not be in all couples' budgets to take off work and travel to see relatives, which means they may choose to host their own celebration or visit with family closer to home.\n\nreasons to alter your holiday routine\n\njust because you've set expectations doesn't mean you can't make exceptions. one major reason to alter your routine would be if your financial fortunes shift, said swann.\n\ncouples may also decide to change things up if a relative on one side is elderly or ill. one of the things that i've found figures the most in couples' plans in where to go is whose family is having a problem, said naylor. we're seeing a lot more humanity in the decisions there. i'm also finding that the other side is very understanding of that kind of thing.\n\nand as young children come into the picture couples may be less willing to crisscross the country in a short period of time visiting various relatives. at the same time, they may feel more pressure to spend time with both sets of grandparents.\n\nin that case, families may consider starting their own tradition, inviting both sets of relatives to their homes. couples nervous about preparing the meal all on their own can get creative, said naylor. they can assign tasks to other family members, hire a private chef or simply make a reservation at a restaurant and invite relatives over for dessert or drinks.\n\nthere are other, less logistical reasons to upend your routine, said gottsman: if both members of the couple are consistently unhappy spending a holiday at a given place. but that doesn't mean you can simply change course willy-nilly.\n\nyou may not like your mother-in-law or brother-in-law, she said, but sometimes you just have to take one for the team. that's an important part of being in a couple, she added. still, in that scenario, it's important to make sure your spouse reciprocates, she said.\n\nhow to break your decision to your family\n\nonce couples have made a decision, they face the challenging task of reporting it to their families. the first step is gaming out how you expect the conversation to go, said higgins. consider the best-case scenario and consider the worst-case scenario and if it's the worst what will you say in response to that?\n\nonce you've visualized the possible scenarios, it's time to take to the phone or set up a meeting. experts agree that this is a conversation that should never be had over text or email. ideally, the phone call or in-person conversation is with the adult son or daughter, not their partner, said gottsman.\n\nthat's something that has to be clearly described so they can hear the inflection in your voice, said naylor. couples should be very direct with their families about their plans, she said. they should also be sure to respond to any invitations, even if that means saying we haven't decided yet, so that the host can plan appropriately.\n\nyou don't want people thinking that there are 50 people coming and buy 50 lobsters, naylor said.\n\ncouples may also want to limit the blow of a disappointment by discussing alternative times to visit with the family they're missing, gottsman said. some suggestions for how to frame that conversation: we're going to come see you christmas eve, but we're not going to do christmas morning, or: we're not going to spend the entire weekend with you, so which day or time would you prefer?\n\nbeing honest, but being diplomatic, she said.\n\ncouples can also numb the sting of their absence by sending the family something to open on the holiday, like a pumpkin pie on thanksgiving, said swann. they should also be sure to mention the gift when they're breaking the news that they won't be in town.\n\nwhen you have the conversation, don't put so much focus on the fact that you won't be there, she said. make that part matter of fact — talk to them about what you will do.\n\nand even if you send a gift, you should still make a point of calling the relatives you're missing on the holiday. what's important is that you remember them on that day, gottsman said.\n\n(this story was republished on nov. 12, 2018.)
dear moneyist,\n\nmy spouse and i have been friends with a neighboring couple for decades, until recently. in our early 30s, we worked, struggled, and endeavored to improve our lives. this included career changes, setbacks and successes, vacations and fun, work on our respective houses, and dinners out.\n\nour approaches to life were different but we remained fast friends nonetheless. for example, we took camping trips in the mountains, while they enjoyed trips to europe.\n\n in our early 40s, our friends invited us to meet with their financial adviser. \n\nwe dug trenches, poured concrete foundations, and worked to build our house; they hired contractors. they traded in cars frequently; we ran ours into the ground.\n\nour idea of a fun night out was the special at the local chinese restaurant, while they clubbed it in the city. indeed, their combined income was twice ours — probably more — and we had unemployment setbacks. but we never suffered relationship problems with the so-called wealth gap as so many friends do. while out for an evening together we split bills evenly, treated or were treated. it worked.\n\nin our early 40s, our friends became interested in retiring early, and invited us to meet with their financial adviser. we accepted and had a great time. well, they did poke fun at us for participating too much on their dime. it was a good experience, and my spouse and i took it to heart and so did our friends, or so we thought.\n\nafter all, they talked about finances all the time, shared conversations they had with their financial adviser, and frequently forecast their future. our friends had absolute plans to retire with their current lifestyle at 55, which at the time seemed out of reach for us, even if the underlying financial concepts seemed sound. we adopted the financial advice, mostly.\n\nwe stopped discussing finances for the next decade or so, enjoyed our lives, and enjoyed one another's company. in our mid fifties, finances came up again. they asked us about our plans, and we reminded them about the financial adviser meeting so many years back.\n\n we stopped discussing finances for the next decade or so, and enjoyed our lives. \n\nwe shared that we had just finished our last five-year plan and, at 55, we were ready to retire with no debt, a steady income stream, full and nearly free lifetime medical insurance, and a healthy nest egg. this includes a nice capital gains exemption on our house sale.\n\nwe assumed they had outperformed us with their income but no, that same financial adviser is telling them that they need 10 more years of work to meet their retirement income goals. they have mortgage and credit-card debt and incomplete medical coverage.\n\nthey can't down-size and sell their home at a profit, nor is their home configured to sell easily. the subject came up a few times more, but then they lost interest and we stopped discussing it. now they have pulled away, and we haven't spoken for a long time. we pass each other in town with polite nods or thousand-yard stares.\n\nmaybe we can understand how they feel, but it is confusing. what happened?\n\nsincerely,\n\nthe future is bright, for us\n\nwant to read more? follow quentin fottrell on twitter and read more of his columns here.\n\ndear bright,\n\nyour letter was compelling from the get-go. it exists in that bittersweet spot between friendship and hardship, romance and finance, saying too much and not enough, good neighbors and bad manners, and good manners and bad neighbors. when i read, in our early 40s, our friends became interested in retiring early, and invited us to meet with their financial adviser, i knew we had reached a turning point or a crossroads or — perhaps for your friends — something of a spaghetti junction.\n\n it was an equal friendship in terms of dinner checks, but that doesn't mean it was equal.  — the moneyist\n\nthey were living well, and they were also comfortable with you and your wife living, well, not quite in the same fashion. but you were a-ok with that. and you're right. you can have just as much fun camping as you can have in europe staying at a five-star hotel. more, in fact. plus, you can enjoy a home that was lovingly renovated over time with the sweat from your own brow as much, if not more, than if you had hired contractors to turn it into a marble-encrusted suburban palace.\n\nit was an equal friendship in terms of dinner checks, but that does not mean it was all equal. it may not have been a 50/50 relationship in the eyes of your friends. they wanted to help you when they believed that you needed their help, and whatever propensity they had for competing with others was not triggered in your company. it may be harsh to say they were at ease with perceiving you and your wife as the underdogs in this relationship, but it certainly seems that way.\n\nif they did live beyond their means and live a lifestyle to which they hoped to become accustomed — and they can't blame you or their financial adviser for their credit-card debt — it suggests that they may not be 100% happy in their own skin. when people are unhappy and they have a brief respite from those emotions when they buy a smart tv or a face cream that promises to make them look 10 years younger, it might not feel so bad to have friends who do not have access to those luxuries.\n\n pull up a chair because i am now going to tell you a story about a friendship.  — the moneyist\n\nlook back without anger or diamond-encrusted rose-tinted spectacles. was your friendship as real as you believe it to be? pull up a chair. i'm now going to tell you a story. my father died 20 years ago and, after reading the death notice in the newspaper, my best friend from elementary school got in touch. in high school, he dropped me. i was crestfallen, but i also realized that it wasn't healthy to have just one best friend. we had not seen each other since then, so i was curious to reconnect.\n\nwe arranged to meet for dinner in a restaurant in dublin. when i arrived, he said, why don't you sit down there — and relax. why was he telling me to relax? i was relaxed! now i wasn't feeling so relaxed! the evening started with that weird, condescending tone, and it went downhill from there. he asked a lot of questions, which soon took on a common theme. all roads led back to money, money, money: where do you live? how many bedrooms do you have?\n\nlate into the evening, and too many pints of guinness later, he asked me in a slow, slurring drawl: do you mind me asking, 'how much did you pay for your apartment?' again, i told him. he could do all the calculations he wanted to, but it was no skin off my nose. my friends have been, and always will be, the most valuable thing in my life. but at that moment it finally hit me: a childhood friendship i had encased in a special snow globe of my mind was, like this evening, actually difficult to endure.\n\n your frugal living led you to where you are today, retiring in your 50s.  — the moneyist\n\nmemories came flooding back. bad ones. summer vacations when he didn't return my calls. reminders that he had more money, a recurring topic. recalling those experiences led me to feel bad for my younger self. it wasn't that he had changed, it was that he had not changed. he was the same. that high status/low status was the dynamic of our childhood friendship. i was so happy to have a friend back then that i put up with it. in 2001, however, one night was enough.\n\nwhat did i learn from that? if someone is no longer in your life, it could be for a good reason. it's ok to have a smaller home or less money than everyone else, so drive up to that school reunion bursting with pride in your old jalopy! listen to how you feel, and take action. when you are spending time with neighbors or old school buddies who are not healthy for you, you are taking time away from yourself, and from days and nights spent with others. time is infinitely more valuable than money.\n\n they, and they alone, bear the sole responsibility for their own finances.  — the moneyist\n\nsimilarly, your friendship with these neighbors may not be exactly as you remember it. it is revealing that they poked fun at you for taking too much time with their financial adviser, or for asking too many questions. it shows that there was an invisible line not to cross. you could take a stock tip or two, but just enough so you would stay in your proverbial box. have no doubt: your investing and frugal living led you to where you are today, retiring in your 50s. no one is responsible for that, but you.\n\nyou never did ask your friends what went wrong. they may not give you an honest answer, but you may feel better by acknowledging that this friendship has come a cropper. they may be genuinely struggling financially and, while that must be hard for them to deal with, they — and they alone — bear the sole responsibility for that. some people will only be around for the good times. others will relish the bad times. but true friends will celebrate and commiserate, and be there for both.\n\nif this friendship doesn't recover, that's ok. what was your part? were you quietly competing with them too? either way, i believe that we journey through people, and just because a friendship ends does not mean it was not a success for the time that it lasted. sometimes, they simply run their course. finally, every challenging experience we have and every person we meet is here to teach us something. and so what has this decades-long friendship taught you?\n\nlearn to master your money:sign up for marketwatch's free live series to boost your financial iq\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group, where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. by emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch.
new york (ap) — barack obama and bruce springsteen are teaming up for an eight-episode spotify podcast series, swapping stories about their upbringings and even a white house singalong around a piano.\n\nthe first two episodes of renegades: born in the usa, a conversation recorded at springsteen's guitar-filled home studio in new jersey, were made available on monday.\n\nsee also: tech ceo says twitter needs to go 'all in' on subscriptions\n\nspotify spot, -0.47% has moved aggressively in podcasts over the past three years, and made other programming announcements monday. the audio streaming service has already worked with barack and michelle obama's production company higher ground, and the former first lady's podcast is the service's most popular original.\n\nthe seemingly offbeat relationship between the former president and the rock star began when springsteen performed at benefits for obama during his presidential campaigns. but it has blossomed into deeper conversations since he left office, obama said in the first episode.\n\nhe's a rock 'n' roll icon, he said. i'm a lawyer and politician. not as cool. and as i like to remind bruce every chance i get, he's more than a decade older than me.\n\nthe men recalled a white house visit, which included springsteen playing the piano as broadway and motown tunes were sung. there were libations involved, obama said.\n\nspringsteen uses a few of those guitars during the course of the podcast. in that first episode, both men recalled feeling like outsiders growing up and turning to their fields as a way of finding their voices, with a little megalomania involved. in later episodes, they talk about racism, fatherhood and marriage.\n\ntheir wives, michelle obama and patti scialfa, bonded, sealing their friendship.\n\nwe still have a fundamental belief in the american ideal, obama said. not as nostalgia. but as a compass.\n\nthe renegades: born in the usa series title references one of springsteen's biggest hits and could also be a sly reference to the birther campaign where obama's eventual successor, donald trump, falsely suggested obama's origins were outside of the country.\n\nspotify said monday it was working with higher ground on another podcast, tell them i am, which compiles stories from muslim voices and will debut throughout ramadan.\n\nthe service also said it had reached a deal with warner brothers and dc comics for a series of narrative podcasts, with the first being batman unburied. director ava duvernay is participating in a new podcast about high profile cases of police brutality.\n\nspotify is also upgrading its sound, announcing that it will debut spotify hifi later this year, where members with spotify-connected speakers can sign up for enhanced quality music streams.
dear quentin,\n\ni am married and have been in the same relationship for a number of years. we have both been single parents from prior relationships. considering our age gap, he is much more successful in life as a sole proprietor. he is more than a decade older than me. he talked about a prenuptial agreement during our relationship, but he did not spring it on me until three days prior to our wedding day.\n\nwe discussed nothing as to what would go into the agreement. i was severely depressed and cried uncontrollably for days. even reliving this is causing heartache. i consulted with my attorney but decided to sign it rather than not go through with the wedding. for several years, i asked for a copy and he couldn't find it. when i finally had enough, i found it in his office and made myself a copy.\n\n 'i'm angry at myself now because there are provisions i would have included had i had more time to think about it.' \n\ni still don't fully understand what happened, and i'm angry at myself now because there are provisions i would have included had i had more time to think about it. my parents will be willing me a home and a nice considerable amount of cash. i'm not in his will, there is no life-insurance policy, and i'm not listed on the deed of the second vacation home we bought before we married, but he wants to say how everything is ours.\n\ntechnically, it isn't. now that i am about to start my own venture, which may be lucrative (potentially six figures a year), i want to amend the prenuptial agreement. in a way, i want to hurt him the same way he hurt me. it's caused a lot of resentment on my end as i feel he never trusted me, although i have never asked him for anything. if he dies tomorrow, what is going to happen to me?\n\nshould i amend the prenuptial agreement? is it possible that the current prenuptial agreement is null and void?\n\npostnuptial state of mind\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear postnuptial,\n\nyou should know what's in your own prenuptial agreement, given that it's a legal document you both signed. i don't understand why you did not have a copy when you originally signed the document, and why you didn't actively insist on a discussion. with the help of your lawyer, that was your job to make sure that happened. you had the choice to call off the wedding and/or sit down and read every page. i'm not saying this to be provocative, but to remind you that taking responsibility for this sequence of events is more constructive than taking umbrage at your husband.\n\nbut let's be very clear: three days' notice of a prenuptial agreement before your wedding without any willingness to compromise on the details or discuss them is sorely lacking in consideration, and is a chaotic and unsettling start to a marriage. i understand why it left you reeling, and why you felt both confused and angry. in a marital property state, in the absence of a prenup, assets are distributed in a fair and equitable manner. inheritance is not considered marital property, so you should have no worries on that front.\n\n it was not a good way to embark on a marriage and, as a tangent to your question, it's not a good way to continue one. \n\nyour prenuptial agreement should reflect that you both maintain your separate finances and assets in the event you divorce. in other words, what's his is his and what's yours is yours. he can't have it both ways. according to rowe law offices, historically, courts sometimes set aside premarital agreements when they were unreasonable; left one spouse destitute; were made without full disclosure of a spouse's property and debt; were signed under duress or without mental capacity; were the product of fraud or misrepresentation; and so on.\n\nshould you amend the prenup? you can certainly create an amendment, as long as both of you are in agreement, or sign a new postnuptial contract that supersedes the original contract. but that is a question only you can answer based on what the prenup actually says, and whether your lawyer believes it is written in a way that gives you both the same financial independence post-divorce. the whole business seems messy and unpleasant. it was not a good way to embark on a marriage and, as a tangent to your question, it's not a good way to continue one.\n\ncertainly, something needs to change. from the little you have said, it appears to be a marriage that lacks transparency and mutual respect. you need a financial therapist, a mediator or your own counselor to examine the causes and cures of this toxic atmosphere. starting a business should be a time of optimism and joy, not steeped in an i'll show you entrepreneurial revenge fantasy. getting married is the biggest financial decision you will make in your life, if only because of the toll divorce takes on an individual, and because you may end up taking turns supporting each other.\n\nif this marriage ends, you should both leave with what you brought into it. given that, the real issue here is not what happens in the event of a divorce, but everything else that comes before it.\n\nthe moneyist:my wife has homeschooled our son and our best friends' son since september due to covid-19. is it too late to bring up money?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch. by submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
in the credit-card turf war, platinum wraps plastic.\n\na premium credit card is typically associated with high social status and higher fees, but recent research suggests that people will choose them because it signifies higher income over and above its benefits. economists worked with an indonesian bank that markets premium platinum credit cards to high-income customers. demand for the platinum card greatly exceeds demand for a nondescript control product with identical benefits, according to the study distributed monday by the national bureau of economic research, a cambridge, mass.-based research group.\n\nwhat's more, the lower your self-esteem, the more likely you will opt for flashy credit cards with higher fees. social image is a substitute for self-image, the researchers wrote. demand for status is psychological in nature. cross-referencing spending habits with psychological tests, the researchers found that increasing self-esteem causally reduces demand for status goods. (the study was carried out by economists from the university of chicago, the world bank, sao paulo school of economics, harvard university and university of california, los angeles.)\n\nthere's one real-world drawback: consumers may use the platinum card in social situations when they're better off using a less prestigious card. it can be a costly mistake, the study found. while the card used in our study does not offer cash back rewards, at least 48% of platinum customers report owning other credit cards which do offer cash back at restaurants and similar transactions. in order to appear wealthier, in other words, customers may actually forgo money in the form of cash rewards each time they use the platinum card instead of other cards in those situations.\n\ndon't miss:the larger the rock, the rockier the marriage\n\nprevious studies have identified impulsivity among people who want to escape unhappiness and low self-esteem. this 2010 study in the journal of experimental social psychology found that individuals conspicuously consume to signal their wealth. or, put in academic terms, the compensatory role of high-status goods has important implications for consumer decision-making and public policies aimed at reducing consumer debt. understanding why we put certain goods on credit is important to controlling our impulses, the researchers said.\n\npremium credit cards are becoming increasingly extravagant. several metal credit cards have been released in recent months. in march, u.s. bank usb, +2.88% , announced the u.s. bank altitude reserve visa infinite card, which the bank hopes will rival chase's jpm, +1.45% sapphire reserve and american express's axp, -1.55% platinum. even amazon amzn, -3.37% used a minimalist metal design for its prime rewards visa v, -0.94% card. they're targeting big spenders and, if the latest research reflects u.s. consumers, those who want to appear to be big spenders.\n\nhigh-end cards like the sapphire reserve and amex platinum charge hundreds of dollars a year to carry them, but often give out a large number of reward points initially. despite such high fees, consumers may also have a hard time spending all those rewards to make those cards worth it. if every sapphire reserve card user's spending qualified for the 100,000 point sign-up bonus — which was later reduced to 50,000 points — they'd have around 91 billion points to spend, an equivalent of more than $1 billion, the personal-finance website nerdwallet calculated.
dear moneyologist,\n\nit took a couple of months, but i finally managed to get out of the relationship i told you about in my previous letter. when i did, my boyfriend threatened to disclose personal details about my life that i don't want others knowing.\n\nas you can imagine, i don't want anything to do with him. if he is going to be petty, then i feel i need to have my bases covered in terms of property that was exchanged in our relationship.\n\nnotably, before any of this happened, i had ordered my ex the latest 128-gigabyte iphone 7. i was advised to cancel this order because it sends mixed signals if my wish is to cease communication with him. there is a part of me that feels i should inform my ex that i have canceled the order, so he can make arrangements to get the new phone if he so desires. however, i am afraid of triggering him to disclose these details of my life; given his recent behavior towards me, does this courtesy go out with the bath water?\n\nthe second question i have is how to deal with a promise ring. it was given to me last christmas. i looked up the price of the ring and its listed retail price is $400 and is selling for $250. i have absolutely no problems giving the ring back — nor has he asked for it — but i am trying to do the right thing if somehow a promise was unfulfilled.\n\nplease advise me. i don't mean to be petty and stupid, even though my problem is.\n\ntrying to work through the damage in california\n\ndear trying,\n\nnever do anything out of fear — unless you're fleeing a burning building, of course.\n\nit is truly abhorrent that he would even think about disclosing personal details about your life. don't dignify this intimidation by paying $749 for his iphone 7. if you do, you are living in the shadow of his threat. to break free from this relationship, cancel the iphone order (if you still can) and do something really nice with that money. if it involves sitting on a beach with a cocktail, raise your glass to the universe to give thanks for this experience. (here's a five-night all-inclusive vacation in cancun for $749 exactly.) you may not know it now, but you have probably learned a great deal.\n\n you dodged a bullet, lost a promise ring and gained $749. i'd say you come out of this ahead.  — the moneyologist\n\namong those lessons: if something does not feel right, deal with it head on. in your last letter, you wrote of this possible marriage to him, i want to be able to protect my assets, which i said sounded transactional. after you read my answer, you wrote to say that you realized that you were likely looking for reasons to end the relationship. whether you were hesitant about marrying a man with two children or his uncertain financial situation, you did not want to take the relationship farther. trust your gut. sometimes, it's the best guide we have in areas of romance and finance.\n\ndon't miss:will a flip phone give other people the wrong impression?\n\nspeaking of the universe giving you a helping hand, apple aapl, -2.32% appears to be having supply issues with its new iphone 7. my marketwatch colleague jennifer booton recently reported that shipment estimates for the iphone 7 plus are now october and versions of the jet black iphone may not arrive until november. the silver, black, gold and rose gold iphones are all on a two-to-three-week delay, she wrote. while other consumers can't wait to get their hands on the new iphone 7 and are probably fuming at the delay, this is good news for you.\n\nso cancel the iphone. the fact that he could be using this phone to text people unflattering stories about you just makes it all the more urgent that you do. if he does want to do that, let him do it on his old flip phone, or whatever he's using. return the promise ring, however. the relationship is over. it would seem churlish to resell it. if his iphone has arrived and it's too late to cancel the order, still give back the promise ring. add a polite, but civil note, saying that it would not seem appropriate to keep the ring, and you hope he finds someone to give it to.\n\nyou dodged a bullet, lost a promise ring and gained $749. i'd say you came out of this ahead.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
the long-held assumption that children will be better off than their parents were appears to be faltering.\n\namericans are not very optimistic about their children's financial futures. only 37% of americans believe today's children will grow up to be better off than their parents were financially, a sentiment unchanged since 2013, according to a recent survey by pew research center, a nonprofit think tank in washington, d.c. it is very hard for people to thrive when health-care, housing and education costs are so high, said david grasso, the editor of genfkd, an education and economy advocacy group for millennials. those are three realities threatening the ability for present and future generations to thrive.\n\namericans aren't the only people pessimistic about future generations' finances. canadians aren't very hopeful, nor are those in france, greece, japan, australia, kenya and mexico. overall, a median of 41% of residents in countries pew surveyed believe children in their country will be better off. the gloomy outlooks comes even as people view their country's economy positively — 58% of americans, for example, said the economic standing of the u.s. was good in a separate pew survey earlier this year. pew interviewed about 40,000 residents in 38 countries.\n\neverything you need to do in your 20s for a great financial future\n\nsee:millennials: this is how to fix your money to get the retirement you want\n\nolder americans are much more pessimistic than younger ones — 61% of americans 50 and older say the next generation is in trouble. among 18- to 29-year-olds, less than half (49%) believe even younger americans will be worse off. older americans in particular may have trouble envisioning a future free from a housing market that would have been out of reach to them in their 20s and 30s, stagnant wage growth and student debt that has tripled to $1.3 trillion from $481 billion a decade ago, grasso said. not to mention modern society's obsession with smartphones.\n\none possible reason for the downbeat assessment of young people's future could be that millennials aren't as well-off as their parents were when their parents were their age, according to a report from young invincibles, an advocacy group for young americans. that's in part because they earn lower incomes than their parents did, according to young invincibles report. the report analyzed federal reserve board of governors public surveys from 1989 and 2013 and found millennials earn lower incomes than their parents did.\n\nsee also: millennials need to worry about these 4 things — in addition to saving for retirement\n\nyounger americans also face a host of financial constraints that previous generations didn't. millennials have a reputation for delaying marriage and homebuying and living at home with their parents for longer than any generation before them, but there's more to it: there's an increasing number of young people who are staying home to help their parents or save for a down payment on a house. but younger americans' lack of worry about the future also means they're saving less for retirement.
welcome to capital confidential — a weekly diary column featuring the best tidbits from around the u.k.'s business and political landscape from marketwatch sister publication financial news.\n\nthis week: martha lane fox voices despondency on eliminating tech's gender imbalance, and star-studded goings-on at davos...\n\nmartha gives up on tech gender pay gap\n\nmartha lane fox, co-founder of lastminute.com, who now runs responsible tech think-tank doteveryone, is renowned for being one of the business community's cheeriest entrepreneurs. but baroness lane-fox of soho is despairing at the chance of the gender pay gap ever being eliminated in her lifetime in her industry. asked by the media masters podcast about tech's notorious gender imbalance, lane fox — who sits as a crossbencher in the house of lords — said: when you look at the numbers, they're unbelievably disappointing and dispiriting. there are more women, as a percentage, in the house of lords than there are in technology; a 1,000-year-old institution versus something that didn't even exist 30, 40 years ago. so, i'm not sure we're ever actually going to get to a level playing field, because if you look at the trajectory now we're actually going backward, and yet this is a sector that is growing bigger and bigger and bigger.\n\nlane fox reckons that studies back her gloomy gender prognosis.we're not making progress, she laments. i am an optimist, but i think we have to be realistic. mckinsey did some work to show when there's going to be gender parity across various different [sectors]… politics was going to be about 75 years. awful, but you can imagine i might still be alive if i take the right drugs and put the right face cream on. business, i think a bit less, maybe 50 years. but then in stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] or anything to do with technology, never — because the trajectory's either flat or backwards… but it doesn't mean we shouldn't focus on it relentlessly.\n\nretail politics\n\ntalk that santander's u-turn on appointing andrea orcel, the former head of ubs's investment bank, as ceo was due to a potential populist uprising in spain over the size of his pay packet, and less to do with reservations over the italian dealmaker's modus operandi, is looking cheap after the elitist adventures of ana botín, the spanish retail bank's chair. in the same week that santander announced it was closing 140 branches in the uk, botín attended the institute of international finance meeting in zurich and was then on stage at the world economic forum's annual meeting in davos alongside assorted politicos. given santander's recent woes of late, it seemed fitting that botín found herself at the davos forum having to mediate a contentious exchange between dutch prime minister mark rutte and former european parliament president martin schulz.\n\ndavos house party\n\nmeanwhile, the prevalence of celebrities attending the wef annual meeting has been much discussed, and there's no doubt that the most star-studded haunt was at davos house. the event space partnered with organizations including red, bono's aids initiative, children's charity unicef and conservation organization wwf in an effort to raise awareness about the u.n.'s 2030 sustainable development goals, and the likes of bill gates, matt damon, john kerry and david attenborough dropped by. capital hears former treasury pals matt hancock and george osborne, now health secretary and evening standard editor respectively, also made an appearance in davos house at the same time daredevil magician david blaine was there showing off his tricks. given blaine's previous stunts include spending 44 days suspended in a glass box by the thames, the political pair — both of whom have been wringing their hands over brexit — could have been forgiven for begging the illusionist to try to pull an eu-related rabbit out of a hat.\n\nslice of modesty\n\nthere was a welcome injection of modesty at the press party hosted by amundi the other week. laurent guillet, the london chief executive of europe's largest asset manager, introduced proceedings and proudly declared that amundi managed €1.5bn before correcting himself to the right amount, which he said was €1.5tn. then a galette des rois, a lavish french cake traditionally eaten on twelfth night, was wheeled out with fany de villeneuve, amundi's uk head of pr, warning guests: from experience i can tell you that if you have a big piece now you won't need any dinner tonight… or breakfast tomorrow.\n\nfast-food guy\n\nguy hands might be more famous for his fast feuds than fast food, but the private equity tycoon is loving running the mcdonald's franchise in the nordic region. students attending the london school of economics' alternative investments conference must have been bemused to hear hands telling them to snap up mcdonald's franchises and that a golden arches diet was working wonders for his waistline. i have found a way to eat mcdonald's every day and lose weight, hands said. i have a protein-based lunch with salad consisting of less than 500 calories and under two grams of sugar. i'm down 26 lbs so far.\n\ngoldman and boy\n\ngoldman sachs banker dirk lievens was made partner at the u.s. bank four years ago, so he knows a thing or two about living the dream. but in a soul-stirring post on linkedin, lievens, who heads up goldman's team in europe, said his 12-year-old son pietro has shown him how it is really done. a few weeks after lievens told his son to get real about his chances of becoming a professional footballer — even though he plays as a junior for crystal palace football club (i laid out the probabilities and then told him to go back upstairs [and] finish his homework, lievens wrote) — on father's day enterprising pietro handed his old man a manuscript of following your dream, a story he had written about three boys who are given a trial at chelsea fc. the lievens have self-published pietro's book and dirk is impressed with his son's literary achievements, with one caveat. i am arsenal. he is chelsea, he noted. guess that is why the father in the book runs off in the first chapter.\n\nremains of the divorce\n\nthe forthcoming divorce of amazon founder jeff bezos, the world's richest man, from his wife mackenzie after 25 years of marriage has yet to play out. but when the possessions are divvied up, bezos will surely walk away with the family copy of booker prize-winning novel the remains of the day. it is bezos's favorite novel of all time and he once said of the tome, which recounts the exploits of a dutiful butler in the mid-2oth century: before reading it, i didn't think a perfect novel was possible. so bezos might not like to hear that author kazuo ishiguro has told capital that his 2005 dystopian novel never let me go has recently overtaken the remains of the day in sales. mackenzie bezos once posted a scathing one-star amazon review of bezos biographer brad stone's book the everything store, in which he claimed the remains of the day inspired bezos to create amazon. it isn't true, she wrote. jeff didn't read the remains of the day until a year after he started amazon. halcyon days!
dr. anthony fauci told americans on thursday to brace for more infections and deaths from covid-19.\n\nwe believe things will get worse as we get into january, fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, told npr in an interview. he called for an acceleration in public-health measures during this time.\n\nthe winter season and cold weather forcing people to socialize and work indoors, as well as travel and family gatherings associated with the holiday season, will likely amount to a terrible situation in january, the veteran immunologist said as the global covid-19 death toll exceeded 1.9 million.\n\nwe want to get it to 1 million vaccinations per day, he added. the idea about having everyone for at least 100 days — at least — wear a mask. everyone uniformly, so we don't have disparities where some people are adhering to public-health measures, and others are not.\n\nas of thursday morning, 5.9 million people in the u.s. had received their first vaccine dose and 21.4 million doses had been distributed in total, according to the cdc.\n\nand then also a greater interaction, cooperation between the federal government and the states, instead of letting the states in some respects do things on their own — to help them not only with plans, but with resources, fauci added in the interview.\n\nhowever, fauci noted that people have covid-19 fatigue and a national lockdown is not feasible. i don't think this is something that we're ready for on a countrywide basis. but, you know, you have to keep your eye on everything that's going on and always keep all options open.\n\nas the months go by, i would expect by the time we get to april, it will be what we call open season on vaccines, he added. everyone will be able to get a vaccine. so i think by the end of the summer, if we get 70% to 85% of the population vaccinated and get a good herd immunity.\n\ndispatches from a pandemic:it's 2:30 a.m. in wyoming: 'you're holding a smartphone to let a husband say goodbye to his wife via facetime after 60 years of marriage'\n\nfauci has previously warned that americans are facing a dark time and the potential surge over the holidays could lead to a dark january, this may be even more compounded because it's a longer holiday, he told cnn last month. infections have exceeded 89.2 million worldwide.\n\nthe u.s. set a record for covid-19-related hospitalizations this month with more than 131,889 patients, and the number of people with the virus in icus has surpassed 23,866. the u.s. had 21.9 million cases and 369,830 fatalities as of saturday, according to johns hopkins university.\n\nthe u.s. lost at least 4,111 lives on thursday from covid-19, the most in a 24-hour period since the start of the pandemic, according to a new york times tracker, and reported a record 280,028 new cases. those do not, for the most part, include those who are asymptomatic.\n\npfizer pfe, -0.11% and german partner biontech se bntx, -1.33% have said that a final analysis of their vaccine candidate showed 95% efficacy. meanwhile, moderna mrna, -5.43% said its vaccine candidate was about 94% effective.\n\non friday, biontech and pfizer said an in vitro study found that their covid-19 vaccine neutralizes the two new highly infectious variants that have emerged in the u.k. and south africa. the results were published on the preprint service biorxiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed.
some things always seem to signal the change from winter to spring. the first crocus. the sound of birds chirping. turning the clocks ahead an hour.\n\non sunday, march 10, at 2 a.m., people in most areas of the u.s. will turn their clocks ahead one hour to daylight-saving (not savings) time.\n\nyou may have already noticed that it's staying lighter later, thanks to the normal course of the earth's movements in relation to the sun, but daylight-saving time turbocharges this process. of course, no daylight is actually being saved. we're just moving an hour of daylight to later in the day — so, for example, on march 10 when the clock reads 6 p.m., it will look pretty much as bright as it was at 5 p.m. the day before. by the time june is here, we'll be able to enjoy the twilight well into the evening.\n\nah, summer. getty images/istockphoto\n\nnot everyone participates in this temporal engineering. a handful of u.s. states and territories, including most of arizona, hawaii, american samoa, guam, puerto rico and the virgin islands, stick to standard time, notes timeanddate.com.\n\nmany people welcome the tradition of springing forward. it means an extra hour of daylight in the evenings, and signals the approach of spring and summer. so what's the problem?\n\nwell, some people complain about the lost hour of sleep (although they'll probably be back on their game within a day or so), as well as the dark mornings for early-bird commuters. and be careful: some studies show there's an uptick in morning car accidents after the switch because people aren't used to traveling in the darkness. it might even be bad for your marriage.\n\nread: 5 ways life would be better if we remained on daylight time forever\n\nhaters can start counting down the days until we (in the u.s.) turn our clocks back an hour and fall back to standard time on the first sunday in november.\n\ntake note: in europe, daylight-saving time doesn't begin until the last sunday in march (march 31 this year), and asia, for the most part, doesn't get involved.\n\nso even though we still have a few weeks to go until it's officially spring, and in much of the country a lot longer until it actually feels like spring, celebrating daylight-saving time is a first step.\n\n(this story has been updated because this occurs yearly.)
stormy daniels takes manhattan.\n\nthe adult-film star, director and author of the 2018 memoir, full disclosure, kicked off the first leg of her nationwide storytelling tour, an intimate evening with stormy daniels, on tuesday evening at stand up ny, a small comedy club on manhattan's upper west side. she talked about her life and answered audience questions about topics ranging from donald trump, his former personal attorney michael cohen and her former lawyer michael avenatti.\n\n 'now i've turned 40, i only want three things from a man: good wi-fi, a good credit score and good parking.'  — —stormy daniels\n\ndaniels has simple requirements for the next man in her life. now that i'm 40, she said, i only want three things from a man: good wi-fi, a good credit score and good parking. daniels, a single mother who reportedly charges $10,000 per appearance, is not alone in wanting a partner who is financially secure and can also demonstrate that he can manage his own finances.\n\nmore than 40% of adults say knowing someone's credit score would make them think twice about dating that person. women were nearly three times as likely to consider credit score a major influence on a potential partner compared to men (20% versus 7%). credit scores also reveal an individual's relationship skill, trustworthiness and level of commitment, a 2015 paper by researchers at ucla, the brookings institution and federal reserve board, washington, d.c.\n\nthe audience wrote questions on cards for daniels to answer. one person asked if there was any chemistry between her and her former lawyer, michael avenatti, who has been charged in a 36-count federal indictment alleging he stole millions of dollars from clients, did not pay his taxes, committed bank fraud and lied in bankruptcy proceedings. (avenatti, 48, pleaded not guilty.) she said no. i was never in a room with him alone, daniels said, adding, he thought he was prettier.\n\nstormy daniels at stand up ny on manhattan's upper west side.\n\nalso see:when wives earn more than their husbands, their marriage is less likely to last\n\nher life has changed since the wall street journal revealed in january 2018 that cohen paid daniels $130,000 in october 2016, a month before the u.s. presidential election, to stop her from talking about her alleged affair with trump. cohen started a three-year sentence on monday for tax evasion, making false statements to a bank and campaign-finance violations related to those hush-money payments. she was delighted that the man who arranged those payments is now in jail.\n\n on her former lawyer michael avenatti: 'i was never in a room with him alone. he thought he was prettier.'  — —stormy daniels\n\ndaniels said the sex scandal that propelled her into the spotlight has no relationship to #metoo. she has always made clear that her alleged affair was consensual, but said the movement has made dating more fraught for men. i have to buy my own drinks now. people approach me less, probably because i have a very large man standing next to me, she said, citing her security detail. but she has no beef with men, in general. i don't think men are monsters, daniels said.\n\nshe allegedly hooked up with trump in a hotel room in 2006 after a celebrity golf tournament. she made it clear that she is not a fan of the president, or of his administration's policies, and said she hopes he's not re-elected. daniels read a question from an audience member that asked if she would apologize to first lady melania trump for her alleged fling with the married trump 13 years ago. daniels replied, i'll apologize to her when she apologizes to the country.
dear moneyologist,\n\nafter years of my wife having numerous affairs, i had one of my own which resulted in twins. their mother and i came to an agreement on child support amicably, which is about 40% more than what would have been ordered by the local courts. this has allowed her and the children to move significantly closer to where i live, so i am able to be a part of their lives.\n\nmy wife and i have decided to divorce. i know our assets will be split and since she only recently rejoined the workforce, i will have to pay alimony. my question is how the alimony will be calculated. will the courts take into account the actual amount of child support i pay or only what the court calculates is appropriate?\n\nworried father in california\n\ndear worried,\n\ncalifornia is a no-fault state, meaning that you can get divorced for pretty much any reason you want. irreconcilable differences is commonly listed on a divorce petition in california. another reason: incurable insanity. in such a case, let's assume that you would be listing your spouse's incurable insanity and not your own. in other words, you might have one affair or a dozen, but a no-fault divorce means a faster and easier divorce for both of you. the judge will only be concerned that the marriage is over, and he or she is unlikely to care who is at fault.\n\nyour divorce attorney should advise you to outline the payments you already make to support your children and will calculate what is fair and reasonable given both incomes and your current expenditure.\n\ndon't miss: my wife left me after two days of marriage — should i divorce her?\n\nand you're not the first couple who walked into divorce court after having multiple affairs. adultery is often a symptom rather than the cause of a breakdown in a relationship. around one in four married people will admit to having engaged in sexual infidelity, justin lehmiller, a purdue university psychologist and author of the psychology of human sexuality, told the wall street journal last year. it also shows that happy, faithful marriages are, at best, the norm and, at worst, at least possible.\n\nconsider yourself lucky. believe it or not, adultery is categorized as a felony in massachusetts, idaho, michigan, oklahoma and wisconsin, and a misdemeanor in several states (not california), although adulterers are rarely prosecuted in those states. so you're actually in a good place in regards to both your finances and your divorce.\n\na married person who has sexual intercourse with a person not his spouse or an unmarried person who has sexual intercourse with a married person shall be guilty of adultery and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than three years or in jail for not more than two years or by a fine of not more than $500.\n\nthat's the law in massachusetts and it's not as extreme as the penalties listed in the old testament, which states they shall both of them shall die.\n\non that note, good luck with the divorce.\n\n(this story was republished.)
happy friday, marketwatchers! here are some of friday's top stories to read over the weekend.\n\npersonal finance\n\nnearly half of women who have abortions live below the federal poverty level\n\nas missouri, georgia and alabama move to restrict abortion access, the cost can vary by state, trimester, procedure and other factors.\n\n\n\nstudent-loan borrowers are using their vacation days to pay off their debt\n\nthis new employee benefit lets workers trade in their paid time off.
tokyo—taiwanese electronics assembler foxconn technology group and sharp corp. scrambled to salvage their proposed marriage as investors questioned whether the companies could restore trust in each other after an 11th-hour breakdown in takeover talks.\n\non friday, as sharp's shares 6753, -0.86% plunged, chief executive kozo takahashi flew to shenzhen, china, to meet foxconn chairman terry gou, according to people familiar with the situation.
some people treat being single like a bad smell that won't go away. they think it's a recipe for a lifetime of misery. and were a person to be so bold as to be happy and single, balancing the two with the kind of aplomb only seen by a unicycle-riding circus juggler, they'd have science to contend with, in the form of a broad swath of studies that appear to prove that married people are happier.\n\nthe problem: those studies are flawed — at least according to bella depaulo, the author of singled out and a project scientist at university of california, santa barbara, who by her own description has been single all my life, and i always loved it. she found that the way researchers study single people puts all divorced people into the single people category.\n\nnowadays, singledom is more widespread than ever before: the number of never-married people has only been growing over the years, and young people today are taking longer to marry, and a record percentage — 25% — may never marry, according to the pew research center, a washington, d.c.-based nonprofit think tank.\n\nbut because that lumps people whose relationships ended presumably because they weren't happy, the results grossly misrepresented the actual story, depaulo said, making married people look better and single people look worse. in the long term, married couples — though there was a short-lived honeymoon effect right after they got hitched — weren't any happier on average years into marriage than they had been when single, depaulo found.\n\ndon't miss:10 things married couples won't tell you\n\nsingle people are also more connected to other people than married people, have more friends and value meaningful work more. even if you could employ the gold standard of scientific research to study this subject, randomly assigning married or single life to people, depaulo said she believes it would be impossible to examine objectively. that's because of what she calls singlism and matrimania — the narrative favoring wedded bliss over perceived sad singledom.\n\nthough happily single herself, depaulo doesn't think everyone else needs to be single to be happy — but that's true of married or partnered people too, she said. embracing this idea, though, renders all the research about marrieds and singles alike meaningless, she said. at best, the quest for a universal truth about partnership will only capture the average experience. science will never tell you that marriage is the right decision, or that walking down the aisle was a horrible mistake.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy fiancé — or should i say eternal fiancé because he never wants to get married — recently shocked me when he flatly stated that he wants me off the mortgage and deed to our newly purchased waterfront home. we have lived there for a year and pay 50/50 on everything. he didn't want to debate or talk about buying me out, he was more insistent and will not budge.\n\nthis happened following a conversation i instigated and in which i suggested we see an attorney to have a will drawn up, in case one of us passes away. the house is appreciating in value daily due to its location (it's worth $50,000 more already) and he wants his children to inherit it. he wants me to pay rent, which essentially leaves nothing for my children.\n\n 'i moved from another state and sold my beautiful home to be with this man. he sacrificed nothing.' \n\ni didn't want out prior to the conversation. i still love him, but i wanted to live a committed life where we were building a future together living in the same home. i feel like it is a slap in the face. i am shocked and brokenhearted and he is making me feel that i am making it all about me. i already gave up my dream of marriage.\n\nhe said that if i don't want to pay rent, we can live in separate houses and continue to date eternally, which to me sounds completely like a huge step backwards. i am a hard-working person with a very good credit rating, and i always pay my half of the mortgage a month in advance. he thinks i am unreasonable.\n\ni moved from another state and sold my beautiful home to be with this man. he sacrificed nothing. if i buy my own home, i doubt if he would stay overnight at my home. i just feel that his decision was influenced by money. i hate the way he is making me feel emotionally unstable and insecure because i disagree with him.\n\nwhat should i do now?\n\nfiancée\n\ndear fiancée,\n\nasking you to both quit-claim your share of the property to your boyfriend and take yourself off the mortgage — assuming the bank would even allow that, which is far from a given — is unreasonable. using a wedding ring and your clear desire to get married as leverage is despicable.\n\ni disagree with you on one salient point: not getting married to this man after such a long engagement would be a huge step forward, as long as you take one more leap forward to freedom, with exactly 50% of this home that you purchased together.\n\n let me introduce you to the sunk cost fallacy. \n\nlet me introduce you to the sunk cost fallacy: you spend an hour waiting for a bus so you wait another hour rather than taking a taxi. or you sink $100,000 into a bad investment so you spend another $100,000 to keep it afloat because otherwise that first $100,000 would be wasted.\n\nthis is the dilemma you face with your fiancé. let's start with dropping the term. it doesn't mean anything, except the promise of something happening that has not happened and is unlikely to happen and, i hope, with the right support, you agree would be a disaster for you if it did happen.\n\nif this is how he treats you and your relationship now, imagine how he would treat you if you signed over your half of the house? imagine how he would treat you if you did get married, heaven forbid. a girlfriend or wife who pays rent on a home she used to co-own?\n\nwhatever social contract you signed up to by becoming engaged has now been broken by his indecent proposal. if this house is rising in value, i suggest you both rent it out, live separately, and show him that what he thinks you want you don't want anymore. or else sell the home.\n\n whatever social contract you have signed has been broken. \n\ndid he need you to co-sign this mortgage, or is this just a random change of heart? either way, stop calling him your fiancé for the purposes of this dilemma, and just view him as another human being who is offering you a bad deal, and using emotion to get it over the line.\n\nif he tries to woo you back, remember this is who he is. people don't change. a partner who would make such a suggestion won't change who he is, he will merely put up a different type of wallpaper and move the furniture around to make you think everything is shiny and new.\n\nyou stayed with this man not because you wasted years but because it took the amount of time it took to learn what it was you were supposed to learn from this experience. among the lessons: you deserve a good relationship, and you are able to face life on your own.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. letters to the moneyist will appear anonymously, and the letter writer give. the moneyist cannot give personal responses.\n\nthe moneyist:when my parents died, my sisters and i split their estate. i chose a painting that may be worth $50,000. should i tell them?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
in financial services, when most people talk about retirement planning it's about the numbers — saving, investing, preparing an income plan and a budget.\n\nperhaps it's assumed that if you hit the magic age of retirement with the magic number in your portfolio, all will be great. the truth is that it's only a lucky few who bounce happily from one phase of life — their working years — to retirement without some feelings of displacement, loss or confusion. from my experience, it can be harder for men than women, so it's important to think about their emotional and social readiness with the same focus applied to building a financial plan.\n\nwho are you?\n\nask yourself, what identifies you today? how important is that career to your sense of belonging in the world? i had a long stage of life where my identity was completely wrapped up in getting ahead — at an ivy league school, at work in a big investment company. but karma intervened, and life got complicated with marriage, children, some family illnesses and i had to step out of my comfort zone and, as they say, get a life.\n\nthis force from singular focus to multi-focus seems to happen to women naturally, even if they stay on a corporate track. i think of it as having a complex identity of piece parts — business leader, mom, wife, daughter, room parent, book club member, etc. while life gets crazy, i'm accustomed to switching from one self to another, and the process has given me a wide social network and a varied set of interests.\n\nthe challenge for the sexes\n\nthese connections are one reason that in my house, and among my friends, it's the wife's role to manage the family social life. as couples move into their 50s and begin thinking about retirement, this imbalance of connections is something that can cause big problems ahead. according to a 2015 pew research study, not only has the divorce rate among people over 50 doubled since 1990, over 66% of those divorces are initiated by the wives. women are not only more financially independent, they have the support network making the single life look attractive.\n\nin 2016, fidelity did a study of over 9,000 people ages 55+ and found that 60% of men looked forward to spending more time with their spouses in retirement, versus 43% of women. men tend to have fewer social ties than women and are more emotionally dependent on their spouses. this may not be true of the next generation, as social norms are changing, but it's something that is worth attention for any couple who have retirement on their minds.\n\nwomen can carry over parts of their identity and amplify them in retirement more easily than men. a different financial services study by tiaa in 2016 found that caregiving, socializing and community service expanded to take the place of paid work when women retired, and they continued to identify as contributing to the world. men, whether married or not, tended to perceive retirement as a reward and they filled their time with sports and were more inclined to stay engaged in some aspects of their career. unfortunately over time physical limitations may affect the sports plan, and work ties can fade, so men need to consciously expand their horizons.\n\nyour social and emotional plan\n\nas i work with clients, i talk about their values and priorities as much or more than their portfolios, and these discussions can help them as individuals or couples prepare for a satisfying retirement life. i also uncover their emotions about money itself — and find for some people the mere thought of spending their wealth, rather than earning more money, creates anxiety. ideally, we are having these conversations for many years before retirement, and they are continuing afterward to support them in their experience.\n\nif you have even a few years to ready yourself for retirement, here are three important considerations and ideas for action plans to improve your transition:\n\n1. who are your most important relationships over the course of your life, and what can you do to nurture them?\n\n2. what are your hobbies or activities you haven't tried that could interest you, and how could those become social networks?\n\n3. how do you define the idea of giving back and how could that be translated to a goal in retirement?\n\naction for a happier retirement\n\nthe success of any plan depends on how well it's executed, so it helps to create specific objectives and consider how well you're meeting these objectives. instead of a portfolio performance review, think about this as creating an index for personal retirement life readiness.\n\nquite often, male and female clients who have led extremely busy lives will be wistful about old friendships and lost connections, but in the age of social media reconnecting can be easy. making a list, reaching out, going to reunions and committing to entertaining more often are just come examples of action plans to reignite relationships. family ties can be improved, too. now is the time to invest in people you love.\n\nwomen have a knack for making even solo hobbies like knitting a social event, but men often need to do more work in this area. i know golfers who after 18 holes still can't describe what they really talked about with their partners. being more conscious about conversations is a first step. learning to be what i call a joiner is another action item — simply sign up and show up for group activities whether it's a yoga class or bird watching.\n\nmany retirees use some form of part-time work to ease the transition, but that's a deferral, not a long-term solution. for people with ongoing board positions and charity work, there's a ready-to-go way to continue to give back when their careers end. for other people, giving back can mean stepping up to larger caregiving roles within the extended family as grandparents. the point is, having a purpose beyond yourself is important for engagement and self-esteem, and the earlier you start developing these interests — the better.\n\nenjoy a richer life\n\nmen, women and couples who prepare themselves socially and emotionally as well as financially can enjoy a rich life in retirement. spouses who've addressed their desired balance of sharing and independence, who are clear on their priorities individually and together, often find the best years of marriage ahead of them. advisers who work with clients to think of this broader definition of richness, beyond the money, will find that the years before and during retirement are when clients need them most.\n\nso, don't be satisfied with a plan that's just about saving for retirement. get in touch with your social and emotional needs to ensure a life worth saving for.\n\nyolanda taylor is managing director at

cameron huddleston, author of mom and dad, we need to talk: how to have essential conversations with your parents about their finances, remembers the birds-and-the-bees talk she had as a child with her mother. huddleston says she'd give her mom a d at best because the talk was a single sentence saying that a man and woman lie together and make love.\n\nsadly, huddleston says, many of us in our 50s and 60s are having the same kind of unhelpful talk with our parents about their finances. she notes in her book that a gobankingrates survey found that 73% of adults haven't had detailed conversations with their parents about their finances. and that, the award-winning personal finance journalist maintains, is a giant problem for both generations.\n\ni interviewed huddleston to find out why, how boomers and gen xers can initiate these conversations; what to do if your parent refuses to talk about money, estate planning or end-of-life planning and what she wishes she'd done differently helping her mother with her finances. excerpts:\n\nnext avenue: why did you write this book and who is it for?\n\ncameron huddleston: i wrote this book because of my experience with my mother. when i was 35 and she was 65, she was diagnosed with alzheimer's. i had not had a detailed conversation with her about her finances.\n\nwhen she was 60, i had had a conversation with her about long-term care insurance and said she should look into it. she had been divorced awhile and was living on her own and i knew if she needed care, a long-term care policy would help. unfortunately, she couldn't get coverage because of a pre-existing health condition — not dementia. that would've been the perfect opportunity to have another conversation about her finances. it never crossed my mind.\n\na few years later, when she started having signs of memory loss, i knew i had to meet quickly with her attorney to update her will and to get power of attorney. i knew she had to be mentally competent to sign them and without them i wouldn't have been able to step in to make health care and financial decisions for her. she was still competent enough, so she did.\n\nthat experience led me to writing this book. as i got more involved with my mom's finances, my friends started finding themselves in similar positions with their parents. they came to me asking how to have 'the conversation.' i realized no one should have to go through this alone. i wanted to help them figure this out, so i wrote the book.\n\nand what about your father?\n\nhe died at 61 without a will and in a second marriage.\n\nwere you surprised by that gobankingrates survey showing that most adults haven't had detailed conversations with their parents about finances?\n\nit's stunning, but it doesn't surprise me entirely from my own experience. i was a financial journalist and i didn't think about it!\n\nthat survey also found that 22% of adults don't think they should ever have this conversation because they think their parents' finances aren't any of their business. i can understand the reluctance. but that 22% who think their parents' finances are none of their business don't realize there's a good chance that their parents' finances will be their business at some point.\n\nalso see: have you started saving for your parents' old age?\n\nit's better to have a plan and those legal documents in place and to have a discussion before an emergency arises.\n\nwhy does it matter whether adult children talk with their parents about the parents' finances? what happens if they don't?\n\nif the parents don't have a will or an advance health care directive and haven't given their child power of attorney, then if they are no longer mentally competent — maybe due to dementia or a stroke or a car accident — the child can't step in and make financial and health decisions. the child would then have to go through a lengthy and expensive court process to be named a conservator or guardian of the parents.\n\nin my book, i write about someone who spent thousands of dollars and nine months to become the dad's conservator. he had to pay his father's medical bills himself until he had access to his dad's bank account to get reimbursed.\n\npeople don't realize that if mom has a stroke and the hospital transfers her to a nursing home, if you don't have access to her bank account, you can't sign the checks for her unless she signed over power of attorney.\n\nwhat are the other types of conversations adult children need to have with their parents?\n\nit could be that your parents didn't save enough for retirement. you may need to encourage them to move somewhere smaller, more manageable and more affordable.\n\nor they may not be doing a good job managing their finances. i'm not saying it's your job to step in and tell them what to do. but if you see that their mismanagement of finances will affect you, it could be to your benefit to try to have conversations to offer suggestions to get them back on track so they don't jeopardize your financial well-being.\n\nhow hard do you think it is for people in their 50s and 60s to talk with their parents about their parents' finances?\n\ni think people make these conversations in their minds to be more difficult than they're actually going to be.\n\ncertainly, some parents will resist having them. but i would say a majority of parents will come around if you let them know that you want to have the conversation because you're looking out for their best interest.\n\nif they say: 'it's none of your business,' you can respectfully respond: 'it could be some of my business one day if you ever need my help. and as your child, i want to be able to help you. i want to care for you in the same way you cared for me when i was growing up. i feel i owe it to you.'\n\ndon't miss: inheriting a parent's ira or 401(k)? here's how the secure act could create a disaster\n\ni think when most parents hear that, they will open up. hopefully.\n\nsome parents think their kids are asking about a will because the kids are out for their money.\n\nyes. they may think that. say: 'i don't care what i'll be getting. i just want to know that you have put your financial wishes in writing so we can do what you want. because if you don't have a will, the state has one for you, and the people who will get your assets may not be the ones you want to get them.'\n\nsome of us fear that if our parents resist talking about these things when we first bring them up, they never will. what do you say?\n\ndon't give up if your parents resist the first time. keep trying. it doesn't mean you need to nag your parents every time you see them. but look for opportunities to have the conversations. if they complain how difficult it is for them to take care of the house, that's an opening for a conversation saying that it might be easier to move into an apartment or a retirement community.\n\nwhat do you think adult children do wrong when it comes to having the talk?\n\none of the biggest mistakes people tend to make in their 50s or 60s is they tend to be condescending when talking to their parents. if you approach the conversation from the point of view that 'i know more about these things and i see you making mistakes and i'm going to point them out,' that just embarrasses a parent and puts them on the defensive and they shut down.\n\ni wouldn't point out that your parents are making mistakes. put yourself in your parent's shoes and consider how you want your own children talking to you. you need to be respectful.\n\nand you don't want to give parents ultimatums, like: 'mom, dad, if you don't tell me details of your finances, i won't take care of you if you need it.' that's not going to work. they're going to say: 'fine, i don't need your help.'\n\nwhat are some of the most important topics for the adult children and their parents to talk about and why?\n\nwhether your parent has estate planning documents like an advance directive and power of attorney, and where. they're essential.\n\nif they don't have these documents, you want to be sure they meet with an attorney or you can go online for a low cost and get the documents in place.\n\nwhat else?\n\nyou want to try to find out how they pay the bills. so if something were to happen, how can we all make sure your bills will get paid? are they set up automatically or do you write a check?\n\nand then you might say: 'i would like to help you set up automatic bill paying and online banking.' i know some older adults can be reluctant and see this as risky, but explain that it's a safeguard and they can check on these bills every day.\n\nand then, if they're willing, get as many details as possible about what type of insurance policies they have and their sources of income and their debts. you can ask them to write it down for you with a list of their accounts.\n\nyou can say: 'i'd love to know your username and password for these accounts, so i can access them in case of an emergency.' they may not want to tell you, but they may be willing to write this down.\n\nwhat's your advice about doing these kinds of things if you have siblings?\n\nideally, you should talk with your siblings before you have conversations with your parents. you want everyone to be on the same page and you don't want to exclude anyone. if you don't talk to your siblings about this, they might resent you for leaving them out.\n\ndecide what roles you can all play in the financial lives of your parents as they age. perhaps one who lives closer will be willing to provide more hands-on care while another might be in charge of the parents' finances. when you go to your parents, let them know. hopefully, this is going to lift a burden off them.\n\nit doesn't work in every family. some siblings don't get along or have different ideas about what's best for mom and dad. point out that it's not what we think is best for mom and dad, but to figure out what they want.\n\nand what do you do when your parent simply won't discuss any of this and won't give you power of attorney?\n\nyou can say: 'i understand.' then you can take one of two approaches.\n\none is saying: 'i understand you don't want to talk about finances now, but let's think about situations when you would be willing to share some information and you might need some help.' maybe it's when one parent has a health issue, if dad passes away and mom's left alone. ask them to identify those moments and write down situations when it might be ok to step in. help make that list and hang onto it. and then when the time comes, come back and say: 'we agreed we would talk.'\n\nor you can use a story. say: 'i understand you don't want to have this conversation now and we don't need to; everyone's health is good. but i have a friend whose mother was perfectly healthy and she started having issues with her memory and my friend realized if she didn't get her mother to meet with an attorney soon, it would be too late to step in and help her mom with finances as her memory worsened.'\n\nfor power of attorney, you could say: 'is there someone you are comfortable naming as power of attorney? i understand it feels like you are giving up control. but if you don't name someone you trust and something were to happen and you were no longer able to make financial decisions on your own, someone will have to make them for you. you'll want to be sure your bills are getting paid.'\n\nwhat about getting a third party involved?\n\nthat's a possibility. you could say: 'i recently updated my legal documents. maybe you want to meet with my attorney?'\n\nfinal thoughts?\n\nthese conversations can't wait. and as difficult as they might seem, the consequences of not having them can be far worse.
