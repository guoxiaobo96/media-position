the marriage of one of hollywood's most famous couples came crashing to an end, reportedly thanks in part to some clandestine work from a private investigator.\n\naccording to a page six report, angelina jolie filed for divorce from brad pitt after a detective she had hired found evidence of his infidelity, among other unseemly things (namely russian prostitutes and drugs). these allegations, now splashed across the internet, may be bad for brad, but for the professionals who investigate cases like these, the scandal could be great for business.\n\njolie is far from the first celebrity to enlist the help of a private investigator prior to a divorce, according to gil alba, president of the associated licensed detectives of new york state. in fact, he said, the majority of celebrities hire investigators in cases of suspected infidelity or pending divorce. highly publicized cases like these can also serve to draw attention to the investigation industry as a whole, which according to ibisworld was predicted to grow 2% last year, fueled by a rising divorce rate and increase in disposable income.\n\nthis level of publicity would drive people to hire investigators more often in situations like these, he said.\n\ncouples and money: creating successful financial relationships\n\ncases like brangelina's pique interest in investigative services for more than just scorned celebrities. tom ruskin, president of a firm that investigates highly publicized matrimonial cases, said they see a surge of requests from the average person after events like these.\n\nwe get a lot more calls when something like this happens because people who have been sitting on the sidelines wondering what to do about suspected infidelity think, 'ah-ha!' let me go speak to this private investigation firm, he said.\n\nhowever, the average person may not be able to pay for the same level of investigation that jolie might have enlisted. private investigators charge an average of around $50 an hour, but experienced firms can cost customers hundreds per hour, and many cases require multiple people for surveillance work. for the rich and famous in particular, those steep prices are worth it, according to ruskin. celebrities have more to gain from hiring a private investigator than the most people, often working to avoid letting their personal issues play out in public. the more damaging information that is found in the private investigation, the more likely it is that the couple will settle out of court. this is particularly true in child custody battles, ruskin said. (jolie reportedly has asked for physical custody of the couple's six children in her divorce filing.)\n\nnormally the stories that are coming out now are most often leaked by someone either close to the party or part of the legal team of the party for the purpose of settlement, he said. the parties usually don't want to be dragged into court with the paparazzi outside and reporters digging deeper. they would rather try to settle with each other and find equitable custody arrangements for children and move on.\n\ninformation that could affect these arrangements include drug and alcohol use and other behavior that would affect the safety of children. upon breaking the news of the divorce, tmz reported that jolie was upset with pitt's parenting methods and consumption of marijuana, the divulging of which some characterized as a ruthless pr campaign and ploy to help her case. whether pitt's parental shortcomings are fact or a strategically leaked rumor, the barrage of coverage influences public opinion as the real battle likely continues behind closed doors.
drawing up the simplest of wills can often cost over $500, depending on where you live and the legal counsel you chose. more complicated ones can cost several thousand dollars.\n\ndoing a simple will online saves you money — it can even be free. but before you jump on board and make the low-cost purchase, ask yourself the following:\n\n1. is your family situation simple? online wills typically are good for a single person with few assets or a couple without children. more loved ones may mean more complications. estranged siblings, second marriages or young children requires specific language to counteract possible disagreements.\n\n2. are your financial affairs in order? if your assets are incorrectly titled or if your net worth is taxable at death in your state of residence, your situation may be too complicated for this approach. if your estate is taxable, more personalized documents can be designed to save taxes, leaving more money for your heirs.\n\n3. does your trusted person have the knowledge and skills to implement the directions in the will? executor is not a simple job. even with a simple will, there are details to handle and accounting to record.\n\nif you answered yes to these questions, an online service would cover your basic needs in not only a cost-effective but also efficient way.\n\nwhere to start? many of these low-cost services have been around for years, like nolo and legal zoom. find one that has good ratings from customers and the better business bureau.\n\nmost come with clear, understandable directions. they are written by a national team of lawyers including those qualified to write wills in your state. many even have lawyers on staff for questions. some offer monthly subscription services, which most people do not need, adding an unnecessary expense.\n\nthe hardest part for many is facing their own death and answering essential questions. the following are stumbling points:\n\nwho do i leave my assets to?\n\nwho will be my executor?\n\nis there some personal property i want to go to a specific person?\n\nwhat do i do want done with my online presence: social media, email accounts and websites?\n\nbecause of this challenge, some put it off or slow down the process — or stop all together. yet i continue to hear from people how good they feel once they do have a will done. they can carry on with their life and know their family and friends will have a plan in place.\n\ndon't forget these crucial steps\n\nas efficient as it may seem to do your will online, don't be misled by some sites that promise wills in less than 10 minutes. you may be able to fill in the information quickly, but there are more steps. downloading the documents, filling them in but never having them signed defeats the purpose.\n\nbefore you sign your will, review it a final time with the instructions in hand. you do not want to create a mistake where you leave out a child's name or vaguely say all my children. courts follow instructions and want details.\n\nthen have your will signed properly according to state law. depending on your state of residence, this probably means notarized with witnesses. give yourself a deadline. people who buy these products and then leave them sitting in a corner virtually or in their home office are wasting money.\n\nfinally, let your loved ones know where to find the will. if you have an old will, be sure to destroy it to prevent confusion.\n\ncongratulations, you are now one of just 42% of u.s. adults with a will.\n\ntwo cautions: if you intend to leave out one of your children for whatever reason, see a lawyer, as you need specific language to avoid a legal challenge. the same applies if you own property in another state. even if it is in joint ownership, estate tax implications vary as do state laws. owning property out of state is perfectly fine, but the added step of distributing property there may mean you need something more than a simple will from your state for estate purposes.\n\nas a single homeowner, the first will i did was filled out with an inexpensive online program. before i signed it, i made an appointment with a local lawyer, not a big firm. i owned my home and wanted my executor to have a trusted resource. because i had taken the time to thoughtfully complete the online document, the lawyer suggested only minor changes around wording to be more personalized. we did not need as much time together, and he was clear what i wanted.\n\nthe next time we met was to sign the documents. he even filed a copy with the court for me, which is an option in many states like vermont. now i knew the lawyer, myself, my executor and the court would have the information if something happened. and best of all, i saved his hourly billing because he did not draw up a whole will from scratch.\n\nwhat else?\n\nremember the will is only one piece of good estate planning. you need to have a financial power of attorney and health care directive legally in place, too. this are available online. each state has a standard form for health-care directives. power of attorney forms are often free online from the will services.\n\nin addition to signing all the legal documents, you should confirm the beneficiaries on your retirement accounts as they will receive your retirement funds, no matter what your will says. these beneficiaries can be changed at any time and supersede what your will says. investment and bank accounts can also be paid on death or transferred on death, avoiding the will and probate process through paperwork at your financial institution.\n\nopinion: how to make sure your spouse gets your retirement savings when you die\n\na will is still needed for personal property and whatever may have slipped through the cracks in your planning.\n\naway from your will, organize a list or easily accessible file with all the information someone would have to know if you died, from who to contact to where your money is. list the correct name on each account , what debts you have and who your employer is. other pieces of information you may include are who to contact, passwords and safe-deposit information.\n\nyour funeral wishes don't belong in a will. this document is often not found until after your memorial service.\n\nnever put your estate plan on autopilot, thinking once done, you are set for life. review it every five years. also, be aware of these triggers:\n\nas your assets grow, your estate plan should as well. your net worth impacts your taxable estate and perhaps your planning for distributing assets. changes in your personal life whether new marriage or a divorce means your will needs to be updated. a move to a new state where you are become a resident means it is time to create a new will for that state. wills are particular to the state. changes in federal estate laws are reason to review your will, as are changes in state law. for example, some current federal estate laws expire in 2026.\n\ncost-effective may not mean cost-efficient if you lose track of the will or do not keep it updated. because problems or issues are not discovered until after death, the outcome is costs, delays and strain on your heirs who are already grieving.\n\nread: skip these 'free' sources of financial advice — they will cost you dearly\n\ni have heard sad stories from relatives who meant well

the u.s. supreme court recently ruled in the important and much-anticipated case, bostock v. clayton county, georgia, that the lgbtq community is protected from employment discrimination.\n\nthe 6-3 ruling took many by surprise, in part because two conservative justices were in the majority, and one of them, justice neil gorsuch, wrote the majority opinion.\n\nin this transformative moment in u.s. history, when the public supports the recognition of fundamental human rights, including the right to marry the person of one's choice, the law appears to be catching up with society. and the u.s. supreme court has decided cases in ways that reflect social realities.\n\nthe principles of equality and nondiscrimination are at the heart of american democratic tradition. as a public law scholar, i believe the bold decision in bostock is consistent with a historic pattern of some justices defying expectations when faced with a major social transformation.\n\ninstead of ruling to maintain the discriminatory status quo, they have demonstrated their commitment to these basic values of democracy by addressing historic injustices.\n\ndisappointed presidents\n\none classic example of a justice defying expectations to promote civil rights is chief justice earl warren, who was appointed by president dwight eisenhower and served on the court between 1953 and 1969.\n\nwarren arrived at the court as a republican with conservative credentials. he had been a proponent of president franklin d. roosevelt's decision to place japanese americans in concentration camps.\n\nbut as a supreme court justice, warren did not meet the expectation that he would bring a conservative viewpoint to decisions. instead, he championed civil rights as chief justice.\n\nin 1954, he wrote the landmark opinion in brown v. board of education, a unanimous decision which led to desegregation of public schools by overturning an 1896 precedent and rejecting the idea that separate but equal was constitutional. social science showing the psychic injury that racism causedwas crucial to this outcome.\n\nsome have speculated about warren and his unexpected shift. his sense of guilt over his active involvement in the japanese american incarceration was apparently influential. the notion among the legal community about warren's opinion in brown v. board of education is that the japanese americans paid the ransom to free the blacks.\n\nalthough eisenhower thought warren would be conservative in his judicial philosophy, that was hardly the case. in this and subsequent cases, what was called the warren court became synonymous with a series of rulings that expanded the scope of constitutional rights.\n\nwhen asked what he considered his most serious mistakes, eisenhower replied: they are both sitting on the court.\n\nhe was referring to justice warren and justice william brennan, a republican who had been on the new jersey supreme court and whom eisenhower appointed to the supreme court in 1956. both judges were more liberal in their judicial philosophy than anticipated.\n\nin these instances and others, presidents have been known to be disappointed by the decisions of those they appoint.\n\nunusual coalitions\n\nwhen justices are confronted with a new type of discrimination and are unconstrained by past precedent, they may have the ability to form coalitions on the court to advance civil rights. for instance, the advocacy campaign against sexual harassment outside of the court, aimed at addressing egregious misconduct in the workplace, appears to have exerted influence inside the court.\n\neven though women had experienced sexual harassment for centuries, no one had even coined a term for the phenomenon until the 1970s, when the federal government began to formulate new policies.\n\npolicy makers recognized that sexual harassment was illegal when it took the form of coercing employees to perform sexual acts in exchange for rewards or to avoid losing their jobs or work-related benefits.\n\nsubsequently, the equal employment opportunity commission, the federal agency with responsibility for dealing with employment discrimination, was inundated with complaints.\n\nwhen the supreme court first considered this issue in meritor v. vinson in 1986, the notion was barely a decade old. moreover, the central question was a novel one, whether an employee could sue for a different type of sexual harassment, a so-called hostile work environment.\n\nin a 9-0 decision written by chief justice william rehnquist — who was appointed by president richard nixon and elevated to chief justice by president ronald reagan — the court unanimously ruled that the protections in federal civil rights law did cover this type of sexual harassment.\n\nthe meritor ruling, despite criticism of its treatment of relevant evidence and employer liability standards, was hailed as a victory for advocates of civil rights.\n\nas with bostock, the ruling in the meritor decision was surprising. conservative justices had taken a liberal position and joined liberal justices in an effort to combat egregious misconduct in the workplace. they did this by expanding the scope of discrimination on the basis of sex with the new and more expansive interpretation of sexual harassment.\n\nsame-sex marriage\n\nanother remarkable social change in american society is the recognition of same-sex marriage, known as marriage equality. litigation began over this issue in the late 20th century with baehr v. lewin (1993), in which the hawaii supreme court held that the failure of a clerk to issue marriage licenses to a same-sex couple was a form of sex discrimination.\n\nas the human rights campaign, lambda legal and other public interest organizations mounted campaigns advocating for same-sex marriage, public attitudes gradually shifted in favor of official recognition of customary marriages of same-sex couples.\n\nthis social movement culminated in the landmark u.s. supreme court decision obergefell v. hodges in 2015. acknowledging that the u.s. had undergone a significant social transformation in accepting diverse types of intimate relationships, the court resolved to make the law match the times.\n\nthe 5-4 decision, which held that the right to marry is fundamental and guaranteed by the constitution, was authored by justice anthony kennedy. kennedy said he voted in favor of this position even though it did not correspond to his own catholic religious tenets.\n\nkennedy said he undertook writing the landmark opinion because of his religious beliefs: it seemed to me i couldn't hide, he told an interviewer. the nature of injustice is you can't see it in your own time, kennedy said. and as i thought about it more and more, it seemed to me just wrong under the constitution to say that over 100,000 adopted children of gay parents could not have their parents married.\n\nsocial upheaval creates new context\n\nin the midst of immense social upheaval, courts and individual justices grapple with rules that must be reassessed in a new context — so it seems less surprising that justices consider carefully the meaning of equality and sex discrimination in light of the changing times.\n\nthis set of examples suggests that it may be unwise to presume that judges will vote in particular ways because of their backgrounds or judicial philosophy. over the years, justices have felt the exigencies of the times that sometimes lead them to rule in ways that will protect the american constitutional order. chief justice john roberts, expected to be more ideologically conservative in his rulings, has been praised for his role in building consensus, his temperament and his fair-mindedness.\n\nwhile this certainly does not happen all the time, it may at least indicate that the u.s. political system can survive the ongoing crises of the 21st century associated with hyperpolarization. ideological considerations, while often important in judicial decision-making, do not necessarily provide a guide to future decisions.\n\nalison dundes renteln is a professor of political science, anthropology, public policy and law at the university of southern california's dornsife college of letters, arts and sciences in los angeles. this was first published by the conversation — when supreme court justices defy expectations.

i'm overwhelmed by student loan and credit card debt, and i'm embarrassed to admit it to my partner. should i come clean?\n\nsome secrets are harmless, like eating the last slice of your partner's favorite cake. or saying you're sick to avoid his aunt's retirement party.\n\nhiding thousands of dollars in debt does not fall into the harmless category. while having debt is just one piece of your identity, it could directly affect your partner also: maybe you're unable to contribute to joint savings or keep up with your share of the bills, or you'll have a harder time qualifying for a mortgage as a couple.\n\nthe debt might not come as a surprise if, say, your partner already knows about your lavish sneaker-buying habit. but the longer you wait to divulge the details of your financial stress, the more betrayed your beloved may feel when you eventually do it, says don cole, clinical director of the seattle-based gottman institute, which conducts research on relationships.\n\nit's better to be honest than to get caught, cole says. the relationship is going to be able to repair much better from a shared problem than one that's discovered.\n\neverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\ngather the facts\n\nfirst, nail down the specifics of the debt for yourself, says kelly luethje, a certified financial planner and founder of willow planning group in boston.\n\nunderstand your loans' and credit cards' outstanding balances, accompanying interest rates and payoff dates. that may help you gain some control, and it's also the first step toward developing a plan to get out of debt.\n\ntime it right\n\nconfessing your debt balance isn't first-date fodder. tell your partner the truth once the relationship gets serious, like by the time you've hit the six-month mark.\n\nat the very least, get everything out in the open before you decide to move in together. at that point, your debt will have an immediate financial impact on your partner. a credit card balance at the top of your credit limit means a lower credit score, for instance. and that could make getting an apartment together challenging.\n\nif you've been together for more than six months or you're already shacked up, don't panic. but prepare to spill the beans soon. cole explains it this way: after the fun and excitement of first falling in love, the next step is to make sure we can be our true selves with our partners.\n\nthat is an essential phase in developing a lifelong, happy relationship, he says. and it takes trust, which you can build only by being honest and transparent.\n\nbroach the subject gently\n\nask your partner to set aside time to talk. pick a weeknight rather than a friday or saturday, says w. bradford wilcox, director of the national marriage project at the university of virginia. he says weekends should be reserved for having fun, reconnecting and maintaining spontaneity, all of which strengthen long-term relationships.\n\ncole recommends starting the conversation with an i feel statement, followed by what you're concerned about and what you need next. the gottman institute calls this a softened start-up, and it lays a positive foundation for hard discussions. you might say, i worry about talking to you about money, but because i love you, i need to tell you about my finances.\n\nexplain the circumstances of your debt. are you spending beyond your means, or did you pay for school without any help from family? has your behavior changed since you first built up a credit card balance, or is spending still an issue?\n\nthen talk about how you plan to pay it off. work on eliminating credit card debt first, for example. credit cards generally have higher interest rates than student loans. and think of coming clean as a positive step.\n\ndebt is stressful, and it takes away future options for people, wilcox says. it robs you of a horizon, of the possibility to dream financially.\n\nhaving debt doesn't erase the fact that you're the world's greatest karaoke duet partner or banana bread baker. opening up about it and asking for encouragement to address it could bring you and your partner closer — and give you permission to dream.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
relationships and finances seem to intermingle no matter how hard you may try to separate the two. the truth is that not very many of us like to talk about finances, especially during the early stages of our relationships. you shouldn't avoid talking about finances though. your relationship can help build or ruin your credit score.\n\nthink about it, how much student debt do you have? nationwide, that number stands at an astounding $1.5 trillion. most of this debt is held by millennials who are now thinking about getting into serious long-term relationships and marrying. you or your partner can bring a whole lot of debt into a union. this will inevitably marry your finances as well as your romance.\n\nwhile you can have excellent credit as an individual with separate accounts, getting married to and cosigning loans with a partner who has bad credit or bad spending habits can eventually negatively impact your good credit. here are some common ways your relationships can affect your credit score:\n\ndating\n\nit's only natural that you want to impress your new partner during the dating phase. this means:\n\ngoing out to restaurants on dates\n\nsplurging on gifts for their birthday, christmas and so on\n\ngiving yourself a makeover to show them that you have style\n\nthere are other things that you may even do such as paying some of their bills to show that you are capable and are a provider or helping them out by cosigning on a loan. this can be a financial strain. also, if they default on the loan, you'll be responsible for it and your good credit will suffer. not to mention, if the relationship doesn't last, you'll end up deeper in debt.\n\nsee: all that money you spend on bad dates every year could pay one month's rent\n\nmarriage\n\nonce you get married, things get a little bit more complicated. the good news is that getting married doesn't affect your credit score. you and your spouse continue to have separate credit reports and scores.\n\nthe problems often come when you decide to apply jointly for a credit card or a loan because this is when both your credit scores are checked. if one of you has bad credit, then your joint application will either be denied or the interest rates you get will be higher based on your spouse's bad credit.\n\ndon't miss: do americans marry for love or money? finally, an answer\n\nadditionally, the mere fact that running a home can be expensive will in one way or another affect your credit especially if one of you is not as financially responsible. the history pertaining to any joint accounts you have appears on both yours and your spouse's credit reports. should that account become delinquent, both your credit scores go down.\n\ndivorce\n\nunfortunately, 40 – 50% of all marriages end in divorce. if you end up getting a divorce, your finances will be affected one way or another, even if your marriage ends on good terms. if you aren't careful, it could also negatively impact your credit score in the following ways:\n\nyou can't pay your bills on time. since you now only have one income, you may find that some of your bills don't get paid on time or at all because of your reduced financial capacity.\n\nsince you now only have one income, you may find that some of your bills don't get paid on time or at all because of your reduced financial capacity. you had shared accounts. joint accounts might go unpaid because the person responsible for them as determined by the judge doesn't pay it. as such, both your credit scores will suffer because at the time the account was opened, you're both responsible for it.\n\njoint accounts might go unpaid because the person responsible for them as determined by the judge doesn't pay it. as such, both your credit scores will suffer because at the time the account was opened, you're both responsible for it. you have a vindictive ex. if you have a nasty split and your ex decides to harm you financially, they could max out any shared credit cards and maybe even clean out your joint accounts, financially crippling you.\n\nsee: divorce after 50: what i wish i had known beforehand\n\nhow to protect your credit through a relationship\n\nit might seem like the logical thing to do to keep your finances separate from your partner and to avoid having any joint accounts. but you may not be able to do this, especially if you're married. there are several steps you can take to ensure that your finances don't suffer as a result of your relationships:\n\nhave a candid conversation with your partner about your financial habits.\n\nmaintain your financial discipline by managing money even through the dating phase. if you find that you can't do that, then find a new source of income to offset the increased spending.\n\nlet the spouse with the best credit score apply for loans and borrow money to get the better rates.\n\nyou can also decide to apply for joint accounts and pay higher interest rates with the aim of improving your spouse's credit score in the long run. you can refinance later for a better interest rate.\n\nideally, you should have a candid conversation with your partner. you both need to be honest with each other about your financial weaknesses, strengths and debt. once you have everything out in the open, you can come up with a plan to ensure that neither of you is making poor financial decisions.
i've never been wedding-crazy. i wasn't that little girl who fantasized about her wedding. the white dress, the church ceremony, the big reception — it just never appealed to me. i've been in a committed relationship for more than five years, and we're not married. we know we're meant to be together and have no reason to believe that getting married would make an emotional difference to us, but lately, i've been wondering what sort of financial benefits we are missing out on by not tying the knot. should i consider getting married because it's better financially?\n\nthere's no doubt there are financial benefits of getting married — and we're not just talking about wedding gifts. once you say i do, you are eligible for certain tax breaks and exemptions, and you may have access to other long-term benefits like a spousal ira or survivors benefits from social security.\n\nhere's the breakdown of the top benefits — and the unexpected pitfalls — of walking down the aisle.\n\nyour love nest is cheaper\n\nperhaps the most obvious benefit of getting married (unless you've previously cohabitated) is sharing living expenses.\n\none of the biggest financial benefits of getting married is the ability to share living expenses like housing, utilities and food without those expenses necessarily doubling, says liz davidson, founder and ceo of financial finesse and author of what your financial advisor isn't telling you: the 10 essential truths you need to know about your money.\n\nthe adage, opposites attract may also work out in your financial favor, davidson notes.\n\n[s]penders often marry savers, which can be a tremendous financial benefit for the spender if they are in a healthy relationship built on communication and mutual respect, she says. when a spender marries a saver, and they are able to find a healthy compromise in their habits that helps them to achieve their goals together, it's often the spender who has the most benefit because they often have a serious lack of savings and sometimes huge amounts of high interest rate credit card debt.\n\nwhy more men are going into debt for plastic surgery\n\na spender's habits can have lasting negative effects, like delayed retirement, financial stress, and health problems, she explains. a saver spouse can balance that out by encouraging the spender spouse to prioritize healthier financial habits — in effect, a saver sometimes 'saves' a spender from themselves!\n\nthis is something davidson employs in her own life.\n\ni write about this in my book, particularly about how my husband and i have differing money values — he values things like his antique car collection, whereas i prefer experiences like travel or a great meal, she says. but even though we're different, it doesn't mean we can't get on the same page and avoid money fights.\n\ngetting married may also give you access to better health insurance coverage than you could obtain if you were single, she says. for example, if you are a freelance writer and have to pay out of pocket for insurance, but your new spouse works for a major corporation, your health insurance could be much cheaper (hundreds less a month), and you could get perks like free prescriptions and lower (or no) copays.\n\ndoing your taxes just got a lot sexier\n\nfiling your taxes jointly is another marriage benefit. this could mean paying a lot less (or more) next tax season, depending on your new combined income.\n\nfor example, if you and your spouse are both high earners and file jointly, that could bump you into the next tax bracket, meaning a potentially hefty bill next tax season. but if one of you earns significantly less than the other and you file jointly, your combined income will be taxed in the middle, resulting in a lower tax bracket for the high earner.\n\nthe standard deduction allowed for married couples is also twice what it is for an individual. so, if you're married and filing jointly, the standard deduction is $12,600. if you were single, you could only claim $6,300. (this is if you choose not to file an itemized deduction.)\n\nalso, say hello to the unlimited marital deduction, which basically means you can transfer an unlimited amount of funds or property to your spouse without having to pay estate or gift taxes.\n\nso, if your husband or wife leaves you an inheritance of $100,000, you will receive the full amount. if you are gifted that amount by a non-spouse, you will have to pay the gift tax, which applies to all monetary gifts more than $14,000.\n\nmarried couples also get access to a pretty hefty home sale exclusion — to the tune of $500,000 — when they sell their primary residence for a gain, as long as they lived in the house for the two years immediately before the sale. this is nearly twice what singles get.\n\n[a] married couple can exclude up to $500,000 of a qualified gain, while a single person only gets a $250,000 exclusion, davidson explains. married people also enjoy double the exclusion of assets from the estate tax that single people have.\n\nbut there are some potential downsides to filing taxes once you're married, too.\n\nyou can receive a larger standard deduction, but remember that your incomes will now be combined. if each spouse earns $100,000 then you will have a household income of twice that amount, meaning your effective tax rate (and tax bracket) will likely go up, says brannon lambert, cfp® at canvasback wealth management, llc.\n\nbut being married may allow you to get some deductions you weren't eligible for previously, he notes.\n\nhowever, you may qualify for some deductions you didn't previously because you are combining expenses, he explains. medical expenses are one example. you can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10% of your adjusted gross income.\n\ndavidson also cites the possibility of an increased tax bill as a major con.\n\none of the bigger drawbacks is the way the income tax code is currently structured, she explains. the 'marriage penalty' is very real in terms of how the marginal income tax brackets work.\n\nbut this depends on your income.\n\nit definitely depends on your income — two people with higher incomes will experience the marriage penalty. the more unequal the partners' incomes are or the lower they both are, the less likely they will pay more in taxes as a married couple than as singles, davidson explains.\n\nliving happily ever after\n\nyour retirement may also get a boost. getting married gives you access to retirement savings options you may not have otherwise had, like a spousal ira.\n\nan individual is only able to contribute money [to an ira] to the extent he or she has earnings, but if you're married to someone who has earnings and you don't, you may still be eligible to contribute, davidson explains.\n\nkeep in mind getting married may actually prevent you from being able to open certain retirement accounts, like a roth ira.\n\ngetting married could have an impact on your ability to utilize accounts such as roth iras, davidson says, noting that if you were married and filing jointly and your modified adjusted gross income (magi) was more than $184,000 in 2016, you were not able to contribute to a roth ira.\n\nand once your spouse dies, being legally married will only help you.\n\nspouses do get a spousal benefit for pensions and social security which a non-spouse would not, says tana ackerly gildea, author of the graduate's guide to money. in the absence of a will, the spouse does have a claim to assets of the deceased spouse. the particulars vary by state so it's always better to have a will than not, she notes.\n\nincreased social security benefits are another plus. as a married person, you can take a social security payment of half of what your spouse gets, even if you are not entitled to that amount on your own; then survivor benefits when your spouse die can be as 100% of what your spouse's benefit.\n\nyou can roll over and combine their retirement assets with your own when your spouse dies, which can allow you to enjoy that tax-free growth for longer. (there are stricter rules governing withdrawals for non-spouses who are left retirement accounts.)\n\nthe irs allows the qualified retirement assets of one spouse to be rolled and combined into a retirement accounts of the survivor and take ownership as their own, lambert says. a nonspousal beneficiary has to begin required minimum distributions soon after they receive the inherited retirement assets.\n\nthe whole financial picture\n\nwhile there are many financial factors to consider, here's the truth of the matter: whether or not getting married is financially beneficial has less to do with the benefits afforded and more about the person you're actually marrying — and their financial health.\n\ni would never advise somebody to get married just because they may deem it to be financially beneficial, lambert says. you may live together for years and years like a married couple and you may even co-mingle finances, but marriage can have a funny effect on people.\n\nmaking finances a part of the conversation is also a must, lambert says.\n\nif you are thinking about getting married you must sit down with your partner and be completely open and honest about your past, present and future financially. i've seen situations where one person hides money issues from their partner until the wedding. they were afraid to tell their fiancé out of fear of being left. that is no reason to blind side your new bride or groom with a financial atomic bomb, he says.\n\nso is getting married the right financial choice?\n\nnot necessarily, and especially not for women. i think women still tend to put their careers more on the back burner in a marriage and when they have children than men do, gildea says. it is important for woman to keep their economic power whether they marry or don't and sometimes not marrying — at least for a while — keeps that a bit more in the forefront of their minds.
the bipartisan budget act, signed into law on nov. 2, 2015, effectively eliminated the file and suspend and restricted application strategies for anyone younger than 66 and 62, respectively. these unintended loopholes were the product of three legislative changes that allowed for creativity, flexibility and pay raises for those who were well-informed. as of may 1, the party is over. so what's the best way to adapt? here are a few strategies.\n\nstrategies that apply to everyone\n\n1. the do over.\n\naccording to the social security administration, 74% of beneficiaries collect early. i assure you at least some of these folks will regret their decision. the good news is if that regret comes within a year, you can pay back the benefits you've received in a lump sum, and you will be treated as if you never took them at all.\n\n2. voluntary suspension.\n\nin certain instances, it does make sense to turn on social security early. you may simply need supplemental income, or you may want to trigger benefits for a minor child. but it may not be a permanent need. if you decide for any reason that you no longer need that payment, you can suspend it. your benefit will start to earn delayed retirement credits until you are 70.\n\nmore young adults living with parents\n\nstrategies that apply to married couples if at least one spouse is 62 or older\n\n3. restricted application.\n\nthis loophole is being phased out by the bipartisan budget act of 2015. however, if you were born before jan. 1, 1954, you are still eligible to file for a restricted application when you reach full retirement age. this allows one spouse to collect a spousal benefit based on the other spouse's earnings record while spouse one's benefit continues to grow until age 70. at 70, spouse one will switch back to her increased benefit. in order to use this strategy, spouse two has to be collecting his benefit or have filed and suspended before may 1.\n\nstrategies that apply to married couples if both spouses are under 62\n\n4. higher earner delays, lower earner gets a raise.\n\nwhen married couples are planning for retirement, it is very important, if possible, for the higher-earning spouse to wait until age 70 to collect his or her benefit. not only will the higher benefit increase by 8% every year between full retirement age and 70, but the benefit will also become the survivor benefit should that person die before his or her spouse. depending on the gap in earned benefits and whether or not the lower earner is still working, it often makes sense for the lower earner to start collecting early. if the person is fully insured but not working, she or he can collect at 62. if the person is still working at 62, it probably makes sense to wait until she or he stops working or reaches full retirement age so that the earnings offset isn't a factor.\n\nstrategies for widows and widowers\n\n5. collect now, survivor later.\n\nif a surviving spouse had a significantly lower earned benefit than the decedent, he or she should collect the benefit at age 62. once the recipient hits full retirement age, he can switch over to the survivor benefit.\n\n6. survivor now, collect later.\n\nif a couple had similar records, it makes sense for the survivor to take the survivor benefit as early as possible, at age 60. his own earned benefit will continue to grow until age 70. at 70, the person will switch over to her earned benefit.\n\nstrategies to claim on your ex-spouse\n\n7. restricted application.\n\nthe rules for divorced couples are very similar to those for married couples, so long as the marriage lasted at least 10 years. the restricted application strategy described earlier can be used by only one spouse in a married couple. if you're teetering on the edge of divorce, this may get you there. if you are divorced, both you and your ex can claim a spousal benefit on each other while your own benefits grow in the background until you begin receiving them at age 70. it's essentially the restricted application times two.\n\nevery single one of these strategies has exceptions, and this is by no means a comprehensive list. until the most recent legislation, there were 567 different ways to collect social security. you should work with your financial planner to develop a customized claiming strategy. make sure that as you are putting together that strategy, the rest of your assets, liabilities, income and expenses are factored in. social security is an important piece of the puzzle but should never be considered in a silo.
more couples are choosing to advance their relationships with mortgages before marriage.\n\nthe number of unmarried young couples (between the ages of 24 and 35) buying homes has risen to 15% from 11% in 2005, according to research from real estate website zillow, an increase of 36%. many millennials face debilitating financial hurdles, such as student loan debt, that could delay homebuying, but first-time home buyers are still expected to drive existing-home sales this year. some millennials choose to continue living with their parents until they're ready to buy a home, and they're even skipping the starter home altogether for a bigger house.\n\ndon't miss:5 tips for buying your first home\n\nbut buying a home before you're married has its consequences. if both names are on the title and your relationship ends, one or both parties are still liable for paying the mortgage. the lender doesn't care if you break up later, said greg mcbride, chief financial analyst at personal finance website bankrate.com.\n\nhere's what to do before taking the plunge:\n\nmake a home 'prenup'\n\nthe basis of a prenup can expand beyond marriage. experts suggest unmarried couples draft a legal document with an attorney that describes the finances going into the home purchase, such as the way the down payment is split, and how future home repairs will be paid. without a co-ownership document, courts may not equally divide assets if the relationship were to dissolve and it wasn't explicitly clear who paid for what, stephanie hill, a managing member of law firm keystone legal in minneapolis, wrote in 2011.\n\nsee also: this millennial bought her first home — and her family offered her cash\n\nnobody wants to think about their relationship's demise, but exit strategies, as mcbride put it, are crucial for large purchases. unmarried couples buying a home together should discuss what happens to the house, how finances will be split and who gets what if they were to break up. courts are also not set up to help unwind property ownership for non-married couples as they would married ones, hill said. young couples who are in love and committed maybe aren't thinking about what if they got divorced or one dies, she said.\n\nchoose whose name goes on the contract\n\nthe title of the home can include one or both partners, so it may make more sense to have both names appear on the deed. when someone is sole owner of a home intended for a couple, all financial responsibilities for the home rely on him or her. there are two ways for both partners to be on the title, according to bankrate.com: http://www.bankrate.com/finance/real-estate/homebuying-tips-unmarried-couples.aspx they can be joint tenants, where they have equal shares of the home and if one partner dies, his or her share is automatically transferred to the other partner; or tenants in common, where both get shares of the home but if one were to die, that half would go to the deceased's heirs.\n\nbuild your credit scores together\n\nlenders' expectations of credit scores have jumped dramatically since 2000, making it difficult to get a good mortgage rate for those without pristine credit scores. in order to get a good rate for a mortgage loan, both parties should work toward building their credit scores together, such as paying credit card bills on time every month. if there are two borrowers applying for the home, lenders will choose the higher of the two scores to base its loan decisions on, terrazas said.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband wrote a new will when our relationship was in bad shape. i do not know what is in this will, but it's still current and in his brother's possession.\n\nthe good news: we are in a happier place now! however, i would like to write my own will. before i do that, i have a few questions:\n\nalso see: 'my husband's kids hate me and refused to come to our wedding, yet he is leaving them all his property.' how can i negotiate to secure my future?\n\n1. my husband is the beneficiary on my life-insurance policy. i would now like to split this 50/50 between him and my daughter. would i have to change the policy?\n\n2. i do not want him to sell any of the assets in my name so he can benefit from them, as i want to make sure they are secure for my daughter's future. can i specify this in my will?\n\n3. i would like to leave my 401(k) and ira accounts to my daughter and husband, splitting them 50/50. can i state this in my will too?\n\ncurious\n\ndear curious,\n\nmy answers to your questions:\n\n1. yes.\n\n2. talk to your estate lawyer about a trust for your daughter, should she still be a minor at the time of your death. make separate wills and keep them with your attorney; it's not a job for relatives.\n\n3. you need to change the beneficiary on the actual policies. under federal law, your husband will need to sign a waiver to relinquish his claim to your 401(k).\n\nalso see:as a baby boomer, i didn't grow up with this culture of entitlement — do i have to leave my estate to my children or spouse?\n\nlet me channel my inner dear abby. it drives some of this column's readers up the wall, but i just can't help myself, and this column is just as much about relationships as money. so bear with me: if you are in a happier place in your marriage and you wish to remain so and/or find higher, more stable ground as you move ahead with your lives, i do have some suggestions.\n\nbe transparent about your plans. if your husband discovers you changed the beneficiaries on your ira account, it may erode the trust you have built up in recent times. an erosion of your trust today can lead to an unraveling of your relationship and bank balance tomorrow. massachusetts is not a community property state, so if you split your assets would not necessarily be divided 50/50.\n\nrecommended: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nhow did you find out about his will? did he tell you? how did it make you feel when you discovered that? i'm glad you're in a happy or happier place, but i also implore you to question your motivations. while i agree that it's a good idea to make sure your daughter is looked after, i don't believe it's a good idea for you to do this unilaterally. it's time to discuss your end-of-life plans together.\n\nhaving such discussions about inheritance is good practice for you both. it also indicates that you are planning to spend your old age together. i wish you many more happy days.\n\nalso see: i discovered through ancestry.com that my biological father is someone else — can i claim an inheritance as his heir?\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
two chores that most people gladly put off: the first is writing a will—and the second is updating it to reflect changed circumstances. either way, it's crucial to name the right executors.\n\nregarding the first chore, my client roster includes recalcitrant individuals who've yet to write their wills. i regularly remind them how badly things could turn out if they fail to do so. for instance, their assets might wind up with individuals whom they never intended to benefit or they consider less deserving of their largess than others.\n\nregarding the second, i tell those who heed my homilies that costly and expensive events could occur if they neglect to update their wills to reflect changes in their lives. what changes? i cite events like moving to another state, entering into a marriage or ending one, significant increases or decreases in their net worth, or heirs that unexpectedly predecease them.\n\ni also exhort clients to think carefully when selecting or replacing executors — the persons who are the key figures in the settling of their estates. they're best served by individuals willing to take jobs that are potentially time-consuming and demanding. as for wannabe executors, i tell them to reflect on how badly things can end up if they make mistakes; more on that in a moment.\n\nbut let's start by going down the list of executors' duties. their first duty is to assemble and value all of the deceased's assets. executors have to ferret out records for bank accounts, brokerage accounts, tax-deferred retirement accounts and insurance policies, as well as other assets like real estate, art, jewelry and automobiles.\n\nbesides those chores, executors need to unearth information about debts, mortgages and tax records, and figure out if the person had safe-deposit boxes, made loans to family members or others, or made charitable pledges.\n\ntheir next responsibility: pay all bills and charges. executors typically turn to professionals for those tasks. the list might include the timely filing of the deceased's final income tax return, federal estate taxes, state inheritance taxes and the estate's income tax return, along with the payment of any taxes owed.\n\nwhen can executors distribute assets in accordance with wills? only after they've valued assets and paid bills. the executors' final responsibility: submit accountings to the courts (usually designated probate, but sometimes called orphan's or surrogate's) for everything they've done.\n\nthat's how the story usually ends. but many executors belatedly learn that their reliance on the counsel of attorneys, accountants and other professional advisers doesn't relieve them of responsibility for mistakes.\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nsuppose the irs says taxes remain unpaid or forms were filed late. the agency's stepford response is to bill the executors. after all, the law says they're personally responsible in those kinds of situations. the courts routinely uphold irs assessments of taxes, penalties and interest charges.\n\nthe need to obtain proper tax advice was made expensively clear to the son and daughter-in-law of henry lammerts, who owned a cadillac dealership in niagara falls, new york, and died in 1961—and who had designated them as his executors. on henry's death, his son took over leadership in settling the estate. while the son was under the impression that a tax return had to be filed for his father, he was unaware of the need to file an income tax return for the estate.\n\nthe son found out from his accountant that no return had been filed reporting income received by the estate. the filing was eventually made seven months after the due date and elicited an irs assessment that included a sizable late-filing penalty.\n\nthe executors argued that they were new at this sort of thing and had relied on their accountant and the estate's lawyer to do whatever was necessary. mirabile dictu, the accountant's and the lawyer's recollections significantly differed when they testified in court.\n\nthe accountant said there was nothing in his past services to the family to suggest that, on his own initiative, he would have to file an income tax return for the estate. similarly, the lawyer pointed out that neither of the executors had asked him for a rundown of the responsibilities attached to being an executor. consequently, the trial court's approval of the penalty was upheld by the second circuit court of appeals.\n\nsuppose, as is not uncommon, executors volunteered to serve without compensation and weren't heirs. would that persuade the courts to rule that executors who received nothing also owed nothing to the irs? put it this way: if i'm going to represent one of the two parties and i'm being compensated on a contingency basis, i'd want to represent the irs.\n\nthis article originally appeared on humble dollar. it has been reprinted with permission.\n\njulian block writes and practices law in larchmont, n.y., and was formerly with the irs as a special agent (criminal investigator). his previous blogs include taking shelter, for the record and the dreaded letter. follow julian on twitter @blockjulian.
jeff bezos built a world-changing e-commerce and technology empire with amazon, and now he says he's turning his time and energy to another realm where he can have a global impact: philanthropy.\n\nas he steps down as ceo of amazon amzn, +1.42% , he'll trade running a business where success is measured in the speed of delivery and outcomes are tabulated in earnings reports for a world where progress happens over years, not minutes, and targets and goals can be elusive.\n\ni'm super passionate about the impact i think these organizations can have, bezos wrote of his philanthropic ventures in an email to employees announcing his job switch.\n\nbezos, who was the world's highest-net-worth individual until elon musk displaced him earlier this year, had in the past been relatively quiet about how and whether he spends his money for the public good. in 2017, nearly 20 years after becoming a billionaire, he broke his silence and asked for ideas on how to spend his fortune on charitable giving.\n\nthe next year he and his then-wife, mackenzie scott, unveiled the day one fund, a $2 billion initiative to target homelessness and early childhood education. that pledge earned bezos his debut appearance on the list of america's top philanthropists. in 2020, his $10 billion pledge to start the bezos earth fund was the single largest philanthropic donation of the year. so far the fund has awarded about $791 million in grants.\n\nthis $791 million in donations is just the beginning of my $10 billion commitment to fund scientists, activists, ngos, and others, bezos wrote on instagram. we can all protect earth's future by taking bold action now.\n\nso what's the next bold action for bezos and his charitable giving? no one knows yet — and that's just one of several unanswered questions about the centibillionaire's philanthropy. here are 5 other questions worth asking:\n\nhow much will bezos spend on philanthropy and how fast?\n\nbezos is a notable exception among the mega-wealthy: he hasn't signed the giving pledge, the campaign created by warren buffett and bill gates to encourage billionaires to promise to give away the majority of their wealth during their lifetimes or in their wills. he's made no public declaration of his intentions in terms of the speed and scale of his giving.\n\nwhat people want to know is how much of his fortune will go to charity — will he commit to doing what the giving pledgers (including mackenzie scott) have done and promise at least half of their wealth to charity? chronicle of philanthropy editor stacy palmer told marketwatch in an email, referring to bezos's ex-wife. will he try to give most of his fortune while he is alive (that means a really fast pace if he is giving a lot of his wealth).\n\nbezos is used to thinking about how fast amazon can do things, and that skill will come in handy if he decides to embrace a giving while living strategy. wealthy people who aspire to give away their money while they're still alive sometimes hit a roadblock: they accumulate wealth so fast that it's difficult to give it away quickly enough to honor their promise.\n\nthe question of how much bezos — whose estimated net worth is around $197 billion — will give away and how fast he'll do it isn't just voyeuristic curiosity. it has far-reaching implications, says ben soskis, a research associate in the center on nonprofits and philanthropy at the urban institute who studies the history of philanthropy.\n\nhe has so much money that the scale question and the pacing question is really important, because it could fundamentally transform certain fields, soskis said.\n\nhow transparent will bezos be about his charitable giving?\n\nthe public may have a tough time learning the details of bezos' giving unless he wants to disclose them. the bezos day one fund and the bezos earth fund do not appear to be private foundations. they're not registered charities with the irs. an amazon spokeswoman said she could not share details on what type of entities they are.\n\nif they're not private foundations, it could be more difficult to find out how they're spending their money. foundations are legally required to spend a certain amount each year and report their grants to the irs, but bezos appears to be under no such obligation.\n\nbezos's 2017 tweet asking for suggestions on how to spend his money broached this faux transparent intimacy that created anticipation that he would be more open about his giving, soskis said. that vision has not come to fruition. he's been really strikingly reticent and resistant to giving details about his giving.\n\nbezos typically makes a very large pledge — the $10 billion climate pledge, for example — without providing details on how and when the money will be spent. that could change now that bezos is more focused on his philanthropy, soskis noted. it's vital that the public have more information about the process and direction of his philanthropy, soskis said.\n\n 'what people want to know is how much of his fortune will go to charity. … will he try to give most of his fortune while he is alive?'  — chronicle of philanthropy editor stacy palmer\n\nbezos isn't the only megadonor without a formal apparatus for explaining their giving to the public. more traditional philanthropic entities such as the bill & melinda gates foundation issue annual reports on their grant-making and answer press inquiries. newer philanthropists reveal their giving on their own terms.\n\nmackenzie scott announced her $4 billion giving spree in a medium post; twitter twtr, +1.37% ceo jack dorsey posts his charitable llc's grants on a public google goog, -0.07% googl, -0.08% spreadsheet; elon musk's foundation has a minimalist website and keeps the bulk of its assets in a donor-advised fund, a giving vehicle that can distribute money anonymously to nonprofits.\n\nhowever, publicizing giving can sometimes be a double-edged sword, said melissa berman, president and ceo of rockefeller philanthropy advisors. on the one hand, we hope that more people publicly giving to climate change will inspire more philanthropy in that space, because it's underfunded, even though we talk about it all the time, said berman. however, big names in philanthropy draw people in, but they can also give people the sense that the problem is solved.\n\nwho will hold bezos accountable?\n\nas the head of a public company, bezos is beholden to shareholders, regulators such as the sec and the irs and, of course, amazon customers. philanthropy, on the other hand, is the only power center in our society that has no real bottom line and is accountable to no one, david callahan, founder of the philanthropy publication inside philanthropy, once wrote.\n\npressure to be more accountable has mounted as critics take aim at philanthropy. there's a much greater expectation that wealth holders are part of the solution to the world's problems than there has been in a long time, berman said.\n\npart of that has to do with rising income inequality, berman added. all of the wealth holders we talk to feel that pressure — from the media, from their peers, from their customers and from the organizations that they want to work with — that they need to be part of the solution and make it possible for more people to succeed the way they did. we now have public lists of who gave the most money last year. we didn't have that 15 years ago.\n\nwill bezos's philanthropy give amazon a 'halo effect'?\n\ncritics of philanthropy often charge that the wealthy use giving away money as a smokescreen to distract from the economic injustices that helped them earn their money in the first place. in other words, they say it will provide a halo effect.\n\ncounting the minutes before there's a significant announcement about a philanthropic gift to cover up all this bad press, tweeted edgar villanueva, an advocate for socially just philanthropy and author of decolonizing wealth, after bezos' departure was announced. he was referring to amazon ending hazard pay for warehouse workers and firing a worker who advocated for forming a union.\n\n(when the company ended the extra $2 hour in hazard pay, a spokeswoman noted that amazon's $15 an hour starting wage was higher than many of its competitors, and that the company had paid our team and partners nearly $800 million extra since covid-19 started while continuing to offer full benefits from day one of employment. the company said the worker who was fired lost his job because he violated a safety rule.)\n\n 'this is going to only heighten attention on amazon's corporate practices.'  — ben soskis, research associate in the center on nonprofits and philanthropy at the urban institute\n\nsoskis doesn't think bezos' philanthropy will do much to dampen criticism of amazon. there's going to be a natural assumption that this announcement is related to amazon's pr strategy, that this is an attempt of bezos to do some reputation laundering, soskis said, noting that news of bezos stepping down came the same week the company settled a $61.7 million case with the federal trade commission alleging that amazon withheld tips from its contract drivers. (an amazon spokeswoman told marketwatch the company's contract drivers earn among the best in the industry at over $25 an hour on average.)\n\nsoskis believes it's unlikely that bezos' philanthropy will divert public attention from amazon. he is so clearly identified with the company that his engagement with philanthropy will make him a more fully public figure than he was before, soskis said. every occasion that he engages with the public as a philanthropist provides opportunity for oppositional scrutiny on amazon. this is going to only heighten attention on amazon's corporate practices.\n\nwill he stick to the causes he's supported so far, or will his philanthropy change?\n\nbezos' early philanthropic gifts were a bit of a hodge-podge, including, among others, a $10 million donation to the museum of history & industry in seattle; a $2.5 million gift to the campaign to legalize gay marriage in washington state and a $33 million donation to fund 1,000 college scholarships for dreamers, or immigrants living in the u.s. under the deferred action for childhood arrivals policy.\n\nsee also: amazon's jeff bezos ranks no. 1 among s&p 500 ceos in political spending\n\nhis recent multi-billion dollar initiatives to address homelessness, start a network of free preschools and address climate change are bezos' biggest bets to date. so far he's engaged in a few different styles of philanthropy, soskis said, and it's not yet clear which type of donor he'll be.\n\nwith the day one fund, bezos and his then-wife mackenzie made contributions with seemingly few strings attached — a form of what's called trust-based philanthropy, which upends the traditional power dynamic between funder and recipient. (mackenzie scott has been praised for deploying that strategy as she's handed out money at a furious rate since her divorce.)\n\n philanthropy is 'the only power center in our society that has no real bottom line and is accountable to no one.'  — david callahan, founder of the philanthropy publication inside philanthropy\n\nbut with his network of free preschools, bezos has embraced a more donor-centric model — his name is on the schools, and the schools are entirely new entities created by his nonprofit, day one academies. they are a new product, if you will, and as he has said, the students are the customer.\n\nbezos said in a 2017 tweet that i'm thinking i want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now — short term — at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact.\n\nto succeed in addressing complex challenges like climate change, bezos will need to listen, learn and be open to different types of collaboration and partnerships, said una osili, a professor of economics and philanthropic studies at indiana university's lilly family school of philanthropy.\n\nthere are a lot of skills that business leaders can bring to bear at solving social-sector problems, osili said. at the same time, there's a cautionary note — solving hunger, for example, is very different than the work that bill gates and jeff bezos were doing before. one thing that is very different about philanthropy is the notion that you're working within communities and defining goals with communities. the notion of success isn't about maximizing a profit, it's about maximizing social return, and really identifying communities and what their needs are.
dear moneyologist,\n\nmy father died last april in a motorcycle accident. it was very unexpected and overwhelming. he had no will, but was still married to my mom. the house was only in his name. i know that my mom was seeing a probate lawyer and there was supposed to be a court date where me and my siblings could either give up our rights so she can have all of the profit after selling the home or object and say we wanted our share since we live in california and it's a community property state.\n\nalso see: my in-laws want me to buy half of their home — should i do it?\n\ni never received paperwork in the mail like i was told was supposed to happen informing me of everything going on. if the date has passed is there anything i can do? my mom has already remarried when it's only been six months since his passing and i am not happy to say the least. so i would really like to stick it to her a little since she already got his $500,000 insurance policy. it just really gets to me that she's being so selfish and i don't want it to be that easy for her to have everything.\n\nmaybe there's nothing i can do. but i'm hoping since i never received any formal paperwork i can still object and be entitled to my share of the house.\n\nmelinda from california\n\ndear melinda,\n\ni'm sorry your father died so unexpectedly. and i'm sorry that you have such anger toward your mother. presumably, they were living separate lives long before your father died.\n\ndo you stand to inherit a share of the house? the answer hinges on whether it was community or separate property. if it was the latter, then you may stand to inherit half of that (assuming you hire a good probate lawyer). if it is community property, it should pass to your mother. if the house was purchased during their marriage, it is deemed community property and you're out of luck. if it was purchased before they were married but your mother contributed to the mortgage or there were major renovations during their marriage, it may now be considered community property rather than separate property. (this is not the first time the moneyologist has come across the conundrum. the last case involved a man who wanted to divorce his wife.)\n\ndon't miss:can i leave my stepchildren nothing if my husband dies?\n\nit's not unusual for second wives, husbands or children to get upset over beneficiaries on a life insurance policy, but there is likely little you can (or should) do here. your father may have intended to change that policy, but he was preempted by his tragic accident. he is not alone. in 2013, for instance, the u.s. supreme court ruled in favor of a 66-year-old man's ex-wife (rather than his widow) as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth over $124,000. in this case, he may not have wanted his ex-wife, who he divorced 10 years before his death, to claim his life insurance policy. but with or without a divorce decree, the document given to the insurance company had his ex-wife's name on it.\n\nseeing your mother inherit this $500,000 may be a bitter pill for you to swallow. for her sake and that of her newfound inheritance, let's hope her second marriage is a happy one.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.

the financial markets are often quick to punish investment sins. by contrast, if we err with our borrowing, spending and other financial issues, problems might not show up until years later—but the damage can be just as great. here, to complement my list of 12 deadly investment sins, are 12 fatal flaws when it comes to managing your money:\n\n1. pride: keeping up with the jones by buying luxury cars and fancy clothes.\n\nantidote: realize the folly of buying depreciating assets you don't need, with money you don't have, to impress people you don't like.\n\n2. greed: operating with a never enough money mentality. a reporter asked billionaire john d. rockefeller, how much money is enough? his response: just a little bit more.\n\nantidote: generosity. giving away money will loosen its emotional grip on you—and make you happier as well.\n\n3. lust: getting divorced.\n\nantidote: invest more time and energy in your marriage.\n\n4. envy: comparing your financial state to that of others. since there will always be someone with apparently greater wealth, such comparisons often lead to envy and discontent.\n\nantidote: instead of comparing yourself to others, work to develop gratitude for what you have.\n\n5. gluttony: falling into debt. if money saved is financial progress, money borrowed is often a step backward. as i've mentioned before, going into debt to pay for today's consumption is the path to financial slavery.\n\nantidote: with the exception of taking out a mortgage or student loans, if you don't have the cash to pay for something in full, save up until you do.\n\n6. impatience: claiming social security early. delaying benefits can be one of the best financial deals out there.\n\nantidote: make an informed decision about when to claim social security benefits. a great place to start is mike piper's excellent book, social security made simple.\n\n7. sloth: remaining financially illiterate. this sin is particularly costly because it leads to so many other financial sins.\n\nantidote: read at least one good financial book a year. start with if you can by william bernstein, which is both a masterpiece and a quick read. it's also free—just google it. if you learn to be a do-it-yourself investor, you can save a boatload in fees over your lifetime.\n\n8. fear: being unable to enjoy your retirement because of irrational worries about running out of money. spending down a nest egg requires a mindset that's completely different from that required when saving for retirement. drawing down a portfolio is also subject to a unique set of risks, such as sequence-of-return risk and longevity risk. i suspect a large number of retirees allow such fears to cast an unnecessary shadow over their golden years.\n\nantidote: if you've saved enough for retirement, don't let irrational fears rob you of joy. adjust your asset allocation as you approach retirement—by reducing your portfolio's risk level—so an unlucky sequence of returns doesn't meaningfully impact your retirement. learn to roll with the punches, spending a bit less when the markets are stingy and more when returns are generous.\n\n9. imprudence: failing to insure. it's like playing russian roulette with your financial life.\n\nantidote: insure the big stuff, by purchasing home, health, auto, disability and life insurance.\n\n10. negligence: buying cash-value life insurance instead of term insurance. term is the least expensive and most appropriate form of life insurance for the vast majority of people.\n\nantidote: when dealing with insurance agents or financial advisors who hawk insurance products, always be on your guard—because you'll likely be pitched the products that pay them the highest commissions.\n\n11. hyperactivity: being addicted to online shopping. the convenience of online shopping is matched only by its detrimental effects on our ability to save and to delay gratification.\n\nantidote: if you're hooked on internet shopping, consider cancelling your amazon prime membership, deleting offending apps from your smartphone and unsubscribing to emails from online merchants. adopt a sleep on it rule for online purchases, so you avoid impulse spending.\n\n12. aimlessness: not having a budget or rainy-day fund.\n\nantidote: adopt a super-simple pay yourself first budget. if you don't have a rainy-day fund, use your monthly savings to begin building one.\n\nthis column originally appeared on humble dollar. it has been republished with permission.\n\njohn lim is a physician and author of how to raise your child's financial iq, which is available as both a free pdf and a kindle edition. his previous articles include 12 investment sins, how low? too low and solomon on money. follow john on twitter @johntlim.
clutter is costly. just ask jessica doyle of fullerton, calif. after her divorce in 2010, she moved to a small apartment, dumping a few boxes on the living room floor and sending the rest of her belongings to a storage unit, incurring a monthly fee of $127. paperwork was everywhere, so when her bills went missing, doyle got slapped with late charges averaging $30 apiece. when her monthly car payment got lost in the shuffle, it cost her nearly $70 in extra interest. and when her traffic ticket disappeared, doyle lost a day's work standing in line at the courthouse to pay the $354 fine.\n\nit's expensive to be broke, doyle says, and for me, clutter was at the heart of it. my mind was chaos; everything around me was chaos. it was a vicious cycle.\n\nshe's not alone. experts say that in the u.s., 15 to 20% of our annual income is drained by disorganized finances. some of the ways it plays out:\n\n23% of americans pay their bills late and incur extra charges because they can't find their bills. misplaced gift cards that never get redeemed waste money, too (in 2014, that amounted to $1 billion). then there are overdue library books — the average community library collects a whopping $182,000 in overdue fines each year).\n\nmore than 10% of households rent storage space to hold their extra stuff. families who use them spend as much as $1,000 a year on storage- space rent. and home storage products — those plastic bins stacked in garages and basements — have blossomed into a $10.5 billion business.\n\namericans spend 55 minutes a day looking for stuff they own but can't find. the result? they end up buying duplicates of everything from roasting pans to bowling balls. whatever you can't find, you have to pay to replace.\n\namerican families throw away 25% of the food they buy. a family of four wastes up to $2,275 a year.\n\nthe hidden clue to financial chaos is right there under all the clutter, says dorothy breininger, organizing expert for the tv series hoarders and author of stuff your face or face your stuff: the organized approach to lose weight by decluttering your life. when i start the decluttering process with a client, it's clear that chaos keeps them from financial freedom.\n\nchances are, clutter is eating into your income. here's how to take control and save:\n\n1. pile, don't file. can't find your bills? it happens to everybody, breininger says — even the rich and famous have had their utilities disconnected simply because statements went missing.\n\nthe solution: use a piling system instead of a filing system, she advises.\n\nclear out a bookcase and use the shelves to pile your paperwork into categories. the most important one: your to be paid pile. add piles for other categories, too, like medical information and bank statements. it doesn't have to be pretty, breininger says, it just has to be predictable. never misplace your bills again.\n\n2. round up receipts. ever bought a sweater without trying it on, only to realize later it didn't fit? but if you couldn't find the receipt, that sweater — along with the one you bought to replace it — is still in your closet. in one home, says breininger, i found a new mattress in the garage, still in plastic wrapping. the owners didn't like it, but since they couldn't find the receipt to return it, they just bought another one. that cost them $1,000 and kept them from parking their car in the garage.\n\nthe solution: grab a shoebox and stash receipts inside after every shopping trip. or, go high-tech and snap a picture of sales slips with your cellphone. then, create an electronic file.\n\nhow self-driving cars will take over more than just the driving\n\n3. deposit your documents. every single misplaced document can cost you money and stress. need to renew your passport but your birth certificate's gone awol? it'll cost you up to $30 and put you in a panic that you'll miss your trip.\n\nyour roof's damaged in a storm but you can't find your insurance policy? that's money down the drain. it happens all the time, says breininger. not only do people misplace the policy, but they can't remember who they're insured with. company names — and agent reps — change so often and those details are either clogged in their email inbox or in a pile of unopened envelopes. and by the time they figure it all out, it's often too late.\n\nthe solution: create a binder — or a file on your computer — and insert every important document, from birth and marriage certificates to tax records and insurance policies.\n\nread: living in a small space? try strategic minimalism\n\n4. lock up your savings. one of the top stressors is losing your keys. that's expensive: the average cost of hiring a locksmith to rekey your house is $181.\n\ni've had clients whose car sat in the driveway for months because the keys were missing, says breininger. the battery drained and the tires needed to be replaced. cha-ching.\n\nthe solution: put a hook at the front door (it can be a plain old nail or a decorative ornament) and always hang your keys there. for things you might use less frequently, like a snowmobile or a lock box, use a bowl or jar.\n\n5. simplify storage. sometimes it's unavoidable — you've moved from a big house to a tiny apartment and need to stash your stuff in a storage unit. but besides the monthly rental fee, there's another, unexpected cost. my clients lose money by repurchasing items they've forgotten about, says breininger. so they'll end up buying a new set of christmas decorations or lawn chairs, spending more money and creating more clutter.\n\nthe solution: keep a basic inventory of everything in your unit. it doesn't have to be detailed — three lamps, two boxes of kids' clothes, breininger advises. then keep that list, along with your storage unit number and keys in a clearly marked envelope in your binder.\n\nand if you haven't used anything on your list in a year, clear out your storage unit and save yourself $1,000.\n\n6. create cash. thinking of finding a roommate to share expenses or renting out a room through airbnb? seems like a great idea — till you remember the junk in your spare room.\n\nthe solution: recruit a couple of friends to spend a day helping you clear it out. group like items — say frames, crafting supplies, clothes — in a staging area, advises breininger. then pick the best and donate the rest. have team members run the items you're keeping to the place they belong, and bring the rest to a donation center.\n\nwhile you're at it, you might even find a surprise. one family broke down in tears of relief when we found an uncashed $20,000 check in the clutter, says breininger. that's unusual, but we almost always find some money.
fox news host tucker carlson, many years ago, would regularly call in and chat with the host of the bubba the love sponge radio show. the idea, as it is with any shock-jock program, was to stir up a buzz by discussing some controversial topics.\n\ncarlson didn't disappoint.\n\none of those topics, according to the media matters website, focused on warren jeffs, who was on the fbi's ten most wanted fugitives list for his role in arranging illegal marriages between adults and underage girls.
when erin lowry, 28, author of broke millennial, marries her partner of eight years this september, they both will be nearly 30 and will have been dating for eight years.\n\nthat's nearly 2.5 times the national average time spent dating before marriage, but lowry said she has no regrets. she said marriage has long been part of the plan for the couple, but they both wanted to finish their degrees, get settled into careers, and her partner wanted to attack his student loans before they committed to marriage.\n\nfor us, we'll enter marriage in a stable and healthy financial situation, even though he has some student loan debts, and we know that being open with each other about money and being in a good situation does automatically remove some of the common tension of marriage, she said.\n\nthe millennials who refuse to get married trend is not necessarily a bad move, a new study from dating site eharmony found: it showed the longer people wait to marry, the happier they are in relationships. the survey, conducted by harris insights & analytics, surveyed people on the success of their relationships and found that couples who waited longer after meeting and got to know each other before marrying scored higher on a happiness index. in fact, the unhappiest group said they got married because it was time, while the happiest cited love.\n\nthere is pressure from culture and family and friends to pick somebody to marry at a certain time, grant langston, chief executive officer of eharmony said. that is a terrible idea — people need to push back on that idea because relationships prove more successful if they do.\n\nwhat marriage-phobic millennials mean for the wedding-ring industry\n\nlowry is one of many people in her age group waiting longer to tie the knot. the average age for marriage is now 27 for women and 29 for men compared to 21 years for women and 23 years old for men in 1963 — and that is if they get married at all. only two in five millennials were married in 2015, compared to two in three in 1980.\n\nmany couples cite high levels of student loan debt as an obstacle to marriage, and millennials are wise to wait to pay that off before tying the knot, said brianna mcgurran, personal finance expert at nerdwallet. she noted that people with more financial independence have the resources to break off relationships they may be forced to stay in otherwise just to split rent or pay the bills.\n\nbut those who hold off on marriage could be losing out on money, too: filing taxes jointly as a married couple could affect how much you are able to write off and which income bracket you're taxed at. marriage also gives couples the ability to leave an inheritance if something should happen to one partner and legal rights to parents of children. two parent families have traditionally been considered to be more beneficial to the outcome of a child, but recent research disputes that.\n\nwaiting also has major payoffs emotionally. waiting to marry means spending more time learning who you are and what you want, mcgurran said. so when you find the right person, the relationship is more fulfilling — you enter into it knowing you're truly choosing to do so, and you'd be just fine on your own.
this article is reprinted by permission from nextavenue.org.\n\nat long last, as the vaccines gradually roll out, maybe the end of the pandemic is in sight and soon the new (revised) normal will begin to take shape. but don't wait. the pandemic, with all of its pain, fear and isolation, has also handed us a probably once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to step back and rethink our lives.\n\nand this is the time to do it.\n\nwe've been obscuring the purpose of our lives without knowing it — with activities, with appointments and social engagements, says katie militello, a marriage and family therapist who runs adapting to life transitions in del mar, calif. with outside activities gone, people can see their lives in a new light.\n\nand, says boston-based transition expert linda rossetti (women and transition,) the pandemic gives us the runway to ask some bigger questions.\n\nso here are three questions to help you plan a post-pandemic comeback that could make your career and life more satisfying and fulfilling:\n\n1. what do i care about now and what do i want to fix in the world?\n\nmeg newhouse, founder of life planning network and co-editor of live smart after 50, offers this starting point: notice what in your daily life brings you either joy and hope or makes you very upset and angry. because each of those is giving you a clue about what you might want to do.\n\nyou can also try to answer this question through reverse engineering. write your eulogy, says newhouse. if you can put yourself at the end of your life, you can see what has mattered, what there is still to do.\n\nsee: 2021 could be the year of estate planning\n\ndoug dickson, head of encore boston network and a specialist in career and life transitions for people over 50, suggests looking at your high school years to rediscover the aspirations and latent dreams that have been sitting unattended for a while.\n\nbecause of pandemic lockdowns, dickson adds, many issues — like social justice and climate change — have captured our attention on tv as never before. that has precipitated a sense of, 'i have to do something about this,' he says.\n\nwhat do you want to do something about? start a list and capture the ideas you're discovering. they'll help set your direction.\n\nyou might like: easy moneymaking ideas for seniors\n\n2. after looking inward, start looking outward and ask yourself: what opportunities turn me on and engage my energies?\n\ntake a look at volunteermatch, a website listing over 700,000 opportunities. doing so isn't necessarily about volunteering right now. it's about ideas. scan volunteermatch's 29 categories (from advocacy & human rights to sports & recreation) and see what lights up for you.\n\nor go to an online educational site like edx.org and browse courses from cloud computing to writing. which ones sound exciting? when the pandemic is over, where might you want to devote your energies?\n\nif you're employed, check out job postings at your company and the job search sites. linkedin will list a bunch of jobs it thinks fit your profile (see the jobs icon there).\n\nthe point is to explore these kaleidoscopes of opportunities to free up your thinking and give you building blocks for a comeback plan that will be aligned — and that's the key word — with what you care about and will really want to do when normal life picks up again.\n\n3. what's my action plan to engage during my comeback?\n\ntry for one accomplishment each day, says rossetti. research one company; network with one person. small steps work just fine, rossetti notes.\n\nand keep moving. what i advocate, says dickson, is that people try something. don't wait for the perfect opportunity. don't set the stakes too high. in the end, what really moves the ball down the field is the trial and error process…see what fits, see what works.\n\ncheck out: pandemic savings setbacks? here's how to rebuild your retirement\n\nthe pandemic might let you do this through remote work opportunities. think about entrepreneurship, short-term projects and the gig economy, says dickson.\n\nyour comeback plan might be to return to the office when it reopens and switch to a different part of your employer, more aligned with the kind of work you want to be doing. if so, use this time to look for interdepartmental committees or cross-disciplinary projects you could get involved with.\n\nalso, see if your employer will pay for training or certification to help you pivot to a new career path.\n\nthink about signing up for weekend volunteering to sample organizations and causes you might want to assist.\n\nif retirement isn't far away, start thinking about how you'll want to spend your days in that next stage. is now the time to look into joining a nonprofit? what about checking out classes in photography or ceramics — or you name it — that could grow into meaningful activities in retirement?\n\nhow will you know what's right for you?\n\nif you don't have energy around something, it's not going to work, dickson says. look for a compelling activity or organization. the energy can also come from the people connected to the effort — who are like-minded and fun to work with — or from the way in which your skills fit, says dickson.\n\nwhile there's no secret sauce to putting together a great comeback plan, rossetti says, the key is openness, a willingness to explore, to step into uncertainty, to expand your definition of self. to say to yourself, 'maybe i'm something more.' \n\nthe zoom zm, +0.47% world many of us have been living in has let us reveal more of ourselves, ditching business uniforms for sweats, holding meetings from our kitchens, letting our dogs show up on screen. if that sounds familiar, you're already on the path to being more authentic. so your comeback plan may, in some ways, be a come-as-who-you-really-are plan.\n\nget ready, as newhouse puts it, to live your life and not somebody else's. so, keep safe, wear your mask and use this time to prepare for an awesome comeback.\n\nconnie baher is a writer and lecturer on reimagining retirement, and a sought-after career transition specialist. author of the case of the kickass retirement, she has written for usa today, the new york times, the boston globe and other print and online media. she is a harvard mba, an entrepreneur and a former tech executive.\n\nthis article is reprinted by permission from nextavenue.org, © 2021 twin cities public television, inc. all rights reserved.
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nfirst comes love. then comes marriage. then come…financial responsibilities.\n\nwe're approaching wedding season, and amid the talk of cake and flowers should be some frank talk about money, not just the cost per plate on the big day, but the short- and long-term financial implications of bringing two people together in one household.\n\neven in first marriages, people are tying the knot later in life now than ever before. in 2018, the median age at first marriage was nearly 30 for men and nearly 28 for women. thirty years ago, it was 26 and 23½, respectively. that means people are coming into these partnerships with several more years of personal financial history under their belts that must be considered and reconciled.\n\nwaiting until each partner has achieved a certain level of financial stability may play a large role in when couples decide to get married, especially given changing social and economic factors like extended stints in higher education and the accompanying debt. but once a couple has made that decision, there are some key money vows they should take to ensure they're on the same page.\n\nfirst, talk openly about financial values. we all go through life with a set of ethics and goals related to our money. beyond major life choices such as having children and owning a home, it's important for soon-to-be spouses to know if charitable giving, international travel or other large expenses are part of one partner's personal and financial identity. it's a worthwhile exercise for both of them to write down their priorities separately, then compare lists and discuss where they overlap and where compromise is necessary.\n\nmany marriages don't survive the wealth-planning and building phases because only one, or neither, of the spouses is totally committed to a shared wealth plan, so being clear about goals and values upfront can alleviate a lot of tension.\n\nnext, take a hard look at each partner's individual financial situation. before combining their assets, it's important for each spouse to have their own house in order. a financial inventory should include everything from personal monthly income to savings to credit card balances to student loan debt. it should also account for monthly expenses and how they will change post-marriage. with young couples getting married later, decisions about ownership and titling of prenuptial assets should also be considered.\n\nat this stage, it helps to decide whether outstanding obligations will become couples' debt or if each partner will continue to take ownership of their liabilities. this can be a tough negotiation if there is a large disparity between the partners' situations, but hashing it out before the big day can head off surprises and arguments down the line.\n\nbe honest. the foundation of a strong relationship is trust, and this is especially true when it comes to money. before coming together in marriage, both partners must be willing to open the books and be honest about any past financial troubles or debts that may come to bear during the marriage.\n\nthis is not a one-and-done conversation. my colleague, wealth strategist malia haskins, suggests that couples should schedule a regular money date to talk about finances once or twice a month.\n\nmake a savings plan — together. in this instant-gratification age, it takes a lot of discipline to set funds aside for the future. when couples are relatively young and thus have the luxury of time on their side, they should aim to save at least 10% of every dollar they earn in a long-term, untouchable account, like a workplace 401(k) plan, ira or roth account. the particulars can be discussed with the help of a financial professional, but the commitment to saving for the long haul needs to be enthusiastically taken up by both halves of the couple.\n\nhave the tough conversations. two of the most financially devastating life events are divorce and the unexpected death of a spouse. even when a couple is first starting out, it's important to think about how they'll protect their assets in light of an unfortunate event.\n\na lot of people put up a mental block about the possibility of such events, so they avoid talking about them. but drawing up a will or trust, or establishing a prenuptial agreement, can make a life-changing difference in a devastating scenario. prenups don't carry the same taboo as they once did, and they can offer important protections, especially if one or both partners is coming to the marriage with significant personal assets, and/or if there are former spouses or children from previous relationships in the mix.\n\nwedding planning can be stressful, but a wedding is only one day; a marriage is, in theory, a lifetime. for that reason, couples shouldn't give short shrift to the topic of money, which will realistically impact most of the decisions they make together. having an honest, open dialogue and coming together to plan around the financial aspect of an impending union can make all the difference in the success of a marriage.\n\nangie o'leary is head of wealth planning for rbc wealth management - u.s.\n\nrbc wealth management does not provide tax or legal advice. all decisions regarding the tax or legal implications of your investments should be made in connection with your independent tax or legal adviser. investment and insurance products offered through rbc wealth management are not insured by the fdic or any other federal government agency, are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank or any bank affiliate, and are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested. rbc wealth management, a division of rbc capital markets, llc, member nyse/finra/sipc.
dear moneyist,\n\ni owe back child support for a son from my first marriage, and so i have not received a stimulus check. does president trump not realize i now have another family to take care of? they need me now. if i can't feed my family, i will do what i can to make that happen. if that means taking food from stores without paying, i will. this system is not equitable.\n\ndon't miss:'we will not have a vaccine by next winter.' like the 1918 spanish flu, cdc says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. so what happens now?\n\nthe cares act has allocated money to get people through this period of economic uncertainty, and withholding checks now does not take into account the unprecedented circumstances in which millions of hard-working families are living. millions of people likely owe back taxes and are overdue on their student loans, yet they are forgiven and receive $1,200 stimulus checks.\n\ni am not the only person in this position. what do you believe is fair?\n\nj.m. in texas\n\ndear j.m.,\n\nthere are a few non sequiturs in your letter. some people have complained of being punished for doing the right thing. you are, by your own account, being penalized for doing the wrong thing. more than 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in recent weeks due to the economic effects of the nationwide lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic. i agree: it's not fair on children who have to live with the stress of seeing their parents come under financial strain.\n\ni understand that you need to support your family. your family should not have to suffer during this difficult time. let me rephrase that. your families should not have to suffer. you have two families to support, after all, not one. you don't get to pick and choose what children deserve your help at a time when millions of families are struggling, at least not in the eyes of the law. thus, the federal government has intervened to make sure you fulfill your legal and your moral obligations.\n\nalso see: i received my ex-husband's $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. should i give him the money or return it to the irs?\n\nif you had supported your first child, the system would support you now. why did you not pay your child support? did you lose your job and do everything in your power to get another one to support both of your families? did your business go under because of the pandemic? of course, there are often extenuating circumstances where parents are simply unable to pay and, perhaps, don't have an emergency fund for all eventualities. but if your instinct now is to steal, it gives me pause.\n\n of course, there are often extenuating circumstances. but you have not given me a valid reason, or any reason for that matter, why you have not paid child support. \n\nmost of these eics are being split 50/50 between two households. that seems fair. if you are married filing jointly, and you filed an injured spouse claim with your 2019 tax return (or 2018 tax return if you haven't filed your 2019 tax return), half of the total payment will be sent to each spouse and your spouse's payment will be offset only for past-due child support, according to the internal revenue service. there is no need to file another injured spouse claim for the payment.\n\nthose parents listed on the treasury offset list for unpaid child support are liable, like you, to have their economic impact payment reduced or withheld. federal law requires child-support agencies to have procedures to collect past due child support from federal tax refunds, according to ken paxton, the attorney general of texas. in the federal stimulus bill, the cares act, congress did not exempt the stimulus rebate payments from federal offsets for child-support arrears.\n\ndispatches from a pandemic:letter from new york: 'new yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags'\n\nin some cases the government has mistakenly withheld stimulus money from injured parties in child-support cases. the irs said it's working with the bureau of fiscal service, the department of health and human services and the office of child support enforcement to resolve this as soon as possible. those parents who are owed child support and have not received their money may, indeed, feel rightly justified in holding their former spouses and the government responsible.\n\nyou have not given me any valid reason, or any reason for that matter, why you have not paid child support. instead, you lay the blame at the feet of the government. while no government is perfect, directing your anger at everyone else seems too simple a conclusion. in almost every situation, we all have to take some share — however large or small — of the responsibility. there's an old saying: when you take 'bla, bla, bla' out of 'blame,' you are left with 'me.'\n\nthe time has come to take accountability for your own actions, my friend.\n\nread readers' responses to this letter: 'not everyone that owes back child support is a deadbeat.' is it fair for president trump to garnish stimulus checks of fathers who are behind on payments?\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com want to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published?

across the nation, engaged couples are putting their nuptials on hold.\n\npresident donald trump issued guidelines on march 16 calling for americans to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people to limit the spread of the coronavirus — disappointing many brides and grooms who were planning to tie the knot this spring.\n\nwe had gotten april 4 engraved on our wedding bands,'' said christin johnson, referring to the day she and her fiancé were going to exchange vows. i was picking up my wedding dress the day governor cuomo announced there would be zero social gatherings — that was heartbreaking.\n\nthey're not alone. many engaged couples who had scheduled their wedding between march and december 2020 were forced to rethink their plans because of the pandemic, according to a recent survey by the wedding report, an independent research firm that tracks and forecasts wedding market data. nearly 27% of surveyed couples said they had rescheduled their weddings for 2021. some 26% decided to shift their dates to later in 2020, and 42% were still holding their original date.\n\nmy fiancé took it a little harder because we've put so much time planning for this day but luckily our vendors were able to work with us, said sebastian arias, who had his wedding planned for may but has rescheduled the ceremony for early august. our biggest problem now is getting our marriage license because all of the courts in los angeles are closed.\n\ncelebrity wedding and event planner colin cowie has advice on how to keep wedding dreams alive amid the coronavirus pandemic. colin cowie lifestyle\n\njohnson and her fiancé, who is a nurse at mount sinai hospital in new york, have moved forward with rescheduling their ceremony for the end of may but opted to downsize their guest list to only a few close family members and friends. their wedding was originally going to be at an arts center in virginia, but they're now planning a smaller ceremony at a townhouse in brooklyn.\n\nugo eze and christin johnson postponed their april 4 wedding to late may, switched venues, and cut the guest list down. courtesy of christin johnson\n\nit was extremely hard to push it out, but i'm less stressed now about the wedding. i've been able to put things into perspective for what's more important and that's everyone's safety, johnson said.\n\nas the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across the country, sickening and killing thousands, it's also shut down all but essential businesses and put the wedding industry at a near a standstill.\n\n 'it's going to take a while for us to get confident again: to travel, socialize and entertain one another. but eventually we'll get there.'  — — celebrity wedding planner colin cowie\n\nthe u.s wedding industry is worth nearly $74 billion, according to ibisworld, an industry research company. with couples scrambling to coordinate alternative ceremony dates with vendors and break the unfortunate news to guests, the coronavirus has already shaped up to be the ultimate wedding crasher.\n\nif it was a problem just in america, i'd work with my clients to plan something in italy or the south of france, but we're all in the same boat right now with no place to go, said colin cowie, a celebrity wedding and events planner. it's going to take a while for us to get confident again: to travel, socialize and entertain one another. but eventually we'll get there, said cowie.\n\nbased on conversations he's had with vendors and others in the business, cowie estimates that 90% of all weddings that were planned over the next three to four months have either been canceled or postponed.\n\nthere's going to be a lingering impact, and i think we'll likely lose between 27 and 32% of weddings in 2020 but gain a surge of weddings in 2021 of about 20 to 25%, said shane mcmurray, ceo and founder of the wedding report. we'll see a significant drop in the number of guests for weddings because couples will be hesitant to invite a lot of people and don't want to put anyone at risk.\n\ncowie, who counts oprah winfrey, tom cruise and jennifer lopez among some of his star clients, has been communicating weekly with all of his engaged clients to calm fears and keep hopes alive for their dream wedding. so, we asked our readers to submit questions to the high-profile wedding planner on how soon-to-be newlyweds can continue planning their big day.\n\nmarketwatch: i'm thinking of canceling. what should i expect from my vendors?\n\ncowie: this is all about relationships. if you have a good relationship with someone they might not give you the full deposit back, they may give you a portion of the deposit that they haven't used.\n\nbut, legally, they are not required to give you the deposit back at all. [editor's note: situations can vary, depending on terms of the contract.] in some instances when we have an event that is nine to 11 months out, we've given the deposits back, but if the wedding is in two months' time, 80% of the work is probably done. it takes a little bit of leeway on both sides.\n\nmw: how can i still shop for my wedding dress?\n\ncowie: everyone in every industry is being impacted in the same way. for now, start shopping online for your wedding dress; start identifying silhouettes and things that you're looking for. if you find something you really love, find out who makes that dress and what their policy is.\n\nthey'll tell you if they are able to make the dress in two months. a lot of dresses are made in china or india and many are made in the united states. depending on where the dress is being made and what the lead time is to manufacture it, they should be able to do it.\n\nmw: should i get wedding insurance?\n\ncowie: in today's time, i would definitely think of wedding insurance. but certain contracts don't cover things like force majeure or an act of god or something along those lines that nobody is able to foresee. read the fine print and understand exactly what it is that you are buying. remember, the broader the spectrum of coverage you want, the more expensive your policy is going to be. do your homework; we have lots of time to do research right now.\n\nif you want more advice that colin has for wedding planning during the coronavirus pandemic, check out this video: wedding planning during covid-19? here are 5 tips to keep you sane
dear moneyist,\n\ntwenty years ago, my husband foolishly and selfishly got involved with his much younger employee, thinking that it would be a couple times of casual sex that he could get away with. my husband's ex-mistress is ruining our life.\n\nunfortunately, she also fell for him, refused to let him go, and threatened to tell me if he did not comply with her demands, including sex.\n\nthe moneyist: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nshe was an undocumented immigrant, so when she moved back to her home country with her parents, she told my husband that she was pregnant with his child. she demanded that he send the money to help with this child and he did so for several years.\n\ntwo years ago, she contacted me. she demanded more money or she would sue my husband for child support. i decided not to get divorced because we still owned a house together and can't sell it now because our younger son still lives with us.\n\nhe is regretful and agreed to do anything that i decide regarding our finances. after he signed a waiver, i removed my husband as beneficiary from my retirement accounts, and he took his name off our joint checking and savings accounts.\n\nthe moneyist:my mom asked for a divorce. my dad made his mother his pension beneficiary — and then he killed himself. now my mom and grandma are feuding. who's right?\n\nshe recently hired a lawyer in her home country and sent my husband a threatening letter, threatening to sue him for child support. we both have wills specifying that her illegitimate child are excluded from receiving anything when we die.\n\nis that enough? what else can we do to make sure that she cannot get her hands on this house or anything else? the only asset we co-own together is our primary residence.\n\nwe live in new jersey. too bad she is not living in the u.s. if she did live here, i would sue this mistress from hell for ruining my life and my marriage.\n\nworried wife\n\ndear worried wife,\n\nit's smart to divorce your finances, if not your husband.\n\ngiven what you have been through, signing a waiver to remove himself from your retirement accounts, and your bank accounts is the least he can do. in your divorce, your house will be divided 50/50 so that seems fair. he has also spent a considerable amount of money over time on keeping his affair quiet and/or providing support for a child who may or may not exist. we simply don't know. he has no evidence that what this woman says is true. if she does have a child, it would be wise to conduct a dna test to confirm his/her paternity.\n\nlegally, i don't see how your husband's former mistress/employee has any further hold over you or your husband. if she does have a child with your husband, he/she would be over the age of 18 now and the statute of limitations would likely have passed for back child support. her ability to sue would have depended on where she currently lives. obviously, it's better to consult a lawyer on your state's laws rather than pay more money to this woman. plus, your husband has thus far complied with her demands, and i assume he has records of their correspondence and his payments.\n\nif this child does exist, don't blame him/her. why not set up a trust so he/she can study in the u.s.? rather than think about suing his mother, consider how you can help her child.\n\nthe moneyist: my stepfather and mother pooled resources to buy a home. my mom died in 2003 and he just passed away. his kids are selling their house — am i entitled to anything?\n\nit's not your husband's ex-mistress that is ruining your life.\n\nyour husband ruined your marriage. twenty years ago was the time to confirm the validity of these claims instead of dipping into your joint funds. you appear to be united in protecting your assets from any potential lawsuit. as i said, i don't believe you have any worries on that count. i would, however, caution you about remaining in a marriage that has broken down. we do know that you and your husband have a minor son living under your roof and, if you were to split and/or he were to move out of the family home, he does and would have an obligation to him.\n\nthink carefully about your future. you are entitled to a happy relationship with a man who is honest and respectful. he is far from the gold standard. he has encouraged you to believe that this fiscal infidelity and affair is your problem, too. this has all the hallmarks of a co-dependent relationship. your husband's former mistress sounds manipulative, but as my irish friend's mother would say — as god made them, he matched them. has he made amends, financial or otherwise? i hope you find a way forward either with your husband, or without him.\n\ndon't live for tomorrow. you have savings, a retirement account and — no doubt — you have worked hard to build a life for your family. you deserve to be financially secure and happy, too.\n\nthe moneyist:my father-in-law's business went south and my mother-in-law has never worked a day in her life. how can i avoid supporting them?\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

several years ago, laura segal's husband read a quote that claimed the best gift you could give a working mom is time. he took the advice to heart.\n\ni think he read it around mother's day time period, and that's when he was like, 'you know, i will start doing the laundry,' said 48-year-old segal, the senior vice president of communications and external relations for the washington, d.c.-based american association of university women.\n\n laura segal and her husband of 14 years, full-time working parents to 9-year-old boy-girl twins, reached a domestic-labor balance by splitting up tasks based on their respective strengths. \n\nsegal and her husband of 14 years, full-time working parents to 9-year-old boy-girl twins, reached their current domestic-labor balance by splitting up tasks based on their respective strengths.\n\ntoday, segal handles the play time and child-care arrangements, as well as buying groceries and some cleaning. her husband does laundry, some of the cleaning and the bulk of putting the kids to bed. segal does the bill-paying, she said, but they work together on budgeting and finances for the house.\n\nthere have been concessions. they have simple dinners, with plenty of takeout and prepared meals, and definitely don't keep the house as clean as we would like all the time ... some things just have got to give, i think, or i don't know how we would stay afloat, she said.\n\nthey are part of a much wider problem. men now perform a larger share of unpaid labor than they did before, and women have increased their participation in the paid workforce. but the fact remains that men spend more time than women doing paid work, while women spend more time than men on unpaid work.\n\nsegal calls her husband quite a feminist. he's very attuned to gendered expectations of domestic roles, she said. but to be fair, it's probably not a total coincidence that an svp at an equity and education nonprofit wound up choosing a partner who's willing to pull his weight. it is funny, working in the gender-equity space and also living it, segal said.\n\n 'a lot of us who study work and family are definitely selective about our partners, and wouldn't be marrying people who weren't on board with an egalitarian partnership to begin with.'  — —natasha quadlin, an assistant professor at the ohio state university\n\nthe same goes for natasha quadlin, a 32-year-old assistant professor at the ohio state university whose research areas include social inequality, gender and family.\n\nit started with choosing an egalitarian partner to begin with, quadlin said of her husband of four years. i think a lot of us who study work and family are definitely selective about our partners, and wouldn't be marrying people who weren't on board with an egalitarian partnership to begin with.\n\nquadlin enjoys cooking, while her husband tends to care more about cleaning. they outsource yard work at their columbus home and subscribe to a meal-delivery service — assistance, she admits, that they are privileged to have. she tries to cut down on the time she spends doing chores or thinking about the gender dynamics at play in her everyday interactions. after all, she said, thinking about those issues for a living can weigh on a person.\n\nchores and gender is something that i think about all the time, she said. so a lot of times, my response is just to not do it, not engage with it, to the extent that i can.\n\nbut quadlin admits she and her husband, who don't have children, have the luxury of negotiating and abstaining from chores if they want to. once children enter the equation, even among millennials, that's often when these really gendered patterns in chores and child care really emerge, she said. we haven't been put in that situation.\n\nnatasha quadlin and her husband, sean quadlin. taylor dearr\n\nwomen spend more time than men on unpaid work\n\nu.s. women spend an average of 244 minutes per day on unpaid work, compared to men's 145.8 minutes, according to data from the organization for economic cooperation and development. moms in 2016 continued to spend more hours per week than dads on child care (14 versus eight, respectively) and housework (18 versus 10), and fewer hours per week on paid work (25 versus 43), according to a pew research center analysis.\n\n women women spend more time than men on unpaid work. american women spend an average of 244 minutes per day on unpaid work, compared to men's 145.8 minutes, the oecd says. \n\njust 19% of men report doing housework like laundry or cleaning on an average day, according to the bureau of labor statistics' 2017 american time use survey, in contrast to 49% of women. men were less likely than women to have done food prep or cleanup (46% versus 69%, respectively) and a bit more likely than women to have performed lawn or garden care (11% versus 8%).\n\nand there appears to be some disconnect in men's and women's perceptions of just how much housework they do: in a national survey this year by the washington, d.c.-based gender-justice and violence-prevention organization promundo, 48% of female parents said they thought their partner's household workload was unfair to them, while 40% said the same about child care. but just 24% of male parents considered their own household workload unfair to their partners, and 22% thought that of their child-care load.\n\nwhat's more, research recently published in the journal family process linked the level of support new fathers feel while participating in child care with how they perceive their relationships with their partners. for example, if mothers are critical and less supportive of their partners' parenting, it could have ramifications for the whole family dynamic, co-author sarah schoppe-sullivan, an ohio state university psychology professor, said in a statement. fathers may not only do less child care, they may have more negative views on their relationship with their wife or partner.\n\nwhile same-sex couples tend to have a more equal division of household labor, research suggests that balance shifts after they have kids, as one person performs more of the domestic labor while the other earns more money. many americans still assign traditionally female tasks to the more feminine partner in a same-sex couple, and more traditionally male tasks to the more masculine partner, 2016 research by quadlin found.\n\n while same-sex couples tend to have a more equal division of household labor, that balance shifts after they have kids, as one performs more of the domestic labor while the other earns more money. \n\nsalaries and promotions also begin to diverge after heterosexual couples have kids. a 2018 paper distributed by the national bureau of economic research found that women's incomes dropped nearly 30% after their first child was born and never recovered, while their occupational rank began to fall behind men's. this was in denmark, which offers generous paid parental leave. (the u.s. remains the sole industrialized nation that does not offer paid family leave by law.)\n\none lab study published in 2007 found that participants would offer an average of $11,000 less to job applicants who were mothers than to women without children. still more research has suggested new dads receive a 6% fatherhood bonus in earnings after having a kid, while new moms get hit with a 4% wage penalty.\n\nwhile there has been a marked change in the attention paid to modern fatherhood, society continues to expect so little of dads, said promundo president and ceo gary barker, who has a 21-year-old daughter with his wife. he recalled, for example, some people in his graduate program 20 years ago being impressed that he would care for his young daughter — or even referring to his child care as babysitting.\n\nif we do something close to 50/50 … it looks like we get credit for simply showing up, barker said. i think there is something that's shifted. it's still, however, that we get a lot of credit for doing not yet [our] full amount.\n\nshattering the status quo could pay off in spades. an alternate reality in which women achieved identical paid participation to men in the economy would add up to $28 trillion (26%) to the global gross domestic product by 2025, according to a 2015 report by the consulting firm mckinsey. and research has linked more balanced housework arrangements with less depression and greater marital satisfaction among women.\n\n'we more or less both did everything'\n\nwhen georgene huang and her husband were engaged and living together seven years ago, they had a big fight about the division of household labor. we'd been living together for a while, and i just felt like i was doing more, huang, 39, the co-founder and ceo of the new york-based women's career community fairygodboss, told marketwatch.\n\nso they sat down and made lists of the chores they perceived each of them did, and then tried to re-divide responsibilities based on their own preferences and tolerances. they outsourced tasks neither of them wanted, like laundry.\n\ni think it's always anchored us in terms of how to be fair about household work, huang said. actually, writing it down made me realize it was more equal than i thought.\n\n 'both of us had to feed children, both of us had to put children to bed, both had to dress and play with children.'  — —soraya chemaly, author of 'rage becomes her: the power of women's anger'\n\nthey later had two sons and a daughter — aged 1, 4 and 6 — who brought with them a whole new set of adjustments. but while certain child-care tasks fell to huang, like breastfeeding, she says her husband would take on a greater share of non-child-care tasks. and after she no longer had to wake up at night to breastfeed, huang said, her husband would be the one to tend to the kids at night.\n\nwe'd gotten into the pattern before we had kids of trying to divide equally, she said. we would adjust even based on the stage of the child and their needs.\n\nsome couples struck a domestic-labor balance thanks to unforeseen circumstances. writer gemma hartley, author of a viral 2017 harper's bazaar piece on women's unpaid emotional labor and the 2018 book fed up: emotional labor, women and the way forward, says her household dynamic shifted after her husband was laid off around the time she snagged her book deal. the sudden change meant he had to learn how to run a household for an extended period of time, she said, tending to their three kids now aged 4, 6 and 8.\n\nhe did about four months of really intensive parenting, emotional labor, doing the stay-at-home-dad thing, hartley, 30, of reno, nev., told marketwatch. that was a really big shift for him. i think now that he is back in work, it really affects the way that he takes care of the home and notices what needs to be done when he is at home.\n\nand writer and activist soraya chemaly, the author of the 2018 book rage becomes her: the power of women's anger and mother of three daughters in their late teens and early 20s, says having her younger twin girls helped pull her and her husband away from traditional gender norms.\n\nwe more or less both did everything, she said of raising three young children close in age. both of us had to feed children, both of us had to put children to bed, both had to dress and play with children.\n\n 'if you want somebody else to do the activity or take on that responsibility, you also have to be willing and able to understand they're going to do it the way they will do it.'  — —laura segal, svp of communications and external relations at the american association of university women\n\nin some ways, it was a real gift because we didn't have an out, added chemaly, who is in her early 50s. i think very often when you have children sequentially, there's never enough concentrated demand that you have to disrupt the traditional patterns of parenting. so our situation was altered by that fact, and i'm grateful for that because i think it would have been easy even for us to slide into a different situation. she described their parenting method as constant baton passing.\n\nof course, chemaly said, that division of labor can be in constant flux as parents' jobs, kids' needs and family circumstances change over time. there were times when we did an equal share better than other times. and then there were times that the inequalities that we felt, either in terms of being responsible for income or domestic care … felt out of whack, she said. then we would circle back and say, 'ok, that's out of whack, and how do we readjust?'\n\npart of striking a balance means being ok with how the other person handles their share. segal admits, for example, that she might shop for birthday presents or figure out camp schedules with probably a different level of intensity than her husband might. if you want somebody else to do the activity or take on that responsibility, you also have to be willing and able to understand they're going to do it the way they will do it, she said.\n\nit also means making sure one partner isn't in charge of the most onerous tasks: chemaly pointed out that dads will often do child-care tasks that are less stressful and more fun, while women get stuck with jobs like administering medicine.\n\nbarker says that fathers are sometimes judged for not providing care in the exact same way in which mothers might. dads may also bring a task-oriented and efficiency-driven checklist approach to child care, he added, which doesn't always work in situations like putting your son to bed or caring for a sick daughter.\n\nthe friction doesn't have to be between partners. chemaly says she didn't fight with her husband; rather, they formed a united front against institutional pressures to perform in gender-traditional ways. parental volunteering at school was one such pressure, she said, as moms at her kids' school were expected to provide unpaid labor simply by virtue of their being moms. chemaly would ultimately choose to stop volunteering at her daughters' schools, based on her belief that men and women should be asked to shoulder such work equally.\n\ni really do believe that even the most progressive families have to deal with these very traditional environments, once children enter institutions, she said, citing sports, schools and religious institutions as examples.\n\nsoraya chemaly karen sayre\n\nthey made it work, and so can you\n\nif you and your partner struggle to divvy up household chores, child-care duties and emotional labor, here are some strategies to iron them out, according to experts who have thought long and hard about the issue — and lived it themselves:\n\n1. women, speak up. men, be more conscious. i think women a lot of the time don't feel comfortable speaking up and voicing not only their needs, but their wants for their partnership, hartley said. that was a really big thing for me to start speaking up and handing more stuff over.\n\non the other hand, barker added, it often falls to women to hold men accountable, which is a huge burden. they do the work, and then have to remind a male partner, 'you should be doing a greater share,' he said. how do we as men have a greater awareness?\n\n2. keep it caring and lighthearted and loving, barker said. otherwise, we just become co-administrators, and we don't really want to hang out as much anymore — at least not in intimate, loving ways. chemaly agreed. i don't know how people do it if they're constantly fighting with their spouse, but we didn't have that situation because we really were just tied at the hip, she said.\n\n3. if it ain't broke … i don't think you have to make it a perfect 50/50 balance — i think that's a pipe dream for most couples because workloads are different; schedules are different, hartley said. as long as you're making sure that you're in a place where it feels equal and you feel like there is not resentment building up, don't fix what isn't broken.\n\n4. if you need help, say so. cultivate empathy in the other person by not waiting 'til you're at the point of a breakdown to say, 'i need help … and here are some concrete ways you can help me,' segal said — as opposed to kind of holding it in and expecting the other person to automatically know.\n\n5. express appreciation. paying compliments for the things that are working can provide positive reinforcement for the role you want your partner to play, segal said, and show that you value their contributions.\n\n6. have honest conversations about child care before you have kids, chemaly said. will one partner take on a more flexible work schedule to accommodate family life? what kind of long-term effect could that have on their career? consider the butterfly effects of starting a family, she said, and be forthright with your partner about your feelings regarding work, money, life satisfaction and gender roles.\n\nin the moment, you may not talk about it, she said. but five, 10 years down the road, you will be talking about it.
dear moneyist,\n\ni really love my boyfriend and i think that i'd like to marry him, but at this point in our relationship, we aren't exactly financially compatible.\n\ni am teacher with a credit score of 790, no debt, and a small, but decent amount of savings. i'm planning on buying my first home next year. i don't make a ton of money, so i am pretty frugal and i really try to just spend it on the things i really need and want, and do without the rest.\n\nmy boyfriend is an engineer making more than twice what i make, but he has no savings and lives paycheck to paycheck. he has $25,000 in credit-card debt, a truck payment, and child-support payments. as far as i know, he isn't able to pay down his debt at all.\n\nhis divorce was finalized this year, so some of this financial reality is new for him, and i think it has been difficult for him to come to grips with it.\n\nalso see: i'm 81 and signed over my life savings to my son to manage my finances, but now he's keeping all my money\n\ni've asked him to get some free financial counseling, but he says he knows where his money goes so he doesn't need it. i told him point-blank he should get rid of his truck, and get a car cheap to own and maintain like i have, plus save on payments, gas, and insurance, but he says he loves the truck too much and he owes more than the truck is worth.\n\ni've encouraged him to go back to court and try to get some of his divorce renegotiated, because he claims his ex-wife's income was grossly understated in her divorce papers, but he says he can't prove it so there is no point.\n\non the one hand, there are all his excuses.\n\non the other hand, i honestly haven't had the financial issues that he has to deal with, so i don't even really know where he should start. i want him to get his financial house in order so that we can get more serious, but i don't know exactly what that would look like.\n\ni want to stop offering passive financial advice, and want him to stop offering passive excuses. i want us both to do stuff that works and actually become financially compatible. any ideas?\n\nstuck in rut with a boyfriend in debt\n\ndear stuck,\n\nhe can start by making a plan to pay down his debt.\n\nyou are one of the few people who have written at the right time. maybe 90% of the letters to the moneyist arrive after the damage has been done: the inheritance has been stolen, the divorce papers are signed, the deeds of the house have been changed, siblings have already taken control of bank accounts, life insurance policies have been neglected and, yes, people get married and realize their partner is unwilling to change.\n\nhe is very unlikely to change if you marry. he may even be less likely to change. he will know that there will always be someone there to pick up the pieces. you may even end up paying more than your share of the bills. his poor credit score will make a joint mortgage and most other loans more expensive. in most situations, his financial troubles will in all probability become yours. debt collectors could take a car or furniture that belongs to both of you.\n\ni have a suggestion: bring the water to the horse, but don't make him drink. make an appointment with a financial planner and ask that person to come to your home to go through your financial affairs. tell him it's important to you and he doesn't have to participate, but you would like to share some details from his finances (anonymously, if he wishes) and all he has to do is listen and, if he doesn't listen, you can present him with the findings after the fact.\n\ndon't miss:my husband grew up dirt poor and doesn't believe in insurance or banks, yet he racked up $7,000 on my credit card\n\nand if he can't agree to even that? i'm not sure there's much more you can do. he is effectively telling you that he is not prepared to lay the foundations for marriage. he is, on the other hand, telling you that he is committed to his own lifestyle, and nothing or nobody will change that, not even you. take him or leave him. if you bring him face to face with the financial responsibilities you would face as a married couple, you will have done everything you can.\n\nmany people are reluctant to marry someone with bad credit. some might regard that it's shallow, others say it's common sense. unless there are extenuating circumstances, those three digits for a man who earns good money like your boyfriend reflect bad habits. one study suggests that debt of $11,525 makes someone undateable and says credit-card debt is the no. 1 red flag, followed by payday loans. in your case, it's not the debt as much as his refusal to take responsibility for it.\n\nit's about so much more than money. research has shown a high credit score can help predict whether someone is trustworthy, reveal their skills at navigating a relationship and show their level of commitment. something to remember in your case: similar credit scores are also highly predictive of whether couples stay together, according to a 2015 paper by researchers at ucla, the brookings institution and federal reserve board, washington, d.c.\n\nif he refuses to make compromises, love is not enough.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

in the credit-card turf war, platinum wraps plastic.\n\na premium credit card is typically associated with high social status and higher fees, but recent research suggests that people will choose them because it signifies higher income over and above its benefits. economists worked with an indonesian bank that markets premium platinum credit cards to high-income customers. demand for the platinum card greatly exceeds demand for a nondescript control product with identical benefits, according to the study distributed monday by the national bureau of economic research, a cambridge, mass.-based research group.\n\nwhat's more, the lower your self-esteem, the more likely you will opt for flashy credit cards with higher fees. social image is a substitute for self-image, the researchers wrote. demand for status is psychological in nature. cross-referencing spending habits with psychological tests, the researchers found that increasing self-esteem causally reduces demand for status goods. (the study was carried out by economists from the university of chicago, the world bank, sao paulo school of economics, harvard university and university of california, los angeles.)\n\nthere's one real-world drawback: consumers may use the platinum card in social situations when they're better off using a less prestigious card. it can be a costly mistake, the study found. while the card used in our study does not offer cash back rewards, at least 48% of platinum customers report owning other credit cards which do offer cash back at restaurants and similar transactions. in order to appear wealthier, in other words, customers may actually forgo money in the form of cash rewards each time they use the platinum card instead of other cards in those situations.\n\ndon't miss:the larger the rock, the rockier the marriage\n\nprevious studies have identified impulsivity among people who want to escape unhappiness and low self-esteem. this 2010 study in the journal of experimental social psychology found that individuals conspicuously consume to signal their wealth. or, put in academic terms, the compensatory role of high-status goods has important implications for consumer decision-making and public policies aimed at reducing consumer debt. understanding why we put certain goods on credit is important to controlling our impulses, the researchers said.\n\npremium credit cards are becoming increasingly extravagant. several metal credit cards have been released in recent months. in march, u.s. bank usb, +2.90% , announced the u.s. bank altitude reserve visa infinite card, which the bank hopes will rival chase's jpm, +1.45% sapphire reserve and american express's axp, -1.55% platinum. even amazon amzn, -3.37% used a minimalist metal design for its prime rewards visa v, -0.94% card. they're targeting big spenders and, if the latest research reflects u.s. consumers, those who want to appear to be big spenders.\n\nhigh-end cards like the sapphire reserve and amex platinum charge hundreds of dollars a year to carry them, but often give out a large number of reward points initially. despite such high fees, consumers may also have a hard time spending all those rewards to make those cards worth it. if every sapphire reserve card user's spending qualified for the 100,000 point sign-up bonus — which was later reduced to 50,000 points — they'd have around 91 billion points to spend, an equivalent of more than $1 billion, the personal-finance website nerdwallet calculated.
today, roughly one in five women in the u.s. doesn't have children. thanks in part to this decline in birthrate, for the first time in u.s. history, there may soon be more elderly people than children.\n\nbased on trends in costs, it's evident why many families are choosing to have fewer children — or in some cases, no children at all.\n\nthe cost of having children in the u.s. has grown exponentially since the 1960s, when the government first started collecting data on childhood expenditures. between 2000 and 2010, the cost shot up by 40%.\n\nas of 2015, american parents spend, on average, $233,610 on child costs from birth until the age of 17, not including college. this number covers everything from housing and food to child care and transportation costs. as a mother myself, as well as a sociologist who studies families, i have experienced firsthand the unexpected costs associated with having a child.\n\nthis spike costs has broad implications, affecting everything from demographic trends and human capital to family consumption.\n\nlabor and delivery\n\nthe overall costs of labor and delivery vary from state to state.\n\nexpenses for a delivery can range from $3,000 to upward of $37,000 per child for a normal vaginal delivery and from $8,000 to $70,000 if a c-section or special care is needed.\n\nthese costs are often a result of separate fees charged for each individual treatment. other factors include hospital ownership, market competitiveness and geographical location.\n\nit's worth noting that these costs often include additional fees for ultrasounds, blood work or high-risk pregnancies.\n\nas a result, for women who are concerned about the costs related to giving birth, it's important to explore the average costs at their local hospitals and review their insurance plans before they decide to become pregnant.\n\nchild care and activities\n\nthe u.s. department of health and human services deems child care affordable if no more than 10% of a family's income is used for that purpose. however, parents currently spend 9% to 22% of their total annual income on child care, per child.\n\nchild care has become one of the most expensive costs that a family bears. in fact, in many cities, child care can cost more than the average rent. this is particularly challenging for low-income families who often don't make more than minimum wage.\n\nwhat's more, over the past century, americans significantly shifted in the way that we see childhood. whereas in the past, children often engaged in family labor, now children are protected and nurtured.\n\nyet children's activities can be costly. for example, americans families will spend on average $500 to $1,000 per season on extracurricular or sports activities for each of their children.\n\nin fact, due to the rising costs of sports, the number of children who aren't physically active has increased to 17.6%. being physically inactive is even more likely for low-income children, who are three times less likely to participate than children who reside in higher-income households.\n\nanother hidden cost associated with having a child is that of time. in my experience, many parents don't realize how much time they will invest in their children, often at the cost of personal freedom and work expectations.\n\nin fact, the american time use survey shows that, on average, parents with children under the age of 18 spend about 1.5 hours a day on domestic and child-care responsibilities. women spend 2.5 hours a day, while men spend roughly only one hour on these tasks.\n\nread:here's the most expensive place in america to raise a family\n\nweighing the causes\n\nresearchers at pew argue that the recent decrease in birthrate has as much to do with the great recession in 2008 as it does with the increase of women who are not willing to sacrifice their careers for family.\n\n5 simple steps to reach $1 million\n\nthis speaks to yet another cost of having children: mothers are often pushed out of careers or opt out, based on high demands of balancing family and work-life balance.\n\nresearchers have also found a growing trend of men and women who become single parents by choice. this group of parents prioritize children over marriage and often are on single incomes. that also contributes to the reduction in overall childbirth, from a financial and practical perspective.\n\nread:here's how to save money for your children's futures\n\nultimately, the decision to have a child is a personal one. the data show that the burden of costs and the stress of family life are real. yet despite the costs associated with having a child, many parents report overall satisfaction with their marriage and family life.\n\nconsidering the high costs of having of a child, coupled with the tension in balancing family-work life matters, states and companies are starting to invest in family support policies, parental benefits and competitive education. and individuals are creating more innovative approaches to managing family-work balance, such as a reduction in working schedules, family support and a push for more shared responsibilities within the home.\n\nheidi steinour is a visiting instructor in sociology at the university of south florida. this was first published on the conversation — baby bust: 5 charts show how expensive it is to have kids in the u.s. today.
remember when netflix inc. split its dvd-by-mail service and then-new streaming plan, enraging subscribers who had been receiving both to pay more for the same level of service?\n\n\n\nwell, there isn't much different in what the walt disney co. dis, -1.52% is doing with its new espn+ streaming service, which is likely to grow and change just as netflix's nflx, -3.75% streaming service has since 2011.\n\nespn launched the direct-to-consumer offering thursday, its first foray into so-called over-the-top, or ott, streaming services. it is an attempt to address one of the biggest complaints from disney investors over the past two years: consumers cutting the cable cord and therefore slicing the amount of cash disney receives for its sports programming.\n\namid the cord-cutting phenomenon, disney has also been dealing with stratospheric increases in the costs for sports content, with professional and college leagues demanding more for the live games that are the largest portion of a dwindling amount of television shows that viewers still watch as they occur (and accept the commercials that are included). the twin pressures of fewer consumers willing to pay for espn content and greater costs to provide that content have led to layoffs at espn and struggles for disney stock.\n\nsee also: with fox merger and espn streaming effort, disney has a confusing mess to sort out\n\ndisney responded with an acquisition, but not the kind to which we have grown accustomed to as the company has vacuumed up popular content-creators like pixar, marvel and star wars creator lucasfilm. instead, the company bought a majority interest in bamtech, a spinoff from major league baseball that has become a leader in developing streaming services.\n\nthe first result of the marriage of a tech startup and legacy content provider is a newly updated espn app and the espn+ subscription option, which arrived nearly two years after it was originally announced. disney hopes that consumers will pay $4.99 a month, or $50 for a year, to access a long list of games and other content to which it has the rights but is not showing on the channels for which cable subscribers pay roughly $8 or $9 a month through their cable bills.\n\nmany of those games were already available, however, as part of a digital channel known as espn3 that will live on, according to the company. espn has long had an app, called watchespn, that offered live streams of all of its channels as well as many espn3 games it was not airing on its tv stations. espn+ bundles many of those streams it offered to subscribers in watchespn with other previously free services and some niche sports and original programming for a fee, and offers that service in the same app as streaming versions of espn channels available only to cable subscribers.\n\nthose subscribers are already paying more than $100 a year for espn content, btig analyst rich greenfield said in a telephone interview. now, they're being asked to pay another $60 a year for the least compelling parts of that content.\n\ncan this robot make football safer?\n\nespn pushed back against that characterization in an email to marketwatch, saying the majority of espn+ programming is new and additive to our existing networks.\n\nwe believe that the content offering is very compelling for avid sports fans as well as passionate fans of niche and underserved sports, an espn spokeswoman said. and at $4.99/month, we believe it's an attractive offering compared to others currently in the marketplace for the audiences we are trying to reach and serve, while at the same time offering flexibility to subscribers.\n\nspecifically, espn+ will include college sports from smaller conferences such as the big west and ivy league, with most of the action from larger conferences, such as the southeastern conference and atlantic coast conference, still restricted to cable subscribers; live coverage of tennis and golf tournaments that include the ability to choose which feed to watch; professional soccer, including access to the major league soccer streaming service and certain english football league, united soccer league and uefa nations league games; boxing matches, through a deal with top rank boxing; as well as cricket, rugby, canadian football league and other sports more popular outside the united states.\n\nin addition, the full 30 for 30 documentary series, including oscar-winner o.j.: made in america, will be available on-demand at all times, and the latest addition to that catalogue — the last days of knight, about the downfall of former indiana university basketball coach bobby knight — will be an espn+ exclusive. other original content is also planned for espn+ exclusively, including a new show called detail helmed by former los angeles lakers star kobe bryant.\n\ndon't miss: netflix sees sharks approaching from both sides in disney and apple\n\nwe also will have a nightly hockey program throughout the playoffs, are developing a regular boxing program (more details to come) and are exploring shows for other segments as well (for example, mma, cricket, etc), the espn spokeswoman said.\n\nmuch of that content — a ton of small-college sports, tennis tournaments and many of the niche sports — was available to cable subscribers through watchespn, though some of it is new thanks to deals espn has announced in recent months, such as with mls and top rank.\n\nfor an example of bundling of previously free content into the paid service, look at one other offering espn has pushed: major league baseball and national hockey league games.\n\nfor both mlb and nhl, espn+ will offer a game a day throughout the season — more than 180 games — as part of the $4.99, the spokeswoman pointed out. those are games not available on our networks or other networks nationally. the only place those appear other than espn+ is if somebody buys the full mlb.tv or nhl.tv package.\n\nthose games, however, have been free to anyone for years. the mlb and nhl streaming services have long offered free games to non-subscribers — one a day for mlb, several a week for the nhl — in an attempt to draw in new customers to their streaming services. mlb has even broadcast its free daily games to other countries through alphabet inc.'s googl, -2.92% goog, -2.62% youtube.\n\nread also: why 'black panther' is the most important hollywood blockbuster in years\n\nespn's partnerships with mlb and the nhl also highlight disney's difficult path to offering direct-to-consumer services while attempting to support the lucrative cable bundle. in partnering with the two sports leagues, espn has the opportunity to make its new app something of a sports-focused skinny bundle, perhaps even including those leagues' broadcast networks in addition to their streaming services. that potential would only grow if disney's acquisition of parts of 21st century fox foxa, -0.09% is approved, as it will include broadcast rights to local broadcasts of many mlb and national basketball association games.\n\na platform of sports content from several sources, especially if offered without the need for cable subscriptions, could be a death knell for the cable bundle. sports fans have largely held on to cable subscriptions because they are typically the only way to watch local sports teams — those broadcasts are typically blacked out on streaming services — as well as espn and other national sports networks.\n\nat launch, though, espn's app is nowhere near that kind of offering. current subscribers of the mlb and nhl streaming services won't be able to watch that content through the espn app at launch. espn is offering subscriptions for those plans, but viewers must sign up through the espn app and pay disney their subscription fee ($25 a month for mlb), similar to signing up for the services through a cable provider. current subscribers will still have to visit those services' dedicated apps instead of accessing all their paid sports content in espn's app.\n\nthe new espn app and espn+ streaming service appear to be something of a test for disney, which plans to launch similar offerings for non-sports content, as well as a warning to cable providers that disney has a plan should they fail to keep the bundle alive. espn admitted that several features not available at launch are under consideration for the future, including pay-per-view events and bundling subscriptions with a similar effort on its website, espn insider.\n\nwe will continue to build the programming portfolio, actively, in the months and years ahead, espn told marketwatch.\n\nrelated:how to save money on disneyland—tips from the pros\n\nthat makes the service that launched thursday unlikely to move the needle for disney or consumers, as some investors may have hoped. espn is offering a 30-day free trial for consumers who sign up by april 18, and a seven-day free trial for other interested parties\n\nwe're going to see a niche-sports over-the-top service that allows disney to learn more about the direct-to-consumer business, btig's greenfield said. if this was about getting tens of millions of subscribers, it would have everything.\n\nwhen netflix separated its streaming and dvd-by-mail businesses, the company was not yet producing and distributing its own original content on the streaming service, instead offering mostly older shows and movies that could easily be found on cable or elsewhere. with espn+, disney appears to have something similar to

bad romance and bad finance go hand-in-hand.\n\nmore than half of americans (58%) say they wouldn't marry someone with significant debt, according to a new study of more than 2,300 adults from legal industry site avvo. and when it comes to committed partnerships, most people don't want to be responsible for all of the bills. some 58% said they would feel uncomfortable in a relationship if they had to be the main breadwinner: 69% of women say they'd be uncomfortable footing most of the bills, compared to 46% of men.\n\npodcast: can intimacy at home improve your work productivity?\n\nthis isn't the first study to align financial and romantic aspirations. couples' credit scores can predict how likely it is that your relationship will last, according to a 2015 study of roughly 12 million consumers by researchers at the federal reserve board, the brookings institution and ucla. the higher your credit score, the less likely people are to separate from their partner — and for every 105-point spike in that credit score there is a 32% drop in the likelihood of them separating.\n\npeople on dates used to ask for your telephone number or other intimate details like how many partners you have had before. and now? that question is replaced with, 'what number is your credit score?' says april masini, a relationship advice columnist. low credit scores and high debt levels are not only a sign of financial difficulties, they can also reveal a lot about a person's judgment, lifestyle, impulsiveness and even his or her trustworthiness, studies suggest.\n\ndon't miss:rich women like rich men, and rich men like slender women\n\nof course, people want to live in a big house and send their children to nice colleges, experts say, and while it may sound superficial, they're less likely to marry someone who is up to their eyes in debt. people don't want to be in a relationship that will economically disadvantage them, said moira weigel, author of labor of love: the invention of dating. others, she says, judge potential partners for even more than that, including the school they attended, job and where they grew up.\n\none, perhaps, small irony: while people take financial responsibility in their relationships seriously, they don't get around to a prenuptial agreement before they say, i do. only 4% of americans who have ever been married have gotten a prenuptial agreement, the avvo survey found. but when they are asked about a prenup before marriage, nearly one-third said they would ask their partner to sign a prenup to protect their assets if they were engaged.\n\nnot everyone cares about money. only 9% of americans who have been in a relationship or married say they stayed committed longer than they wanted to because they had already spent a lot of money to make it work. and an overwhelming majority of respondents (79%) said the primary reason for marriage is love. nika kabiri, law and society analyst at avvo, says when they have already fallen head over heels, most people won't put their finances before their happiness when it comes to love.
dear moneyist,\n\ni am a 47-year-old woman living in new jersey. currently, i own a duplex with a family member.\n\nmy boyfriend and i had been looking at houses for about six months. we finally found one we both liked. after the home inspection, it seemed to be out of reach with all repairs it needed. at this point, he wanted to take out the mortgage himself and put me on the deed, with the agreement that the money i got from the sale of my home would go into the new house. he also asked me take out a $20,000 loan to renovate my home to make more on the sale.\n\nsince the original deal fell through, i decided not to look at more homes with him. he is extremely picky and the process was just too much. i told him to go with the realtor and, if he found a property he liked, then i would look.\n\ndon't miss: how to give your home to your children tax-free\n\nmeantime, he is moving my household into a storage unit for easy moving.\n\nthe first time out without me he made an offer on the original house. he refused to show me paperwork and, when i asked him to call the lawyer to see what i needed to sign, he refused. he told me that he was only putting the house in his name and i would still be required to pay money from my sale into the house.\n\nalso see:after my father died, my brother has been pressuring me to lend him money\n\nas an aside, i had been paying all his bills on time so that he would have a better credit score for our future purchase, he paid a nominal amount of rent and i paid all his bills. then he started texting me to buy this or that on amazon, for him or his band.\n\ni had him leave on our fourth anniversary as he told me about his plans to not include me and had not paid his bills for 3 months.\n\ndo i have any recourse on the loan he insisted i take out for renovations? is there anything i can do? i am unemployed. we had no contract regarding rent. i did not sign the contract for the home he is now buying. or do i just suck it up and take it as a life lesson?\n\njobless and boyfriendless in new jersey\n\ndear jobless,\n\nyou got played.\n\nbut don't blame yourself. he drew you in over time and convinced you that he wanted to build a future with you and, perhaps, for a time he did. you trusted him and you believe (or believed) in him. that's a good trait. of course, there were red flags: paying his bills and buying stuff on amazon for his band, pushing you to renovate your home with a $20,000 loan. i trust you can cancel and/or repay it. i hope you didn't give him any large sum of money for this new home.\n\nfinance and romance will forever be intertwined. if you want to know whether someone is on the level, their financial life will give you a good clue. and americans are skittish about such matters. two-thirds of people in a relationship say they would consider breaking up with their partner if he/she had hidden a debt, according to a recent survey of more than 1,100 people carried out by market research firm yougov on behalf of life insurer haven life. any lack of transparency is a bad sign.\n\nread also:this man fathered a child after four dates — and wants to forget it ever happened\n\nanother study found that people found the same photograph of a person more attractive when they're told that he/she is a saver rather than a spender, according to a penny saved is a partner earned: the romantic appeal of savers. people are blank canvasses. we are always at risk of projecting our hopes and dreams onto them, despite all evidence to the contrary. money is a complicated subject for couples and often becomes an issue of power and control, says fran walfish, a psychotherapist in beverly hills, calif.\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\nalso see:here's how to help your children save for college and pay off student debt\n\nit would be a very difficult case to pursue an ex-boyfriend for unpaid rent. this fellow's fiancée wanted him to buy her a second home in her name only, in case they divorced. and this man's wife left him after two days of marriage. you're not the first person to be taken in by romance and charm, assuming he had any. and you certainly won't be the last. given that you could have ended up owning a home with this guy, staying right where you are sounds like a good outcome.\n\nit's a small price to pay.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.

roseanne barr's return to the top of the ratings was a familiar feeling for the star. but it was also shockingly brief. america in 2018, it turns out, is a very different place to america in 1988. in some ways, at least. in other ways, not much has changed for many blue-collar families, many of whom have been described as president trump as the forgotten people.\n\nthe 10th season of roseanne will be its last following barr's racist comment on twitter twtr, -4.96% directed at valerie jarrett, former senior adviser to barack obama. the show-ending controversy in some ways highlights how much has changed — about america and barr herself alike — since the sitcom first hit the airwaves.\n\nthe original series centered on a working-class family living in the fictional town of lanford, ill. when the show premiered, roseanne (played by roseanne barr) was a mother of three who worked in a plastics factory. her husband dan (john goodman) made his living as a drywall contractor.\n\n mortgage interest rates are much better for families today, but income and unemployment levels are not so different. and if she were unemployed today, the roseanne conner wouldn't have a factory job to turn back to. in the show, she worked for uber. \n\nduring its run, roseanne focused on the trials and tribulations faced by families in middle america — it wasn't uncommon for episodes to center on having the electricity cut or scrimping to pay a child's college tuition. here was a post-reaganite economic critique with belly laughs — trickle-down sitcommery, ken tucker, then a television critic for the magazine entertainment weekly, wrote in a review of the show's seventh season.\n\nthree decades after the seminal sitcom, roseanne, first appeared on abc dis, -1.52% on oct. 18, 1988 and became a voice of working-class americans for a generation, it returned to become the no. 1 show on abc. the march 27 season premiere was a hit, with 18.2 million viewers tuning in, and the revival's full run got such good ratings abc planned a second season.\n\nthere is a line — and roseanne barr crossed it tuesday. the network withdrew support for the star with abc entertainment president channing dungey calling her tweet abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with abc's values.\n\nthat second season will never happen now, leaving the original cast — barr, goodman, sara gilbert (darlene), michael fishman (d.j.), lecy goranson (becky) and laurie metcalf (jackie) — and a new generation of actors out in the cold.\n\na lot has changed in america since 1997 when roseanne aired its final episode. mortgage interest rates are much better for families today, but income and unemployment levels are not so different, said heather boushey, executive director and chief economist at the washington center for equitable growth, the washington, d.c.-based think tank founded by john podesta, former chairman of hillary clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nso what has changed in the u.s. since the show premiered in 1988? marketwatch breaks it down:\n\neconomically, matters did not improve for the working class over the intervening years — if anything, they've gotten worse. these days there's a good chance that barr and goodman's characters would be out of work or making less money. the median salary for drywall installers (dan conner's profession) fell from $48,000 in 1997 to roughly $41,000 today after adjusting for inflation, according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics.\n\nas for roseanne conner, after leaving the factory and working odd jobs, she eventually opened a loose meat sandwich restaurant with her sister and a friend during the fifth season. while the idea that most restaurants close in the first year is a myth, the median lifespan for an eatery is only 4.5 years, according to a 2014 report by researchers from the u.s. bureau of labor statistics and the university of california, berkeley.\n\n the housing market downturn would have also hit the conner family hard. illinois had one of the largest legacy foreclosure inventories in the country at the end of 2016 and home values have not recovered as readily in the midwest as in other parts of the country. \n\nif she were looking for work today, roseanne wouldn't have a factory job to go back to, according to john russo, the former director of the center for working class studies at youngstown state university in ohio. she'd be a contingent worker, said russo, also a visiting scholar at georgetown university. these days there's a need to have multiple part-time jobs just to make ends meet for many people. in the show, roseanne conner drove a car for uber.\n\nthe housing market downturn certainly would have hit the conner family hard. illinois had one of the biggest foreclosure inventories in the country at the end of 2016, according to real estate data company attom data solutions, and home values have not recovered as readily in the midwest as in other parts of the country. in fact, the indiana property used for exterior shots in the show went up for sale in 2013 at a list price of $129,000, but is now only estimated to be worth $80,374, according to realtor.com.\n\nstruggling to pay student debt? here's what you need to know.\n\nthe revived series also played to a viewership that has witnessed myriad cultural and political changes in the past few decades. many of these communities have been in a major period of transition both economically and demographically, said valerie wilson, director of the program on race, ethnicity and the economy at the economic policy institute.\n\nbesides being groundbreaking for its depiction of class issues, roseanne was heralded for showcasing actors (barr and goodman) who were overweight. the new york times review of the show's pilot included the following (cringe-inducing) line: together roseanne and dan are a fetching pair of chubbies who think, with ample justification, that they're pretty cute.\n\n while in 1990, no state had an obesity rate equal to or above15%, these days no state has an obesity rate below 20%, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. \n\nwhile these kinds of harsh attitudes to people who are overweight may or may not have changed since 1988, there's been far more research into the effects of obesity on health and mortality. and being overweight is no longer as rare as it was in the late 1980s. while in 1990, no state had an obesity rate equal to or above 15%, these days no state has an obesity rate below 20%, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nroseanne also famously discussed lgbt issues at a time when that was still a taboo subject. marriage equality would not become legal in any u.s. state until six years after the last episode of roseanne aired in 1997. massachusetts was the first state to introduce marriage for same-sex couples in 2003, followed by connecticut in 2008, two decades after the first episode of roseanne aired. in june 2015, the supreme court struck down state bans on same-sex marriage by a 5 to 4 majority as unconstitutional.\n\nas for politics, the show skewered the conservative rhetoric of its time. in one episode, roseanne rebuffs a politician who knocks on her door, promising to bring more employers to her town via corporate tax incentives. so they're going to dump the unions so they can come here and hire us at scab wages, and for that privilege we get to pay their taxes, she quips.\n\nas when the show first hit the airwaves, a republican resides in the white house. but some members of the conner clan are now far more conservative than the show's original run.\n\nwhite, working-class americans have been credited with president donald trump's electoral success, and the success of the show's final season. barr is an avid trump supporter, and her character was portrayed as such, too. roseanne's sister jackie, however, was shown to be a clinton supporter who wore a pussy hat to protest trump's election.\n\nbut some argue that trump has reneged on the promises he made to blue-collar voters — and that disenchantment could still play out on-screen. the show, as it turns out, focused more on the relationships within the conner family.\n\nthat resentment, it turns out, played out in real life on twitter.\n\n(this story has been updated.)
dear moneyist,\n\ni am in a tough moral situation and i don't know what to do. my older sister and brother-in-law have been fighting about money for the past year or so. he is a big spender, not just for himself, but for the whole family, friends, and community.\n\nwhile they make enough money to cover their debt and pay off their credit cards every month, it is still an issue. my brother-in-law would often hide and lie about his spending, and even would put my teenage niece and nephew in the middle by asking them to cover for him. after receiving an unexpected amount of money, he surprised my sister with a new $60,000 car and matching vehicle for himself.\n\n my niece made me promise not to tell my sister if she told me something bad. she told me that her dad, my brother-in-law, has a secret credit card that my sister doesn't know about. he flashes it in front of my niece and nephew's friends. \n\nafter this crazy situation, my sister laid down some new rules to try to keep her marriage and finances together. she recently told me that things were going ok. she was keyed into all of the spending with access to online accounts and better visibility to credit-card spending and accounts. she thought that there was still room for improvement, but the marriage and spending were doing better and she felt like the lying was in control.\n\ni was with my niece this week, and she made me promise not to tell my sister if she told me something bad. i, of course, thought it was some teenage drama so i agreed, hoping that i could give her advice. i was wrong. she told me that her dad, my brother-in-law, has a secret credit card that my sister doesn't know about. he flashes it in front of my niece and nephew's friends, uses it constantly, and is insistent that no one tells my sister.\n\nalso see: yes, america needs to brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus\n\ni don't want to break my niece's trust, but i feel like my sister needs to know about this. i am worried that this type of financial infidelity could end their 20-plus year marriage. is there a way that i can help her discover the card without being the one to overtly blab? if he has a credit card under his name only, is there a way she can find out? i want my niece to be able to trust that she can come to me with tough things in her life, but my sister is my best friend, and i am so torn.\n\nany advice you have would be very much appreciated. thank you.\n\nconfused sister in law\n\ndear confused,\n\nyour brother-in-law is an addict. he gets a kick out of spending money, lavishing others with gifts, and putting his family's finances at risk in the process. there may even be a part of him that wants to get caught. it sounds that way, at least. flashing his credit cards to friends and family is not the best way to keep this credit-card spending going. it's the thrill of buying stuff, and the risk of getting caught that appear to keep him going.\n\nif he wasn't getting himself and his family into debt, he would likely find food, alcohol or other substances, sex, or some other form of escape. unless your sister and her family see this for what it is, it will continue, with or without this credit card. but he needs to want to get help himself. this problem is far bigger than one credit card. if you broke your promise to your niece and told your sister, he would likely find another way of satisfying his addiction.\n\nalso see:george floyd, white supremacy — and the 'otherization' of african-american men\n\nit would, of course, be helpful if your sister discovered his deception and was able to put an end to this particular line of credit, but she is playing a game of whac-a-mole. i don't believe it's worth breaking your niece's trust for that. there are, however, other ways for your sister to discover this latest credit card. you could talk to your niece and tell her what i told you, you could ask your sister how it's going with his spending, and advise her to keep track of bank accounts, or run a credit check.\n\nthis issue is bigger than anyone realizes and, unless there is some kind of intervention, where each family member tells him how it's hurting them, their financial security, their trust in him, and putting the family's finances at risk, it will continue. with or without the discovery of this credit card coming to light, his family would do well to tell him how it's affecting them. his behavior has consequences, and it's hurting others. it's time to break the spell of his spending sprees.\n\nalso see: can you alter your 2019 taxes in order to qualify for the stimulus check?\n\nthere are many options open to him, including a 12-step program for people who get themselves and others into debt, marriage counseling and financial therapists. money is an emotive and emotional issue. our impulse spending is connected to our emotional and mental health. when your brother-in-law spends money and buys himself another gift, he may feel in control and empowered. like anyone on a destructive path, alas, he is actually spinning out of control.\n\nhe needs to analyze the cause of this behavior. whatever anxieties or lack of psychological safety that he feels needs to be addressed. if he felt at home in his own skin, he would not need to seek his thrills with new toys. understanding a problem and showing compassion is the doorway to finding a solution to that problem. but it only opens the door. even with an intervention, he will need to be ready to face his own demons, and admit that this problem is bigger than even he realizes.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published?

the assumption that couples married for two or three decades will follow through with the til death do us part portion of their vows is dead.\n\nthese days, it's more likely to see older couples divorcing than it was years ago. for some, divorcing late in life, also known as gray divorce, is a result of empty nest syndrome, where their kids have left the house and they realize they're not as in love as they once were or lack common interests, while for others it could be involuntary, with one spouse finding someone else.\n\ndivorce these days is more acceptable, said karen covy, a chicago divorce lawyer and author of when happily ever after ends. so the fact that divorce is easier to get and more socially acceptable, and there's a bigger group of people in that age group to begin with, makes for the perfect storm for why this demographic is the biggest divorce demographic.\n\ndivorce for people 50 and older has roughly doubled since the 1990s, according to data compiled by the pew research center.\n\nsue gross, wife of money manager and pacific investment management co (pimco) co-founder bill gross, recently filed for divorce after 31 years of marriage. other high-profile figures who divorced decades after tying the knot include actors danny devito and rhea perlman, after 30 years of marriage; al and tipper gore, after 40 years of marriage; and morgan freeman and myrna colley-lee, after 24 years of marriage.\n\nread: are jennifer garner and ben affleck about to make the best financial decision of their lives?\n\nthough increasingly popular, getting divorced at an older age can be scary for many, especially those who have identified themselves mostly as a husband or wife for so long. finances are turned upside down as couples try to pick apart what belongs to whom, where they'll live and how they'll support themselves independently. families, meanwhile, are mending from hurt feelings and emotional stress.\n\ndivorce can rock anybody's world, but the longer you've been married the longer invested you are in seeing yourself as a married person, covy said. you never thought your world would change or your spouse would bail on you.\n\nin fact, among all adults 50 and older who divorced in the past year, 34% had been in their prior marriage for at least 30 years, and 12% had been married for 40 years or longer, pew's research showed. many later-life divorcees have grown unsatisfied with their marriages over the years and are seeking opportunities to pursue their own interests and independence for the remaining years of their lives, pew said.\n\nregardless of the reason, when it comes to a legal separation later in life, the soon-to-be or newly divorced should prepare themselves:\n\nunderstand your finances\n\none of the most challenging aspects of getting divorced after a long marriage is sifting through the finances, covy said. money that used to support one household will have to stretch to two, and if you're already retired, you may be stuck to a fixed income. understand your finances by creating a cash flow or budget statement and clearly identifying your assets and debts, said sacha millstone, a financial adviser at the millstone evans group of raymond james in boulder, colo.\n\nhomes are part of marital assets, but divorcées should figure out the value of the home and divide it accordingly — though some may want to stay in the house, it may not make sense to value it over cash since a person can't live in a home without funds. social security isn't a concern, as divorcées can claim their former spouse's social security benefits without impacting the other, so long as the person claiming their former spouse's benefits isn't remarried, millstone said. envision what you want your life to look like, and take the time to think about how you want your new life to be, millstone said. you can make proactive decisions and make a realistic spending plan so that you end up in a situation you will be happy with.\n\nsee:my wife is divorcing me after 21 years — and wants everything in our savings account\n\ncan wall street close this gender gap?\n\nfind a comfortable living arrangement\n\nit could be hard to detach yourself from the marital home, especially if it's the home where you raised your children, but in some cases, it just doesn't work to keep it. with a third of baby boomers (people born between 1948 and 1964) single, more are deciding to bunk up with each other, similar to the premise of the '80s sitcom the golden girls. the demand for this lifestyle has been fueled by later-in-life divorces, said bonnie moore, chief executive of the golden girls network, which pairs roommates. if this is the route you wish to take, she suggested you write a written house agreement with house rules and have a lease agreement. if you're buying a home to retire in, have a plan, consider being close to family and friends and know the tax implications of your purchases.\n\nbe flexible, especially when it comes to possibly needing a job\n\nsometimes, even retired people need to go back into the workforce to make a living. this is especially true of women over 65, who risk falling beneath the poverty line. if this sounds like you, consider job-hunting. looking for a job later in life isn't always easy, as older people tend to fight employer biases that they're not capable or interested in working. if you're searching for a job, update your resume with relevant skills and stay physically fit, experts say. you have two choices: bring more money in or spend less, covy said. if you need to get a job, suck it up and do it because what you don't want to have happen is you're 80 years old and eating cat food.\n\ntake the opportunity to appreciate this fresh start\n\nolder divorcées should embrace change, and recognize as an opportunity for a fresh start, millstone said, adding that a lot of women over 60 initiate their divorces for this very reason. divorce means being flexible, covy said, since you'll likely have to change your lifestyle. in some cases, you may need to make compromises, but acknowledge that it isn't too late to live the life you want. as much as it might suck to get divorced later in life and as angry as you may be to be put in that situation, remember you only have a limited number of years left to enjoy this life, covy said. you have the ability to take control of whatever life you wanted.\n\n(this story has been updated.)
there were a lot of fireworks for investors in 2016, so you would be forgiven if you forgot how many big-time buyouts we saw last year.\n\nbut in the wake of the announced $30 billion acquisition of actelion ltd. us:alioy ch:atln by johnson & johnson jnj, -0.12% a few days ago, it's worth revisiting the topic.\n\nfrom the $26 billion buyout of linkedin by microsoft corp. msft, -2.65% to dell/silver lake's $60 billion move to take emc private in the largest tech merger in history, 2016 was a banner year for buyouts. and while a few of those deals were to take companies private, as with emc, the vast majority of deals were from corporations looking for strategic partners, like jnj's bid for actelion.\n\nin fact, data provider pitchbook estimated that corporate buyers shelled out a record $1.7 trillion in 2016 for u.s. and european mergers and acquisitions — about $8 of every $10 spent in m&a last year.\n\nand why not? after all, corporate cash is at record levels approaching $2 trillion. and even though the federal reserve did bump up interest rates again in december, corporations with good credit ratings can get debt remarkably cheaply compared with historical norms.\n\na recent deloitte report indicates that 2016 is only the beginning. when surveyed, 75% of corporate execs said they expect higher m&a volume in 2017 over 2016, and 64% expect deal values to increase as well. a mere 3% of respondents expect m&a volume to decline in 2017.\n\ntop it off with a more favorable environment for mergers under a republican administration, and 2017 should shape up to be a big year for acquisitions.\n\nthis is when driverless cars will hit the road\n\nso which picks are the juiciest morsels for bigger corporations looking to gobble up a competitor? here are five to consider:\n\ncyberark\n\nsome bigger names in cybersecurity tend to get more attention, but the lower profile and more digestible $2 billion market cap of cyberark software ltd. cybr, -4.56% makes it a better bet for a 2017 acquisition. cyberark already has some big-name clients, such as hershey co. hsy, +1.00% , novartis ag nvs, -0.35% novn, +0.39% and qualcomm inc. qcom, -2.89% , but its share price has have suffered.\n\ncompetition has been fierce, and the company hasn't lived up to the perhaps unrealistic expectations of some investors. however, cyberark is one of the rare small-cap cybersecurity companies that is actually profitable — meaning a big tech player couldn't just bolster its client list, but also add some material impact to the bottom line going forward.\n\nbiogen\n\nbiotech stocks ibb, -2.83% suffered some serious pain from mid-2015 through mid-2016, but the industry has stabilized lately. while the epipen price-gouging claims that made big headlines last year rattled the industry, election day brought in a wave of republicans less likely to be as aggressive with price controls. that adds up to high hopes for biotech m&a in 2017.\n\namong the candidates, i like biogen inc. biib, -0.47% best. merck & co. inc. mrk, +0.11% and allergan plc us:agn have already signaled interest, and a huge financial incentive for the ceo should motivate him to make that deal sooner rather than later.\n\ngopro\n\ni think there's potential for gopro inc. gpro, -1.14% to succeed as part of a larger technology company in a strategic acquisition. while gopro has had profitability challenges, its bulletproof balance sheet helps ease the pain; gpro has zero debt and roughly $225 million in cash on the books. while that may not sound like a lot, at a $1.4 billion market cap, that's roughly 16% of its entire value.\n\n3-d-printed cars: the future of automobiles?\n\nyou don't need a big fish like apple inc. aapl, -3.26% for a buyout to transpire. if a midsize company like garmin ltd. grmn, -1.04% or privately held drone giant dji could find a way to streamline operations and rejuvenate gopro, it could pay off big-time for all parties.\n\nmarvell\n\nchip-related companies were a big part of the buyout frenzy in 2016, including japan's softbank corp. sftbf, -3.56% 9984, -1.73% shelling out $32 billion for arm holdings and qualcomm making a $47 billion bid for nxp semiconductors nv nxpi, -4.69% . as consolidation continues across the industry, marvell technology group ltd. mrvl, -5.20% remains a top semiconductor company to consider when ranking the most likely m&a targets of 2017. as a so-called fabless chip maker that outsources production, it's pretty obvious how a larger rival could gain big efficiencies through a marriage with marvell — and since the big semiconductor companies are only getting bigger, it's just a matter of time before this $8 billion company is gobbled up.\n\nperrigo
you might have heard that prince died without a will, which is likely to lead to a major battle over his estate. but do mere mortals like the rest of us, with far smaller net worths, really need a will?\n\ntraditionally, the answer to that question has been an unequivocal yes — particularly if you have a spouse, children or stepchildren. lately, though, some financial advisers have been saying that many americans might not need a will. new york times wealth matters columnist paul sullivan wrote about that provocative view in his article, prince needed a will, but maybe you don't.\n\nwhat a will can do for you\n\ncertainly the simpler you are, the less of a complex estate plan you need, says jeffrey greener, attorney and partner at the law firm rivkin radler in uniondale, n.y. but very few people are simple. if you have minor children, only a will names a guardian for those children. a will or a trust will allow you to name someone to watch over assets for a disabled or elderly family member or someone who may not have the financial sophistication to manage those assets.\n\nyou may think that if you have made beneficiary designations on your life insurance policies, property deeds or retirement accounts, you're covered. well, it's true that those designations will ensure that the right people will receive benefits or inherit the assets on those.\n\nbut who gets the car or great aunt sophie's tea set? or what if you want to bequeath part of your estate to the local animal rescue society? cases like those are where a will is essential.\n\nfamily split over a spoon\n\nwhen a member of your family dies there's a lot of emotion involved, and i have seen families split apart over a spoon, says tim estes, ceo and founder of estes financial services in fort worth. two sisters wanted possession of a single spoon that had been in their family for generations. one sister got the spoon, and the other didn't. they haven't spoken for 15 years.\n\nwhen someone dies intestate — without a legal will — the estate goes into probate, a judicial proceeding that decides the rightful heirs and the distribution of holdings. going through probate can eat up more money than the cost of creating a will, or offer a less-than-perfect split of assets.\n\nfor many families, wills can fill in the gaps of property assignment or beneficiary claims on life insurance policies.\n\nall about family dynamics\n\nyou have blended families, second marriages. mature couples might cohabitate after a divorce or death of a spouse. you may want to provide for that spouse or significant other, but when that person is gone, reroute those assets back to the children from your first marriage, explains greener. i don't want to throw out the assertion that a will is always necessary, but people have to be realistic about their family makeup, their needs and where these assets may go.\n\ngreener says it's all about family dynamics.\n\nwhat's fair is not always equal, what's equal is not always fair, he says. maybe you have to treat your children differently. maybe you have one child who lives here and one child who lives elsewhere so you add the nearer child on all your bank accounts for convenience purposes — even though your idea was to leave everything 50/50 to your children. then [when you die], all those jointly-held assets, in-trust for assets or payable-on-death assets pass to one child. the other child gets nothing. that wasn't necessarily the parent's intent and there are fights over this all the time.\n\na will can include a no-contest clause, which will prevent potential heirs from arguing over its contents. frank sinatra put a no-contest clause in his will because the [total value of music rights] that he owned was probably worth $500 million. if they squawked or balked at anything, they were out. they got bupkis, says estes. if there's any kind of an estate, i recommend including a no-contest clause, just to keep the peace and harmony.\n\nwhere you live matters\n\nwhich state you live can make a big difference here. estes notes that in community property states such as texas, your surviving spouse will only inherit all your community property if all your children are also the children of that spouse.\n\notherwise, your one-half interest in your community estate will pass to your children. if there is any kind of animosity or resentment, they can conceivably force her to sell the house and boot her to the curb, because they own half the house, says estes.\n\nfor snowbirds, if you leave no will behind, that second home or rv could be governed by its location. when people die owning property in more than one jurisdiction they must be aware that the state in which the property lies will control its disposition, says greener.\n\ntaking care of your pets after you die\n\nwithout a will in place, your beloved pet could end up in a shelter after you die, if no one comes forward to accept the responsibility of care. a will can designate a responsible party and allow a smoother transition for the animal.\n\nsometimes we create formal pet trusts within a will, greener says. you want to be able to provide for them financially and make sure they have a caregiver. he recently created a trust for a client's horses and dogs. he has rescue dogs and wants to make sure that they go to a stable and loving home. we allowed for different people to be in charge of his pets because they have different needs and different desires, greener says.\n\nhelping your elderly parents\n\na will could also help your elderly parents avoid losing government benefits if you die before them. if they're beneficiaries of your life insurance policy, a large payout from it could wind up putting a stop to their government benefits unless you put a key provision in your will.\n\nlet's say my parents have limited resources and they may be getting government benefits. if i leave them a gift outright, it may jeopardize their government benefits, the same way if i have a disabled or special needs child [because their newly boosted income will disqualify them], says greener. a will can direct the terms of policy distribution so your parents receive it as a series of payments instead of a lump sum.\n\nan estate plan is not just about passing your wealth to your loved ones, notes greener it's about providing for independence and control as we age. i think you can never go wrong by having these documents in place.
dear quentin,\n\nmy boyfriend of 10 years and i became acquainted because i was his tenant. he is 25 years my senior. i agreed to continue to pay rent because he told me that i would get the house when he died. to be fair, i also was not going to be able to move because the rents in my area began to skyrocket, and as a young single mother i wanted to work part-time so that i could care for my (then) young son.\n\nin the years that followed, we started two businesses together using the property that he owns. one was a short-term rental in a unit of the duplex house that we live in, and the other was a theater. both were very popular. however, i did a lot of unpaid labor to get the businesses started, as well as day-to-day operations. i did make some money managing the rental and received tips from working the bar at the theater, but my boyfriend kept the rest of the money.\n\n 'he began taking part of my commissions without telling me. he also started treating me like an employee and not like a partner.' \n\nat the time, this arrangement was fine because there were discussions that the money on the rental would go to renovating the house, turning it into a single home for us to share. but he quit his day job and lived off the money instead. he then began taking part of my commissions without telling me. he also started treating me like an employee and not like a partner. all of this was very upsetting, and we have had a lot of difficult conversations about his behavior.\n\nsince the pandemic, we have had to close our businesses and he has had to go back to work. i started an apparel company in 2019, but the pandemic has affected that business as well, so i have been living off of unemployment benefits. i have a congenital heart condition, and i do not feel comfortable looking for work until i have been vaccinated. i have not paid rent since august 2020. i helped get long-term tenants to occupy the short-term rental, in addition to my labor preparing the property for their occupancy.\n\ni have begged my boyfriend to sit down with me and look at the numbers. he has never once been willing to show me the mortgage, taxes and insurance payments, nor have we had a real discussion about money. every time i bring it up, the conversation ends with a promise of something that will happen in the future. however, i no longer think that any of it will happen. every time i feel we have reached an understanding, he will say or do something that contradicts it, leaving me feeling very confused.\n\n 'he has never once been willing to show me what the mortgage, taxes and insurance payments are monthly nor have a real discussion about money.' \n\nif i had known then what i know now, i never would have not gotten involved with this man, and the two businesses we started together would have never happened. i worry that with the real-estate market the way that it is right now, he will be tempted to sell one or both of his properties without consulting me. since we don't have any agreements on paper, i am wondering how i can protect myself from losing out in this arrangement. i have been led to believe that i am making investments with my time and money.\n\nsix months ago, i became very frustrated and made a few spreadsheets: one documenting the rent i have paid over the last 10 years, one for all of the unpaid labor, and another documenting anything i felt he has paid for me (which isn't much). i sent it to him and explained that i felt he did not value my contributions, and he complained that i had sent him a bill. i didn't think of it like that, but rather as a negotiating tool for what i felt i have invested in the businesses, property, and ultimately our relationship.\n\nwe live in louisiana, and while we have never made any formal arrangements, we have been in a committed, monogamous relationship for over a decade. i want to protect myself in the event that this relationship were to end, either through separation or an untimely death (mine or his), but i don't know what leverage i actually have legally. any thoughts or advice you have are welcome.\n\nfeeling exploited\n\nthe moneyist:we were friendly with our neighbors for decades, until recently. one day, they introduced us to their financial adviser…\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear exploited,\n\nyou are both living in the same house and working side by side, but you are also living in alternate worlds. you may be in a committed, monogamous relationship, but you are not quite committed to the same things.\n\nyou are committed to helping him start his businesses and turning his property into a money-making enterprise, while living there on below-market rent, and dreaming of a future where you marry and commingle all your financial assets.\n\nhe is committed to you helping him to start his businesses and turning his property into a money-making enterprise, while you live there on below-market rent, and never telling you outright not to dream of a future where you marry and commingle all your financial assets. he has a girlfriend and an employee whom he pays in promises and sweet nothings and commissions, until he decides he wants them for himself. it's a win-win for him.\n\n you may be in a committed, monogamous relationship, but you are not quite committed to the same things.  — the moneyist\n\nthis is more a game of cat and mouse than a love affair. if you were partners in business or in life, there would be something on paper. there is nothing on paper. that is not an oversight or something that belongs on a to-do list. that is entirely by design. when you wrote, he quit his day job and lived off the money instead, i thought, well, of course he did. you must judge people not by their dreams or promises, but by their actions.\n\ni don't believe you are entirely a victim of his financial malfeasance or romantic misdemeanors, and i urge you not to see yourself as one either. it will help you see your part. you knew nothing was committed to paper. you were not an employee or a partner, and he can't steal a commission if you have no legal standing. you say you would never have gotten into a relationship with him if you knew then what you know now. but he only had to obfuscate once to reveal himself.\n\nyour boyfriend sounds more of a lazy scoundrel than a sophisticated con man. your growing impatience was, i suspect, confirmation of what you knew all along. your doubts grew, but the evidence was there very early on for you to see and act upon. he showed you who he was from the very beginning. ask yourself why you accepted this. was it lower rent at a vulnerable time in your life, companionship, romance and/or the promise of financial security?\n\n he can wait you out for another decade, or more. it costs him nothing to do that. he holds all the cards. \n\nhe can wait you out for another decade, or more. it costs him nothing to do that. he holds all the cards. sure, he can feign outrage: how could you be so crude as to calculate every last red cent? you have reduced our 10 years to these unseemly transactions. i thought i meant more to you than that! or: this is not the right time to pressure me about marriage, especially when you seem so terribly unhappy, and we are in the midst of a pandemic. if you feel this way, why do you stay?\n\nhere is one way this could shake out: you finally reach your breaking point, perhaps threaten to leave him, his house and his businesses. you finally walk out the door, quietly hoping that he comes to his senses and realizes what he is about to lose.\n\nand next? he yet again takes the path of least resistance, shows you who he is for the very last time, and does exactly what he has done for 10 years to move this business partnership and relationship forward: nothing.\n\nthe moneyist:my

dear moneyist,\n\nmy dad passed away unexpectedly last february at the age 56. my mom, age 52, two siblings, 28 and 23, her nephew, 5, and i miss him very much. my dad had a $300,000 life-insurance policy that my mom was fortunate enough to receive.\n\nwith the proceeds she paid off the mortgage, credit cards and some personal loans. the remainder (approximately $140,000) she deposited into a savings account. she also inherited dad's retirement savings of $45,000, which is sitting in an ira.\n\nthis past year i have been helping my mom get her arms around her current and future finances. my mom works and receives a net income of $2,000 a month. in helping her, i found that most months she runs a deficit. she will pull from her savings to cover gaps.\n\nmy siblings and nephew live with my mom. they don't pay my mom rent or help out with the bills. i know my siblings experience financial hardships. my mom pays for all utilities and groceries. she also regularly covers their cell phones, car insurance, and child care.\n\nalso see: i discovered through ancestry.com that my biological father is someone else — can i claim an inheritance as his heir?\n\nmy mom has a very hard time talking about money in general, but especially with them. i've suggested several times that she needs to charge them some sort of rent. she immediately clams up and gets very agitated.\n\nmy sister, 28, flat-out refuses to pay anything. my brother, 23, says nothing at all. my dad's view was to help anyone regardless of the cost, a noble thought but not sustainable. my mom wants to honor this, but also ensure she can be independent.\n\ni need help to know how to approach the subject with my mom and siblings. i tried several times to various degrees of success, but nothing has changed. i have been fortunate to have financial stability, which (i feel) makes my family embarrassed and self-conscious about their situation.\n\ntherefore, when i try to help, my siblings think i'm a know-it-all when i'm just trying to impart tools that have worked for me. i feel that this has dragged out long enough. resentment crops up in me, like when my sister gets a fancy new cell phone or manicure, or pays for her subscriptions.\n\ni need a way to get the message to resonate. my mom can't continue to support them and we can't continue to ignore the situation just because it's uncomfortable. what do you suggest i do?\n\ncaring son and brother\n\ndear caring,\n\nyou have identified the major symptoms of your mother's problem: your siblings and cousin living off her generosity and, perhaps, her passivity. if she is ignoring her financial problems and/or has the disease-to-please to make everyone happy, you may need a different approach.\n\ni suggest employing a financial adviser who can go through your mother's accounts objectively. sometimes, families need an outsider to provide clarity and advice without the familial baggage. a best friend might tell us what we need to hear, but we may only hear it from, say, a therapist.\n\nalso see: 'we're in a happier place now!' my husband wrote a secret will when our marriage was rocky — should i now write one too?\n\nif you want a different result, you will have to take a different action. come at this problem from a new angle. look at the cause and the result rather than the symptoms. your mother is the cause, not your siblings. they will ride her coattails as long as she allows them to do so.\n\nbut even your mother may not have considered the ramifications of her actions. her retirement and quality of her long-term care are at stake. she needs a new voice to give her tough love: rather than tell her what to do, show her what she will be unable to do in the not-so-distant future.\n\nrecommended: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nshe is allowing these adult-children to jeopardize her future. when the money runs dry, they will either look for a new mark or wallow in misery together. in her retirement, she will not be able to travel and do all the things she presumably loves doing. personal loans will not help her then.\n\nwhat if she gets sick? we are all temporarily abled: if we are lucky, we will live to an old age and have a good quality of life. but that's not always the case. an adviser should help make her aware of this. a good scare before bedtime and a timeline on when the well will run dry may finally wake her up.\n\nfailing that, you cannot live her life for her. sometimes, the hardest thing to do is to let go.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

dear moneyologist,\n\nour local public golf course charges a fee of $3 for advance reservations. i agreed to play with an acquaintance who made the reservation. when we arrived to play on saturday, the pro shop charged us both the regular fee for 18 holes of golf (around $45 each), but charged only my partner the $3 reservation fee. they did not charge me the $3 fee, but we only discovered this later.\n\nafter the golf was finished and we had gone our separate ways, he texted to tell me that i had forgotten to pay him my half of his reservation fee, since i never paid my own $3. i apologized and said that i would pay him $1.50 the next time we played. he said he was going on vacation and persisted. he asked if i used venmo. i said, no, what is venmo? he said, ask your kids. my friends and i use it to settle up when we buy tickets.\n\ni registered for venmo and sent him $1.50, but i felt like the request was rude and small-minded. am i being too sensitive? should i play with him again?\n\navid golfer and onetime venmo user\n\ndear golfer,\n\nthis was his $3 fee to pay, not yours. you can pay your $3 the next time you play golf there.\n\nwhen we socialize with friends we sign up to a social contract. we are polite, we ask how they are, we don't ask each other intrusive questions, we respect each other's personal boundaries and we show up when we say we will. in terms of finance, we remember to repay money we owe each other, we offer to pay a little more if we had a dessert or a glass of wine and our friend didn't (if they say, let's split it 50/50, we demure) and we try not to borrow large sums of money, or get antsy over a tiny sum. navigating money and friendship is complex.\n\nalso see: can i use a coupon-for-two during a double date?\n\nmy marketwatch colleague jillian berman previously looked at this penchant for stinginess among some users of venmo, a mobile payment service similar to paypal that allows you to transfer money to your friends. she wrote that cheapskate-itis is more than just a fear of not ever having enough. (hillary clinton grew up with very little and some have posited that her post-secretary of state side career earning millions of dollars giving wall street speeches could have been fueled by this formative experience.) did your golf buddy's father or grandfather grow up in the great depression? even if he did, the moneyologist isn't buying this as an excuse.\n\napps don't nickel and dime people. people nickel and dime people. venmo is great for settling debts. forget your wallet, but not your phone? boom! here's half the check sent to you before we even leave the restaurant. no small bills? boom! i'll venmo it rather than telling you that i'll give it to you later when (as often happens) we will both forget who owed who what. but insisting on a $1.50 payment after playing 18 holes of a golf, which wouldn't cover the tip on a bar tab afterwards, is downright curmudgeonly. they didn't charge you the $3, but now you have to pay half of his?\n\nread:my husband's credit rating is ruining our marriage\n\nfind another golfing partner. someone who nitpicks over this fee might also nitpick you to death over a missed putt or dispute your golf handicap: $1.50 is a small price to pay to avoid that.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear quentin,\n\ntwo years ago, my sister called me from a divorce-settlement meeting without a lawyer. her soon-to-be ex-spouse had a lawyer there. she was being pressured into giving up her portion of his pension that she was legally entitled to (their marriage was over 20 years). she was freaking out, in tears and realized she needed a lawyer.\n\ni told her to leave that meeting and get a lawyer. afterward, she asked me for money to pay for the lawyer and promised to pay me back. i testified for her regarding other marital financial issues (i was executor of our father's estate, in which her husband had made false statements on his entitlements to some of her inheritance). she thanked me again and again in front of her lawyer and promised to repay me.\n\n 'she borrowed another $5,000 from an aunt for a child-custody battle, which she lost.' \n\ni am not wealthy and did not have $4,780 on hand, but i have good credit and used my line of credit. it will be two years in may and i have not received any payment. she was supposed to give me some monthly payments and lump sums at tax-refund time. last year's excuse for no tax-refund reimbursement was that she borrowed another $5,000 from an aunt for a child-custody battle, which she lost.\n\nshe earns $90,000 to $95,000 a year, but this year's excuse is that she is in arrears for child-support payments. she is not destitute; she is a financial idiot and partier. i do have texts saying she will pay me back and others that say she has no money. she swore before thanksgiving this year that she would start paying me in january. january came and went, no payment.\n\nduring a text discussion in early february, she informed me about her child-support arrears (so no lump payment from her tax-refund again) and is only planning $25 per month repayments when she could. that plan doesn't cover the interest on the loan, and even if i was ok with covering the interest, it would be more than 20 years.\n\ni told her that was not acceptable, and that she left me no choice. i didn't say what action i would take. so i am planning to take her to small-claims court, and garnish her wages. the virginia statute of limitations is two years, so i need to do this by early may. now the financial idiot sent me a check for $25.\n\nif i cash it, would it extend the statute of limitations? should i cash it? what is the best approach? also, she is a social-media junkie; on her facebook and instagram, there are multiple examples of vacations, drunken outings and other expenditures since may 2019 that could have helped to dig her out of the financial heap.\n\nthere is a capability to reimburse, but zero will. any advice is appreciated.\n\ndeadbeat's sibling\n\ndear sibling,\n\nonly gamble what you can afford to lose. only invest what you can afford to lose. only lend what you can afford to lose. i don't believe you will be getting this money, so i advise you to write it off as a bad debt sooner rather than later. sure, try the small-claims court, but failing that there will come a time when you will have to say enough is enough: i tried to do the right thing, she didn't repay it, and i can't change her. i do have questions about what you hope to achieve.\n\n 'i see two unhealthy patterns: your sister's grifting and your gifting. each serves a purpose.' \n\nif she repaid you the principal sum, would you then start to feel similar rumblings of injustice over the interest? if she repaid you with interest, would you then suffer pangs of annoyance over the hoops of fire she made you jump through in order to be repaid? after all, you were doing her the favor, right? how dare she put you through this. and, thirdly, what is this $4,780 worth to you? it's already been two years of self-righteous fury, stress and anxiety.\n\nnone of this should come as a surprise to you. i see two unhealthy patterns: your sister's grifting and your gifting. but each of these serves a purpose. yes, your sister reactivates the statute of limitations by repaying a small part of the loan and, thereby, acknowledging that she still owes you money — five years for breaching a written contract or three for an oral contract, but talk to a lawyer about that. when it does, this tortured game of cat and mouse begins anew.\n\nhow far are you willing to go to retrieve this debt? how long will you pursue it? and aside from the prospect of knowing that you are still in with a shot of getting the $4,780 back, what do you get out of feeling perpetually angry and frustrated at your sister? does it reaffirm that you are the principled, upstanding one in the family? or does pursuing your sister for this money remind her on a daily basis that she appears to be incapable of keeping a promise?\n\n 'in order to truly move on, you too need to take responsibility for lending it to her in the first place.'  — the moneyist\n\ni ask you these questions for a reason. of course, she's behind on child support. you already know that your sister is a dramatic (and possibly irresponsible and/or reckless) person who has learned how to leverage her alleged victimhood to her advantage. she may see herself as a victim of a bad marriage, cruel husband, biased judicial system, and any other circumstance that does not include her own choices and actions.\n\nyour sister may or may not accept responsibility for borrowing this money, but in order for you to truly move on, you too need to take responsibility for lending it to her in the first place. few could fault you for wanting this money back. but in the game of life, you already win. you are the sister who endeavors to keep her word, look out for others, and be the adult in the room. your sister loses. you get to be right. your sister is wrong. and, for exactly $4,780, everyone else will see that.\n\nyou are not a credit company or debt collector. you are, for better or for worse, her sister. i understand that you would like this money back, but many people lead uneven, tumultuous lives. you may also ask how this unrelenting pursuit of money from such a person serves you. after you do that, ask yourself if you have done what i hope you had originally intended to do — ease some of your sister's self-doubt and anxieties and, ultimately, help her chaotic life run a little easier.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nthe moneyist: 'warren buffett and harry potter couldn't get those two retired early': our spendthrift neighbors said our adviser was 'lousy.' so how come we retired early?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
lgbtq people have more negative feelings about personal finances than their heterosexual counterparts, according to a new poll. what's more, they are less financially equipped for emergencies and retirement.\n\nmore than half of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning people feel anxious about their personal finances, compared to 41% of heterosexuals. personal finance makes 42% of lgbtq people feel depressed, versus 31% of heterosexuals; meanwhile, lgbtq people were 7% more likely to feel shame about their finances. lgbtq people were also more pessimistic (35% to 28%) and less optimistic (43% to 52%) about their financial futures.\n\ntheir heterosexual peers, however, felt more confident (51% to 41%) and more in control (57% to 49%) of their finances. the morning consult survey of more than 6,600 people, commissioned by the lgbtq-oriented wnyc podcast nancy and conducted in late january, included 778 lgbtq respondents.\n\n 1 in 4 lgbtq respondents said their sexual orientation or gender identity had impacted their personal finances versus 14% of heterosexuals; 25% said they'd faced financial issues because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \n\none in four lgbtq respondents agreed that their sexual orientation or gender identity had impacted their personal finances, compared with 14% of heterosexual people. and 25% of lgbtq people agreed they had faced financial challenges because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, versus 13% of their straight counterparts.\n\nthose challenges appear to include losing financial support from friends and family: 21% of lgbtq respondents said they could no longer rely on that help after telling loved ones and friends about their sexual orientation, while 20% said the same of disclosing their gender identity.\n\nwhat's more, a slightly larger share of non-queer people signaled they had an emergency fund (55% to 49%) — and more of them felt they were saving enough or had saved sufficient funds for a comfortable retirement (28% to 20%).\n\nlesbian, gay and bisexual people are more likely to be poor, according to ucla's williams institute, which would obviously support the morning consult's findings. young adults in the lgbtq community are more than twice as likely as their non-lgbtq counterparts to experience homelessness, research shows. lgbtq people also have more student-loan debt than the general population, on average.\n\none theory: they may not have received the same financial support from their families and may be more likely to manage their finances alone. the great recession may have made them more vulnerable to losing their home.\n\n marriage equality in the u.s. was only introduced in june 2015 in a supreme court decision. the netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage in 2001. \n\nlegal and societal acceptance for lgbtq couples has moved at a relatively slow pace. marriage equality was only introduced in the u.s. in june 2015 in a supreme court decision. the netherlands became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage in 2001; denmark legally recognized same-sex partnerships in 1989 and marriage in 2012.canada was the first country in the americas to introduce same-sex marriage in 2005.\n\nthe 2015 supreme court decision enabled same-sex couples to marry and inherit property without paying punitive rates of tax and receive federal benefits that other married couples were entitled to under the law.\n\nresearch shows that lgbtq americans face discrimination in the workplace. more than a quarter of transgender people say they've lost a job because of bias, according to the national center for transgender equality.\n\nin june 2014, the supreme court overturned the 1996 defense of marriage act, opening up federal benefits to same-sex married couples. it heard two cases: hollingsworth v. perry, the successful challenge to california's proposition 8 measure, a 2008 ballot initiative that banned gay marriage in that state; and a new york case, u.s. v. windsor, which overturned doma.\n\n research shows that lgbtq americans face discrimination in the workplace. more than a quarter of transgender people say they've lost a job because of bias. \n\nin the latter case, new york residents edith windsor and thea spyer married in canada in 2007 after 40 years together. spyer died in 2009 and windsor was required to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes on her wife's estate. windsor died in 2017.\n\nworkplace discrimination remains particularly problematic for transgender americans. former attorney general jeff sessions issued a memo in 2017 saying that the justice department will no longer argue that transgender people are protected against workplace discrimination by existing civil rights law.\n\nthat memo reversed an obama administration policy that said bias against transgender individuals was a form of sex discrimination, thus entitling them to protections laid out in title vii of the civil rights act of 1964. title vii's prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination between men and women but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status, sessions wrote.\n\nthe trump administration is also considering a new policy that threatens to strip civil-rights protections from millions of transgender people nationwide. but transgender americans already face an uphill battle when it comes to securing employment.\n\nthe department of health and human services is leading an effort to define gender as either male or female, based on the genitalia a person is born with. the move would remove federal recognition and protections under existing civil rights law from more than 1 million transgender americans.\n\n(quentin fottrell and jacob passy contributed to this story.)

court is adjourned — but these judyisms will live on.\n\njudge judy shocked her roughly 10 million daily viewers on monday, as judy sheindlin revealed on the ellen degeneres show that the 2020-'21 season will be her courtroom show's last.\n\ni've had a 25-year-long marriage with cbs, and it's been successful, sheindlin told degeneres. next year will be our 25th season, silver anniversary, and cbs, i think, sort of felt, they wanted to optimally utilize the repeats of my program, because now they have 25 years of reruns. [indeed, she earned $100 million in 2017 from selling the rights to her library of more than 5,200 judge judy episodes to cbs viac, -0.09% , according to forbes, and is the highest-paid tv host in the country.]\n\nsheindlin isn't hanging up her robes for good just yet, though — she'll be back on the air the following year with a new show, judy justice, about which she wouldn't share details beyond it's going elsewhere than cbs.\n\nsheindlin, 77, who's worth an estimated $400 million, commands $47 million a year for judge judy, thanks to the sharp tongue, quick wit and zero tolerance policy for b.s. that have made her a household name — not bad for a former new york family court judge who was once living a manhattan studio apartment with her husband — complete with a murphy bed. (today, they've got homes in nyc, beverly hills, greenwich, conn. and naples, fla.)\n\njudge judy sheindlin accepts the lifetime achievement award at the 2019 daytime emmy awards. getty images\n\nso in honor of the next chapter of sheindlin's career, here are five of her biggest lessons and pieces of personal-finance advice that she's shared in and out of her courtroom.\n\n1. you've got to put in the work. nothing gets her honor more incensed than someone with no good reason for being unemployed. some of her most popular judyisms include a variation on, do you have a job? well, get one! and she's even less forgiving for parents, saying: if you have children, you have to do whatever it takes to support them. that's your job. as far as landing work, she recommends playing to your strengths: find something that you're naturally good at, find out how to make a living at it, she's said.\n\n2. make yourself indispensable — and get paid for that. sheindlin infamously didn't negotiate her $47 million a year salary, according to a new york times magazine interview last year; she dictated it. every three years, she has dinner with the president of cbs television distribution, and she hands him an envelope with the salary that she wants for herself and her show's staff. and that's because she knows she's made herself indispensable: she is judge judy, after all, and her product is a ratings winner -- even beating the oprah winfrey show in its last few seasons. in order to negotiate your own worth you have to make yourself indispensable, she told megan kelly in 2018. once you're indispensable you set your own rules.\n\n3. don't. lend. people. money. if a bank won't give your friend or family member money, why should you? sheindlin has mused on her show. she's also cracked, do you know when a gift becomes a loan? when the relationship is over. seriously, love and money get complicated — just check out the moneyist's column, or these other cautionary tales. if you do want to help out a relative financially, consider these tips. and always get your agreement in writing, or keep receipts if you purchase something for someone — judge judy generally rules on the sides of those who can provide hard evidence.\n\n4. don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining. in other words, cut the b.s. — she can see through it, and so will many other judges, employers and people you're trying to impress, and she'll be quick to cut you down. stupid is not written on my forehead, she often says. other judyisms on honesty include her yelling liar, liar, pants on fire! and baloney! you'll want to show her due respect, as well — the honorable judge judy has called out plenty a plaintiff and defendant for not dressing appropriately for court, or for saying yup instead of yes. you only have one chance to make a first impression, and if that first impression is a crummy one, you are clawing your way out for a very long time, she told katie couric.\n\n5. it's never too late to make or remake yourself. if you didn't make it in your 20s, you can make it in your 30s. if you didn't make it in your 30s, you can make it in your 40s. and if you didn't make it in your 40s, you can make it in your 50s, she said at the forbes women's summit a couple of years ago. every stage in life can be an adventure. take her word for it: she became a tv star at age 52, when judge judy debuted.\n\n(honorable mention: um is not an answer! as in, um is not an answer! you've got to file your taxes!)\n\nand here are some other famous judge judy one-liners from over the years.
retirement is being rethought: playing lots of tennis, golf or bridge, while living modestly so we don't run out of money, might have been an acceptable plan when lives were shorter.\n\nnow, the early go-go years of life's fourth quarter can last two decades, especially if we retire early. a life of pure leisure may not be financially possible—and it might even be a bad idea mentally, emotionally and physically. as we look beyond the current uncertainty of the coronavirus, we should prepare for what's likely to be a longer and healthier retirement than previous generations enjoyed.\n\nlet's say you're fairly confident you have the money needed to support yourself for the rest of your life, so work is now optional. without a sense of purpose and a thoughtful plan, you may be more susceptible to bad decisions, including financial, marital and health mistakes. to help you avoid key pitfalls, here are five pointers.\n\ntip no. 1:consider a part-time job, becoming a consultant or taking a volunteer position. this could help you feel useful and might be a good option for meeting people.\n\ncurrently stuck at home? use this time to figure out your game plan. the coronavirus has reinforced the value of strong connections with others—preferably those with positive but realistic attitudes.\n\nas you ponder working part time in retirement, you'll likely be able to leverage your current career. for example, attorneys or accountants might do some consulting. a retired executive could coach professionals on their way up or mentor local small-business owners through an arrangement with the community college. a former chef might begin a blog or podcast that focuses on food and wine. if you've always loved history or art, you could work as a guide at a museum or historical site.\n\nthis fire couple was down $232,000 as of april 1. here's their plan\n\ntip no. 2: guard and cultivate your mind. in our contentious 24/7 media environment, we need friends and activities to help us stay balanced. but it's also important to minimize time spent with negative people and to refrain from dwelling on the world's problems.\n\nhere's a real-world example: a client of mine was having heart problems. his cardiologist helped him discover that part of his problem was attending a weekly men's group that spent time fretting over the world's dysfunction, compounded by watching too much cable news. for 30 days, he stopped attending the men's group and gave up certain news shows, choosing instead to spend time with his most positive, can-do friends. he is now off his doctor's heart attack danger list and off most of his medications. during the current pandemic, he's selectively calling and zooming with those people in his men's group who energize him with their upbeat attitudes.\n\na great way to focus on the positive side of life is to work on your emotional quotient, or eq. this is the measure of a person's adequacy in such areas as self-awareness, empathy and dealing sensitively with others. studies have shown that eq is a better predictor of career success than iq, or intelligence quotient. better eq skills can help us build a stronger network of friends during retirement.\n\na healthy sense of curiosity also helps build friendships and enhances mental health. for instance, read something new and different every day. learn a new language. dig into a historical documentary or take a course at the local library or community college. be both interested and interesting. challenge yourself.\n\ntip no. 3: nurture existing friendships. early in retirement, we need close friends who can help us feel useful and important at a time when we might feel the loss of our career identity. the importance of friends, especially share almost anything friends, was a key finding in our research with aging thought leaders and hundreds of people approaching—or already in—their fourth quarter.\n\nloneliness has become an epidemic. most people don't realize how important it is to keep up with old friends.\n\ntip no. 4: find new friends. amid the coronavirus shutdown, this is difficult, but it'll be easier once life returns to normal. for instance, simply going to the gym can connect you to new people. don't just hang out with the silver sneakers group. try to engage with younger people, especially if you don't have many in your current circle of family and friends.\n\nsome of our clients use old school networking, participating in church and community events. others have used meetup.com to find people who share their interests. volunteering is a great way to meet people. find a group whose mission you really believe in and see how you can help.\n\nwhat happens if you don't tend to your existing garden of friends, while also seeking to add new friends? there's a risk that, in life's fourth quarter, you could become overly dependent on your spouse or life partner.\n\ntip no. 5: find the right balance with your spouse. there's a reason the old saying i married you for better or worse, but not for lunch rings true. in the past, when lifespans were shorter and the slow-go years quickly became no-go, an overly needy spouse was a problem, but not usually fatal to the less needy spouse or the marriage.\n\nread: this is why baby boomers are divorcing at a staggering rate\n\nwith longer go-go and slow-go periods, neediness can be toxic for both partners and sometimes leads to gray divorce, which is fast growing and a major threat to maintaining financial independence. one of my partners and i presented our thoughts on gray divorce—and how to avoid it—at a 2018 conference. click here to view the presentation.\n\nthis column originally appeared on humble dollar. it was republished with permission.\n\ndennis stearns is a certified financial planner, a partner at stearns financial group and the author of fourth quarter fumbles: how successful people can avoid critical mistakes later in life.
wading into partisan politics (without a pair of duck boots) has landed l.l. bean in the crosshairs.\n\nwith post-election tensions high, l.l. bean is in the spotlight thanks to linda bean, an heiress to the bean fortune, company director and fan of president-elect donald trump. bean had donated at least $30,000 to a pro-trump political action committee that was only allowed to accept $5,000 from her, federal election commission filings show. (news of the discrepancy was first reported by the associated press.) for her part, bean indicated on fox and friends on jan. 12 that she had only donated $25,000 to the committee.\n\nliberals like those behind the online campaign #grabyourwallet, which is organizing a boycott of brands doing business with the president-elect and his family, are calling on their ideological allies to avoid buying from a brand that bears the last name of the fervent trump supporter. in response, the incoming commander-in-chief tweeted on jan 12, encouraging his supporters to buy l.l. bean products as a sign of support.\n\ntrump professes loyalty to the camping- and outdoor-gear maker that portrays itself as an american heritage brand. since being founded in 1912 in freeport, maine, the bean brand has maintained a manufacturing facility in the united states, a rarity for a company that sells across product categories. l.l. bean's 200,000-square-foot flagship store in freeport juxtaposes the efficiency of corporate america—it's open 24/7—with small-town charm. the company boasts that it has never locked the store's doors.\n\nl.l. bean has tried to distance itself from controversy over the linda bean largesse. it responded by saying that linda bean was one of 50 family members involved in the business, and, in a jan. 8 facebook fb, -1.64% post, executive chairman shawn gorman wrote, l.l. bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. simply put, we stay out of politics.\n\nbut in an age of global supply chains, the situation may be more complex than both parties portray. l.l. bean has a facility in nearby brunswick, maine, where local labor produces some of the company's most iconic products, like the signature duck boot. it also has a thriving export business: it did $1.5 billion in sales in 2015 and sells in serves 200 countries, with canada a fast-growing market.\n\nl.l bean has moved to appeal to a younger and less middle american demographic. since 2010, it has held a wintervention tour, sending a truck shaped like its duck boot to college campuses in the northeast, hardly conservative hot spots. l.l. bean reportedly imports 75% of its merchandise from overseas, and at least some of its clothing is produced in china and vietnam, according to sourcing data supplier panjiva. consumer advocate and former presidential contender ralph nader wrote in 2011 that over 90% of the goods featured in an l.l. bean christmas catalog were not made domestically. (l.l. bean did not respond to request for comment.)\n\npotential boycotters, on the other hand, should note that snubbing l.l. bean could have a negative effect on employees regardless of their feelings toward trump. for instance, the majority of the company's 50 u.s. retail stores are located in blue states, including new york and massachusetts. factory workers in l.l. bean's foreign manufacturing plants could be hurt, as could those at the almost two dozen boutiques it operates in japan. (and it's not the only americana-celebrating brand that makes goods overseas. so does jeans brand levi strauss & co. and computer company apple aapl, -3.26% , among many others.)\n\nwhat's more, a sustained boycott of a brand is also tough to carry out. consumers will continue to shop at l.l. bean because of the quality, fitting and sizing of clothes and footwear that they offer, says ayako homma, an analyst at euromonitor international. for instance, comedian whoopi goldberg separated personality from politics when she ended a two-year boycott of fast-food brand chick-fil-a, which the gay-rights supporter had avoided after chick-fil-a's president, dan cathy, made the remark that supporting same-sex marriage was inviting god's judgment, which some considered homophobic.

one of the biggest issues for college students — and their bill-footing parents — is whether they will really graduate in four years.\n\nat the university of pennsylvania, where i teach, the four-year graduation rate is about 100%. but penn is one of the nation's super-elite universities.\n\nif you go to an elite state university, you'll find four-year graduation rates for full-time students are considerably less. at penn state, for example, it's 65%. the average for u.s. college students is 40%. add in those who need five or six years, and that only gets the average up to 60%.\n\nwhat do those additional years of college cost? tuition may not be that much, as most students who stay beyond four years don't need many more credits to graduate. but the college board calculates that living expenses for college students on average are about $17,000 for nine months. if we just look at that cost, u.s. students are spending over $15 billion a year to stay around that fifth year.\n\nthen add in student loans. some 60% of all college students borrow to help cover the cost of education. except for subsidized federal loans, interest accrues from the day you take the loan out, and with private loans, you may have to start paying them back the day you take them out, whether or not you ever graduate.\n\none of the things you're buying at the elite universities with their hefty tuitions is a lot of support to get into a cap and gown in four years. there are a lot of things that cause students to struggle in college and delay graduation that are completely predictable: a lack of social support, not wanting to be in that particular college, getting in over your head in courses you aren't prepared for, and general life problems of young people anywhere, such as a lack of self-esteem.\n\nbetter colleges have programs that help students succeed, including freshmen seminars, or small classes dedicated for freshmen taught by a real professor, not a graduate student. they get to know what you're doing. they can sense when you're having trouble.\n\nread:47% of high school grads aren't prepared for college\n\nit might be surprising, but a lot of undergraduates, maybe the majority, way overestimate their abilities and take courses that are too hard for them. many schools — not just the elites but now also flagship state universities — have programs that help head that off.\n\nmore generally, students and their parents should consider whether a college has a supportive atmosphere where students regularly interact with adults and have structured opportunities to interact with each other, such as in small living centers. that support heads off emotional trouble and helps provide help for all kinds of difficulties.\n\nthis is the place you want to spend your time and money to boost the odds of a good return on your education. remember, the worst outcome is dropping out of school laden with debt.\n\nread:the richest 25% of american families account for more than half of all college graduates\n\nthe second-worst outcome is taking a very long time to graduate. even if students don't get derailed by college life and tough courses, they can be delayed by not being able to get into courses to complete requirements for their majors.\n\nthis is a risk that can be assessed pretty easily just by looking at those requirements. the more there are and the more of them that involve prerequisites (this has to be taken before that), the more difficult it is to complete the major.\n\nread:ask a millennial: the most important things to consider when choosing a college\n\nthe final effect of expensive college years is how they can affect career and life choices after. that is especially so when there is more debt. one of the things we know from empirical evidence is that people in debt choose different career paths — and they're not necessarily the career paths that they would have chosen otherwise.\n\nfor example in law school, a big proportion of students coming into law school think they want to do public-interest law. by the time they graduate and look at their debts, they end up working for private firms because that's the only way they can pay off their loans.\n\ncollege debt also affects life choices. the most obvious of these is the possibility of going to graduate school, which can be next to impossible for individuals who already have a lot of debt. student debt also delays marriage and home purchases.\n\nstudent loans are expensive: the cheapest, federal subsidized loans charge 3.4%, but the borrowing limit is $3,500 in the first year (it then rises, reaching $5,500 a year for juniors and seniors). unsubsidized federal loans charge 6.8%, and the new federal loans that parents can take out for their undergraduate children charge a whopping 7.9% along with an initial fee of 4.2% of the total value of the loan. that more than doubles the total cost of the loan over a 10-year period.\n\nread:parents borrowing to send kids to college skyrocketed over the last two decades\n\na college education these days is a big investment, one that can cripple a student and their family financially if they aren't careful. the biggest risk factor in that investment is also one that can be managed if we are careful, and that is making sure the student graduates and does so on time.\n\npeter cappelli is the george w. taylor professor of management and director of the center for human resources at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia. his latest book is will college pay off?

love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how issues surrounding money impact our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nmarried couples are making room for roommates.\n\nsometimes, multiple roommates. just ask kelsey riley dixon. the 29-year-old business owner and her husband, a semi-pro kayaker, share a four-bedroom home with three male roommates to reduce costs in the very expensive city of seattle, she says. it allows us to have a home in a really expensive city with a deck, a backyard, a basement — and we are able to pay half the rate that we would living on our own.\n\n stephanie, a 28-year-old pr professional, was only able to afford to move to san francisco in 2017 because a married couple offered her a rent-controlled room in their apartment. \n\none big motivation for having roommates: having extra money to travel. the couple recently spent nine months in chile, peru, australia and new zealand. we don't want to spend that much money on rent. this [having roommates] aligns with our values. we'd rather use that money for travel, she says. and she adds that not only does having roommates help financially, it's also fun and rewarding.\n\nthey're part of a growing trend: the number of married couples living with roommates has doubled since 1995, according to a recent report from real estate site trulia. about 280,000 married people now live with a roommate — and that's particularly true in pricey cities like those on the west coast.\n\nthe reason: housing costs a ton. in honolulu and orange country, calif., the share of married couples with roommates is between four and five times the national rate. san francisco, los angeles, san diego and seattle also have sky high rates of married couples with roomies. those same cities all have well above average rental and housing costs (trulia notes that housing costs in all these markets have risen more than 30% since 2009), with residents of uber-pricey san francisco requiring more than $123,000 in income to live comfortably, one study showed.\n\nwhile only a small share of married couples live with non-family members, the ones that do often take on roommates either as a financial strategy to cope with housing costs or as a means of assisting others burdened by housing costs, trulia reports.\n\nlogan allec, a 30-year-old santa clarita, calif., resident, and his wife had a roommate when they first got married. we had an extra bedroom upstairs with its own bathroom and a little living area and we charged $850 a month, he explains. we were in our 20s and that was a nice chunk of change.\n\nbut pretty soon allec's wife wanted more privacy for their budding marriage. about a year ago, our roommate took a job some 50 miles away and moved out — and my wife couldn't have been happier, allec jokes. and now that the couple is expecting a baby, getting another roommate is off the table, even though allec, a cpa at money done right, loves getting the extra money from renting. a new roommate plus a new baby would be a little much, he says.\n\nbut that situation happens too. stephanie, a 28-year-old pr professional who asked that we withhold her last name, was only able to afford to move to san francisco in 2017 because a married couple offered her a rent-controlled room in their apartment. and thanks to that great deal, she's still living there today — even though the couple now has a 6-month-old baby who sleeps in the room next to hers. it's a great 3 a.m. alarm, she jokes of the middle-of-the-night crying.\n\neven so, she's likely staying put, because not only does she like the couple, she says she's unlikely to find anything else affordable. there are so few options that are less than $2,000 a person and i am still trying to pay off student loans.\n\nof course, problems can arise when singles move in with a married couple. thirty-four-year-old ashley patrickrecalls the time that she and her husband rented out their upstairs room to a friend so they could afford their house payments during a tough time financially. the roommate — who they loved — sometimes did things they didn't love. he would pee in the middle of the night but wouldn't turn the light on so he'd get pee on the bathroom floor, patrick recalls. we were living with a bachelor and he was a mess.\n\nstill, she says, they loved his sense of humor, and ultimately are glad they had the roommate, as it helped them afford to keep their home. we were both starting out in our careers, and that [having a roommate] helped us get through those [financially tough] beginnings, she says.\n\nif you're single and thinking of either moving in with a married couple or vice versa, keep a few things in mind. elizabeth lombardo, psychologist and author of better than perfect: 7 strategies to crush your inner critic and create a life you love, says it's essential in this potentially fraught situation to set ground rules that you all agree on (dixon, her husband, and their roommates all have a chore wheel that dictates who does what when) and keep the communication open. finally, look for ways to make things work. don't keep score. taking steps to make things easier for your roommate, partner and you will make things much smoother, she adds.
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nflashy men are not fooling anyone. least of all, women.\n\nmen who drive fast cars and like to live large are regarded as being more interested in short-term hook-ups or affairs than marriage. that's according to a study by daniel kruger, a faculty associate at the university of michigan and jessica kruger, a clinical assistant professor at the university at buffalo in new york, and published in the academic journal evolutionary psychological science.\n\n both men and women rated the man with the flashy car as being more interested in brief sexual relationships and gave him low marks as a potential family man. \n\nin the study, two groups of undergraduate students rated two fictional men on their perceived dating and parenting skills, interest in relationships and attractiveness to others. both men had the same budget, but frugal dan said spent his $20,000 on a car for reliability, while flashy dave said he spent $15,000 on his car and used $5,000 to pimp his ride with larger wheels, a paint job and a sound system.\n\ndon't miss:this cornell sociologist says he's found the secret to a happy marriage\n\nmen and women rated the man with the flashier car as being more interested in brief sexual relationships and gave him low marks as a potential life partner or family man. the frugal guy—who didn't feel the need to paint his car and add more bells and whistles—received top marks as a potential life partner, parent and provider by both genders, the study found.\n\ncompared to women, men have a greater tendency to conspicuously display their wealth, the researchers wrote. this is consistent with their typical role as providers and is thought to be a way for them to advertise their intentions about a relationship. across cultures, a woman's preference for a certain partner at a specific time reflects the type of partnership she is considering.\n\nhow ai and video could transform the online dating industry\n\nwealthy men and women look for different things\n\nwealthy men and women have different priorities when it comes to choosing a mate, previous research concluded. men with higher incomes showed stronger preferences for women with slender bodies, while women with higher incomes preferred men who had a steady income or made similar money, according to a 2016 survey of 28,000 men and women aged between 18 and 75.\n\n men with higher incomes showed stronger preferences for women with slender bodies, while wealthy women preferred men with a steady income. \n\nthe study was conducted by researchers at chapman university in orange, calif., and was published in personality and individual differences. women felt it was more important that their partner made at least as much money as they did (46% versus 24% of men) and had a successful career (61% versus 33% of men). men favored a fit body (80% versus 58% of women).\n\nalso see:i paid off my wife's student loans — she filed for divorce after two years of marriage\n\nand men with more education also had stronger preferences for female partners who were good looking and slender, whereas this was not a concern for women. some 95% of men with an advanced degree said it was essential that their partner was good looking versus 77% of those with a high school education or less, that study found.\n\nslender bodies are associated with youth as the body's metabolism slows as one grows older and, as such, could represent fertility for men, while women pay attention to things that enhance their security and survival, and that of their family. cultural factors, of course, can greatly influence the extent of these preferences, the researchers theorized.\n\n(this story was republished on feb. 14, 2019.)
dear moneyologist,\n\nmy ex-husband had two life insurance policies that named me as the beneficiary when we divorced. i asked that this be retained during his lifetime and the beneficiaries would be our son and daughter. this also was written up in our divorce papers.\n\nhe called our son and daughter at his retirement and told them they would need to start paying the life insurance policies and that he could no longer afford the monthly payment. the amount was $25,000 per person and the monthly payment for each of our children would be between $200 and $300 per month.\n\nalso read:you need more life insurance and it is probably much cheaper than you think\n\nhe did remarry and has an adult son by this marriage. he told them he had a life insurance policy made out to each of them: his current wife and their son. we have a good relationship. i am friends with his wife and son. i don't want any trouble. our divorce took place 26 years ago.\n\nsince this was written in our divorce finalization papers, can he still be held in contempt of court for this?\n\nconcerned ex-wife\n\ndear ex-wife,\n\nyes. it's unlikely, but certainly possible if a judge ruled in your favor and he failed to comply.\n\nit's not at all uncommon for a spouse to fail to comply with a divorce decree over a life insurance policy. in previous cases, one spouse (often the husband) cancels the life insurance policy, replaces it or changes the beneficiaries. there are several issues here. firstly, it is your former husband's responsibility to pay for the life insurance policy and not fob off the payments to his children. to strong-arm his own children to make payments is not acceptable.\n\n it is your former husband's responsibility to pay for the life insurance policy and not fob off the payments to his children. to strong-arm his own children to make payments is not acceptable. \n\nsecondly, he told his second wife and son that he has a life insurance policy with them named as beneficiaries. it could be that it's a different policy and might help explain why he wanted his first two children to make payments for the life insurance policy written when you were married. it's not clear from your letter if there are one or two policies. i understand that you don't want trouble, but he has created this situation and you owe it to yourself and your children to stand up for yourselves.\n\nthirdly, those monthly payments seem expensive. either he is over-inflating them or he was sold a really expensive product. as one of our members wrote on the moneyologist facebook group: i am an attorney in the insurance industry. in eight years, if he just saved that same amount without interest, he would have $25,000 in an account. my husband, who is the most out of shape old guy i know, has a $2 million policy and pays $7,200 a year. this math doesn't add up. these estimates for a $25,000 are a fraction of what your husband says is due every month.\n\nhere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\nshenanigans surrounding life insurance policies and divorce decrees are all-too common. in this 1996 case in michigan, pernick vs. brandt, the husband took out a $50,000 life insurance policy as per instructions in his divorce decree, canceled it and took out a second $100,000 life insurance policy with his new wife as beneficiary. he died and his first wife sued. the court ruled she had an equitable interest in the policy, even though his second wife may not have known about the first policy.\n\ndon't miss:10 years later, my sister still hasn't distributed $100,000 in stock from her ex-boyfriend's will\n\nin 2013 in hillman vs. maretta, the u.s. supreme court ruled in favor of a 66-year-old man's ex-wife (rather than his widow) as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth over $124,000. in this case, he may not have wanted his ex-wife, who he divorced 10 years before his death, to claim his life insurance policy. but with or without a divorce decree, the document given to the insurance company had his ex-wife's name on it.\n\n should adult children be beneficiaries? yes, if that's what the divorce decree states. whether or not that makes them entitled (i don't think so either) is a separate issue. \n\nlast year, this woman wrote to me to say her husband's divorce decree stated that he shall maintain a $300,000 life insurance policy for his children from a former marriage until they reach the age of 23. however, on the actual policy he only listed her as the beneficiary. she asked, what would the legal liability be on this if he should pass before me? again, i told her that her husband would be in contempt of court because divorce decree trumps the new name on the policy.\n\nyour children are your proxy here — receiving the money you would have received under the terms of your divorce, so i have no problem with them receiving this, albeit modest, amount. one last thing: your children should not be paying their own money every month towards this policy. those payments are vastly over-inflated, as i said. that should stop today. should adult children be beneficiaries? yes, if that's what the divorce decree states. whether or not that makes them entitled (i don't think so either) is a separate issue.\n\ngiven that it's $25,000 — a deposit on the median price of a home in many states — it's up to you to decide whether you think this issue is worth pursuing.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

moneyist update:\n\non thursday, anonymous wrote to the moneyist about her fiancé. he is 55, divorced with two adult children and recently refinanced his home. she is 35 and almost debt-free. she owns her home free and clear, has a young daughter, and will have paid her last student loans off within two years.\n\nin a nutshell, she wanted to buy a new home together, he wanted her to move into the home he shared with his ex-wife. and, despite the fact the he is leaving his home to his two adult children, he suggested she help him pay off the mortgage.\n\nthe reaction on the moneyist facebook page was swift and her fiancé took a lot of flack.\n\ni asked her to get more information on his emotional and financial state. i also waved a red flag: the one red flag: his request for you to help him with the mortgage over the next 15 years seems unreasonable, especially if this home will ultimately be inherited by his children. name-calling is another no-no.\n\non friday, anonymous made her decision:\n\nno. 1: she now calls herself looking forward to my happily ever after one day.\n\nno. 2: she's moving on with her life.\n\n 'yes, i love him. however, i love myself more. and my love filters down to my daughter who is my priority and obligation.' \n\nhere is her response:\n\nfirstly, i'd ike to say thank you to all that took the time to comment on my letter. i appreciate every person's contribution and words of advice. i've learned a lot in this situation and no experience is ever a waste of time. there are indeed a lot of red flags but the hard stop was asking me to contribute financially to a property that i will never have ownership of. yes, i love him. however, i love myself more. and my love filters down to my daughter who is my priority and obligation.\n\ni understand that people want to protect themselves after failed marriages and relationships and i honestly believe that's what his intent was. the problem: you can't be in a marriage/relationship with anyone if you are only in it to benefit yourself. people don't want what they are, they want what they're not. the glitz and glam of a 20-year younger and successful woman was absolutely appealing to him. what's in it for me?\n\nthe moneyist: when your partner wants to live with you for free\n\n 'it takes a lot more than love for a successful relationship. so the next step is putting my energy and time into getting back out there to meet new people.' \n\ndating can be difficult as a single mom and when an opportunity presents itself i want to ensure that i have done everything possible to make it work, but some things are just impossible and unrealistic. we all know it takes a lot more than love for a successful relationship. that's only one component. so the next step is putting the energy and time that i was putting into that relationship into getting back out there to meet new people.\n\ni am in my prime years. i have a successful career. i am a beautiful woman inside and out. i have come too far in my life to go backwards.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
summer travel may be crazier than usual this year, and credit card gamers are to blame.\n\nthe past 12 months have been an arms race between issuers offering flashy travel credit cards, according to gerard du toit, a boston-based partner at the consulting firm bain & company, who is the head of the firm's banking practice in the americas. the industry is experiencing, he said, very, very aggressive offers. a spate of recent luxury credit cards come with generous rewards and expensive annual fees, so customers are more likely to make sure they get their money's worth.\n\nchase's sapphire reserve card jpm, +1.45% made headlines this year when more than 900,000 people signed up for it between september 2016 and november 2016. (chase declined to confirm that number.) american express axp, -1.55% also followed chase's lead by offering a new version of its platinum card, which recently boosted its sign-up bonus from 40,000 points to 60,000 points. both cards are made from metal. so many people applied for it that the company reportedly temporarily ran out of embedded metals.\n\nif every customer met the minimum spend to unlock just the sapphire reserve card's 100,000 point sign-up bonus — later reduced to 50,000 points — they would have roughly 91 billion points to spend, an equivalent of more than $1 billion, the personal finance website nerdwallet calculated this week. (chase declined to confirm that number, but said in its 2017 investor day presentation that more than 10.4 million people opened new chase credit-card accounts in 2016.)\n\nwhy the bank of the future will look like an apple store\n\namerican express declined to say how many people have signed up for the platinum card. the company previously told the wall street journal it experienced a small increase in the number of consumers who closed their platinum cards during the two-week period when chase launched the sapphire reserve. but after that initial drop-off the card recovered and there are more platinum card members than any time in the card's history. we've been pleased with the continued growth of our platinum card member base, a company spokeswoman told marketwatch.\n\nthere will likely be fewer 'rewards seats' this summer\n\nthe likely result? a whole lot of travelers trying to use their points before year-end, du toit said. in fact, about half of people who sign up for credit cards with sign-up bonuses — which also come with hefty annual fees — ditch the card after the first year, bain found.\n\nsummer travel will likely see an unprecedented surge, which may create never-before-seen competition for airline seats this year, said george hobica, the president of the travel site airfarewatchdog. airlines don't increase award seats merely because more people have more miles, he said in an email. it will be even harder to find award seats.\n\nbooking travel as far in advance as possible is one way to solve that problem, hobica said. but if it's already too late, calling airlines rather than attempting to book online could help as not all offers are posted online and, if nothing is available, consumers may be able to book last minute, since that's when airlines often release their last few award seats. another tip: many airlines hold back cheaper flights from their flights-only online booking to pair with vacation packages, hobica said.\n\nsee also:these are the times you shouldn't book a flight with points\n\nthe industry may compensate for the surge in credit-card points if there are more blockbuster credit-card offers next year. because credit-card issuers have realized many consumers only want to game them by using the card's sign-up bonus and then canceling it, credit-card companies will continue to experiment to see what perks and types of rewards actually keep customers loyal, du toit said.\n\none way they could do that: making points easier to redeem, not only for travel, but at check-out for retailers, said michael landau, the payments lead for the financial technology practice at professional services firm pricewaterhousecoopers. on amazon amzn, -3.37% , for example, it's possible to check out with credit card points.\n\nin chase's case, the company has focused on offering rewards beyond the sign-up bonus, including an annual travel credit for the sapphire reserve card, said pam codispoti, the president of chase branded cards. the company also guards against credit-card gamers by declining applicants who have applied for multiple bank cards in a short period of time. we're in it for a long-term, committed relationship, she said. we're going for the marriage and not the love 'em and leave 'em customers.\n\nthe industry faces a new dilemma with an increasing number of luxury credit cards hitting the market, including citi's prestige card, often considered a competitor of the sapphire reserve and american express platinum. card issuers and banks must be able to keep the cost of their loyalty programs low enough to be sustainable, landau said, and if they lose customers shortly after gaining them, that won't be possible. as a result, the generous offers may start to dwindle. this might be looked upon later as a golden age of points, he said.
i swore i would never remarry after my wife died from complications related to frontotemporal dementia and lou gehrig's disease at 53. the personality-altering disease took a toll on me as well. but that was 2014, and this is now.\n\nlike many caregivers, i met a wonderful partner in my dementia support group. (linda's father has late-stage alzheimer's disease.) she invited me to coffee after liz passed and our conversations flourished into a love affair that continues to deepen.\n\nwhy i didn't want to remarry\n\ni made it clear at the outset that i had no desire to remarry. i told linda that i never wanted to face caregiving again, that i didn't want to take a loved one for granted again and that i needed to preserve as much of my estate as possible for my two children, one of whom has autism. she didn't object.\n\nyet thoughts of marriage continue to tug at me. i'm 62. linda's 56. we love one another. but it's the practical questions about getting married late in life that prompted me to bring up the subject with my financial adviser.\n\nas russ weiss, a certified financial planner with the marshall financial group in doylestown, pa., says when older couples raise this issue: it's not just, should we move in together or should we get married. the decision can significantly affect their finances.\n\nhow marriage could make things easier\n\nin our case, linda has two adult children from a previous marriage, earns very little money working in infant care at a montessori school and has a subsidized health care policy because of the affordable care act. i believed i could make things easier for her through marriage: she'd be covered by my health policy (for a modest payment) through my work at the star tribune newspaper where i'm an editor, and would be eligible for a share of my pension upon retirement, which i expect will be in three to five years. i hoped marriage would give me a small tax benefit by filing my income taxes jointly.\n\nadvice on getting married late in life\n\nmy financial adviser and tax accountant, scott beers of lottsa financial in minneapolis, congratulated me on finding a loving partner. but he surprised me when he said marriage might be a bad idea, fiscally speaking, for linda.\n\nit would throw her into a higher tax bracket. also, after i retire, give up my employer-sponsored health insurance and go on medicare at 65, linda might find that as a couple we made too much money for her to qualify for a subsidized health care plan.\n\nscott offered to run the numbers if we ever seriously contemplated the idea of marriage.\n\nwhy cohabitation among people 50+ is up\n\napparently, we're not the only older couple who may be dealing with issues like this. according to the pew research center, the number of cohabitating adults age 50 and older rose 75% since 2007—faster than any other age group. that's at least partly because money is a major bar against marriage for older adults.\n\ni don't think there's much to recommend getting married from a financial point of view, said brad johnston of the johnston group, a financial advisory firm in minneapolis.\n\nthe advantages of staying single and living together\n\njohnston said it often makes sense for older couples to remain single, especially when considering estate matters and children from prior marriages, which can complicate financial planning.\n\npepper schwartz, a university of washington sociologist described as aarp's love and relationship expert, has seen how marriage and cohabitation among older couples affect their finances. she recommends older couples contemplating marriage speak with a financial adviser and an attorney experienced with elder law or estate planning in the state where they plan to live.\n\ngetting married is a wonderful, romantic thing and it comes with certain rights as well as certain obligations, schwartz noted. it's a dollars and cents exercise you'd have to take a look at.\n\ntoo expensive to get married?\n\nshe mentioned a couple she knows who got married in their early 60s. they had significant financial assets and their first tax bill as a married couple went up by around $40,000. they got divorced, she said. they realized it was just too expensive for them to be married.\n\nfrederick hertz, a lawyer with offices in oakland and san francisco and co-author of living together: a legal guide for unmarried couples, said many of his clients believe that marriage demonstrates a deeper commitment than living together. some also choose to marry because they want their adult children to take their relationship seriously, he noted.\n\neven so, it's increasingly common for older couples to live together without getting married, hertz said, partly because that's become more socially acceptable for boomers.\n\nhertz cautioned, however, that whether it makes economic sense to marry depends on facts specific to the couple.\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nthe effect on debt\n\nhe cited the case of a female client in california with a large tax debt and student loans. generally, if she were to marry, her spouse would not be liable for her premarital debt. but california is unusual, because both spouses are jointly responsible for any debt that affects community property, whether it was incurred before or after the marriage.\n\nin addition, hertz said, if she remained single, a portion of her debt could be discharged (canceled or forgiven by a financial institution) based on her finances. but if she got married, the couple's joint income would eliminate that possibility.\n\nsocial security, pensions and alimony\n\nhertz also offered this advice to older couples contemplating marriage, regardless of where they live: if you're receiving social security, a survivor's pension or alimony income, evaluate how marriage would affect that income. if you're a widow getting a survivor's pension, for example, you could lose that income by getting married. then, if the new marriage ends in divorce, you could find yourself on the rocks.\n\nmarriage also could affect other financial benefits and obligations.\n\nif you're gay, living with hiv and participating in a low-cost drug program, hertz said, marriage to a wealthy partner might disqualify you from the program due to your new joint income, driving your cost for medications to thousands of dollars a month.\n\nor if you have children in college who get financial aid, a new marriage might drive up your income, rendering them ineligible.\n\nlong-term care implications of marrying\n\nthere may be long-term care implications, too.\n\nweiss gave the example of his male client who makes a substantial salary. his partner receives social security and is beginning to have cognitive problems. if she were to marry, weiss said, their combined income would render her ineligible for medicaid, which would ordinarily help pay for her long-term care. her husband would then become liable for the cost, which can easily run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nthe top consideration for most older couples contemplating marriage is how it would affect social security, weiss said.\n\nin his own case, his girlfriend doesn't make much money, but both he and her ex-husband make a good living. if her ex-husband were to die and she remained single, weiss said, she'd get his social security survivor's benefit. but if they marry, she'd lose that.\n\nwe can probably get more out of social security by living together, weiss said.
dear moneyologist,\n\nmy 20-year-old daughter has been living with a 24-year-old man for the last year, and has just announced their engagement. my wife and i do not approve of their cohabitation or intended marriage, because we have deep concerns about the character of this man. ever since she met him, she cut all meaningful and emotional ties with her family and many friends. i find him to be repulsive, and lacking the basic courage to meet with me man-to-man when i recently invited him to lunch to try and start a dialogue. they asked for our approval to get married over the thanksgiving holiday, which i refused to give based on their behavior and lifestyle choices over the past two years, which my wife and i have found so disrespectful and hurtful.\n\nmy wife and i are seeking professional counseling to help us walk this difficult road of trying to be supportive of our daughter while being totally against what we see as a controlling and manipulative relationship. we recognize there is nothing we can do to stop them from making and learning from their choices, as we all do eventually. but i don't have to reward their decision with a financial gift upon my passing either. i intend to alter my will to exclude my daughter from receiving any portion of my estate, unless she is no longer married or living with this man. i may, however, include some financial gifts for any future grandchildren in the form of college funds or iras. i don't want any part of my estate to go to, or be in control of, this coward and thief she wants to marry. what say you?\n\nname withheld\n\ndear husband/father,\n\nthe moneyologist says you can do anything you want with your money.\n\nwithout knowing any of the parties, i would have to say that there are two potentially controlling people in this situation: there is the man who may or may not be usurping some or all of your daughter's time and there is the man who wants to punish her for making this choice. on this basis, your daughter is drawn to characteristics that may be all-too familiar. if you cannot make her pay for marrying this man while you are alive, you will do so after you are gone. you may not like him, you may never like him, but you will lose your daughter if you continue to insist that she does as you wish. she is 20 years old. she will make mistakes.\n\nhave you made the extent of your feelings known? if so, you have helped to create an environment where this man — himself only 24 — is more likely to decline your invitation to talk. typically, invitations are issued in the spirit of goodwill. you want him to acknowledge you. yet you have called him repulsive, a coward and a thief. they're strong words. he may be these things or it may be that you feel like he has stolen your daughter's affections or, indeed, your daughter. but a thief is someone who walks into a bank and asks the teller to hand over the money — not asks for the hand of the woman he loves.\n\nthe intersection of hurt feelings and financial penalties are never pretty. i recently received this letter from a man who chose to issue a letter to his children on thanksgiving announcing the end of an annual cash gift because (a) he felt one of his children lacked fiscal responsibility and (b) he believed his daughter-in-law tithed too much money to church.\n\nread: should my daughter elope or have a big wedding?\n\nresponses were mixed at his actions. but the solution worked for him and i supported him in that decision. in that case, he treated all of his children equally. (i haven't heard back how that thanksgiving dinner went.) another woman wrote to say that her mother was giving her sister too much money. yet another man wondered if he should divide his father's estate or keep it (as his siblings were excluded from the will).\n\nwhether or not you learn to accept your daughter on her own terms — and vice-versa — it's probably a good idea to think about any future grandchildren's education and retirement accounts. that's forward thinking and generous of you. setting up trusts for them and depositing money in those trusts on a yearly basis (up to $14,000 in 2015 without having to file a gift tax return, although there is a gift tax exclusion for education) would also reduce the size of your estate and the taxes that will fall due upon your death. in the meantime, if she marries this man and you receive an invitation, don't do what he did. lay down your arms (and last will and testament) and walk her down the aisle. not being there for a family member's wedding could end this father-daughter relationship.\n\nthere is no easy solution here. it gets trickier to maintain control over other parts of your estate if you deed it to relatives. for instance, leaving property to your grandchildren or daughter would be more complicated than merely setting up a trust, says brandon bellew, a lawyer in clearwater, fla. if you deeded it to your grandchildren, your daughter would be guardian over this asset if her children were minors when you passed away. if you left your home to your daughter, it could be deemed marital property, depending on the laws of her particular state. in other words, it could belong to both your daughter and her husband, regardless. like people, the law can be stubborn and refuse to bend to our will.\n\na psychologist once told me that over control leads to lack of control. that was in relation to a jar of cookies. but i think the same principle applies here, too.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, regifting, or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist.
since 1970, the new york city pride parade has become a huge demonstration and celebration for the lgbtq community. its cancellation this year — a first in its long history — is especially difficult since 2020 marks the march's 50th anniversary.\n\nbut the show of pride must go on. and it will go on, a number of new yorkers said, with a heightened sense of unity with the black lives matter movement whose urgent protests are echoes of pride's roots in an uprising.\n\nit's incredible to see the solidarity that's happening right now gathering around the black lives matter movement, said benj pasek, an award-winning songwriter who will load up his own festivities when the parade steps off virtually on june 28 with a music playlist in which love is a recurring theme.\n\nultimately, pride is based on a protest against police brutality, and it's comforting to me to know that there are so many members of the lgbtq+ community who are fighting for the rights of our friends and colleagues in the black community, pasek said. that fight is alive and well, and we honor our history by being a part of fighting the injustices that are occurring today.\n\nin addition to songs of love, the power of protest will guide pasek, who with composer justin paul, has won an oscar for la la land, a tony for dear evan hansen, and a golden globe for the greatest showman. outcry looms large following the police killing of george floyd in minnesota.\n\nthis year, pasek added, i'm going to try and be as active as possible in looking for ways to use pride's roots as a means of connecting to what's happening today. i want to use my voice to link these protests that are both fighting for justice.\n\npasek, 35, who lives on the upper west side of manhattan, isn't alone. other members of the lgbtq+ community are doing likewise. they're looking back to stonewall demonstrations of 1969 and connecting the dots to the black lives matter movement.\n\nthroughout our nation's history, we have been made better by the voices and protest of black leaders and #pride is no different, new york city council speaker corey johnson tweeted on june 1.\n\nthe first pride was a protest against police brutality towards lgbtq people, spearheaded by marsha p. johnson, a black trans woman, and sylvia rivera, johnson added.\n\nrivera was a latin american gay liberation and transgender rights activist.\n\nas we enter #pride2020 let's remember that in fighting for lgbtq people, the fight must be just as much for black lives, johnson noted. we might not be able to march the way we normally would, but we can continue to 'march' in spirit and action in the name of equality for all.\n\nalso see: in vulnerable communities, lorena borjas was who you turned to for help\n\nlast year, which marked world pride day and the 50th anniversary of stonewall, the event drew an estimated 150,000 marchers in manhattan — twice as many as for a typical year — and some 2.5 million spectators cheering from the sidelines.\n\nthis year's march leaves the streets of the city behind for a virtual special broadcast event — a 50th anniversary of the first pride march held in 1970. it airs on abc on june 28 from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nsee: new york city's daily infection rate dwindles to 1%\n\nthough it will be a very different type of celebration, the tradition of commemorating the lgbtqia+ will continue, notes the organizer nyc pride in a statement. in this unique year, nyc pride is committed to saluting front-line workers alongside several leaders in the community. the event will feature performances by janelle monáe, deborah cox, billy porter and others.\n\norange is the new black actress, pioneering comic and activist lea delaria, 62, has been a frequent participant in nyc pride march. i have a very deep connection. my first new york pride was 1986, she said, adding that she's marched, been a rally host and served as grand marshal. she draws a direct line between pride and black lives matter.\n\nstonewall was a riot. the first gay pride was a riot, she said. bricks were thrown through windows. there would be no gay pride if it wasn't for a riot.\n\ndelaria, welcomes anger, urgency, and politics to the annual parade. the same ingredients reverberate in f--- love, her 2019 show being live streamed on june 18 by joe's pub at the public theater as part of its monthlong pride celebrations.\n\ni went to the parades early on because they were protest marches and demands for our rights, delaria said. a few years ago, especially around marriage equality and what happened in orlando [mass shooting at a gay nightclub], i feel we've gone back to a sort of rageful protest. so i've come back to pride. don't get me wrong, i love the party. but protest is the most important thing.\n\nactress, author and transgender activist shakina nayfack, 39, agrees. pride is about queer resilience, it's a celebration of difference and inclusion, nayfack said. it's also about community, and with most of us stuck at home this june, we need that experience of joyous connection now more than ever.\n\ncorporate america will also be part of virtual events, considering the economics of pride and what's been called the pink dollar. lgbt consumers spend $917 billion every year on goods and services.\n\nthere's talk every year about whether pride is too corporate, said jonathan d. lovitz, senior vice president of the national lgbt chamber of commerce. well, that being on full display, advertising themselves as a place where anyone can work, where anyone will be welcomed, where their support for our community is more than just dollars, it's about opportunities.\n\nnot only do lgbt people spend over $917 billion on goods and services every year, but over 70% of those purchases are determined by what we think about corporations' commitment to our community, lovitz said. if we know you stand with us, we're willing to reward that with consumer loyalty.\n\nbroadway actress lauren patten, 27, who co-stars in the alanis morissette musical jagged little pill, now on a pandemic pause, said she'd miss in-person pride events. it is really meaningful to me to walk the same streets around stonewall during pride, said patten, who lives in lower manhattan. it is a tangible connection to our history.\n\njagged little pill producer eva price, 41, whose credits include tony-winning revivals of oklahoma! and angels in america as well as the original musical dear evan hansen, feels the sense of the past.\n\nit's important to remember and celebrate all the forebears who fought for gay rights, and human rights, throughout history before us, said price, who lives in the east village.\n\npride is not just a celebration and a fun day to hang out with your queer friends, patten added. it is a thank you to our marginalized ancestors who rose up against systemic discrimination and demanded a safe place in this world. we must honor them. pride is also still a fight.\n\ndon't miss: as biden widens polling lead over trump, here's who could be his vice-presidential pick\n\namid the fighting there is room for optimism, judging by a song on the pasek parade-day playlist. it's o-o-h child, a 50-year-old hit by the five stairsteps.\n\nsomeday we'll walk in the ray of a beautiful sun, the lyrics promise. someday when the world is much lighter.\n\nin the meantime, pride, protest, and solidarity all march on.
american women are facing a much bigger retirement crisis than men. they are likely to earn less during their working lives, and then to live longer after they retire. and if they take on extra unpaid responsibilities instead of paid work, such as looking after children, elderly parents, or — most financially devastating of all — a sick or disabled spouse, the problem gets even bigger.\n\nso reveals a recent study from the national institute for retirement security, a think tank.\n\nhow bad is it if i withdraw from my 401(k) during the pandemic?\n\nand it raises the issue of what people can do about it—both as individuals, taking responsibility for their own retirements, and together through public policy.\n\nolder women receive approximately 80 percent of the retirement income that older men receive, report researchers tyler bond, joelle saad-lessler and christian weller.\n\nthe 20% gap between men and women's average retirement income, says the nirs, is about the same as the 'gender pay gap' during working years.\n\nthe gap really gets worse in later retirement, as more women become widows, they note.\n\nwomen experience a steep decline in income past 80, they write. women age 80 and older are much more likely to be widows... health care costs and long-term care costs in retirement are challenging for most people, but can be more so for women, who bear these costs for longer and may have already spent down assets if their spouse predeceases them.\n\nthis isn't new. women with husbands who are 2.5 years older should expect to be the sole breadwinner of their households for over a decade, says diane garnick at tiaa.\n\nsandra gilpatrick, a financial planner in boston who specializes in helping female clients, says many women are caught in a vicious circle. women are still the primary care givers to both their older parents and to young children, she says. trying to balance a job with care giving obligations is a losing workforce proposition.\n\nif women work fewer hours, they earn less money and miss out on promotions. they also have less money available to sock into their 401(k) or equivalent. oh, and if they earn less money over their careers they'll also get a smaller social security check, she adds.\n\nlabor economists note the gender pay gap has multiple causes, such as career and life choices, in addition to direct sexual discrimination. regardless, it's there and the effects on retirement can be severe.\n\nwomen earn less than men, on average, during their careers. women who take time out to raise children lose years of working credits toward social security and possibly other pension plans. and women who work part time, such as while raising children or after children go to school, may be ineligible for participation in a company's 401(k) plan or equivalent. women are nearly twice as likely as men to be working part time, the nirs researchers point out.\n\nall of this adds up.\n\nin total, the researchers argue, 27% of american women over 65 are poor or near poor, compared with 20% of american men.\n\non the other hand, say researchers, women who get and stay married, and those who have children young or not at all, are far less likely to face a retirement crisis than their peers.\n\nso too, are those who choose public-sector careers, such as teaching, that come with solid final salary pension plans (though the funding issues in many of those plans may raise concerns for the future).\n\nwomen in a first marriage, especially one in which both spouses work and both spouses save, have the best retirement outcomes, says the nirs. married older americans, both men and women, fare better in retirement than any group of non-married older americans, whether divorced, widowed or never-married.\n\njust 13% of married women over 65 are poor or near poor, they report.\n\nthe figure among divorcées over 65? try 35%.\n\n(meanwhile the rates of poverty, and near poverty, for the over 65s who've never married are more than 40%. and that's true for men as well as women.)\n\nbut what is to be done?\n\nthere are clear public policy measures that would be likely to help, such as eliminating unfair pay disparities, and providing more taxpayer support for child care costs so more young mothers could go back to work earlier. public policy measures that helped the retirement crisis across the board would benefit both sexes.\n\nread: in this covid climate, should i just retire?\n\nmore companies offering paternity leave is another social or public policy change that could move the dial, notes gilpatrick. what i would love to see happen is men taking paternity leave! having more men take advantage of their workplace paternity benefit will help ease the burden on working women.\n\nbut while we are waiting for these things to happen, there are practical things individuals, particularly individual women, can do right now to help their situation, advisers point out.\n\ngilpatrick highlights two: spousal iras for stay at home moms, and long-term care insurance.\n\na spousal ira is simple. it lets you sock away up to $6,000 a year in pretax money for your retirement, even if you're not working but your spouse is.\n\nread: a spousal ira may be the best gift for your nonworking husband or wife\n\nlong-term care insurance, notes gilpatrick, is especially important for women.\n\nmost long term care needs are at the end of life, she says. so who will be there to help if you outlive your spouse? also, being a caregiver takes both an emotional and physical toll. wives who may be expected to care for their husbands can see their own health rapidly devolve. i worry most about women who are a decade plus younger than their husbands without long term care planning.\n\nmeanwhile, if women face a bigger retirement challenge than men they need to invest at least as aggressively for long-term accumulation, if not more so. instead, the reverse is true.\n\na remarkable study by mass mutual, the insurance company, a few years back found that women overall admitted they were less confident about making financial plans and less confident about handling investments. the gender gaps were simply amazing. for example, women who had college degrees still felt less confident about investing their retirement savings than guys who had dropped out of high school. men with degrees were twice as likely to feel comfortable handling their retirement investments as women with degrees.\n\nwomen are also much more likely to be worried about stock market volatility and investment risks, the study found. the overall result was that, basically, women tended to be underinvested in stocks by a wide margin. men were 26% more likely to invest their savings for growth. tiaa found similar results. men were more likely to invest in stocks and mutual funds. women typically held more cash.\n\nthis—like the roots of the gender pay gap—is another hot academic topic. are women more likely to be risk-averse due to nature or nurture? you can find studies arguing either way. but, once again, it doesn't really matter when it comes to retirement planning.\n\nread: why your social security could feel like a lot less next year\n\nholding cash or bonds isn't going to get most people to their retirement goals. avoiding the stock market because you don't understand volatility is just leaving money on the table, regardless of your sex or anything else. the investment returns from so-called risky or volatile assets, such as stocks and real-estate investment trusts, beat the alternative into a cocked hat over any reasonable stretch of time.\n\nthe gap is so big that even if you bought a global stock index at the worst moments in the past 20 years—just before the crashes of 2000-3 and 2007-9—and held on, you would be better off today than if you would held your money in short-term, safe bonds. even the worst long-term returns from stocks beat safe investments.\n\nironically, studies have also found that women tend to make better investors than men over time because they are less prone to overconfidence, and they are less likely to trade needlessly.\n\nan intriguing experiment found that one of the fastest ways to improve the investing performance of men and women was to get them to participate in a stock trading game for a few weeks. researchers found that by the end women were more confident, and men were less overconfident. both ended up better off.\n\nread: your bucket list crashed and burned — now what?\n\nwhat i do see from my professional experience is when women can receive financial education about concepts like inflation eating away at low risk assets and learn about risk assets in an appropriate long term allocation, they are more willing to take on the diversified portfolio, says gilpatrick. i like to educate my clients, as it helps to give them a good level of comfort and confidence to invest in a diversified portfolio. as women live longer, it is even more important for them to take on risk assets to strive to achieve returns to help make their longer life expectancy.
and royal baby makes three.\n\nbritain's prince william and kate middleton, the duke and duchess of cambridge, welcomed their third child, a son, on monday. he has an older sister, charlotte, and brother, george. the baby weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces when he was born and william was present during the birth, kensington palace said in a statement. middleton left the hospital with her baby on monday afternoon. this is the first time the arrival of a royal son won't demote an older sister in the line of succession to the u.k. throne. child-care costs won't be a problem for the royal couple. the duke is personally worth an estimated $10 million and lives at kensington palace in london.\n\ntheir family is now bigger in size than the average american family. unlike many british and american families, the royal couple don't have to worry about the cost of child care. american moms have 2.4 children on average, down from 3.01 children on average in 1973, according to the bureau of labor statistics. fewer americans have having more than three children. around one-quarter of mothers aged 40 to 44 have three children, a figure that has remained fairly stable over the last four decades, according to the pew research center, a nonprofit think tank in washington, d.c. but only 14% of mothers in that age group have four or more children, versus 40% four decades ago.\n\nthere are several reasons for the decline in u.s. family size. foremost among them is finance. more women are delaying having a family to focus on their career and education and, as time goes on, the window of fertility gets smaller. many families are dual income and must save for a down payment and negotiate with banks' strict lending requirements post-recession. the cost of raising a child from birth to age 17 is approximately $233,610, according to the u.s. department of agriculture. of 186 countries examined by the world policy analysis centre adult labor database, 96% provide some pay to women during maternity leave. the u.s. is not one of them.\n\n40% of american women would like more children\n\nmany women do want more kids. around 40% of u.s. women nearing the end of their childbearing years say they have fewer children than their ideal, according to a 2015 general social survey carried out by norc at the university of chicago, a nonpartisan, independent research organization. among women in the e.u. aged 40 to 54, one-third reported that the number of children they have given birth to is lower than their personal ideal. in the u.k., women aged 45 had an average of 1.9 children, down from 2.21 from their parents' generation. family size in the u.k. and wales peaked in 1935, the u.k. independent reported.\n\nthere are other demographic changes afoot, likely affecting the size of american families. in the u.s., the share of children living in a two-parent household is at the lowest point in more than half a century. some 69% of children live in two-parent households versus 73% in 2000 and 87% in 1960. and 62% of children live with two married parents — an all-time low. non-traditional families outnumber traditional two-parent families. the share of children living in one-parent households make up 26% of all households with children, up from 9% in 1960, and they were more likely to live in poverty.\n\npeople are also getting married later than they used to. around 50% of u.s. adults are married, according to the pew research center, down from 72% in 1960. in 2016, the median age for a first marriage was 27.4 for women and 29.5 for men — roughly seven years older than the median ages in 1960. that's partly due to changing social norms, the cost of raising a child and more people carrying student debt. and the share of american adults who have never been married is at an historic high. one-in-five american adults aged 25 and older have never been married.\n\ndon't miss: sen. tammy duckworth is one of a growing number of women having babies in their 40s
dear moneyologist,\n\nmy father suddenly passed away last month. he fell and hit his head. my sister, brother and i feel there is more to the story than his wife, our stepmother, is saying. he was out drinking with friends. she showed up. they fought. she left. he stayed and continued to celebrate with his friends. she was clearly not happy with his choice according to the other people present that night.\n\nhe arrived home and, according to our stepmother, he fell and hit his head. then he somehow managed to fall again and severing the brain stem on the curb 20 feet from his vehicle. the damage to the front of his head was enough to cause brain bleed and swelling. she says his blood alcohol content was 0.2, based on the autopsy report, this after the neighbor kids found him lying on the sidewalk with him choking on his own blood. (sorry).\n\n he arrived home and, according to our stepmother, he fell and hit his head. then he somehow managed to fall again and severing the brain stem on the curb 20 feet from his vehicle.  — suspicious daughter\n\nshe was home at the time of his arrival. we have not been told how long he was laying there dying before the kids found our father. the kids were literally banging on the front door for her. did she not hear him drive up? why did it take her so long to see why he had not come in the house? my brother's stepdaughter has indicated my stepmother was abusive towards are father. he was 70 and overall healthy.\n\nwe believe that she met our father in the driveway and they got into an argument. possibly, she hit him in the head, causing the first fall. he then staggered away and fell again. he did not pull his truck completely into the driveway. it was like someone was blocking it. once she realized he was seriously injured, did she bolt into the house and act like she didn't know he was home? we don't know. this is our problem.\n\nlisten to our new podcast:money, markets & more (or subscribe on itunes): paying good money to get shamed at the gym? and playing golf has gone the way of the three-martini lunch.\n\nshe conveniently cannot find things that belonged to my father: little things like photos and books his sister wanted of their mother. they can't be found yet some of the pictures in it were used at his services. we find this strange. he signed his will in 2008. it is six pages but only the last page is signed. nothing was notarized and there are no initials. pages could have been changed since it was not done at a lawyer's office.\n\nshe has since blocked us on facebook. we do not have her phone number. she told us to stop contacting her. we feel she knows more than what she is saying happened. anything we can do to get this death looked into further?\n\nsuspicious daughter\n\ndear daughter,\n\ni'm sorry to hear that your father died, and in a way that seemed so random and preventable. i often think about fatal car accidents and other odd mishaps kill people, and wonder how many of them were alcohol related (as opposed to how they were reported in the press). it's hard not to replay the circumstances of your father's death again and again in your head and fill in the blanks with questions and scenarios. please just keep in mind that those suspicions may be rooted in grief for your father and resentment toward your stepmother.\n\n your feelings about your stepmother, her unwillingness to cooperate by handing over personal items and blocking you on facebook are enough to make you angry, perhaps even suspicious. but these alternative scenarios of how he died are still a result of your imagination.  — the moneyologist\n\nhave a lawyer review the will. that should be the easiest (and first) thing to do to make sure that everything is correct. a will does not need to be notarized in california, says kern singh, an attorney based in fremont, calif. however, it needs to be witnessed by two disinterested parties, not related by blood or marriage. nor is it a requirement for pages to be initialed in california. some attorneys have their client initial the pages, some don't, singh says. pages being swapped out can occur even if the pages are initialed.\n\nif your father's will was handwritten it's treated slightly differently. a will that does not comply with california probate codes is valid as a holographic will — one that was handwritten — whether or not it was witnessed if the signature and the material provisions are in the handwriting of the testator (your late father), singh says. this is why it is so important when drafting these documents that the testator/grantors notify the executors and successor trustees that they have completed the work.\n\ndon't miss:my son won't let me see his kids unless i change my $10 million will\n\nthe police undoubtedly asked a lot of questions about the night he died. did your stepmother have any motive for causing your father's death or contributing to it? was there a history of physical abuse in the relationship? did your father have a history of heavy drinking? she may have been home when he got there, but that doesn't mean that she (a) heard him come home and did nothing or (b) heard him come home and went outside and fought with him. that should all be in the police report.\n\nyou can contact the police and express your concerns. they may have deemed it an accident already, and may not be willing to open a case. but from what you say in your letter, your imagination, personal feelings about your stepmother, her unwillingness to cooperate by handing over personal items and blocking you on facebook are enough to make you angry, perhaps even suspicious. that doesn't change the fact that, as of now, these scenarios are a result of your imagination.\n\nyou could, if you had a few thousand dollars, hire a private investigator to review police reports and phone records, canvass neighbors, speak to people who last saw him alive and look into prior police calls or crime reports, says james allard, a private investigator in long beach, calif. i should suggest you keep in mind: one out of five falls causes a serious injury, according to the centers for disease control and prevention and, in 2014, there were nearly 32,000 deaths related to falling.\n\nthe simplest answer is often the most likely: your father accidentally hit his head. whatever you decide, i hope you find some resolution — legal, emotional or otherwise.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

do you remember the letter from economic slave in chicago?\n\nhe wrote to the moneyist in july 2018. here's his letter in full and my response.\n\nhere's a short recap of his original problem:\n\ni've known my wife for eight-plus years and i'm happily married with a newborn son. we both make a good living ($100,000 per year), but we pay a significant amount in student loans. i work multiple jobs, and we get some help from my parents and scholarships. my master's cost three times less than her master's. she owes over $200,000 in federal student loans and another $20,000 in private student loans (one is at 12%).\n\ni recommended the national foundation of credit counseling, which helped a couple i interviewed with $125,000 in debt, and i gave them other pieces of advice. obviously, situations like this are more difficult to handle after the fact (in this case, the wedding). it was a breach of trust, sure, but there was one piece of silver lining: they loved each other and at least his wife's spending was on her education rather than on lavish consumer purchases.\n\ndon't miss:should jewelry only be passed down to female family members?\n\nand so to his update and how they are tackling $480,000 in debt:\n\nhere are excerpts from his update to the moneyist:\n\nour family was left with over $480,000 in debt and that put a serious strain on our marriage. after having a serious talk, we created a crude microsoft excel msft, +1.24% spreadsheet that had three student loans totaling $240,000, new house appliances that were purchased when we moved, including mortgage, car, monthly credit-card expenses, and hospital bills from our newborn son.\n\n 'we created a crude excel spreadsheet with $240,000 in student loans, new house appliances, including mortgage, car, monthly credit-card expenses, and hospital bills for our newborn son.' \n\nthat excel eventually contained the loan, the loan name, hyperlinks to pay it, due dates, amount due each month, proposed payment plans, total amount owed, interest and any additional notes.\n\nwe also broke down our credit-card debt to include recurring payments on the credit card. we asked our bank and online financial services companies for help to refinance some loans, but we did not have any luck. the banks' advice: pay things down as fast as possible. not really a revelation to us.\n\nsince the end of july, we paid off all appliances as they had a 0% interest rate for 12 months, but they were still eating into our budget every month. we then paid off a student loan with the highest interest rate (12%) of $13,000.\n\nalso see: this one trick drastically changed borrowers' approach to their student loans\n\nwe revisited the largest student loan, which had $900 in interest every month. we called and spoke with multiple representatives before we could start to get a clear answer. every time we called about the student loan terms, we got a different answer.\n\n 'we called and spoke with multiple representatives before we could start to get a clear answer. every time we called about the student-loan terms, we got a different answer.' \n\nwhen we talked to the manager/loan officer, whose number is not given out so easily, we reached solutions. we reached this person on the sixth call and spoke with them at length. we had previously been told that my wife's loans were on deferment. this was incorrect as the loans were placed in forbearance and were accruing interest.\n\nit was also explained to us that the income-based repayment plan was the best option for my wife. however, this income-based repayment plan did not cover the interest that grows on the loans. we took these loans off an income-based repayment plan and put them on a level repayment plan, which carry $900 in interest each month and we pay down about $600 in principal each month.\n\n 'my advice for others out there is to stay the hell away from what we felt were severely under-trained customer service reps. speak to loan officers and record phone calls.' \n\nthe large student loan caused us the greatest difficulty. my advice for others out there is to stay the hell away from what we felt were severely under-trained customer service reps. speak to loan officers and record phone calls.\n\nwe are on pace to pay off my wife's car in the next two months (which will open up $500 a month for other debts) and her smaller student loan of $16,000 by the end of 2019. although my wife's car payment has a lower interest rate than her smaller student loan, the extra $500 a month will alleviate a strain (versus the $100 due on the small student loan) and allow us to save a little each month or put towards other bills.\n\nalso see:america's $1.5 trillion student-loan industry is a 'failed social experiment'\n\nmy wife is still working full time and i'm working effectively two jobs, but in a family business you're always working. we have reduced our debts to $430,000 in five months and have learned a lot (collectively). the best feeling in the world is deleting lines from that spreadsheet.\n\ntake care and happy new year.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping,

dear moneyist,\n\ni am in my 70s and have two children from a previous marriage of five years. one has a son and the other has two daughters.\n\nmy daughter is married and values material things far more important than financial security. she and her husband stay in debt, which has contributed to a horrible relationship for the past 15 years. i don't know if it will last or not, especially when my granddaughter leaves home in just a few years.\n\nalso see: my father-in-law chose me as heir to his $2 million fortune — leaving his wayward son out in the cold\n\nmore than likely, there will be some money left when my current husband and i are gone. is there a way to assure that whatever she might be left would be protected from her wasting it away and instead, possibly contribute to her old age? we have individual wills but wondered if a trust of some sort or other type of document would be better?\n\nwhat would be the best way to structure this for both of my children and grandchildren and also, my husband's one family member that he wants to leave something to? my current husband and i have been together for the last 35 years and live in texas.\n\nmary\n\ndear mary,\n\nyour question has two parts: do you split your estate equally? and, how do you split your estate? the first one is easy: yes. you want to leave your children something, but you don't want to leave them with resentments and questions. you want to leave this world in a swift, graceful manner that leaves people with a good feeling — the inheritance equivalent of the triple axel from the 2018 winter olympics: three equal, generously timed moves, and then you're off the proverbial ice. except in your case, for good.\n\nthe moneyist: when your partner wants to live with you for free\n\ndon't miss: my sister took care of our mother for 10 years — shouldn't she be entitled to her house?\n\nas to your second question. i suggest an irrevocable trust, outlining ways in which your inheritance should be spent. this has two advantages. your son has a financially responsible life, so he will be glad with any bequest and, i'm sure, will be heartened to know there is money set aside for home improvements or his children's education. your daughter, while not so fiscally responsible or astute, gets the same deal. only in her case, you are protecting her from herself and protecting the interests of your granddaughter.\n\nyou don't say what relationship your husband's relative has to him, but if it's not a sibling, you may consider leaving him/her a smaller amount than the money you leave the rest of your family. you may want to discuss the tax implications of such a trust with a financial adviser when you have decided on your stipulations and the amounts. you want to appoint someone who has no conflict of interest whether that person is a professional trustee — that is, a bank or trust company — or not. you need to depend on that person to act in a competent and trustworthy manner.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
having worked in the financial field for more than more 20 years, i had some knowledge of what to do when a person dies. the passing of my father-in-law earlier this year quickly revealed how much i didn't think to consider in terms of transitioning my mother-in-law—the surviving spouse—to her new life.\n\nwhile there is a lengthy commentary i could write about the experience, there are four key things i think everybody should be aware of.\n\n1. the surviving spouse will need cash, or at least the ability access it quickly. even if there are surviving spouse benefits, they may not be paid quickly. forms will need to be filled out and documents such as marriage licenses may need to located. between the time the initial request for survivor benefits is made and all of the paperwork is fully processed, pension and related streams of income may be halted. for instance, the federal government's office of personnel management (opm) halts payments on the pension annuity until all the paperwork is processed. they told me to assume my mother-in-law would be without benefits for two to three months when i first contacted them.\n\n2. the rules for the deceased's ira need to be followed carefully. there are two big things to know. the first is that the required minimum distribution for the deceased must be taken for the calendar year in which the person passed. the second is that afterward the ira changes to an inherited ira, which has its own characteristics. spend the time to read irs publication 590-b to understand what the rules regarding inherited iras are.\n\n3. if the surviving spouse is going to move to independent or assisted living, a budget needs to be created. in suburban chicago, for instance, prices range between approximately $3,500 to $5,500 a month — potentially more if optional services are added. the monthly costs can be big a change for a person who has been living in a house with no mortgage payment. plus, there is the uncertainty about how long those expenses will be incurred and when additional care will be needed. i've personally found it helpful to create a spreadsheet plotting out expected income (pension, social security, savings withdrawals, etc.) and projected expenses to determine a beginning monthly amount that can be spent without causing assets to be depleted too quickly.\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\n4. organization is of utmost importance. this may sound obvious, but transitioning the surviving spouse to his or her new life is a big project with more moving pieces than you may realize. there will be various deadlines and important information coming from many different sources. your ability to successfully assist with and/or manage the transition will be influenced by how organized you are. i've found it helpful to both have a dedicated file box and a notebook. the latter might seem simple, but a notebook's portability and ease of use comes in very handy for taking notes from all of the pertinent conversations involving transition.
an approximately $30 trillion transfer of wealth is currently under way in the u.s. as aging baby boomers pass their assets to successive generations.\n\nthis transfer, together with the recent increase to the lifetime federal estate and gift tax exemption (to $11.18 million in 2018), has created a favorable situation for u.s. citizens and residents seeking to transfer wealth to their loved ones during lifetime and at death. despite the encouraging estate planning horizon, we still see many who make common mistakes which can thwart their intentions.\n\ndying without a will\n\nmany fewer adults have a will than should. for individuals who are unfortunate enough to die intestate (without a will or living trust), the price can be high. state and local laws determine who manages and inherits a deceased person's property that is not transferred by a beneficiary designation or by law. family members who are entitled to inherit an intestate decedent's estate often have to spend significant amounts of additional funds proving their relationship to the decedent or setting up guardianships or trusts for minors or disabled beneficiaries.\n\nmoreover, relatives whom a client may not wish to benefit may inherit their assets, and disabled heirs receiving government benefits such as medicaid or supplemental security income could have their benefits terminated or disrupted.\n\nthe $80 billion fitness industry sees huge growth in this demographic\n\nneglecting to plan for incapacity or disability\n\nit is equally important to establish documents appointing agents to manage one's health care and business affairs in the event of incapacity as it is to have a valid will. health care proxies and durable powers of attorney are typically the primary means of appointing agents to make health care and business decisions in the event of incapacity, whether temporary or permanent. without these documents, state and local law will determine who can make health care decisions and a guardian may have to be appointed to permit financial and health care decisions to be made for an incapacitated person.\n\ntrying to 'diy' important documents\n\ndocuments or plans made by clients who think they can accomplish their planning on their own or from self-help websites are frequent sources of estate planning mistakes. often clients ask whether their printed form or handwritten document can constitute a will, durable power of attorney or other estate planning document. even if the document form itself is valid, very often the client will not know how to correctly execute the document. an improperly performed will execution ceremony, for example, invalidates the instrument. there is generally no substitute for hiring a qualified attorney to ensure that one's documents are properly drafted and executed.\n\nimproper beneficiary designations and joint accounts\n\nbank and brokerage accounts with beneficiary designations (such as transfer-on-death or in-trust-for accounts) or accounts that are jointly owned are often attractive because they will automatically transfer to the beneficiary or joint owner at death. clients who are unaware that their wills do not control the transfer of these accounts at death often title their accounts without paying attention to how the transfer fits into their entire estate plan. for retirement accounts such as iras or 401(k) plans, properly designating beneficiaries is essential to avoid the loss of further income tax deferral at death. clients engaged in estate planning should consult their attorney about all of their account titling and beneficiary designations to ensure that such designations reflect their plan's design and do not circumvent it.\n\nnot re-examining an estate plan\n\npeople should not create and forget about their estate plan, as changes in the law or family structure can invalidate prior planning. for instance, the birth of a child, marriage, death or divorce will normally change the emphasis of a plan, whereas an increase in the amount that can pass free of estate and gift taxes may change the type of documents needed. to avoid obsolescence, families should typically re-examine their estate plan with an estate planning professional every five to seven years or after a major life event such as a death or a marriage.\n\nforgetting that multiple marriages need planning\n\nentering into another marriage and blended family situations can be stressful, so couples getting remarried often do not create agreements to determine how their assets will be divided at their deaths. without proper planning, a surviving spouse or children and grandchildren from a prior marriage can be left penniless or without proper resources upon the death of the first spouse. creating trusts, buying additional life insurance and titling joint accounts can be an important means for second spouses to provide assets for each other as well as their descendants at death. planning ahead can help ensure family harmony and reduce costly litigation.\n\nkeeping secrets from your estate planner\n\nsometimes people are reluctant to provide complete information regarding their family or finances and only provide incomplete or vague details. an accomplished estate planner may be able to make suggestions that will avoid future family conflict, increase the value of an estate and minimize taxes. these objectives are not possible, however, if the planner doesn't have accurate financial information or a complete picture of the family dynamics. often involving other professionals (like a financial adviser) and developing the relationship with the attorney will provide the necessary background to formulate the proper strategy.\n\nthe key to avoiding costly estate planning mistakes is generally a willingness to spend the time and the resources to ensure the family is protected in the event of their death or incapacity. often, a little time and money spent planning can prevent spending a lot of time and money later correcting planning errors.\n\nmichael feinfeldis a manager in the trusts and estates group of marcum llp, a national

as part of the government effort to mitigate the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, those getting unemployment checks now receive an extra $600 a week. researchers at the university of chicago have estimated two-thirds of jobless workers now would receive more money in unemployment benefits than they would have earned if they hadn't lost their jobs. of course, though, that extra $600 kick-in from the federal government is temporary, expiring in july.\n\nrelated: the extra $600 americans receive in weekly unemployment benefits ends in july — how that could cost the u.s. more jobs\n\ncovid-19 and creative accounting\n\nmost s&p 500 spx, -0.16% companies direct attention to adjusted figures in their quarterly reports. this can help investors to understand how core operations are performing by netting out noncash charges. but this can also confuse investors by hiding items that can affect them.

in the 1970s, alan merrill, lead singer for london-based rock band the arrows, saw the rolling stones play it's only rock 'n' roll on top of the pops.\n\ni'd met mick jagger socially a few times, and i knew he was hanging around with prince rupert lowenstein and people like that—jet setters, he told the website songfacts in a 2009 interview. i almost felt like 'it's only rock and roll' was an apology to those jet-set princes and princesses that he was hanging around with… that was my interpretation as a young man: okay, i love rock and roll.\n\nmerrill went on to write i love rock 'n roll—an un-ironic and unabashed love ode to rock music—which became one of the defining songs of its generation and has since been covered by everyone from joan jett to britney spears and miley cyrus. a parody version of the song, i love sausage rolls, which was produced to raise money for charity, became the top christmas hit in the u.k. last year.\n\non march 29, merrill—a musician, songwriter, actor, and model whose colorful life spanned the globe—died from complications from covid-19 at the age of 69 in manhattan. he is survived by his second wife, joanna lisanti; daughters laura merrill and allegra soler; and son allan sachs-ambia. it's unknown whether he had any pre-existing conditions.\n\nmerrill had been in the process of releasing a new album when he died.\n\nalso see: john prine, revered songwriter who chronicled the human condition\n\nborn in the bronx as the only child of jazz singer helen merrill and saxophonist aaron sachs, merrill was raised with music: his parents regularly played with the likes of earl hines, charlie parker, and billie holiday. american singer-songwriter laura nyro, whom he was related to through marriage and was several years his senior, meanwhile, considered him a cousin.\n\nin the late 1960s, merrill moved to tokyo, where his mother was living. merrill not only managed to open a door to the japanese music world, but thrived, quickly achieving a hit with akuma ga kureta aoi bara, which he sung in japanese for band the lead, before becoming a pop star in his own right.\n\nwith his androgynous good looks—soulful eyes, a mop of dark hair, and a lanky build—merrill found himself in high demand. in tokyo he dated go-go dancers, modeled for big brands, became a tv host, acted in soap operas, and was signed as a solo act to atlantic records. in 1972 he formed vodka collins, japan's first glam rock band, whose album tokyo –new york had three hit singles.\n\nin 1974 merrill moved to london, a place he referred to as the everest for ambitious musicians, where he formed the arrows.\n\nfollowing several hit singles in the u.k., the arrows recorded i love rock 'n roll in 1975. while the song was only a modest success, it became a no.1 hit—staying on the billboard hot 100 chart for seven weeks—after joan jett and the blackhearts recut it in 1981, launching her career.\n\ni can still remember watching the arrows on tv in london and being blown away by the song that screamed hit to me, said jett in an instagram post following merrill's death, adding that she felt deep gratitude for his work.\n\nread: jazz guitar legend bucky pizzarelli dies at 94 after testing positive for coronavirus\n\nanother of merrill's songs, when the night comes, was covered by lou rawls in 1983, for his album of the same name. the same year, rawls' version became the first album to be played in outer space; astronaut guion bluford blasted it back to earth from space shuttle the challenger.\n\nmerrill made everyone feel like you were his best friend, and he was genuine like that, said new york-based musician rew starr, who held a live online memorial concert following his death. he had so much class, but he was so down to earth. he… had a childlike quality to him. he was a living legend.\n\nhis songs were stories, added starr. he sang them like it was the first time every time.\n\nread more: stories about lives lost during the covid-19 pandemic\n\nteri scoble first met merrill in 1976 when she was a choreographer on the arrows show produced at granada tv in the u.k.\n\nalan merrill was uber-talented, unassuming and the nicest person to work with, she recalled. he was a warm and loving friend and made me smile… the world will be a poorer place without him.
some people are just lucky — they're born with it. i'm not talking about good looks or money. i'm talking about wanderlust …. that something inside of you that just makes you want to go places, explore and of course, wander.\n\nmy own wanderlust was cultivated at a young age. although my family never took anything but road trips growing up, my father used to regale me with bedtime stories of gee gee go-go, a fictional character who traveled all over the world on his tricycle. it's no surprise i became a pan am flight attendant!\n\nwhat research says travel can do for you\n\ni know, there are many reasons why the word travel doesn't have the allure it once had: security, restrictions, frenzied airports and packed airplanes, to name a few. i also long for those glamorous days of travel. but although the journey may not always be as exciting as the destination these days, i still think that traveling — whether to places near or far — should be on the top of your list.\n\ntourists view ice buildings on display at the international ice and snow festival in harbin, heilongjiang province in north china. getty images\n\nwhy? because research shows that travelers are healthier in mind, body and spirit. these seven compelling reasons to travel might be enough to send you packing:\n\n1. you'll be healthier\n\nthe research is clear that travel makes us healthier, especially as we age. the framingham heart study found that women who vacationed at least twice a year are healthier and much less prone to suffering a coronary event than those who vacation less frequently. a study sponsored by the national heart, lung and blood institute found that men with high risk for coronary heart disease who took frequent annual vacations were 21 percent less likely to die from any cause and 32 percent less likely to die from heart disease.\n\na global coalition on aging study also credits travel with helping to prevent dementia and alzheimer's, especially with retired people. this all makes sense when you think about how stimulating the act of traveling is for your brain. travel requires you to make new decisions, learn new routes, read maps and adapt to new situations. new adventure means negotiating new paths.\n\nthe $80 billion fitness industry sees huge growth in this demographic\n\n2. you'll be happier\n\naccording to a cornell university study, people can even experience a direct increase in happiness just from the act of planning a trip. i've seen this in action with my husband, who loves researching travel options and will spend hours on the computer, enjoying every minute of it.\n\nfor most of us, having a change of scenery to look forward to, something that takes us away from the everyday routine and stresses of life and lightens the heart, boosts the spirit. buying experiences brings more satisfaction than buying things, according to the cornell study.\n\n3. you'll relieve stress\n\ntraveling takes you away to another world far from your normal surroundings and alleviates stress by transforming your focus.\n\ntourists walk through the famous sagano bamboo forest in kyoto, japan. getty images\n\na study from the marshfield clinic in wisconsin found that women who vacation at least twice a year are less likely to suffer from depression and chronic stress than women who vacation less than once every two years. the study also found that married women who vacation are more likely to be satisfied with their marriage.\n\nother studies conclude that the stress reduction factor of traveling is a major contributor to longevity with men who are at high risk for coronary artery disease.\n\n4. you'll gain a sense of gratitude\n\nit has been said, it's great to leave, and it's great to come home. one of the best effects of travel is the resulting increased gratitude and appreciation for what we generally take for granted. whether you are vacationing on the french riviera, touring rural india, visiting a national park or stopping by a town just a few hours away, these are experiences that enrich your view of the world around you. being exposed to new surroundings and the diversity and beauty of our world leads to a greater sense of appreciation for life, and can be spiritually enlightening and gratifying.\n\n5. you'll make important memories\n\nthey say, travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. i think that's true. experiences made through traveling help create deep connections with others. whether you travel alone, with a group or with family or friends, you will cherish these memories for a lifetime.\n\n6. you'll be more interesting\n\nimmersing yourself in new places and cultures opens up your world to firsthand knowledge, more than you can learn from reading alone. the enriching experience of being there broadens your scope of understanding and makes you more interesting all around. you'll never run out of cocktail party conversation!\n\na vendor sell peanuts in sri lanka. getty images\n\n7. you'll be more compassionate\n\ntravel helps you make sense of the world around you. how can you effectively understand others if you haven't seen how they live? as mark twain wrote in 1869 in his book, the innocents abroad:\n\ntravel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.\n\nalmost 150 years later, these words ring true now more than ever.\n\nthe facts should be convincing; travel is good for us. time to get packing!
dear moneyist,\n\nmy wife wants a divorce after 13 years of marriage.\n\nshe drinks too much and won't stop for me and our child. she wants to wait three months before filing for divorce because she wants to record herself being the best mother she could be. our child is seven and not one time did she ever get up to make him breakfast, dress him, bathe him, etc.\n\ni have been there since day 1 getting up all hours to take care of our child and i still do it. she changed her phone and blocked me on her social media. i'm worried that she drives drunk with my child. there's no way i can call to see where my child is. is that legal for her to do that?\n\ndon't miss:getting divorced?

she takes adderall for adhd. i never wanted divorce for the sake of my child and i didn't want to give up on the marriage.\n\nwe live in rhode island. i want to know where my child is and if he is ok when she leaves the house.\n\nwhat should i do?\n\nbroken hearted\n\ndear broken,\n\ni'm sorry that you're going through this. any divorce lawyer or judge in a child-custody case will want to see evidence of irresponsible behavior.\n\nyou should know where your child is at all times and, assuming you're now separated, your first priority should be to make sure your son is in a safe environment. without an arrest record for drunken driving or some other conviction, it can be difficult to prove that your estranged spouse has a drinking problem. witnesses (neighbors, child-care providers) may help.\n\nmost states have a mechanism for parties to seek child custody on a permanent and/or emergency basis, says andrew brendle, a partner with hull & chandler law firm in charlotte, n.c. emergency child custody typically arises when the child is exposed to a substantial and immediate risk of physical harm, sexual abuse, or at risk of being removed from the state's jurisdiction.\n\nalso see: my cheating husband just inherited $3 million from his father's estate—should i still divorce him?\n\nit's difficult to prove alcohol abuse, however, even when a parent is a heavy drinker. in this 2017 case, fessler vs. mcgovern, the mother alleged that the father of her child drank too much. however, the court ruled that there was no evidence that the father in this case drank while the child was with him, even though he drank nightly.\n\nbrendle often advises parents to keep a record of anything and everything that relates to their child's well being. if you are taking the child to the doctor, taking the child to school, making arrangements for developmental milestones, etc., write it down somewhere, he says. if there is a confrontation with the other parent make a note of it as soon as it is safe to do so.\n\n without an arrest record for drunken driving or some other conviction, it can be difficult to prove that your estranged spouse has a drinking problem. \n\nthese notes, pictures, and documents will become important pieces of evidence in a custody trial if the parties are unable to reach an amicable resolution, he adds. in situations where there are allegations of alcohol abuse document the alcohol abuse as best you can to help prove the allegations/concerns when the time comes.\n\nyour estranged wife may wish to delay the divorce, but you can file for divorce anytime. it does not have to be by mutual agreement. what's more you can state the grounds on which you are filing. if you do present evidence of your wife's alcohol abuse, a judge may ask for regular blood tests or request your spouse undergo a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nrecommended: i paid off my wife's student loans—then she filed for divorce after two years of marriage\n\nunfortunately, the holidays and the new year is a popular time for people to initiate divorce proceedings. in fact, some divorce lawyers refer to the first monday of the year as divorce mondays, and say there are 33% more divorce filings at that time. many families decide to wait until after the holidays to pull the plug. they don't want to spoil the holidays for the family.\n\ni'm sure this has been on your mind. the best home for a child is a safe and happy home, and that can be achieved just as easily with one parent as two. ultimately, any divorce or child-custody case will put both the safety and needs of your child first. i'm sure that's what you want too. i hope you muster up the strength to take those first, difficult steps.\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

starbucks, like many other corporate giants across the world, last week entered the black lives matter conversation on social media by proclaiming its support for the movement and laying out in a tweet some of the measures it would take to do its part:\n\nat the same time, according to an internal memo obtained by buzzfeed news, starbucks sbux, +2.24% prohibited its workers from wearing accessories or clothing mentioning blm, citing its dress-code policy that targets anything to do with politics or religion.
the irs started cutting stimulus checks in mid-april, and it's already gotten money to nearly 130 million people.\n\nthat's good news for everyone who's received the payments and now has $1,200 in hand to use as they see fit as the country copes with the coronavirus outbreak and its massive health and financial consequences.\n\nbut it's another source of stress for everybody who's still waiting for their money.\n\nthere are reasons for the delays, but, first, here's where things stand so far on those checks: the irs had distributed 128.3 million stimulus checks and paid out $218.4 billion, according to statistics released may 8. the $2.2 trillion relief bill called the cares act set aside $290 billion for direct cash payments to individuals and households.\n\nthe irs started mailing paper checks bearing president donald trump's autograph in what might otherwise be the memo line during the week of april 20, according to a timeline from the house ways and means committee. the irs was slated to put approximately 5 million checks in the mail each week for up to 20 weeks. the agency started mailing checks to the people who have the smallest incomes first, the timeline indicated.\n\nit's cold comfort to hear the check's in the mail. in fact, it can be a real problem for many people who are tight on cash and eyeing bills whose payments are coming due or are already late.\n\nhere are some reasons that you still may not have gotten a stimulus check — and, in some cases, what you can do to speed the process.\n\nthe irs doesn't have your bank-account information on file\n\napproximately 14 million americans don't have bank accounts, according to a federal deposit insurance corp. survey from 2017. that's about 6.5% of american households.\n\nthe fdic is urging people to open bank accounts so they can get their stimulus money quicker. (consumers with bank accounts might also be bypassing pricey fees from check-cashing businesses — some of which can charge more than $100 to cash a stimulus check for a family of four, according to an analysis provided by miami's mayor francis suarez in a marketwatch op-ed.)\n\nafter opening a bank account, consumers can submit their banking information to the irs. if they don't file tax returns (some people don't make enough money to file), they'll need to submit the account information via an irs website for people who don't file tax returns.\n\nsee also: claim social security benefits and still haven't gotten your stimulus check? you're not alone\n\npeople who have filed but did not give the irs their banking information can submit direct deposit information through an irs tool called get my payment. the tracking tool can also show payment status, but some people have complained that the tool doesn't give them any information.\n\nthere are reasons for a nonanswer, according to the irs.\n\nfor example, it could be that the agency isn't done processing the person's 2019 return. it could also be that the person typically doesn't file a tax return and has submitted non-filer information via the irs web portal, which is still being processed.\n\nwe update get my payment data once per day, overnight so there is no need to check more often, the irs says on its website.\n\na spanish language version of get my payment will be available in a couple of weeks, according to the irs.\n\nyou make too much money\n\nsome people might not be getting a $1,200 stimulus payment right now because they make too much money.\n\nthe coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act, the legislation's official name from which the acronym cares ostensibly derives, authorized $1,200 payments to individuals making below $75,000 and $2,400 to married couples earning under $150,000. the program also pays parents $500 for each child age 17 and under.\n\nthe payments decline by $5 for every $100 above the $75,000/$150,000 threshold. anyone making over $99,000 doesn't qualify, nor do couples making over $198,000.\n\npeople who exceed the income limit might still have a chance at the money — next year. that's because the stimulus payments are technically an advance credit for next year's tax season. the credit is just being paid right now.\n\nso if someone made too much money based on the income-tax returns they are filing now for 2019, they could still get the money based on the tax returns they file in 2021 for their income this year.\n\nsomeone else is claiming you as a dependent\n\nsome young adults might be missing out on stimulus \money because their parents have claimed them as dependents.\n\nwhen it comes to stimulus checks, the irs counts a dependent as age 17 and under. but if the irs is only reviewing a 2018 return, it could be looking back at a point in time when someone was a high-school senior when now they're in college.\n\nin one case, a 19-year-old college student told marketwatch his dad claimed him as a dependent on his 2018 income-tax return. but as marketwatch tax columnist bill bischoff noted, this student could still be eligible for a stimulus payment himself on his 2019 return.\n\nthe irs also supplied some hope for young adults. it said someone graduating from high school this year will not receive a $1,200 stimulus payment if they are claimed as a dependent this year and claimed as a dependent next year. but, if nobody can claim the student during the next tax season, the student might be eligible for a $1,200 check at that point.\n\nsee also:can you alter your 2019 taxes in order to qualify for the $1,200 stimulus check?\n\nglitches could be slowing delivery\n\nsome national tax preparers offer advances on a client's refund, with the money loaded onto a debit card. yet that could mean the irs might not be putting the stimulus money in the right account.\n\nfor example, h&r block and jackson hewitt both have prepaid cards, and both said they are working to make sure all customers get the money they're entitled to.\n\nh&r block hrb, -0.91% said in a statement that the irs has its clients' banking information. the irs created confusion by not always using clients' final destination bank account information for stimulus payments. we share our clients' frustration that many of them have not yet received these much-needed payments due to irs decisions, and we are actively working with the irs to get stimulus payments sent directly to client accounts.\n\njackson hewitt advised customers to update their direct-deposit information on the irs's get my payment tool. but if the irs already put the money on a serve or bluebird card that the customer no longer has, go to that account and ask for a replacement, jackson hewitt advised, in its statement.\n\nserve customers who would like to receive their stimulus payment to their serve account should confirm their direct deposit information with the irs and update it if necessary, jackson hewitt said. the company said other information on the process is available on its website.\n\ndebt collectors could be taking your money\n\nconsumer advocates have pointed out the wording of the cares act does not prevent private debt collectors from seizing stimulus checks that suddenly come into a bank account.\n\na debt-collection trade group said members are acting with compassion at this time, but, even still, it noted, collectors wouldn't know the source of money that suddenly comes into an account.\n\nbut lauren saunders, an associate director at the national consumer law center, said there are steps consumers can take to keep their stimulus money out of debt collectors' hands. one way is to cash your stimulus check without depositing it into your bank account, she said.\n\nit's also important to know state laws. approximately 10 states plus washington, d.c., and several other cities and counties are enacting orders preventing garnishment of stimulus checks, according to the national consumer law center.\n\nyour immigration status could be complicating matters\n\nthe government is paying the stimulus checks to u.s. citizens. the checks are also going to certain categories of non–u.s. citizens. this includes legal permanent residents, also known as green-card holders, according to the irs.\n\nbut if someone still has a green-card application pending, they may not be getting a stimulus check, at least not any time soon, according to washington, d.c., immigration lawyer allen orr. u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) field offices, which administer in-person interviews before issuing green cards, closed temporarily in march because of the pandemic. as of now, offices are closed until june 3, uscis said.\n\norr, first vice president of the american immigration lawyers association, had a client ready for a green-card interview on march 15 when the government office closed on march 14. he's out of luck with his stimulus check, which he would qualify for, orr told marketwatch. whenever the uscis reopens its offices, orr said, it's likely green cards will be issued at a slower pace, meaning a slower payout of stimulus funds to new green-card holders.\n\nmarriage to a green-card holder doesn't necessarily mean a second stimulus check, orr added.\n\nif a spouse was married to a green-card holder and present in the united states before they received permanent-resident status, they, too, should be getting a check, orr said. but if someone married a green-card holder afterward, they wouldn't get the same benefit.\n\nreceiving a stimulus check shouldn't disrupt a person's path to citizenship if they already have a green card, orr said. no one is giving you anything. it's something you're entitled to.\n\nread on:trump wants his signature to appear on coronavirus stimulus checks — a protocol breach\n\nthis story was updated on may 11, 2020.
the state of the union on tuesday night offers president donald trump an opportunity to focus the nation beyond impeachment — importantly, to establish his second-term agenda and launch his re-election campaign.\n\ntrump would be in good shape if the election were held soon after the senate acquitted him. on his watch, economic growth has substantially outperformed both the bush and obama presidencies, unemployment is at historic lows, and women,minorities and lower-income workers are making notable progress.\n\npreview of the state of the union speech\n\ncongress has passed the united states-mexico-canada free trade agreement, the phase one trade deal with china promises to significantly boost exports, and his court appointments will limit executive overreach in business regulation long after he leaves office.\n\njustice brett kavanaugh shifts the majority in the supreme court to a less-expansive view of executive branch authority. he is hardly hostile to environmental protections. nor does he oppose, as the left charged during his confirmation, the evolving national consensus that accepts a woman's right to reasonable access to abortion but with limits on late-term procedures once fetuses are viable outside the womb.\n\ncoupled with the appointment of large numbers of conservative federal district and appellate judges, kavanaugh's presence should more effectively circumscribe the ability of federal agencies to regulate business beyond the specific parameters articulated by congress in legislation.\n\nhowever, the boeing ba, -3.92% 737 max production shutdown could slice 0.5% off gdp growth in the first quarter — the impact on employment and wages will be noticeable.\n\ngrowth should recover somewhat in the spring but as the two parties hold their conventions, trump won't be able to brag on the economy quite like he did during the recent holidays.\n\ndemocrats flipped the house in 2018 — not with radical, socialist rhetoric — but by emphasizing issues with traction with middle-class voters.\n\nmedian family incomes adjusted for inflation are about where they stood in 1999 but for items the american families consider essential — health care, higher education, homes, new cars and child care — costs have risen much more than the general price level.\n\ntoo often, middle-class families have coped with high fixed expenses by pushing debt on their children — student loans that now total $1.5 trillion. consequently, younger americans are delaying marriage, children and home purchases.\n\nin the state of the union, the president should challenge congress to take up a middle class new deal. democrats who opposed him would be saying no to the young college-graduates, women and suburban voters who gave them a house majority.\n\ninitiate an infrastructure program to improve roads and mass transit and bolster climate change abatement. even if financed by higher gas taxes that would boost growth, wages and stock prices.\n\npermitting the states to purchase imported drugs and more transparency in pricing, as the trump administration proposes, wouldn't do enough to change what most americans pay. instead the president should get behind the plan endorsed by speaker nancy pelosi to benchmark drug prices to european and canadian prices.\n\nat least initially, electric cars will be even more costly than the gas models those replace. extending the average tax credit of $5,000 for the first 200,000 electric vehicles each manufacturer sells to every first-time purchaser of an electric car or truck — assembled in north america and meeting usmca content rules — would give the domestic battery and auto industries a huge boost.\n\nuniversities and private schools that sold young people bogus curriculum with promises of good paying jobs that only resulted in big debt should be brought to account. their land and structures should be mortgaged through bonds to help young folks retire student loans.\n\namong the biggest barriers to building affordable homes is the cost of land. the president should assemble a bipartisan committee of governors to purpose model zoning regulations and push congress to make federal funds for roads and mass transit contingent on adopting those.\n\nfree-market fundamentalism will not deliver a sustainable majority to republicans any more than the green new deal or other trojan horses for socialism will for democrats. this is an era of measured, activist government.\n\nit is critical that activism be pro-opportunity and middle class, not rooted in envy and the economics of failure. it's up to the president to articulate the vision.
this article is reprinted by permission from nerdwallet.\n\nwomen are gaining ground in america's workforce. the wage gap between the sexes has narrowed, women now account for nearly half the nation's workforce, and in many couples, women are the primary breadwinners. but progress often comes with complications: many women report dissatisfaction at home even as they make strides in their professional lives.\n\nin a third of american couples, a woman earns more than her spouse or partner, according to the women of wealth study by the family wealth advisors council. that percentage is likely to increase as the population ages, with millennial women earning 95% of what their male counterparts earn, according to the department of labor's women's bureau.:\n\nbut given those numbers, another finding, from the working mother research institute, is particularly concerning, if unsurprising: bread-winning moms say they are a lot less satisfied with their home lives than bread-winning dads. the reasons surely vary, but even the most capable woman can feel overwhelmed by everything she has to manage. many female breadwinners are also members of the so-called sandwich generation, caring for kids and aging parents at the same time, adding even greater pressure.\n\nbread-winning women face a variety of challenges, but i believe it's possible to have it all. in my work as a financial planner, i specialize in advising both young and executive-level professionals, including many women who are the primary breadwinners in their families. here's some advice based on what i've seen work well for them:\n\noutsource everyday tasks\n\ninequitable division of household labor was one of the areas of greatest dissatisfaction for bread-winning mothers in the working mother's survey. it's not realistic for couples to expect either party to be responsible for the majority of household tasks; they're both busy. instead, hire a housekeeper. it will change your life.\n\nin fact, don't stop with housecleaning. working couples should look at which everyday tasks, such as grocery shopping or laundry, they can easily outsource. this allows them to invest time in aspects of home life that really matter, such as spending time with their kids and each other.\n\nbudget your time\n\nmake conscious decisions about where you want to be involved. you might want to pick up kids at school, attend soccer games or be on the pta board. in what other areas of your life can you save time to help you prioritize things you want to do?\n\nmanage your stress\n\nwe always tell our clients to make time for themselves. me time can help you reduce stress and feel more relaxed. remember, you won't be able to take care of your family and job if you don't take care of yourself first.\n\nengage in mentorship\n\nthe support of someone who shares your experiences can be invaluable. find a female mentor who can offer guidance, feedback and support, or become one yourself. mentorship benefits both parties in the relationship.\n\nwork with a financial adviser\n\npreserving and building wealth is traditionally a key role for the primary breadwinner. having a partner such as a financial adviser can help you ensure things are taken care of. look for professionals who understand your bottom line and who can help you maximize tax-deferred savings and analyze equity compensation plan strategies, if applicable.\n\nalso read: women can't seem to catch a break when it comes to retirement planning\n\nconsider your spouse's feelings\n\nit's important that your spouse feels like an equal partner. if your spouse is a stay-at-home dad, encourage him to consult from home; this can help him continue to be professionally engaged, preserve his earning potential and re-enter the workforce in stages.\n\ndetermine how you'll divide expenses. will you base the division on the size of the expenditures or percentage of income contribution?\n\nremember, communication is key\n\ngood communication about financial matters is essential in any marriage, but in my experience working with high-income clients, communication is even more important in couples in which a woman earns more than her spouse.\n\nwomen earning more than men is still a fairly new situation in our culture, and many couples — and single people — might not know how to feel about it. some coping mechanisms are less helpful than others. for example, higher-earning women who are in relationships may feel the need to downplay their income or position to protect their spouse's pride. single women may think their higher salary could hinder forming a relationship with a man who earns less.\n\nbut as more millennials advance in their professional lives, we're going to see more couples in which women are earning as much as or more than their partners. with a foundation of good communication and planning, it's possible for working women and their spouses to find satisfaction in their home and professional lives.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:\n\nhow to write a retirement plan\n\nhow to sell your house\n\nhow to find a good buyer's real estate agent
when it comes to game of thrones, it's always a good rule of thumb to expect the unexpected.\n\nbut in sunday's season 7 premiere on time warner inc.'s us:twx hbo, titled dragonstone, audiences were thrown for a loop before the first strains of the series' unmistakable theme song hit their ears. those sudden turns continued on until daenerys targaryen and her fleet of ships landed in westeros at long last, making the final scenes featuring the mother of dragons the only really predictable moments of the entire episode.\n\nthe key to unpacking how this season is going to go (we think), is by focusing on the four shocking developments that went down in dragonstone that could end up changing the game permanently.\n\na girl is ready. maisie williams as arya stark in 'game of thrones.' hbo\n\nread: 'game of thrones': where we left off at the end of season 6\n\nbe very, very afraid of arya stark\n\nas already mentioned, dragonstone didn't even wait for the opening credits to make it pointedly clear that little arya stark is now a vicious killer capable of murdering every person responsible for the red wedding in one fell swoop. forget about confusing those loyal to house frey — her use of walder frey's face as her disguise initially tricked the game of thrones audience into thinking this was either a flashback, or worse, that last season's killing of the red wedding mastermind was all a dream. thankfully, it wasn't. while the westerosi houses are busy fighting among themselves, i wouldn't put it past arya to slither in and take the iron throne for herself.\n\nwill euron greyjoy come between cersei lannister (lena headey) and her brother jaime (nikolaj coster-waldau)? hbo\n\neuron greyjoy is going to be really important this season\n\nthe man known as the king of the iron islands has reappeared in king's landing in the form of cersei lannister's newest potential ally. unlike the freys, [the greyjoys] have ships, and they're good at killing, westeros's newest monarch dryly explains to her brother, jaime. but it's not so much whether or not euron can offer the muscle the unpopular cersei so desperately needs that makes him so vital to the narrative: it's looking like euron is poised to drive a wedge between cersei and the man she's loved more than anyone, including her own children. yara and theon greyjoy's uncle presents his two good hands (a sick burn directed toward jaime) and 1,000 ships in exchange for cersei's hand in marriage. although she declines, her unending quest for power may ultimately change her mind down the road, especially when euron returns to king's landing with the mysterious, unnamed gift he promises cersei.\n\nalso: read more entertainment news at marketwatch.com/entertainment\n\nthe hound could rival bran on the vision front\n\nbran stark's greenseeing and that r+l=j revelation is so last season. now it appears sandor clegane, aka the hound, has his own mystical abilities and can see visions through the one element that serves as his greatest fear. while seeking shelter with beric dondarrion, the hound cements himself as a crucial player in the impending white walker battle when he sees a wall of ice in the fire, with the dead marching past. the hound has a complicated relationship with fire — it's the reason for his gruesome facial scars because when he was a young boy, his brother gregor (aka the mountain, and cersei's bodyguard in king's landing) inexplicably shoved his face into a burning container of hot coals. sandor has harbored a fear of fire ever since — and a hatred for his brother.\n\nrelated: how did samwell get those surgical gloves? a doctor dissects the scene\n\nsamwell tarly is poised to be the savior of westeros\n\nwhy else would game of thrones relegate poor sam to so many seasons of drudgery if he wasn't destined for absolute greatness? the fact that he is reintroduced to audiences doing a nightmare version of college work-study — the man is reduced to cleaning out every chamber pot in the citadel — has to mean that he holds the answer to defeating the white walkers, right? fortunately, sam's archmaester mentor, played by jim broadbent, enjoys dispersing white walker wisdom while extracting organs from open cadavers, which can't be all for naught. especially when sam makes a major discovery about dany's final destination of dragonstone and insists on getting word to his old chum in the north, jon snow. as if that weren't enough, it's evident that sam is also going to forge a connection to dany via a citadel prisoner with a familiar-sounding voice and a greyscale-ridden arm (psst! it's the khaleesi's onetime adviser, ser jorah mormont.)
net-worth poverty — a measure of poverty concerning wealth rather than income — affected one in three u.s. households with kids even prior to the pandemic-induced recession and has disproportionately struck families of color, a new study says.\n\nfifty-seven percent of black households with children and 50% of latino households with children were net-worth poor in 2019, versus 24% among white households, according to a study by duke university researchers published in the journal of marriage and family.\n\nnet-worth poor means a household's net worth — total assets minus total debts — falls below a quarter of the federal poverty level, the researchers said. in other words, net-worth poverty is a measure of whether a household has enough resources to meet basic needs for three months, they added.\n\nhouseholds living in net-worth poverty lack a financial cushion to provide for their children's basic needs, study co-author christina gibson-davis, a duke professor of public policy and sociology, said in a statement.\n\nthese 'net-worth poor' households have no assets to withstand a sudden economic loss, like we have seen with covid-19, she said. even before the pandemic, many families with children were in a precarious situation. things are not going to get better in the wake of covid-19.\n\nthe study analyzed u.s. survey of consumer finances data from 1989 to 2019 on households with at least one resident member under 18. the sample included 19,013 households.\n\n 'when a household has few or no assets, even a minor financial setback can make it difficult to pay for necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter.'  — journal of marriage and family article\n\nwhile both income and wealth are significant factors in child wellbeing, net-worth poverty (a measure of the adequacy of the stock of resources owned by a household) may provide a better snapshot of long-term household financial stability than income poverty, which measures the adequacy of a flow of resources, the authors suggested.\n\nwealth, as a store of value, therefore represents goods that a household can access to meet unexpected expenses, buffer against income loss, or contend with economic shocks, such as medical emergencies, that can deplete financial reserves, they wrote. when a household has few or no assets, even a minor financial setback can make it difficult to pay for necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nthe researchers found that net-worth poverty was more prevalent than income poverty across demographic groups, with white, latino and black households with kids two to three times as likely to experience net-worth poverty than income poverty.\n\nmost net-worth poor households with children weren't income-poor, they said. net-worth poverty, unlike income poverty, is increasing.\n\nnet-worth poverty rates among black households with children rose from 46% in 2001 to 51% in 2007 and kept inching upward until 2013, after which they decreased slightly. in white households they increased from 24% to 30% during the great recession, but have decreased since then, the authors wrote. the increase in net-worth poverty for black households, when combined with the null increase for white households, has widened the racial gap over time, they wrote.\n\nnet-worth poverty rates in latino households, meanwhile, saw small changes over time and hewed closely to trends for white households.\n\ncentering policy efforts solely on income poverty won't fully address the problems these families face, the authors argued. they suggested pro-wealth accumulation strategies such as expanding child-care or housing subsidies to free up net income and relaxing safety-net programs' asset tests.\n\nmost policies focus on income and families meeting their day-to-day needs, co-author lisa gennetian, a duke associate professor of early learning policy studies, said in a statement. these efforts are important. but our findings suggest that they are not helping families increase savings that help set children up for success.

modern royal husband. party-loving wild child. military hero.\n\nprince harry has adopted a number of public personas in his colorful life. but a recently-published biography of prince harry, to coincide with his marriage to american actress meghan markle yesterday, reveals plenty of evidence that his perspective on finance is closer to a citizen than a sovereign.\n\nhere are five intriguing finance stories from harry: life, loss, and love, a new biography of the prince by royal author and broadcaster katie nicholl:\n\n1. when prince harry was five years old, he went shopping with his mother diana, princess of wales and his brother prince william to a shop in kensington, west london.\n\ntypically, members of the royal family did not carry any cash on them, but diana felt it imperative that her children understand the value of money and gave them pocket money that they were allowed to spend on such trips to the shops, nicholl writes. but when harry attempted to buy a superhero comic, chocolate bar and a pack of chewy sweets, he found he didn't have enough pocket money to cover all three items.\n\nrather than throw a tantrum over his lack of means, nicholl notes, harry behaved so well, putting back the sweets, that diana decided he deserved a cheeseburger and french fries. so the three of them headed to the nearest mcdonald's, where william and harry ordered their own meals and carried their happy meals to a table in the corner, not far from their discreetly placed protection officers, who were busy tucking into their own burgers.\n\nprincess diana with sons william & harry in 1988. everett collection\n\n2. harry is no slouch when it comes to the art of charity fundraising.\n\nin 2007 bryn parry and his wife emma parry launched the charity help for heroes (h4h) to improve facilities for british servicemen and women. media coverage of the initiative was extensive and the charity received support from the likes of simon cowell, michael caine and sharon osbourne.\n\nbut when harry and his brother william backed the charity, according to nicholl, it catapulted the charity into a different sphere altogether. when both princes wore the charity's wristbands at a football match, it swiftly became a household name. bryn parry says in the book, they both raised their arms and showed the wristbands and of course [popular british newspaper] the sun jumped on it and it became the thing, in many ways. you almost didn't want not to be seen to wear a wristband after that.\n\n3. prince harry might be a scion of a family valued by business consultancy brand finance as being worth $88 billion. but like most other people, he has had financial disputes with girlfriends that ended up impairing his relationships.\n\nbetween 2012 and 2014, the prince dated model and actress cressida bonas. they had been due to fly to tennessee for the wedding of his friend guy pelly, who was marrying the holiday inn heiress lizzy wilson, nicholl writes. cressida had had to save up for the economy air ticket, but when she found out that harry planned to spend part of the weekend on a belated stag night with his friends, she decided the expensive weekend away was going to be a waste of money.\n\nthere was a bit of a row about how much it was costing her and cressida decided not to go, which upset harry, so he went off to memphis with his brother in a bit of a huff. the pair split up not long afterwards.\n\n4. harry definitely married meghan markle for love, not for money.\n\nnicholl's account of the finances of thomas markle, the bride's father, chimes with the chaos in the run-up to the royal wedding when he was caught staging photos with the paparazzi.\n\nmeghan's father filed for bankruptcy in june 2016, she writes. while he had earned a good salary working for abc, there had since been leaner times. she quotes her stepmother rosalyn saying of her father, he went through tough times, sometimes washing dishes to pay the rent and he bordered on homelessness at times, but he worked really hard.\n\n5. harry seems to have a refreshing sense of humor about material possessions.\n\nwhile serving with the british army in afghanistan in 2007, prince harry had a practical joke played on him by his troop commander captain dickon leigh-wood, which was inspired by his then-girlfriend chelsy davy.\n\nharry carried a picture of chelsy with him and told his fellow soldiers about his girlfriend, writes nicholl. on valentine's day he received a pair of knickers, which caused his fellow officers to tease him mercilessly. harry thought the purple-and-yellow briefs were a joke present from chelsy, and he tied them to the grill of his spartan for a laugh\n\nin fact, the underwear belonged to a stripper and was a parting gift from captain leigh-wood, who was heading home for a brief respite from the front line.\n\nharry: life, loss, and love by katie nicholl is published by hachette books
resisting the impulse to just check my work email really quick when you're with your family could improve your career — and your spouse's too.\n\nnew research shows that when an employee uses a mobile device to do work during family time, it negatively affects their spouse's job performance and job satisfaction.\n\nthe findings build on previous research that found that workers experience more burnout and are more likely to leave their jobs when they use their mobile devices to work during off hours.\n\nresearchers wanted to see if those problems extended to workers' spouses as well. the answer: yes.\n\nthe relationship tension created in a marriage because of this device use ultimately leads the spouse to experience reduced job satisfaction and job performance, said wayne crawford, an assistant professor of management at university of texas, arlington's business school. he co-authored the study along with professors from baylor university, utah state university and texas a&m university. it was published this week in the journal of occupational health psychology.\n\nhere's how workplace diversity can help companies boost profits\n\nsee also:activist shareholders want apple to help kids kick iphone addictions\n\n researchers found that the more a worker used his or her mobile phone or tablet to work during family time, the more likely their spouse was to report lower job performance and satisfaction. \n\nthe study surveyed 344 married couples. both partners worked full-time, meaning at least 30 hours a week, and both were expected to use mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets to work at home during off-hours.\n\npartners weren't allowed to see each other's responses. both were asked how much their work life affected their family life, whether there was tension in their relationship, and whether that tension spilled over to affect how they felt on the job. researchers found that the more a worker used his or her mobile phone or tablet to work during family time, the more likely their spouse was to report lower job performance and satisfaction.\n\nthat's because tension created by the mobile device use at home created a ripple effect that bled into the spouse's work life, crawford said.\n\nsee also:6 ways to make smartphones more humane — and less addictive\n\ngiven the findings, companies may want to examine the impacts of keeping workers on a short digital leash, crawford said.\n\nhaving these expectations about mobile device use for work purposes during off time is creating negative experiences for everyone involved and that gets carried back to the organizations, crawford said.\n\nand businesses may also want to consider whether it makes more sense to focus on getting more done from 9 to 5, said abdul rasheed, chair of uta's department of management. that extra time spent on mobile devices after hours might not be worth it if the grief it causes results in productivity losses once the conflict is carried back to work, rasheed said. businesses have to think about accomplishing tasks more efficiently while people are at work.\n\nthe study comes as some employers are rethinking the demands they put on workers outside of the office. france passed a law last year allowing employees to ignore work emails when they're not at the office.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband refuses to give me my stimulus check from his savings account. we filed taxes jointly, but i'm not listed on the checking account. i have a checking account, and he has his own checking account. he says that i don't deserve it because i didn't earn it. what is my best course of action?\n\nfrustrated wife\n\ndear frustrated,\n\nthis issue is a lot bigger than your $1,200 stimulus check.\n\nthis is a textbook case of financial abuse. in fact, here is a direct quote from the office on women's health at the u.s. department of health and human services: financial abuse happens when an abuser takes control of finances to prevent the other person from leaving and to maintain power in a relationship. an abuser may take control of all the money, withhold it, and conceal financial information from the victim. you are inside of it, so you not be able to see it for what it is.\n\nhe has no legal right to keep your money. the economic impact payment is technically an advance payment of a tax credit on your 2020 return. the irs is using 2019 tax returns to gauge people's incomes; 2018 tax returns are used as a plan b. i don't see any compassion, trust or respect in his actions — just some of the hallmarks of a loving relationship. financial abuse is a form of domestic violence. not all scars are visible, many are psychological and have the same insidious effect: to control and subdue another person.\n\nyou need a plan. you can't see the bars on your window. after this pandemic is over, here's the good news: you can walk through them, if you want to.\n\n'i'll never give my wife $1,200 to blow her stimulus check. she'll get a couple of hundred bucks to go shopping.' what's wrong with that?\n\nif you filed jointly, you share the money. even if your husband earns more money, there is a tax benefit of claiming two deductions — one for each spouse — on the returns, says david waltzer, a new york-based lawyer. so, without you, there would certainly be less of a tax credit. also, if there were a tax liability — money owed to the irs — you would be on the hook. so it is outrageous that a spouse would share liability for tax debt, but not share in the tax credit.\n\nit might be valuable to look at equitable distribution principles that apply to divorced couples, waltzer said. the premise is that if one spouse earns more, the other spouse is entitled to some of the value from those earnings. why? because it is presumed that the lower-earning spouse is contributing in other ways, maybe with household management, laundry, food, shopping etc.. that contribution (sweat equity) supports and frees the earning spouse to make the money.\n\n'we will not have a vaccine by next winter.' like the 1918 spanish flu, cdc says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. so what happens now?\n\nnot only do these principles apply to your stimulus check, but waltzer says there is even a stronger case for the equal division of stimulus checks. they are supposed to be $1,200 per person, for example. so if a $2,400 check arrives into one spouse's account, $1,200 of that belongs to the other spouse. lastly, even if none of the above convinces your husband, tell him to be a mensch and not a grinch and to stop giving you a hard time — just out of sheer decency and love.\n\ni received my ex-husband's $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. should i give him the money or return it to the irs?\n\nthat's the legal opinion on your case, with some free relationship advice thrown in for good measure. you are in a difficult position during this lockdown. you could call your husband's bank, but if the account is in his name, it will be difficult — if not near impossible — to persuade a bank to transfer that money to your account. the internal revenue service is sending out millions of stimulus payments to people, so i'd be very surprised if they were able to send another one to you separately.\n\nyour best course of action for now: keep notes of all of these events with dates, and other details, and use them to motivate yourself to take action when the economy starts up again. you can also use this time to consult a family attorney in your area to explore your options. are you happy in your marriage? is your husband's refusal to give you your stimulus check some kind of aberration? you are the best one to answer that.\n\nif not, you not only have a right to that $1,200 stimulus payment, you also have a right to be happy. but only you can make that happen.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
research and policies aimed at addressing poverty tend to focus on family income. yet, the future financial resilience of u.s. households with children will be shaped not only by the income they earn but also by their wealth holdings.\n\nwealth is a critical resource that enables households to deal with unexpected economic shocks—including recent experiences of job loss related to the pandemic—when parents must draw on saved assets to meet the needs of their children. wealth, like income, supports parental investments in their children and reduces family stress; wealth also can inform and direct parents' hopes and expectations about their children's futures.\n\n more households are vulnerable to having insufficient economic resources than previous research suggests. \n\nimportantly, the negative correlations between child-development outcomes and wealth cannot statistically be attributed to income. children living in households that have similar income levels but lower levels of wealth have increased risk of compromised academic outcomes—including college enrollment and college attainment—as well as greater risk of negative behavioral outcomes.\n\nthe facts:\n\nhouseholds that have scarce wealth holdings can be considered net-worth poor.\n\nin our research, we define net-worth poverty as net-worth levels that are less than one-fourth of the federal poverty line. this threshold measures whether a household has a stock of assets sufficient to meet its basic needs, as defined by the poverty line, for three months. a family of four would be classified as net-worth poor if their wealth were less than $6,500 in 2019.\n\n the long-term consequences of growing up with insufficient economic resources (such as the effects on children's education) are particularly acute and enduring. \n\nwealth, or net worth, is the value of total household assets—which typically include savings and checking accounts, retirement accounts, and the value of a family's home, among others—less total debts, such as mortgages, credit-card debt, and car or educational loans.\n\nwealth, or net worth, for households with children has declined in recent years, putting many families at risk of net-worth poverty.\n\nhouseholds with children in the bottom half of the wealth distribution had lower levels of median wealth in 2016 than in 1989, with black households experiencing the largest relative declines. our study provides the first estimates of net-worth poverty among child households, defined as households with at least one resident child under the age of 18.\n\n factors such as structural racism can particularly impact net-worth poverty by restricting accumulation of assets. \n\nwe focus on child households because the long-term consequences of growing up with insufficient economic resources (such as the effects on children's education) are particularly acute and enduring. our data come from the 1989-2019 waves of the survey of consumer finances (scf), which offers rich data on both income and wealth.\n\none-third of child households were net-worth poor in 2019, three times as many as were income poor.\n\nin 2019, 35% of child households were net-worth poor whereas 11% were income poor. moreover, during a time when income poverty rates for child households have been falling, net-worth poverty rates among child households have largely been stagnant or even rising since 1989.\n\nthe majority of households that were net-worth poor were not income poor, indicating that these households would be overlooked by policies and programs that focus exclusively on income poverty, and that more households are vulnerable to having insufficient economic resources than previous research suggests.\n\nthe majority of black-child households are net-worth poor, and racial gaps in net-worth poverty exceed those for income poverty.\n\nin 2019, 57% of black-child households were net-worth poor, compared to only 22% for white-child households. the black-white gap in net-worth poverty has grown over time, whereas the gap in income poverty has not (see chart). latino-child households were twice as likely to be net-worth poor as were white families, though the latino-white net-worth poverty gap has not increased statistically over time.\n\nincome poverty has fallen over time for black and latin families, but net-worth poverty has not.\n\ndisparities in net-worth poverty between black- and white-child households cannot be fully explained by differences in characteristics such as education, marital status, or age that have been found to predict income poverty. factors such as structural racism can particularly impact net-worth poverty by restricting accumulation of assets (such as historical strategies that have impeded homeownership among black families) and affects the presence of predatory-lending behavior (see here and here).\n\nnet-worth poverty is more common than income poverty among all child households, but a substantial fraction of nonwhite households with children experience both types of economic scarcity.\n\nacross years, two-thirds to three-quarters of white-child households were neither income poor nor net-worth poor. in contrast, in any given year, between 54% and 67% of black- and latino-child households experienced income poverty, net-worth poverty, or both types of poverty. the most common type of poverty, among those who were poor, was net-worth poverty.\n\napproximately 15% of black and latino households were both net-worth and income poor, suggesting that they may be particularly economically vulnerable.\n\ndifferences in net-worth poverty among racial and ethnic groups are not merely a reflection of differences in homeownership.\n\none-fifth of black-child and one-fourth of latino-child households in 2019 experienced net-worth poverty even if they owned homes. high rates of black net-worth poverty for homeowners are consistent with the contention that policies promoting homeownership would be insufficient to close the black-white wealth gap (see here).\n\npolicy solutions focused solely on income enhancement will likely do little to support wealth accumulation or reduce wealth deficits on their own.\n\nregulating predatory-lending behavior, including underwriting of mortgages and loan structure, that occurs at higher rates in low-income and communities of color can also reduce net-worth poverty traps by preventing foreclosure and debt accumulation. such regulation could be coupled with opportunities to be banked and access credit at low fees with the formal financial sector that is particularly relevant given that our findings show that net-worth poverty is not reducible to homeownership.\n\nchild-directed policies to reduce intergenerational transmission of wealth deficits, such as baby bonds and child development accounts that are gaining public and political support, are additional considerations, though the implementation of such strategies to date have had mixed success (see here, here, and here).\n\nwhat this means:\n\na focus on income deprivation alone will tend to overlook the precarious economic conditions related to family net worth and ignore growing disparities in wealth by race and ethnicity. the increasing prominence of net-worth poverty in the lives of child households before the pandemic, particularly those who are black or latino, underscores the economic precarity faced by many children in the u.s.\n\nwhether this vulnerability has translated to disproportionately harsher impacts from the pandemic is unknown. policy attention should be paid to both income and net-worth poverty. children who are net-worth poor, but not income poor, have been overlooked but may nevertheless be a vulnerable group.\n\nthis commentary was published with permission of econofact—many families with children experience a hidden source of poverty\n\neditor's note: the analysis in

chapel hill, n.c. (marketwatch) — don't fire your investment manager just because he failed to beat the stock market last year.\n\ni can already hear the howls of protest: if trailing the market isn't a fireable offense, then what is?\n\nmy answer: it's not that past performance doesn't count; what's irrelevant is performance over the recent past. calendar-year performance, for example, tells you next to nothing about whether your manager is a good bet for future returns.\n\nthis is an exceedingly difficult lesson for us to take to heart. even harvard university, with the largest endowment fund in the world, apparently is having trouble with it.\n\nthe university in late january laid off more than half its investment-management staff. though the institution's press release announcing this didn't mention it, the layoffs come on the heels of a disappointing fiscal year in which the endowment actually lost money, lagged behind its benchmark by 3 percentage points, and trailed the total return of the s&p 500 index spx, -1.43% by 6 percentage points.\n\nyet the endowment's longer-term performance remains impressive: over the past 10 years, it's beaten its benchmark by 0.9 percentage point per year on an annualized basis, according to its latest annual report. and over the past 20 years, its margin of victory is 3.1 annualized percentage points.\n\nsince the vast majority of all managers fail to beat their benchmarks over the longer term, one would have thought that this impressive long-term record would have given the institution at least some leeway to tolerate its recent loss.\n\napparently not. (for the record, i should mention that harvard says there are other reasons besides disappointing recent short-term performance for its decision to fire its management staff.)\n\nto put harvard's recent actions into perspective, i measured the frequency of losing and lagging years among the investment newsletters i monitor that have nevertheless beaten the stock market over the past decade. it turns out that, while not necessarily the rule, such years are most definitely not the exception either.\n\nconsider first the number of calendar years over the past 10 that these market beaters lagged the overall stock market: this number averages 4.8, believe it or not, or only slightly less than half the time. (please see the accompanying chart.) the number of calendar years of the past 10 when these market beaters actually lost money was 2.3, on average, or about one of every four.\n\nand note carefully that these numbers reflect the performance of the very best advisers at the top of the 10-year rankings.\n\ntrump signs executive order to cut regulations\n\nlest you conclude that the investment-newsletter industry is unique, let me assure you that they are not. consider a brandes institute study from 2007 in which the frequency of mutual fund losses and benchmark-lagging returns was measured. it found that each and every one of the mutual funds in the top decile for 10-year performance through 2006 was nevertheless in the bottom half of the ranking in at least one 12-month period. and three-quarters of those top decile funds were in the bottom 10% for performance during at least one 12-month period.\n\nin showing us why it's premature to get rid of a manager for short-term underperformance, these studies also illustrate why picking an adviser in the first place is so important. you need to give your chosen manager the benefit of the doubt even if he or she lags behind the market for a year or two along the way.\n\nif the relationship to your adviser is not exactly a marriage, it's far closer to it than most of us think. and yet most investors view their relationships with their advisers as something akin to a one-night stand.\n\nfor more information, including descriptions of the hulbert sentiment indices, go to www.hulbertratings.com or email mark@hulbertratings.com.
divorce is never easy, but couples over 50 who end their marriages face particular hurdles. below, people who went through a late-in-life divorce share six things they would tell their younger selves, offering ways others can learn from their experiences:\n\ni wish i had known how the divorce would impact my oldest children even more than my youngest still at home. gail konop, a 57-year-old yoga studio owner whose 2011 divorce ended a 25-year marriage, said her son who lived at home slowly got used to her new reality, which wasn't as easy for her adult daughters. he got to see us as individuals living in his life. he saw how there was less stress, and he got used to it. but my daughters are coming home periodically and they couldn't keep up with the changes. at one point, konop says her daughter announced, i don't want to come home anymore — it's so weird. if you're considering a divorce and kids are involved, don't assume you are sparing your children by holding on, only to divorce once they're out of the house.\n\ni wish i'd explored the job market before i separated; i think i would have worked harder to try to keep the marriage together if i'd realized just how bleak things are out here. for older adults, especially women who have been out of the workforce, re-entering it can be more even more challenging than they expect. look into getting advice from financial and career counselors to consider your options for long- and short-term planning post-divorce. beth hodges, a family law attorney at horack talley in charlotte, n.c ., says the input of those experts can be helpful when negotiating the amount of alimony and property settlement.\n\nsometimes when we're negotiating, i have a client who wants to get her degree to increase her earning capacity. we'll find out what the cost would be to go back to school and get statistics on what type of income my client can expect to receive once she finishes, which then gets figured into the settlement package, so the main breadwinner will pay for her education instead of alimony.\n\nwhat to do in your 50s to build wealth for your retirement\n\ni wish i had known how painful it would be. kelly james, a ghostwriter who was 50 when she divorced after 19 years of marriage, was surprised by how long it took her to adjust to the loneliness of living alone.\n\neven if you don't have the happiest of marriages, there's something comforting about having someone in your home, your bed. i'm lonely sometimes and miss being part of a twosome, says james. it's also difficult to not have my kids with me all the time — their dad and i do a good job of co-parenting, but i miss them when they're at his house.\n\nin addition to suggesting the pursuit of new hobbies and volunteer opportunities, hodges recommends therapists to her clients as a way of helping them adjust to their new life. [divorce] is a very traumatic, life-rattling experience, especially if you've been married for 25 to 35 years, says hodges. she reassures her clients that in time, they'll not only recover, but emerge stronger. [divorce] can be transformative, says hodges. she tells her clients, 'you're going to survive and feel better about yourself and about your future.' almost to a person they'll come back to me and say, 'you were absolutely right.'\n\ni didn't think my friends would actually bail on me, but i was wrong. lynn cohen, a chicago-area divorce attorney who serves on the board of the women's divorce support nonprofit the lilac tree, sees it all the time with her older female clients: a lot of their friends cut them off — even their best friends. you might keep one or two close friends, but that whole crowd is not going to be there. they'll help you while you're going through [the divorce] but not after it's done.\n\nshe advises her clients to get ahead of this social shift and be proactive about expanding their networks by joining groups that set up travel opportunities for single people, and by volunteering. if you're not active in your community and giving back, you're kind of by yourself, cohen notes. she also cautions against relying too heavily on divorced friends. every divorce is a different set of facts and circumstances and must be viewed individually. they'll say, 'when i was divorced, i was able to get everything in the house.' that's unnerving and usually bad advice. i tell people that they're going to have to make their own life, says cohen.\n\ni wish i had known how expensive it would be. james was shocked that her uncontested, relatively conflict-free collaborative divorce still cost nearly $35,000.\n\nin retrospect, a 'traditional' would have probably been a lot less expensive, she says. collaborative divorce eschews adversarial strategies and litigation. cohen advises consulting a divorce attorney as soon as a client suspects she or he may need one to get a jump on figuring out how to pay for the divorce and life after. alimony may be sparse if a couple already living on retirement savings splits, so would-be divorcées may need time for their exit strategy.\n\nhodges has a simple tip when it comes to saving divorce attorney fees: stay off the phone. sometimes clients run up their bills because they're constantly calling us and engaging us in half-hour consultations. we're there to counsel and provide guidance to a client, but there is a cost, says hodges.\n\nthe first thing you should do when hiring an attorney, she says, is ask questions about the attorney's billing practices, how the lawyer charges. if there are things you can do for the attorneys, like gathering financial information, you can save money by doing that yourself.\n\ni wish i had known how liberating it would be — and how that can be a little scary. says konop: being only responsible for myself (and my kids) has let me make decisions based on what i want. from little decisions like what to hang on the wall of my house to bigger ones like where to travel and what kinds of projects to do on the house, is all up to me. that feels good but can also be overwhelming. it was like i had a second adolescence. i had so much fun, i knew myself so much better. at first, it was really nerve-racking and the dating world had changed. it was energizing (until it got exhausting.)
the new movie colette, which just got bought by bleecker street and 30west for a mid-seven-figure sum for release later this year, following its premiere at the sundance film festival, is many things: a biopic of france's most celebrated female author. a racy period drama. a timely look at gender inequality. and a star vehicle for keira knightley, which might well put her in awards contention next year.\n\nyet colette is additionally a study of how the pursuit of money can drive, and derail, a marriage. in 1893, at the age of 20, sidonie-gabrielle colette (knightley) married the unscrupulous literary entrepreneur henry gauthier-villars, nicknamed willy, 14 years her senior and played in the film by dominic west, best known for his roles in tv dramas the affair and the wire.\n\na popular author and socialite, willy's business depended upon a stable of ghostwriters to publish books that would appear under his name. when his wife pens a series of novels that purport to be the journal of a provincial schoolgirl called claudine, but which are in fact based on her schooldays, he takes the credit for those too.\n\ncolette's claudine series became bestsellers and willy both owns the copyright and keeps the lavish royalties. while he buys her a country house with the profits, both partners' infidelities as well as creative and financial tensions lead to the pair divorcing. (colette would later sue for, and win, the right to drop her husband's name from the title pages of the claudine series.)\n\nhe's not a writer, he's a businessman and therefore spouts figures, knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing, west said of his character in an interview with marketwatch.\n\nthey were a celebrity couple and they generated so much wealth — hundreds of thousands in today's dollars, said director westmoreland, and a lot of their wealth came from them mining their own relationship in the books.\n\nconfronted with willy's persistent infidelities and controlling ways, colette develops her own writing identity and emotional independence, leading willy to reflect that the marriage ultimately amounted to a bad investment. when at the end of the movie, willy talks about what they had as a business, it's very much about what their relationship has become through being in the public eye for so long, said westmoreland.\n\ncolette subsequently became a public figure and prolific author, observing in her 1957 book my apprenticeships about her ex-husband: figures were his greatest entertainment, the source of his deepest pleasures and of his gravest guilt. to count, to amass, to hoard — even in the flood of his letters that have survived him, these are his chief concerns.\n\napart from chronicling the rise and fall of a celebrity couple and colette's sexual liberation that encompassed lovers of both sexes, westmoreland said he was determined to examine financial pressures in paris's belle époque period. we wanted to get into how much everything cost whether it's how much a dress cost or how much willy was paying for his mistress a month, he said.\n\nat one point he lists the household income and how much is coming in and how much is going out so you understand the relative economy that they were in at the beginning and then the money they made from the claudine books, he said.\n\nhe added: willy went through money like a knife through butter. he was always spending things. he would buy a racehorse that went lame or a car that fell apart. he would spend more money than was coming in so it always put them on the verge of financial collapse.\n\nwestmoreland compares the arrangement to andy warhol's celebrated factory. warhol would come up with the ideas but other people would do the work and this is very much along the same lines that willy operated.\n\nwilly had great ideas and mastered the pitch but in his way he was frightened of the blank page and didn't have the discipline to deal with the writing process, he added. colette was the opposite — she thrived in sitting for hours and hours just writing and found power through being able to do that.\n\nsidonie gabrielle colette and her first husband, henry gauthier-vivars, who wrote under the pen-name of 'willy,' together with music hall singer polaire hulton archive/getty images\n\nwest found their business arrangement a modern one. i was rather amazed that what we talk about today about branding or twitter has been around for a very long time and it's discussed in 'colette', he said.\n\nhow does west himself separate art from commerce when it comes to choosing a role? how dare you?! he responds. i wouldn't dream of ever taking a job for the money. why would i ever do that? tomb raider! [a knowing reference to the upcoming lara croft blockbuster in which he acts opposite alicia vikander.] it's a fairly well-established route where you do some things for money so that you can do things for passion. [colette] was definitely in the latter, not just because we didn't get a lot of money out of it but also because it's a worthwhile story that is all too rare in our business.\n\nboth actor and director encouraged comparisons between their film and the current, ongoing gender inequality debate.\n\nwilly used the public aspect of the relationship in order to maintain this parasitic relationship, west said. that's very relevant to hollywood today. that was his way of keeping the status quo...there's so much in this film where you recoil from the coupling as it's an older man and a younger girl and willy making a lot of money out of a sexual proclivity towards older men and younger women.\n\nadded westmoreland: it's very relevant because the whole entertainment business and many other areas of society have been shaken up by the #metoo movement. the way of conducting business within that the male power structure was holding so many women down and allowing so much bad and predatory behavior against them.\n\nthe shoot threw up other practical challenges for west: it was a very hot budapest summer [during the filming of colette.] it's quite difficult to kiss someone when you've got a huge fatsuit and a walrus mustache and there are scenes i notice before i got my cooling equipment where i do look like i'm melting.\n\nwhile colette credited her first husband for encouraging her to be a writer, posterity has delivered its verdict on the pair. willy published her art as his own and sold the rights and pocketed the money so he was a total exploiter, said west. but she's not a victim and was able to stand up to him. she went on to become the biggest female figure in french literature. no one's ever heard of willy.
at a time in one's life that should be their golden years, women over 65 are 80% more likely than men to live at or below the poverty line (9% as compared with 5%). one reason for this: divorce.\n\na woman can expect an almost 30% decline in her standard of living following divorce, while men often see an increase of 10%. take for example, a woman we'll call catherine, whose 20-year marriage recently ended. catherine received half of a seven-figure estate, which included the family home. while this may sound advantageous from the outside looking in, her settlement was not as lucrative as it appeared.\n\ncatherine's pre-martial estate was almost entirely tied up in a family business (i.e., a highly illiquid asset). instead of receiving a lump sum of cash, or other type of liquid asset, to buy her out of the business, her ex-husband agreed to make monthly installment payments to her over a 10-year period. essentially, catherine became a bank, financing her ex-husband's obligation to her at 0% interest.\n\nread: this is why baby boomers are divorcing at a stunning rate\n\nthe monthly, hefty, tax-free payments gave catherine a false sense of security. she felt she could afford the marital home and wouldn't have to go back to work. however, she would be living off of her assets each month, not her income. so, once her ex-husband made his final payment, not only are there no more assets coming in, but the future value of the asset (had it been invested and not spent) is also lost.\n\nso, how can women achieve a better financial resolution after divorce? here are five common mistakes to avoid:\n\n1. waiting to consult a financial expert\n\nduring the divorce process, too many divorcées rely solely on their lawyer to evaluate the long-term impact of various settlement options. they look to a wealth adviser afterward to create a financial plan. this is a major missed opportunity.\n\nyour family law attorney is the primary expert in navigating your divorce settlement. however, collaboration by a legal and financial adviser around the details of your marital estate, and how they might impact your long-term financial goals is critical—and most effective before you make an irrevocable decision.\n\nyou, and your team, need to have a comprehensive understanding your assets, including tax consequences, earning power, transaction costs and liquidity challenges. for example, private equity, stock options, businesses, residential and commercial property, retirement accounts and collections all have distinct attributes and potential challenges that should be considered in your settlement.\n\nread: this is how much you will need for retirement — and how covid-19 will change that\n\n2. underestimating your liquidity needs\n\nliquidity (aka, access to cash) should be top of mind. divorce is expensive: the national average cost for divorce is estimated at $15,000 per person, according to thestreet.\n\nbut there are additional expenses you may not have considered, potentially including new housing, furniture, automobiles and miscellaneous purchases. beyond the importance of paying for your legal fees and other short-term necessities, it's essential to ensure that the assets you choose to retain have the ability to grow and can ultimately be used to meet your long-term financial needs. remember:\n\n• automobiles, boats and furniture are depreciating assets.\n\n• retirement accounts carry significant penalties and tax consequences if liquidated.\n\n• real estate can generate high carrying costs, and on average only appreciates at the pace of real inflation.\n\neven potentially profitable investments, such as a stake in a business or limited partnership, must be weighed against investible assets (i.e. cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds), which you can use now to establish long-term security.\n\nread: borrowing against social security is a bad idea. here's what you should do instead\n\n3. letting emotions take over\n\nclearly, divorce is an emotional process: it's a major change, and so it's understandable that you (or maybe your children) might look forward to the stability of keeping the same home. but this is a great example of where an emotional decision is not necessarily a financially savvy one.\n\nfor instance, married couples are entitled to a $500,000 capital-gains tax exemption on the sale of a primary residence; however, you can only exclude $250,000 as a sole owner. second, by not selling and splitting the proceeds as part of the settlement, you will absorb the full brunt of transaction costs — including hefty 6% realtor fees — that could have been shared. finally, though each circumstance is different, the equity in your home is probably not an ideal vehicle to support your long-term financial goals.\n\nit's important to consider not only how you feel about a given decision, but the long-term financial consequences.\n\n4. failing to properly ensure what you're owed in the future\n\nnegotiating the amount of your child support, and in some cases spousal support, is only the first step in ensuring what you're owed in the future. securing the income is another ballgame. across the united states, more than half of custodial parents fail to receive full child support payments. with that in mind, put a wage assignment order in place to ensure child and spousal support gets paid — even in the most amicable situations.\n\nyou should also consider using a life insurance policy to insure all support obligations. to get started, consider the following steps:\n\n• begin by checking whether your existing policies have death benefits large enough to cover the present value of future support.\n\n• negotiate so that ownership of the policy is transferred to you. if this is not possible, work with the insurance company directly before completing your agreement. in either case, you need to ensure you are notified immediately if premiums are missed.\n\n• if you need to purchase a new policy, attempt to negotiate the premiums into your settlement so that the paying spouse covers the cost. after all, the policy is insuring their liability to you.\n\nif your settlement includes an equalizing payment, whether in a lump sum or series of payments, there are steps you can take to ensure its integrity. for instance, you can work with your attorney to create a support order ensuring that the payment is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. and to protect yourself from nonpayments, you can explore a deed of trust specifying collateral. incentivize your former spouse to be timely and diligent with payments: pursuing enforcement through legal channels is expensive and time-consuming.\n\nif the equalizing payment has been ordered without collateral, or there otherwise won't be sufficient funds to satisfy the payment in the event of your former spouse's death, consider taking out a life insurance policy. while this important step won't protect you in the case of bankruptcy, it will safeguard your asset in the event something happens to your former spouse.\n\nread: work, daily life, family, loss, acts of kindness, silver linings — what we have learned from the pandemic\n\n5. not accepting your 'new normal'\n\nwith the marital balance sheet often split in half, plus two lifestyles to fund, change is likely inevitable, regardless of the amount of support you might be receiving or your post-divorce net worth. failure to adapt to these new circumstances can be dangerous, as overextending yourself in the present can lead to catastrophic financial consequences in the future.\n\noften the obstacle is not having a comprehensive understanding around the type of lifestyle you can afford based on your new financial framework. it's wise to work with a wealth adviser to create a plan around your spending that won't sabotage your long-term goals. strive to live below your means; generating a surplus each month to help you rebuild your assets will give you peace of mind, and that's the best lifestyle of all.\n\neducate yourself about common mistakes—as well as best practices—so you can be better equipped to thrive in your next chapter.\n\nsteph wagner is the director of women & wealth at northern trust wealth management.
you're probably going to die with some debt to your name. most people do. in fact, 73% of consumers had outstanding debt when they were reported as dead, according to december 2016 data provided to credit.com by credit bureau experian.\n\nthose consumers carried an average total balance of $61,554, including mortgage debt. without home loans, the average balance was $12,875.\n\nthe data is based on experian's fileone database, which includes 220 million consumers. (there are about 242 million adults in the u.s., according to 2015 estimates from the census bureau.) to determine the average debt people have when they die, experian looked at consumers who, as of october 2016, were not deceased, but then showed as deceased as of december 2016. among the 73% of consumers who had debt when they died, about 68% had credit card balances. the next most common kind of debt was mortgage debt (37%), followed by auto loans (25%), personal loans (12%) and student loans (6%).\n\nthese were the average unpaid balances: credit cards, $4,531; auto loans, $17,111; personal loans, $14,793; and student loans, $25,391.\n\nthat's a lot of debt, and it doesn't just disappear when someone dies.\n\nwhat does happen to debt after you die?\n\nfor the most part, your debt dies with you, but that doesn't mean it won't affect the people you leave behind.\n\ndebt belongs to the deceased person or that person's estate, said darra l. rayndon, an estate planning attorney with clark hill in scottsdale, arizona. if someone has enough assets to cover their debts, the creditors get paid, and beneficiaries receive whatever remains. but if there aren't enough assets to satisfy debts, creditors lose out (they may get some, but not all, of what they're owed). family members do not then become responsible for the debt, as some people worry they might.\n\nread: you need more life insurance and it's probably cheaper than you think\n\nthat's the general idea, but things are not always that straightforward. the type of debt you have, where you live and the value of your estate significantly affects the complexity of the situation. (for example, federal student loan debt is eligible for cancellation upon a borrower's death, but private student loan companies tend not to offer the same benefit. they can go after the borrower's estate for payment.)\n\nthere are lots of ways things can get messy. say your only asset is a home other people live in. that asset must be used to satisfy debts, whether it's the mortgage on that home or a lot of credit card debt, meaning the people who live there may have to take over the mortgage, or your family may need to sell the home in order to pay creditors. accounts with co-signers or co-applicants can also result in the debt falling on someone else's shoulders. community property states, where spouses share ownership of property, also handle debts acquired during a marriage a little differently.\n\nread: who inherits your itunes?\n\nit's one thing if the beneficiaries are relatives that don't need your money, but if your beneficiaries are a surviving spouse, minor children — people like that who depend on you for their welfare, then life insurance is a great way to provide additional money in the estate to pay debts, rayndon said.\n\npeople spend small fortunes to bury pets at this cemetery\n\nhow to avoid burdening your family\n\none way to make sure debt doesn't make a mess of your estate is to stay out of it. you can keep tabs on your debt by reviewing a free snapshot of your credit report on credit.com, in addition to sticking to a budget that helps you live below your means. you may also want to consider getting life insurance and meeting with an estate planning attorney to make sure everything's covered in the event of your death. if you're worried about leaving behind debt after death, here's more on how protect your loved ones.\n\npoor planning can leave your loved ones with some significant stress. for example, if you don't have a will or designate beneficiaries for your assets, the law in your state of residence decides who gets what.\n\nif you don't write a will, your state of residence will write one for you should you pass away, said james m. matthews, a certified financial planner and managing director of blueprint, a financial planning firm in charlotte, north carolina. odds are the state laws and your wishes are different.\n\nit can also get expensive to have these matters determined by the courts, and administrative costs get paid before creditors and beneficiaries. if you'd like to provide for your loved ones after you die, you won't want court costs and outstanding debts to eat away at your estate.\n\nremember, estate planning can involve more than just drafting a will. here are seven documents you'll need to fill out before you die.\n\nmore from credit.com\n\n• how to pay off your credit cards\n\n• trapped in payday loan debt? here's how to escape\n\n• my credit is the worst. how can i fix it?\n\nthis article originally appeared on credit.com.
when their clients marry, financial advisers hope to advise the happy couple for decades to come. if that happiness turns sour, many advisers refuse to stand by and let irreconcilable differences set in.\n\nadvisers aren't miracle workers. they can't singlehandedly save a marriage. yet they're ideally positioned to identify money conflicts and offer pathways to resolve them.\n\nsetting boundaries — and knowing how far to push them — tests advisers. if they pry and offer unsolicited advice about a couple's marital troubles, their words and actions can prove counterproductive.\n\nadvisers must resist the temptation to take sides, especially if they're closer to one spouse. listening with compassion helps build and reinforce trust. lecturing and finding fault almost always backfires.\n\ni've had clients come in looking to get divorced, said sarah carlson, a certified financial planner in spokane, wash. usually, it's the woman expressing frustration with their husband and looking for answers.\n\nshe cites the example of a 65-year-old client who feared that her 40-year marriage would end due largely to her husband's divergent retirement goals and spending priorities. the client asked carlson, can i make it financially if i leave him?\n\ncarlson assured her that she had sufficient assets to live on her own. but she also suggested that the client seek professional counseling.\n\nthen carlson hosted a meeting with the couple. she analyzed their holdings and crunched the numbers.\n\nwe discussed dividing their assets and talked about if they got a divorce, this is how it would shake out, she recalled. through that process, i took money out of the equation as something to fight over. that took away the power of money.\n\nas a result, the husband became more receptive to his wife's retirement goals, including traveling more frequently. the couple both earned pensions, so carlson helped them understand their long-term prospects for financial security.\n\nseven years later, carlson says the marriage is strong. she credits a number of factors, including their willingness to keep an open mind and support each other's aspirations and goals in retirement.\n\nsometimes an adviser can cut through layers of marital conflict to address the heart of the matter. one piercing comment can shift an angry spouse's attitude and lead to reconciliation.\n\namy jo lauber, a certified financial planner in west seneca, n.y., recalls a client who discovered that her husband had racked up credit card debt and hurt their credit score. he tried to rectify the situation by transferring balances from one card to another (to chase 0% introductory rates), but sunk deeper into a hole.\n\nshe was so upset at him, lauber said. listening attentively, lauber let her client vent. then she paused and replied, your husband believed he was doing the right thing for you. he thought he was managing your credit. he wants to do what's best. lauber's comment led her client to reframe the situation. she regained her composure and approached her husband with more empathy and less judgment.\n\nbeyond making wise observations, advisers can share bold suggestions to jolt a couple into finding ways to forgive a transgression.\n\nadam lampe, a houston-based adviser, recalls meeting with a client couple about 10 years ago. one of them said, there's been infidelity in our relationship. adam, what do you think needs to happen?\n\ninstinctively, lampe came up with an idea. with most of their money in a joint account, he proposed that the spouse who engaged in infidelity could move all the funds into an individual account owned by the aggrieved party.\n\nthere was a certain level of embarrassment and a need to regain trust, lampe said. moving millions of dollars to the spouse who felt betrayed demonstrated a commitment to salvage the marriage. the couple instantly agreed.\n\nthe marriage has survived. eight years later, the couple reestablished a joint account. today, they remain happily together.\n\nmore: embroiled in a family feud? these people could help\n\nplus: retired too soon? how to re-enter the job market without skipping a beat
if you own a business, you're used to tracking various risk variables, such as new competitors, technology changes or supply costs. but have you considered your spouse as a possible downside danger?\n\nthink about it: divorce is not an unpredictable black swan event. almost half of first marriages end in court; the portion is even higher for second and third marriages.\n\ncouples who own a family business may have gotten together when they were young, and the business probably had little value. as the business grows over the years, it's not uncommon for a couple to have almost all their net worth tied up in the business. as a result, there usually isn't enough cash for one spouse to buy out the other.\n\nthat can mean the business must be sold or take on a heavy debt load — even if the business was built and managed over the years by only one spouse.\n\nso, protecting your family business from the consequences of divorce is crucial to its survival. and for many couples, the business is the biggest personal asset for each partner.\n\nhere are some mechanisms to use:\n\na prenup now will save your business later\n\nof course, if you started the business before your marriage, you can sign a prenuptial agreement that specifies what happens to the company if you get a divorce.\n\ndone properly, prenups can be ironclad, negating even the property-division laws in the nine community property states: arizona, california, idaho, louisiana, nevada, new mexico, texas, washington and wisconsin.\n\nthe document must be in writing and executed voluntarily before witnesses. it requires full disclosure by both spouses and can't be unconscionable. that means if you're making millions, you can't just give your spouse the keurig and a kiss goodbye.\n\nfor people who forgo a prenup, before the wedding is also the best time to set up a buy-sell agreement to protect a family business from disintegrating in a divorce. also known as a buyout agreement, a buy-sell is a contract between business co-owners that governs the situation if one co-owner dies or is otherwise forced, or chooses, to leave the business.\n\nin a divorce, a good buy-sell agreement would require a former spouse to sell any interest received in a settlement back to the company's owners at a price set by a specified valuation method.\n\nuse a trust for generational wealth\n\na way to protect family business assets in the longer term involves using a trust to shield the next generation in case that generation goes through a divorce.\n\nfor example, a father makes a gift to his daughter of $5 million worth of stock in the family business, which is put into a trust that benefits only her. if she marries and later divorces, her spouse can't touch this money—as long as the gifted stock or stock sale proceeds stays within the trust.\n\nthis kind of trust is favored in higher-net-worth situations, but generally, it can't be used to divorce-proof a business if you and your spouse split up.\n\nstay together, at least in the business\n\nthe best and simplest way, perhaps, to structure a business that can withstand a divorce is for the spouses to continue as co-owners, even as they get a divorce. unfortunately, this strategy won't work for many couples, especially those locked in emotional or legal combat..\n\nif you go down this road, though, make sure to have a shareholder agreement drawn up that gives either spouse the right to buy the other out at a mutually agreeable price.\n\nnote that buying out your spouse's interest in the business requires first evaluating the value of the business, which is not always easy and can in itself be very expensive. coming up with the money to finance the buyout can also be difficult.\n\nyou could use leverage to raise money—that is, add debt to the business to get cash to the spouse who will no longer be involved in the business.\n\ncan wall street close this gender gap?\n\nborrow, buyout, or add a partner\n\nthe best route for this is to take out a bank loan; it's easy and likely will have the lowest cost of capital.\n\nanother option is a property settlement note, which is a long-term loan for a with-interest payout of the amount you owe your ex-spouse for his or her share of the business.\n\nif the business already has significant debt, you could consider adding a partner or going after private equity investment or venture capital. if you choose to add a partner, be sure to include a buy-sell agreement in the deal.\n\nfinally, selling the business and splitting the profits is a straightforward, if not ideal, solution. and if your business is the largest share of your assets, this may be your only choice. one advantage is that if your business sells quickly, you will both soon have money to pursue your own interests. also, selling the business means you can avoid financial ties to your former spouse. but keep in mind that many companies aren't easy to sell, so you may be stuck working with your ex for many, many months.\n\nbut who knows? you may patch things up and remarry each other. if so, this time, please see above on prenuptial agreements.\n\ndaniel thompson is a certified financial planner and regional president for first western trust in denver.
after michele lent hirsch had major hip surgery in her early 20s, even as she hobbled around on crutches, people didn't always believe that she'd had surgery.\n\noh, my grandmother had that, she'd hear. or, weird, hip surgery.\n\nan older woman yelled at her for taking a seat on a mostly empty bus, and one bus driver refused to lower the steps so she could get on.\n\nother health problems beset lent hirsch throughout much of her 20s, from a severe allergic reaction that nearly killed her to thyroid cancer — which her then-boss told her to leave at the door — and later, lyme disease.\n\nover and over again, she saw how unsympathetic society was toward young women with health problems.\n\nlent hirsch began to wonder whether other young women were struggling with similarly serious health conditions. the answer turned out to be an overwhelming yes.\n\nstatistics show that young women are disproportionately affected by certain diseases and health conditions, she says — and that's hard enough.\n\nbut they also have to grapple with societal attitudes toward women, and young women in particular, which makes everything that much more difficult.\n\nthere's this idea that young women are this beacon of health and beauty and fertility, she says.\n\nwhen illness strikes, nobody believes you. or they say, 'oh, my god,' in this really dramatic way, she says. it also means that often you don't feel comfortable revealing [your condition] to people.\n\nthat contributes to the perception that there aren't many young women with serious medical conditions, she says, which her research shows couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nlent hirsch, a writer and editor who's now 33, tells those stories in her new book, invisible: how young women with serious health issues navigate work, relationships, and the pressure to seem just fine, which came out late last month.\n\nshe spoke with marketwatch about what this has in common with the me too movement, the year she spent $10,000 on medical expenses and how health issues tend to affect women's romantic relationships (hint: not positively).\n\n 'what i found in my research is that young women are actually the primary demographic for a lot of major health issues and diseases and we just don't talk about that, and we don't think about it, and we, as a culture, don't want to think about it.'  — michele lent hirsch\n\nbelow is an edited version of the conversation.\n\nmarketwatch: when i was reading the book i kept thinking maybe different people had written different chapters, because just so much happened to you. it seemed impossible for it all to have been one person.\n\nmichele lent hirsch: nope, it's all me. and the no. 1 thing people said to me through all of this was, but you look fine, or, you look good, or, you look pretty, or, but you're thin.\n\nyoung women are pressured to act cool and chill about everything even if they don't have health issues. but when people constantly tell you that because you look ok or even great from the outside, they can't imagine that you are really going through this, it's a really difficult thing.\n\nmichele lent hirsch writes about her experience of being very sick in her 20s in the new book invisible: how young women with serious health issues navigate work, relationships, and the pressure to seem just fine, which came out last month. willy somma\n\nit's been a lot of years since that initial horrible stuff happened to me, but all of these things are still a part of my life. at this point, everything that was acute is now chronic; i have to take medicine for some of them, [and] i have to monitor some of them. once you have cancer, you forever after have to get screened.\n\nas a young person we're promised these years where everything's fun and carefree. and there's this idea when you're growing up that, oh, it gets bad after 40, or, it gets hard after 50, or, sick people are older. and that's just not true.\n\nwhat i found in my research is that young women are actually the primary demographic for a lot of major health issues and diseases and we just don't talk about that, and we don't think about it, and we, as a culture, don't want to think about it.\n\nmw: i found that surprising, and probably a lot of other people would too. can you talk more about that? what did you come across in your research?\n\nmlh: a lot of people of every age have this idea that young people are healthy, that youth is health.\n\na lot of autoimmune diseases, some cancers — and other things, those are just the two that people tend to emphasize — really strike young women disproportionately. lupus, for instance, certain strains of very, very severe breast cancer, thyroid cancer, which i had, a bunch of autoimmune diseases.\n\nand again, despite the fact that it's what's happening, there's this idea that young women are this beacon of health and beauty and fertility.\n\nand so that means when it does happen to you, you're made to feel very alone, like a complete freak. part of the reason the book is called invisible, is that once i started researching this and interviewing different people, i found that there are so many people that are walking around, in their 20s or 30s, young women, who have pretty serious health stuff going on.\n\na new tool for neurosurgeons: vr technology\n\nsome of them don't tell their friends, some of them definitely don't tell people they're dating, some of them don't tell the people they're working with, even though they might need accommodations or extra time for doctor's appointments, because there's this idea that people don't expect it, people won't believe me.\n\nyou get it at the doctor's office, you get it at your job, you get it when you talk to some family friend.\n\nmw: in the book, i found it interesting that you weren't really asking why did this happen to me? which would be a very reasonable response, but more saying, wow, nobody understands me — if only i knew someone, or was dating someone, who understood or had some kind of illness as well.\n\nmlh: right. i did a little bit at some point in my early 20s, and still now, have moments where i felt really upset that this stuff did happen to me and i do wonder, why did i get stuck with all this stuff? couldn't just the hip surgery have been enough, couldn't just the anaphylaxis, did i really also have to get cancer? like, this is ridiculous.\n\nbut that's not mostly where my thoughts go. it's mostly, why does my culture shit on me so much because i happen to have a health issue and be a young woman?\n\na lot of the women whom i interviewed for the book have just come up against so many difficult moments because of the way people are socialized. and that can almost affect you more than whatever's actually happening in your body.\n\npeople can deal with having diabetes or multiple sclerosis most of the time, but it's people's reactions to it that make it often very hard.\n\nmw: right. in the book you talk about a job where your boss told you to leave your cancer at the door.\n\nmlh: there couldn't be really a worse reaction. and a lot of the women i've interviewed have talked about how they work, just like i did in that job, harder and longer hours just to compensate for what seems like people treating them like they're not a worthy employee anymore.\n\nand what's especially horrible about that is, again, women are already getting paid less, getting treated more poorly at many workplaces across this country.\n\nthat kind of behavior is only going to enforce women trying to hold it all in.\n\nmw: in the book you talk about a study that looked at how likely in straight couples a woman was to leave a man after illness, and vice-versa. that was really, really stark.\n\nmlh: there's a few different studies that i cite in the book. several have shown that in heterosexual marriages, basically if the woman gets a certain type of health issue, the marriage may be six to 10 times more likely to end in divorce; if the man gets the health issue, there's no uptick.\n\nwe have this idea that women are supposed to care for men. of course it's a very heterosexual thing. the studies didn't necessarily get into why; it's certainly a form of very blatant sexism and inequality.\n\ni use the example of newt gingrich in the book, he's left two different wives; it's a very famous example. one was cancer and one was multiple sclerosis. he's a public figure, and people learn from these models.\n\nwe all have this idea that women are supposed to look a certain way, be a certain way. and a health issue may not fit into that idea.\n\nmw: when you talk about serious health issues, my first thought is, that's going to be really expensive. i'm also wondering about the economic and career costs that it may have when you're just getting started in your career.\n\nmlh: in the book i interview a lot of women who have juggled an often very ambitious career with a very serious health issue. there's times when your health issue isn't distracting you at all from your job, and you don't want your boss to start thinking that. at the same time, when i was diagnosed with cancer, of course i had to go to doctor's appointments, i had to have surgery — i can't be in the office when i'm in the hospital.\n\nwhen we treat people like cogs in a machine instead of like human beings, this is a huge problem because everyone's going to get sick at some point, to some extent.\n\nevery winter there are these studies that come out, [that] it's better for employers to let people stay home if they have a cold. if we look at this from a bottom-line perspective, it's not good to treat your employees badly. they're going to burn out, they're going to get sick again, they're going to relapse, quit.\n\nmw: this is also a time when there's a lot of conversations about women in the workplace: how do we support women? is there a common thread? what are the economic repercussions here?\n\nmlh: i think there is. what's in common between what i'm writing about and the me too movement is treating women as less than human, whether that's not caring if they're in extreme pain and you're making them work a 15-hour day anyway, or whether it's treating them as less than human because you are treating them as an object that you can do whatever with.\n\nthere's a larger underlying issue of the way men are socialized to treat women. and there are plenty of women who are terrible to the women they work with when those women get sick, because we've all been taught that work comes first.\n\nthere are basic laws on the books that say you have to accommodate disabilities and health issues in the workplace, but that doesn't mean it's actually happening. just like you're not allowed to sexually harass somebody in the workplace, that doesn't mean it's not happening, as we know.\n\nthe book also gets a little into my own experience with medical costs.\n\nan accountant one year couldn't believe how much i had spent on medical costs, because i looked his age — he was a young guy. that was a particularly difficult year for me, health-wise. i was going to a lot of specialists who didn't take insurance, trying to figure stuff out about my hip, lyme disease. i had written $10,000 as my medical expenses for the year, for tax purposes, and he thought it was a typo. and i am a white person from a middle-class background, and that's still a ridiculous amount of money to spend.\n\nmw: and you had health insurance?\n\nmlh: yes, i had health insurance. i've always had health insurance.\n\nbut sometimes when you have a very serious health condition, you get passed along from specialist to specialist, until sometimes someone says, look the only guy who i know who really knows about this is doctor so-and-so on the upper east side, and he's on park avenue and he costs $400. he sits with you for an hour, and he doesn't take any insurance. sometimes your insurance refunds, let's say, 70% of your costs, but it might take months, and they might reject it.\n\nmw: you talk in the book about reactions at work, from friends. what would you have liked to hear?\n\nmlh: one of the main things i tell people is very simple but needs to be said: just listening when your friend needs to tell you about what's going on with their health, and all the horrible logistics that goes on with that.\n\npeople get so freaked out about young people with illness that they don't want to listen, they don't want to hear that their friend is sick, or that someone their age is sick, which implies they could get sick.\n\nwe know something is off if people feel siloed off from other people whom they don't even know are going through the same thing because they're too afraid to talk about it.

love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how money issues impact our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nmarried couples are happier than everyone else, whether they're single, divorced, widowed or separated, according to a new study published by the office for national statistics in the uk.\n\n­­­the study analyzed data from 286,059 people between october 2017 to september 2018 and found that marital status, their health and economic activity were the top three things people said made them most happy.\n\n• ­­married couples rated their life satisfaction 9.9% higher than widows and widowers.\n\n• married couples were 8.8% happier than higher than divorced or separated people.\n\n• singles, however, only reported being 0.2% happier than those who are divorced.\n\nthey compared these findings to results from the same survey given between 2011 and 2012 and found that marital status matters more to people's overall life satisfaction today than economic status. this was not the case in the immediate aftermath of the great recession.\n\n 'many of my married patients throw themselves onto my office therapy couch complaining about feeling lonely because their spouse is always working.'  — —fran walfish, a beverly hills-based psychologist\n\ncompanionship is critical, said fran walfish, a beverly hills-based psychologist. couples need to do fun things together, she told marketwatch. having fun on a date night out, or the adventure of vacation facilitates bonding through communication, both verbal and physical.\n\npeople who are middle aged are unhappier than younger and older folk. researchers reported that life satisfaction is higher on average for younger adults, and drops significantly to its lowest point when people are in their 40s, but spikes again at retirement age.\n\nmost folks in their 40s are at the peak of their slave years in the workforce with less available time for socializing, walfish said. many of my married patients throw themselves onto my office therapy couch complaining about feeling lonely because their spouse is 'always working.'\n\nbeing married helps people in their 40s. marriage may help ease the causes of the mid-life dip in life satisfaction, according to a 2014 paper by researchers at the department of finance canada and university of british columbia. the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived.\n\nmarriage eases the middle-age dip in life evaluations in western europe, the u.s. and asia, they added. but this works better for couples who are also friends. the well-being effects of marriage are about twice as large for those whose spouse is also their best friend, they found.\n\nsee also:when wives earn more than their husbands, their marriage is less likely to last\n\nit's easier to be single and young, walfish added. younger adults still place 'having fun' high on their priority list, while people in retirement age have slowed down and feel increased desire for connection and attachment in their relationship partners, she said.\n\n single people are typically more connected to other people than married people, have more friends and value meaningful work more.  — —bella depaulo, the author of 'singled out'\n\nwhat's more, single people are typically more connected to other people than married people, have more friends and value meaningful work more, according to bella depaulo, the author of singled out and a project scientist at university of california, santa barbara.\n\nhow married couples spend their money matters. partners spending money on a shared experiences like vacations or going out to dinner, are more likely to be very satisfied with life than those splurging more on less exciting things like groceries, insurance and cell phones.\n\nless surprisingly, perhaps, those who own their homes outright were reported they were also more satisfied than renters, the latest study said. they are able to share their costs and they have less housing insecurity than people who are living in rented accommodation.\n\nthe balance of economic power is shifting in marriage. wives earning more than their husbands has become more common: 38% of wives earn more than their husbands versus less than a quarter of wives 30 years ago, according to united states census bureau data.\n\nhowever, this income inequality in a marriage could potentially put a rift in the relationship in some cases, however. separate research suggests that if a woman makes more money in the marriage, it could make their partner feel uncomfortable, according to the u.s. census bureau.
dear moneyist,\n\ni've been living with the same man for close to 27 years. of course, our relationship was good in the beginning. most are. however, he has always had an inability to handle money. our home has always been in my name, usually because of his poor credit. i've always had to be the one to plan and pay for any vacations and, frankly, i'm sick to death of him.\n\na few years into the relationship he had to have a kidney transplant and quit his good paying job as a mechanic. he is now 70. so how could i tell him back then that i didn't want to be his safety net? for the past 20 years or so, he has had a part-time job with low pay, mostly to help him with his medications that are required post-transplant. he has no savings, at all!\n\nhe has always tried to give me a few hundred dollars each month for rent and, yes, that has helped, but i still work part-time myself and, at 73, i feel like he just drags me down. he is so negative and would rather sit in front of the tv instead of making an effort to make life more enjoyable. i own the house and i'm ready to just give it to him, and walk away with my small retirement fund.\n\nneither one of us has any family that is willing to help us. do you have any suggestions?\n\nup to my teeth in north carolina\n\ndear up,\n\nhe contributes the bare minimum to save his blushes. he expects you to pick up the slack at home and at work. he delivers a daily weather broadcast that is grey and overcast, with the threat of rain. this isn't about the money. it's rarely, if ever, about the money. it's not about a part-time job. it's certainly not about an transplant operation that took place many years ago. it's not even about him being a couch potato. this isn't about love or money. i don't even know what love means, exactly.\n\n ask yourself the tough questions with the help of a team: a lawyer, therapist and/or financial therapist. \n\nlove means many things to many people. companionship, co-habitation, being married, not being married, spending quality time with each other, being alone together and having downtime, sharing your most important news with that one person that you can't wait to get home to see, breaking bread together, making plans, traveling the world as a couple, being a team, being the source of a warm light when your beloved has lost their own, growing old together and/or enjoying the moment.\n\nalso see: my wife and i bailed out our son with his mortgage and car payments, and set up 529s for his kids — yet we have the daughter-in-law from hell\n\nso if it's not about love or money, what is it about? your story is about respect, or lack thereof. he doesn't show respect for you. he doesn't show respect for himself. you appear not to respect him, and you may not have respected him for a long time. you have stayed in this relationship for probably more years than was healthy for either of you. for that reason, you have not given yourself the respect that you deserve. he's not dragging you down. you are dragging yourself down.\n\n help him to sign up for medicaid, if he has not done so already. ask him what kind of split he would find fair. \n\nwe all have choices. you chose him and you chose to stay with him. from your letter, he is healthy enough to work and go about his business. the kidney transplant was a success. he lives a normal life, to coin an often overused/misused phrase. devoting your life and your time on this planet to a man you don't love anymore is not a vocation. it's not an act of love or respect. you are depriving him of the chance to be his own man and/or depriving yourself of a man who would appreciate you.\n\nif you think you could find a way back to a place you were when you met, that should be your first port of call. a couple's counselor could help you. but i urge you to give that a time frame and set certain goals for what you would like from your partner, financial or otherwise. i'm not advocating that you split up now after 27 years, but taking you at your word that you are unhappy with the status quo.\n\nrecommended:this analysis of 40 million uber rides reveals exactly how much people tip\n\nask yourself why you stayed. did this relationship feel familiar to you? did you stay with a man who gave you something that you either did (or didn't) have growing up? my job here is not to be an armchair therapist. my job is to help you to look in places you may not have looked before, dark corners that may contain answers that will give you the willpower and the courage to live your own life on your terms, so you can be free — financially, spiritually, emotionally. all of the above are related.\n\n you've given so much of your life to this relationship. why sabotage yourself and give up your home too? \n\nyou wouldn't have stayed in this relationship if you did not get something out of it. so what did you get? you may have gotten companionship, a person to come home to at night, a reason and/or excuse not to go out into the world and risk your heart with another man and take a risk on another life as a single woman. answering this question will help you shift the focus away from your partner and onto yourself. crucially, it will also help you take responsibility for your choices.\n\nalso see: 'nothing is ever his fault, everyone is out to get him.' our brother inherited our late mother's home and it was repossessed. he's now in prison — do i send him money?\n\nwhen you ask yourself the tough questions with the help of a team — a lawyer, therapist and/or financial therapist — you will stop suppressing your voice and your true feelings, and start living your life on your terms. north carolina does not recognize common-law marriage. a lawyer can advise you on the rent your partner has paid, whether it constitutes a contribution to your mortgage, and what might be a fair sum to pay him. ask him what he believes would be fair. then give your view.\n\n help him sign up for medicaid, if he has not done so. together, make sure you both have a roof over your heads. \n\nhelp him sign up for medicaid, if he has not done so already. together, you can make sure you both have a roof over your heads. you did not work your whole life to be miserable. you did not pay your mortgage on a home only to have an 11th-hour case of the fook-its, and give it away to a man that stopped showing up for your partnership a long time ago. you've given so much of your life to this relationship already. why sabotage yourself and give up your home too?\n\n(this story was originally published on jan. 5.)\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

dear moneyologist,\n\nmy husband and i have been married for 13 years and we have a 13-year-old daughter. my husband already owned our family house when we got married (the mortgage will be paid off in about seven years), so i am not a legal part-owner of the house. he refinanced the house a few years ago and decided not to include me in the deed.\n\nhe wrote a will a few years ago in which, in case of death, i get the house. however, it is one of those do-it-yourself forms that he got off the internet with his signature and a couple witnesses (co-workers). i do not think it was even done with a notary public. i worry that if he dies, it will be very hard for me to establish legal ownership of the house.\n\nhe says that this piece of paper is valid and i should not have any problems if he dies. but i am afraid that i will have to hire a lawyer and that i will have to spend a lot money to get a new deed or a future title of the house. i am sure it will be a nightmare. i think that i deserve to have peace of mind when it comes to protecting my future and that of my daughter as well.\n\nif my husband were to die, what would be the legal process and also, what advice would you give me in order to be more legally prepared in case this was to happen?\n\nstella\n\nis getting paid to take care of our parents ever ok?\n\ndear stella,\n\nwe all deserve peace of mind in life, though few of us get it. i'm pretty sure if you looked up do-it-yourself wills in a dictionary with pictures, you'd find a photograph of a very distraught family staring back at you. rules on the validity of wills vary by state, but generally wills are witnessed rather than notarized, according to barbara wright, an estate-planning attorney in palo alto, calif. that's the good news. but you should ensure this will is valid by having a lawyer look at it.\n\nif there was no will (or it wasn't valid), the home would not necessarily pass to you by right of survivorship. it would likely go into probate and be dealt with separately, but in that case the separate (non-community) would be split between you and your 13-year-old daughter, according to intestate laws in california. it would clearly help if your name was also on the deed and it does concern me (just a little) that your husband has no interest in doing that.\n\nread: how can i ensure my husband and his lazy kids honor my will\n\nstates treat these issues differently. california, where you live, arizona, idaho, louisiana, texas, nevada, new mexico and washington treat marital assets as community property, meaning that property bought during the marriage is divided equally. in equitable distribution states, assets are divided based on many factors, including the incomes at the time of marriage, duration of the marriage, the custodial parent's needs and future financial circumstances.\n\nand if this will is invalid? then you are on shakier ground, even in california, a community property state, given that he bought this home before you were married. your husband did refinance your home during your marriage and, if you contributed to the repayments after your husband refinanced the family home, you would at least have an interest in the home should he pre-decease you or (and i don't mean to add to your worries) if you got divorced.\n\neither way, get a copy of the will and see a lawyer, with or without your husband.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist.
more men are becoming fathers for the first time after hitting the big 3-0.\n\nthe average age of fatherhood has increased by three-and-a-half years in the past 44 years, according to a stanford university report, up to 30.9 years from 27.4 years old. the researchers used data from the national vital statistics system, which is part of the centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nthere are better contraceptives, so people are able to choose when they want to have children, and they may want to be secure in a job or further along in their education before having a child, said michael eisenberg, the report's senior author and an assistant professor of urology and of obstetrics and gynecology at the stanford university medical center. that's what we could surmise, but we are seeing this across all education spectrums, geography, race and ethnicity.\n\nsee: america's new fathers are binge-watching parenting videos on their iphones\n\nwhat marriage-phobic millennials mean for the wedding-ring industry\n\nnortheastern birth states and men with a college education had higher paternal ages, the research found. asian fathers were the oldest, and black fathers were the youngest. men over the age of 40 make up 9% of all u.s. births (that number more than doubled from 4.1% since 1973), whereas men over the age of 50 account for nearly 1%. women are becoming mothers later in life as well — 2016 was the first year when more women in their early 30s were having babies than women younger than that, according to the cdc.\n\nthe increase in age fits well with the stereotypical narrative about millennials: that they're delaying marriage, having children and buying homes, and instead living with their own parents. financial responsibilities, mainly student debt, have something to do with delaying milestones — 14% of millennials said those loans are forcing them to hold off on having children. in 1975, 89% of 30-year-olds had been married and 76% lived with a child. in 2015, only 57% of 30-year-olds had ever married and just 47% lived with a child.\n\nsee also:these smart toys are doing the work of mothers and fathers\n\ndelaying fatherhood could have repercussions, though. socially, an increased age of paternity could reduce the number of children a man ends up having, which would affect the demographics of the population, the research pointed out. medically, children of older fathers could have an increased risk of autism, schizophrenia, chromosomal abnormalities, some pediatric cancers and rare genetic conditions, because men acquire about two new mutations in their sperm each year, according to the report. a swedish study found the likelihood of certain disorders, such as autism, adhd and bipolar disorder, increased alongside the father's age — a child born to a 45-year-old dad was three and a half times more likely to have autism than one who was born to a 24-year-old dad, 13 times more likely to have adhd and 25 times more likely to have bipolar disorder, the swedish report found.

dear moneyist,\n\ni'm considering proposing to a long-time girlfriend, but unsure how to handle division of assets down the road. i have been married previously and have a high-school aged child. she has no kids, and there are no plans for any in the future. i have fairly sizable assets within my retirement savings, brokerage accounts and a paid-off home.\n\nthe kicker is that there's a good chance i will get early-onset alzheimer's within the next 10-15 years (one of my parents got it in their late 50's, which means it's probably hereditary). i haven't been tested for the gene and i'm not planning on it, but it's with a high level of certainty, i'll get it. my girlfriend is fully aware of this.\n\nthat said, i'm trying to plan financially so that my health care doesn't become a burden, which is my biggest priority. but in terms of modifying my will for what's left over, i'm having trouble. i have my own assets that i've accumulated, and a sizable portion of assets that were left to me by my grandparents and one parent.\n\nthe moneyist:i married my husband 20 years ago. he has 4 kids and i have 1. i paid for our home. who should inherit it after we're gone?\n\nis it wrong to leave funds passed down from generation to generation solely for my daughter, and leave other funds to my new wife? while i want my wife to have ample funds given that she will more than likely live at least another 15-plus years without me, she also will have a decent pension plan from her own place of work.\n\ndividing up assets is hard when you've been married before and have kids, but the high potential of an early terminal illness adds another complexity. is it something we should discuss, or should i simply make these decisions on my own? i can see how each way could raise some tension that i don't want. what are your thoughts?\n\ncontemplating marriage\n\nthe moneyist: my wife found a half brother through ancestry.com. are we morally or ethically obligated to share her father's estate?\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\ndear contemplating,\n\nit's more than fair to make sure that your daughter is taken care of and inherits 100% of the inheritance passed down to you from your grandparents. they would want that. it is also a way to help your own grandchildren, should your daughter change her mind and decide to have children.\n\nyour daughter should be your no. 1 priority. if you are going to ask anyone's advice, let it be hers. she is currently your only legal heir, and it is fair and reasonable to want to discuss your estate planning with your daughter. after you have her perspective, you can raise it with your girlfriend.\n\nthe only thing anyone should ever bet on receiving from a marriage is commitment and honesty. no one should enter marriage with the expectation that they are going to make out financially. you can, of course, take your respective assets into account, but they should not be a motivating factor.\n\nthe moneyist:my spendthrift fiancée, 30, refused to sign a prenup. would it be wrong to secretly put my assets in a trust?\n\nshe would also benefit from your own retirement funds, and social security. you can lay out your plans ahead of time. you're not asking her permission, but you can always ask her for her feedback, and thoughts. you can decide to take them into account, or not.\n\nin an ideal world, we fall in love with the expectation of nothing of a material nature in return. i don't think your girlfriend would be with you for any other reason than because she loves you, especially if she shares your outlook on your possible prognosis.\n\ni do hope you are wrong about your own health, and i respect your decision not to test for the gene. it's important to plan for all likely or possible eventualities, but also to remember to enjoy the moment. i hope that you have many, many more.\n\nthe moneyist:my sister became my father's power of attorney, took out a reverse mortgage, and drained his equity. what can i do?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. by emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch.
there's more evidence that renters are just as likely to be struggling as homeowners.\n\na typical renter in miami would need to spend nearly 50% of his or her income to rent a one-bedroom apartment, but a typical millennial renter would need to spend 54% of his or her income in that city, according to a recent analysis of rental listings by real estate site trulia. in los angeles, millennials pay nearly 39% of their monthly rent versus 34% for the average renter. in new york, they pay as much as the average renter (34%) and pay slightly less than the average renter in san francisco (33.5% versus for the average renter 37%).\n\nthe solution is simple, though maybe not ideal for everyone: in america's biggest rental markets, a renter can save on average 13% of his or her income by getting a housemate. while splitting an apartment with a roommate will save money, the benefits of sharing a living space vary from city to city, home to home. in miami, millennials save 19% of their income in a two-bedroom apartment and they can save 14% in los angeles and new york, but only 9.5% in washington, d.c. in all cases, except miami, they can pay less than 30% of their income on rent by having a roomie.\n\neven in markets with the lowest amount of potential savings, it's still worth considering having a roommate, trulia found. in minneapolis, which has the lowest potential savings, a renter could save the equivalent of 5.3% of median household income or $310 per month; in st. louis, the renter could save 5.7% or $260 per month; in dallas 6% or $310 per month; and 6.6% or $400 per month in baltimore.\n\ncan employers solve the student-loan crisis?\n\nonce upon a time, 30% of your income was the maximum you were supposed to spend on rent, but these days the median amount renters spend across the country is almost 40%. as marketwatch reported last month, many renters of all ages spend north of 30%. on average, renters in the marin county/san francisco metro area will spend over 77% of their salary to pay rent in 2017, according to a study by attom data solutions, the parent company of real-estate website realtytrac.\n\nsee:my roommate is the most entitled millennial in america. do i tell her?\n\nmore than 20% of millennials lived with a roommate as of 2015, trulia said, but many others are holding off on rent and still living at home with their parents. young people today are increasingly living with a roommate — whether it's their parents, siblings, other relatives or friends, said ralph mclaughlin, chief economist at trulia. many are saddled with college debt and struggling to find good paying jobs that will enable them to form their own households. until they do, many will continue to rely on roommates to save on housing costs.\n\nrental costs are on the rise, partially due to a lack of available properties to buy or rent. americans spent $478.5 billion on rent in 2016, a 3.8% increase from 2015, according to real estate site zillow z, -8.09% . renting has its benefits and can be an attractive option for older people wanting to sell their homes and downsize or those looking for a flexible lifestyle, where they can more easily pick up and move.\n\nsee also: should i rent or buy a house?\n\nbuying a home might seem like a deal and, in some cases, may be cheaper than renting. naturally, there are additional expenses that come with home ownership, though, such as closing costs and maintenance, and even home buyers are looking for ways to share costs: more unmarried young couples are buying homes together now than they were a decade ago, not only because lifestyle choices among millennials have changed in recent years (they're pushing off marriage and families longer than their elders did), but because it's easier to split the bills.
for rebecca shifflett, a single mother of two in walkersville, md., buying a home in 2015 was a daunting process.\n\nand in her view, for a familiar reason.\n\ni was asked a few times about doing it alone. i think it was because i was a single girl and it was my first home, she said.\n\nduring the loan application process, shifflett, a 35 year-old accountant, felt she was always getting extra scrutiny, much like an episode in hbo's comedy-drama series sex and the city, where cynthia nixon's character miranda hobbes runs into skepticism (and perhaps sexism) by realtors and loan officers surprised when she revealed she was getting the mortgage just by herself.\n\nthe mortgage company was very particular about what they would accept, as proof of income, shifflett said. she said the lender would not accept her account history and her bank statements, even when she showed them where her money came from, until the bank provided its own notarized proof of the funds.\n\nit was really difficult to do, especially since i had an online bank only, she said.\n\nand more women are expected to apply for mortgages in the near future, as more women enter the workforce and the millennial generation, the biggest home-buying age group, puts off marriage​. fifteen percent of homebuyers in 2016 were single women, according to the national association of realtor's 2016 home buyer and seller trends report.\n\nand according to the washington, d.c.-based urban institute, citing federal home mortgage disclosure act and corelogic data, single-female borrowers are actually better at paying their mortgages than single-male borrowers​, based on data from 13 million female-only borrowers and 17 million male-only borrowers. ​\n\neven for loans made during the 2004-2007 period when people who were the poorest credit risks got mortgages and many defaulted, fewer female-only loans (24.6%) were 90-days delinquent, compared to 25.4% of delinquent loans of male-only borrowers from that same period, the report noted.\n\nfor loans made between 2008 and 2010, 9.6% of female-borrower only loans were 90-days delinquent, compared to 9.7% of male-only borrowers, the urban institute said. for 2011 through 2014, 2.14% of single females were 90-days past due, compared to 2.2% of single-male borrowers.\n\nfemale-only borrowers default less than their male counterparts, wrote laurie goodman, the co-director of the urban institute's housing finance policy center, ​​adding that the better performance by women in mortgage payments was across all races including white, hispanic and african-american borrowers.\n\nthe bottom line is that single women with mortgages are doing a better job of paying their mortgages than their credit characteristics predict, goodman said​.\n\nadding insult to injury, female-only mortgage applicants also get rejected at a higher rate than male-only applicants, with 23% of female would-be borrowers denied mortgage loans compared to 21% of male-only applicants in 2014. in 2011, only about 20% of female only applicants were denied, according to the urban institute's research.\n\nlenders are clearly relying on these imperfect predictions for their denial decisions, goodman said. ​\n\noften where women are held back is because they don't have as long of a credit history as men, ​the urban institute noted, and they likely have more debt and live in poorer neighborhoods. one-third of single female borrowers are also minority, the urban institute noted.\n\nthe ability for somebody to get a loan should be based on their income and their credit, said bryan sullivan, the chief financial officer of loandepot,com, in foothill ranch, calif., which is the second-largest online lender in the u.s. behind quickenloans. it's irrespective of whether they are married or not, he said. ​\n\nshifflett, who lives with her fiancée justin and two children, ages 10 and 15, says she's been in her new house for a year now, and has always paid her mortgage on time. i have not been late on a payment yet, she said.\n\nthe urban institute also noted that the lower default rates during the period between 2004 through 2014 came as female-only borrowers typically on average had an income of $69,000, compared to male borrowers income of $95,000 according to the urban institute's analysis.\n\nmoreover, despite having nearly identical fico credit scores (711 on average for female-only borrowers and 712 for male-only) as well as putting larger amounts towards the home in down payments (75% loan-to-value ratio for women versus nearly 78% ltv for men) female-only borrowers tend to pay higher interest rates than male-only borrowers.\n\nfemale-only borrowers had interest rates on average of 5.48% compared to 5.41% for male borrowers between 2004 to 2014, the urban institute said, citing hmda and corelogic data.\n\nsince pricing is tied to credit characteristics not performance, women actually pay more relative to their actual risk than do men, the urban institute noted.\n\nshifflett said she was lucky in having good credit. as a result she got a 30-year fixed mortgage for 3.65% for her townhome, while putting only 3% down at the close. she said she also steered away from adjustable loan products that offered her a lower initial interest rate.\n\nonly men are dumb enough to get arms, she joked. ​maybe the mortgage world needs to realize who really runs the world.
dear moneyist,\n\ni'm 62 years of age, i have stopped working and i am currently receiving social security. my ex-husband is intending to file a joint tax return, and told me straight out that he does not intend to give me any of our joint tax return, because he said that i am no longer working. what can i do about this? i was discarded after 40 years of marriage.\n\nhe also tried to keep my $600, but i was ready for him. i persuaded him to pay for a washer and dryer and i managed to get my $1,200 stimulus by the skin of my teeth. i took the $1,200 out while divorce proceedings were occurring and i still had bank access. (he got angry, but i still managed to get the better of him.)\n\nthe moneyist: 'i feel like she has joined some abusive cult': my wife makes $25,000 and only gets 1.5% annual pay raises. what can i do?\n\nlast year, while we were still married, he filed our joint return electronically against my wishes and without me knowing, and deposited the tax return in his bank account. our divorce was finalized last november, so i no longer have access to his bank account.\n\ndo i have any legal right to the return? can he file a return without my consent, and with no signature? how do i get the irs to recognize me as a separate person for any stimulus that comes my way in 2021? i assume the irs will use my 2020 tax return? i got a five-figure settlement from him in our divorce instead of alimony. do i have to file taxes on the settlement?\n\ndiscarded after 40 years\n\nwant to read more? follow quentin fottrell on twitter and read more of his columns here.\n\ndear discarded,\n\nyou have asked me a lot of questions, and i will endeavor to answer them. before i do, however, i want to offer two pieces of advice: firstly, file a 2020 return. secondly, hire an accountant to go over your finances. it can be a difficult transition when someone else — namely, your ex-husband — has been taking care of the finances and filing your tax returns.\n\nthirdly, it's time to cut the emotional and fiscal connection to your ex. if you don't want him to file joint returns, don't hit him up for money for a washer and dryer. your divorce has been finalized. that's as good a time as any to not depend on him for anything. any time he does you a favor, even if it's something he owes you, it complicates your newfound freedom.\n\nthe moneyist: my ex-husband put his wife on his life-insurance before he died, going against our divorce. now she's battling me in court\n\nas for the irs, you can verify your identity with the agency here. the phone lines are open, but customer-service support is limited at this time. you can select your state for the taxpayer advocate service here, and report fraud here. it's possible to file a joint tax return when you are still going through a divorce, but he should have sought your signature to do so.\n\nis your divorce settlement taxable? such questions are best answered by your divorce attorney prior to your divorce to minimize your tax liability. the tax cuts and jobs act eliminated deductions for alimony payments. whether or not divorce settlements are taxable can depend on how they are structured; read more on that here.\n\nthe time has come to take matters into your own hands: contact the irs, file a tax return, talk to an accountant, circle back with your attorney, stop playing games of cat and mouse with your husband over stimulus checks and washers and dryers, and warn him that it is illegal to file a joint return without your consent. tell him you will take action if he does.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.
dear moneyist,\n\ni have repeatedly asked my husband to write a will. he gives me excuses and puts me off. i'm so frustrated that we don't have a will that i'm almost ready to write my own without him. we have no children, so i'm thinking we should be each other's beneficiaries and then decide what would happen to our assets if we passed at the same time.\n\n 'why is he leaving tens of thousands of dollars to his mom? is she going to be responsible for planning his funeral?' \n\ni found out last night that he has allocated his entire savings account — roughly six months' worth of living expenses — to his mother. he designated her on the rights of survivorship form when he opened the account. when i confronted him about it, he told me you'll be fine. you're my beneficiary on my life insurance.\n\nok, fine. but why is he leaving tens of thousands of dollars to his mom? is she going to be responsible for planning his funeral? i'm beyond upset, and my question is ultimately this: is it common to leave a large chunk of money to your parent(s) instead of your spouse?\n\nhis mom is financially stable, she has her own business, takes vacations, etc. i always thought the standard practice was to leave everything to your spouse?\n\ndisgruntled wife\n\ndear disgruntled,\n\neveryone should have a will, especially a married couple. too many people die without a will and it causes multiple problems and legal battles for those who are left behind. today is a good time to have this conversation and discuss your respective assets.\n\nif this column has taught me anything, it's that there are no standard practices. i've received so many letters from people who have felt befuddled, bewildered and brutalized by their spouse or parent's will. one man told me his father left him $10,000 and, in his mind, that meant his father didn't love him. a young man wrote to me to say he believed he was robbed of his inheritance by his parents and sister because of his sexuality. i felt bad for him, but it was their choice.\n\n people view the contents of wills and beneficiaries as a reflection of the depth of commitment and feeling within their relationship. \n\nanother woman said her father had given her his word that she could buy his home, but then went back on his promise after she devoted years to him as a caregiver. alas, i could see the writing on the wall as soon as she told me what her father had promised her. this mother said she didn't want a red cent from her estranged husband because he was abusive. and this woman wanted to hold off on divorcing her husband until he received his inheritance.\n\nmy point? emotions run high when it comes to beneficiaries on life insurance policies, and retirement and bank accounts. many people see this as a reflection of the depth of commitment and love within their relationship. if you're not on your husband's savings account does that mean he doesn't love you? no, it does not. does it mean that you won't be taken care of? no, it does not. does it mean you won't inherit 100% of your husband's assets? yes, it does.\n\n is this savings account a small (or large) slice of your husband's entire net worth? why shouldn't his mother get something? \n\nonly you know the details of your financial lives. context is everything. will you have enough money to live on after your husband dies? did he alone save this money and is he entitled to do what he wants with them? yes. do you share the title on your home and will you have somewhere to live for your remaining days if he predeceases you? is this savings account a small (or large) slice of your husband's entire net worth? why shouldn't his mother get something?\n\nhis mother gave him life. he wouldn't be here without her. she probably sacrificed a lot for him and, in the unlikely event that he predeceases her, he may simply wish to say thank you and make sure that she wants for nothing. that's his right. it is his mother, after all. perhaps rather than confront him about this decision, you could ask him about his thought process when he made it. as long as you are financially comfortable if he dies first — and vice-versa — i don't see a problem.\n\nthere is a larger conversation to be had here about the importance of leaving a will and taking a bird's eye view of the assets that you both brought into this marriage. before having this conversation, however, i'd leave his mother and his funeral expenses out of it.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

how the infrastructure deal may fizzle: the $2 trillion pact on infrastructure agreed upon by president donald trump and top democratic lawmakers isn't going to lead to much, writes hill columnist liz peek.\n\ntrump's team will propose using private funding, given the $22 trillion national debt, as well as insist on a speedy approval process in order to attract investors, she predicts. democrats, for their part, will demand higher taxes to finance and stress that the president wants to disregard important environmental constraints.\n\nblocked by a gop-controlled senate dead set against changing our tax laws, speaker pelosi will blame president trump and his party for a breakdown in talks, and that will be the end of that, peek says.\n\nbeto blew it, pundit says: democratic presidential hopeful beto o'rourke has flamed out, as polls have shown him slipping for weeks, says veteran political pundit margaret carlson in a daily beast column.\n\non wednesday quinnipiac confirmed the worst. the one-time wonder beto o'rourke is at 5%, behind every other first-tier candidate, she writes. in the realclearpolitics average of polls, the former texas congressman is at 5.6%, behind five rivals — joe biden, bernie sanders, elizabeth warren, pete buttigieg and kamala harris.\n\naccording to my unscientific poll asking every woman i see, beto reminds them of the worst boyfriend they ever had: self-involved, convinced of his own charm, chronically late if he shows up at all, worth a meal or two but definitely not marriage material, carlson says.\n\nbarr attacked because his probe endangers powerful people, conservative columnist says: attorney general bill barr made real news in a wednesday senate hearing, as said he'd already assigned people at the justice department to assist his investigation of the origins of the trump-russia probe, according to wall street journal columnist kimberley strassel.\n\nhe is now getting attacked by democrats because this probe endangers many powerful figures, she writes. do not underestimate how many powerful people in washington have something to lose from mr. barr's probe, the conservative commentator adds.\n\ndisgraced pundit halperin tries for a comeback: disgraced political pundit mark halperin has been spending the past several months on a professional rehabilitation campaign with the active help of msnbc morning joe hosts joe scarborough and mika brzezinski, says a daily beast report.\n\nhalperin, whose career imploded in 2017 after women went public with allegations that he groped them and made unwanted sexual advances during his tenure at abc news, has also received positive airtime from cnn and siriusxm radio host michael smerconish, the report adds.
dear moneyist,\n\ni am engaged to a money monster. she just got rid of her old debts, but now has new debt and it's growing. we've been together seven years and engaged for four years. after getting engaged i found out about her debt, bad fico score fico, -1.33% , excess parking tickets, etc. i educated and worked with her, and she eventually climbed out of it.\n\n 'her parking tickets are still piling up, and her credit-card debt is $5,000 the last time i checked.' \n\nnow she makes $75,000 a year and has a career with the state. life is good, except she has new debt. she has $18,000 in student loans (a master's degree she dropped out of). we now have a 2-year-old child. her parking tickets are still piling up, and her credit-card debt is $5,000 the last time i checked.\n\nwe have separate finances because i don't trust her to act prudently financially. since we met i have purchased a single family home and plan to buy more real estate. nothing is under her name although she does help by paying utility bills and groceries. i'm concerned that if we were to split she would want to fight to me and feel like she is entitled to our home or new properties.\n\nsunny in california\n\ndear sunny,\n\ni do understand your concerns about your girlfriend's lack of money management, and they are valid. racking up parking tickets and maintaining credit-card debt don't inspire confidence.\n\nyour fiancée's fretful finances feel frustratingly fainthearted and fickle. (try saying that sentence quickly with a gobstopper in your mouth.) but i have questions. why did she drop out of her master's program? something about that sentence pulled at my heart strings. she didn't just want to rack up $18,000 in student debt. it's not the same as overspending. that tells me she has dreams.\n\n why did she drop out of her m.a. program? she didn't just rack up $18,000 in student debt. she had dreams. \n\nwhy does she keep parking in places that result in parking tickets? does she have a plan to pay off the $5,000 on her credit card before using her card again? does she need help with such a plan? maybe you can go through these issues together and, in a solemn ceremony, put the card in a box with a lock. given that you both have a child together, act out of love, rather than fear.\n\nyour fiancée sounds impulsive, but being impulsive is not a crime. of course, it could lead to serious financial woes in a worst-case scenario. i too wish she was more responsible. however, all of this does not add up to her being a money monster, or any kind of monster. she needs to examine the connection between her emotional life and her financial life.\n\nat our worst, we act out of anxiety or anger or frustration or, worse, shame. a financial therapist could help your girlfriend examine this pattern of behavior. what void is she trying to fill and/or what anxiety is preventing her from facing up to her financial problems? you have a 2-year-old child. is she a good mother? is she warm and affectionate to you? who is she?\n\nall of these issues are missing from your letter. my first take with what little i know: your fear of commitment or commitment to this particular woman — given her financial shenanigans — are in some way dehumanizing or objectifying her in a way that suggests your problems in this relationship go both ways and are bigger than her debts.\n\nto answer the legal part of your question: california is a community property state and anything you purchase before your marriage is owned by you. you take out of the marriage what you brought into it. there is some precedent of a common-law marriage in another state being recognized in california. you can read more on palimony law — and its limits in california — here and here.\n\ni understand that some people will read this question and react in an extreme fashion. document everything! watch out! dump her asap! get out! leave her! run away! get primary custody of your child! don't get married! get a good attorney! they are just some of the comments on your letter on the moneyist facebook group. we all bring our own missed red flags to such tales.\n\nof course, consult an attorney when dealing with real estate and marriage, and i would not advise you to marry someone you don't trust. nor would i advise your fiancée to marry someone who calls her a monster. she is your girlfriend and mother of your child. she has a four-figure credit-card debt and a five-figure student-loan debt. guess what? so do millions of americans.\n\nrelationships are a complicated business. you are more than the sum of your fears and the mother of your child is more than the sum of her parking tickets and debts.\n\nfinancial spring cleaning: 5 money moves to make this month\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear moneyist,\n\ni'm a 34-year-old woman living in west palm beach, fla. i'm engaged to a divorced 48-year-old father of three. there is a 14-year difference between my fiancé and i. he has full-time custody of his three children from a previous marriage. we are planning on getting married soon and buying a home. what are the laws on inheritance if something happens to my fiancé and i am left alone with his three children?\n\nalso see:my wife and i want to have a second child — is this a good time to buy a new house?\n\nwill i be forced to sell the home that my future husband and i have worked for and split the earnings with his children? will i be forced to split the money in our bank account and give it to his three children? will you please explain the law to me? i know that if something were to happen to him and he had debt i would have to pay off his debts since we are legally bound through marriage.\n\nthese are things that i have to consider given the age difference and that we have no children together.\n\nthe fiancée\n\ndear fiancée,\n\nunless your fiancé makes a will and you discuss this will before you get married, along with any requests either of you may have for a prenuptial agreement, state law will dictate who gets what should your fiancé predecease you. although this is a macabre question, it's not an uncommon one.\n\npeople have all sorts of questions about what might happen. one woman asked if she could disinherit her stepchildren if her husband dies. another asked the opposite question to yours: she wondered who would be responsible for her stepchildren's student loans if they died.\n\nyou are not powerless. if you are buying a home together, and investing equal amounts, you should have the conversation about what would happen should one of you predeceases the other. ask if his ex-wife is on his life insurance as part of their divorce decree. (sorry to add to your worries.)\n\ndon't miss: i paid my boyfriend's rent and bills to improve his credit score — then he bought a house without telling me\n\nyou need to focus on your preexisting commitments too. in 2013 in hillman vs. maretta, the u.s. supreme court ruled in favor of a 66-year-old man's ex-wife (rather than his widow) as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth over $124,000. divorce court trumps wills made after a second marriage.\n\nso if he dies without a will in florida? you would inherit half of his estate and his two children would inherit the other half. as a co-owner of your home, it would not be subject to intestate succession laws. in that case, you would inherit your late husband's share of the property if he predeceased you.\n\nyou need to go into this marriage feeling empowered and happy. questions beginning with, will i be forced… give me pause for concern about your willingness or, perhaps, readiness to start a new life with a man who has three children. they will require emotional as well as financial support.\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\nrecommended:after my father died, my brother has been pressuring me to lend him money\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
it seems young people get blamed for everything these days. millennials have been accused of killing marriage, home ownership, chain restaurants, diamonds, department stores, face-to-face interaction and pretty much every long, boring sporting event imaginable.\n\nthey're also being accused of killing their own net worth. here's a recent survey from bankrate.com:\n\nin particular, younger millennials (ages 18 to 26) are falling victim to vices that may feel good in the moment, but are far from worth it in the long run:\n\n• 54% of people in our age group eat out at least three times per week.\n\n• 30% of millennials say we buy coffee at least three times a week.\n\n• 51% typically go to a bar at least once a week. (among people ages 21-26)\n\nbottom line: we're spending a lot of cash on vices.\n\nthis is pretty standard personal finance advice. if you just stop buying coffee every day or bring a brown bag lunch to work, you'll be a millionaire in 250 years!\n\nthe problem is this advice doesn't really work. nickel and diming your way to savings is no way to go through life. you need to prioritize the little things that make you happy and stop wasting money on the little things that don't.\n\nbut the real way to save money as a young person is by focusing on the big-ticket items in your life.\n\nwhat marriage-phobic millennials mean for the wedding-ring industry\n\nmillennials are constantly being told that student debt it too high, wages are stagnant, the great recession made it difficult to find a job and the future is going to be a terrible place. i never liked the idea of blaming macro factors on your own personal situation. all of that stuff is out of your control anyway.\n\nwhile it's not easy, here are some ways young people can actually take control of their finances and save a little money:\n\nlive like a college student for a few years. college was the most fun period of my life…and i was basically broke the entire time. i never went out to nice dinners. i rarely purchased new clothes. the houses and apartments i lived in were dumps. if you can simply keep your lifestyle the same for a few years after school that can be a huge head start to getting your finances in order. you can pay off some student loans, develop good saving habits and avoid crippling credit card debt. and you can still have fun when you're young without spending a ton of money.\n\nskip the starter home.buying a house is a huge commitment, requires a lot of work and a consumes a large part of your budget. there's no reason to rush into buying a house when you're young just because it seems like the logical next step. there's nothing wrong with renting for a few years until you're ready financially to buy a home.\n\nanother easy way to save money in the housing department is to live with roommates. whether you buy or rent, housing will likely be your biggest line item every month. splitting that cost is a simple solution to save more.\n\nskip the new car. a new car is a depreciating asset. it falls in value by something like 20%-30% in the first year. if you can't save money, you have no business buying a new vehicle.\n\nread:why getting a 10-year-old car is a savvy move\n\nfocus on your fixed costs. i've never been a huge fan of budgeting. i like the idea of understanding what your fixed costs are going to be every month and spending the rest (and yes, saving is a fixed cost). the 50/30/20 rule isn't a bad place to start. you can also save money by understanding which periodic payments you're making — gym memberships, netflix, apple music, cable, internet, phone service — that are worth it and which ones you don't utilize enough.\n\nread:millennials face a depressing conundrum: is it worth saving $5 a month for retirement?\n\nautomate. the problem with the latte factor is we all have a limited amount of discipline. decision fatigue will eventually catch up with you if you're constantly trying to skimp and save on every minor spending choice. automate your bills. automate your savings. automate your credit card payments. then spend whatever is leftover. this allows you to avoid late fees and overdraft charges as well.\n\nread:young investors aren't as smart as they think they are\n\nmake more money. the best way to save more money is to make more money. that can be difficult when you're first starting out in the working world, but here are a few suggestions:\n\nbecome indispensable to your employer. and once they realize they can't function without you, that's when you negotiate a higher salary. people hate having that conversation but eventually, you'll make more money if you're worth it. invest in yourself. unless you have superior connections in the working world you absolutely have to be in the mindset of continuous self-improvement. that means reading, getting designations/certifications, taking classes, going to conferences, taking people out to coffee, etc. your education isn't done when you get out of college, it's really just beginning.\n\nread:how to earn $100,000 a year or more with side hustles\n\nunderstand yourself. no two people have the same exact situation. you have to figure out what works for you. but delayed gratification is almost always painful. have fun when you're young, but develop good financial habits and your future self will thank you.\n\nread:millennials are making the same dumb investing mistakes their parents did\n\nben carlson is the author of the blog a wealth of common sense, where this was first published. it is reprinted with permission. follow him on twitter @awealthofcs.
in a rite of spring, the estimated $60 billion bridal industry glows with satisfaction. the average wedding cost a record $32,641 last year. that's only slightly more than the class of 2016's average student-loan debt load. and the trend for both has been rising.\n\na young couple that enters marriage with two college loans—along with the expense of rings, wedding and honeymoon—can easily start out life together more than $100,000 in debt.\n\nsophia bera, 32, the divorced founder of gen y planning in austin, texas, relates how she graduated a little more than a decade ago with $10,000 in unused college-tuition savings. she poured that money into the purchase of a house and took on two roommates to help shoulder the mortgage. it all seemed smart and grown-up. so very responsible.\n\nbut the real estate market cratered, and the house turned into a bad investment. even after upgrading the kitchen and bath, bera says she sold the property for $10,000 less than she'd paid for it. in other words, she lost the nest egg that she'd started out with.\n\nthat experience catapulted her on a personal and career mission: i want to help young people with their money, says bera, who established her own financial planning firm in 2013\n\nkelly luethje, 38, the owner of willow planning group in boston, also specializes in serving millennials and has observed that people in their 20s and 30s are trying to understand how to save while paying down debt. that can be a really hard thing, says luethje, who put herself through an mba program at the simmons school of management in boston a decade ago and graduated at the same time as bera did.\n\none day i woke up and asked myself, 'how did i end up with so much debt?'  she recounts. i had student-loan debt, i had credit-card debt, and i was paying a lot of rent.\n\ni downsized. i got a roommate. and i even sold my car. at that point, i was helping friends and families sort through their budgets, and i thought: hey, i'm really interested in this.\n\ncoming full circle, weddings peak in june—the most popular date this year is saturday, june 18, says lauren nolan, a spokeswoman for the new york–based consumer media company xo group us:xoxo and its wedding-planning service the knot. and weddings and marriage, though not always well saved for, are among each generation's largest financial commitments.\n\nas love sours, rings may end up at a pawn shop. getty images\n\nkristen euretig, 33, a certified financial planner and owner of brooklyn plans in new york—who also blogs as young, broke & awesome—tells me she has a female client who's budgeted a $30,000 wedding in mid-2018. yet only when they began planning the commitment did they realize the bride and groom will each need to save $625 a month.\n\nthat's a huge amount of money, euretig says. and that's if you have no other financial goals, like paying off student loans or saving for retirement.\n\non wednesday, the federal reserve's most recent report on the economic well-being of u.s. households—while mostly upbeat—found:\n\n• 32% of adult respondents have no rainy-day fund that would cover three months' worth of expenses.\n\n• 46% of adult respondents say they could not cover an emergency expense of even $400, or would so do by borrowing money or selling something.\n\n• the average student-loan debt is $30,156, rising to $36,000 for those with a master's degree, and $100,000 for those with a doctoral or professional degree.\n\n• more than one in five student-loan borrowers who attended a for-profit institution are now behind on their payments.\n\nwhat might also surprise the 2.1 million u.s. couples who are tying the knot this year—many of them a blushing and fainting subset of the 43 million student-loan borrowers owing almost $1.3 trillion—is that expensive engagement rings and costly weddings are statistically correlated with negative outcomes in marriage.\n\nspending $2,000 to $4,000 on an engagement ring is significantly associated with an increase in the hazard of divorce, according to emory university economists andrew francis and hugo mialon. and spending $20,000 or more on the wedding can be even more toxic.\n\nalso read:the larger the rock, the rockier the marriage\n\nspecifically, more expensive engagement rings are associated with a 1.3 times greater likelihood of divorce, while costlier weddings coincide with a 1.6 times heightened divorce risk, according to the economists' cheekily titled paper, a diamond is forever and other fairy tales: the relationship between wedding expenses and marriage duration.\n\nthat said, going cheap and dirty—with no engagement ring, and less than $1,000 in wedding expense—also elevates the divorce probability while spending quite a bit more on the ring ($8,000) might be associated with a purchase of happiness, the research shows.\n\na quick aside: if your eye is set on a rock, you often can find pretty good deals just this side of the half-carat and full carat diamonds that fetch a price premium.\n\nthe key lesson for consumers is: there is a big discount—up to 20%—to purchasing loose diamonds that are slightly under 1 carat or 0.5 carats, even though the diamonds are otherwise the same quality. the visual difference is imperceptible, says university of kentucky economist aaron yelowitz, co-author of the paper, pricing anomalies in the market for diamonds: evidence of conformist. however, yelowitz adds, some couples may feel that it sends a bad signal between each other if the groom is cheap or prudent, even if no one else knows the diamond is slightly smaller. couples pay a substantial premium for 'boasting rights.' \n\nthese days, wedding preparation often takes a year or more, compared with the two months recommended by bride's magazine in 1959, and 80% of engagement rings contain a diamond, compared with just 10% before world war ii, emory university's francis and mialon relate while concluding: our findings provide little evidence to support the validity of the wedding industry's general message that connects expensive weddings with positive marital outcomes.\n\nso is marriage a bad bargain? not necessarily. but stated otherwise, the marriage industry is very good for the divorce industry. and one reason for that is financial stress. u.s. marriage rates today are near historic lows, even as cohabitation rose sharply last decade.\n\nso what are some effective ways to reduce the financial stresses that contribute to unhappy marriages and divorce?\n\none of my favorite questions, responds bera, is: what was money to you when you were growing up? in other words: what was your mom like with money? what was your dad like with money? which describes you? she continues: often, couples don't start talking about money until they are engaged, or later [but] it's important to have regular conversations about money. know your credit score, income, debt, savings.\n\nlearning the answers to such questions—and filling out your financial objectives—can be the basis for heartfelt conversations between significant others, bera says, which she recommends take the form of money dates.\n\nput everything on the table—like those debts, a bad credit score, or if you're spending on something the other person doesn't know about, adds willow planning's luethje, who says that when couples come to her for guidance and confusion crops up in the details, that's a red flag.\n\nkristen euretig at brooklyn plans says a same-sex couple recently came to her for financial counseling. when they started talking, they weren't talking like a unit. they had some shared expenses, but they didn't act as if they were on the same team. speaking pragmatically—much like a marriage counselor—euretig says she told them they needed two plans, not one.\n\nwhile no financial template is right for everyone (the usual disclaimer is important nonetheless), gen y's bera offers the following recommendations for millennials:\n\n1. save the equivalent of three months of net income for emergencies. that usually lasts six months in an actual emergency, when one spouse loses a job, or there is a medical emergency, or something happens to the house.\n\n2. set aside 15% to 20% of income for retirement—or at least enough to maximize your employer's match if the company offers 401(k) retirement accounts.\n\n3. steer clear of buying a house—at least right away. millennials often value mobility. we don't know where we're going to live in five years, and navigating your career is easier—it's easier to take a job in a new state—if you're renting. housing expenses include not just the cost of the mortgage but also moving, furnishing, yard work—and then you need a barbecue and firepit, and all of these costs add up. the other sacrifice a settled life can mean is living outside the hustle and bustle of life: going to shows and listening to music.\n\nand don't forget to save for the wedding. the average cost of a wedding has increased by more than 20%, or about $5,500, over the past five years, according to xo group.\n\nother eye-opening details: $1,469 is the average cost of a wedding dress: the number of guests averages 139; groom's age: 31; bride's age: 29; and most expensive place to get married: manhattan, $82,299.\n\nnow, since december is the most popular month for getting engaged—and alaska the least expensive place for getting married at $17,361—there may be opportunities to combine the two. even if not, there are other ways to hold the marriage together beyond the wedding day: invite a lot of people to the wedding, and take a honeymoon, because each is significantly associated with a lower hazard of divorce, according to the economists francis and mialon.\n\ngen y's bera agrees: when people overspend on their wedding they tend to delay their honeymoon one, two, three years. what's great about starting a life together is the experience of taking a trip together. to overspend on one day—on a party for friends and family—might mean missing out. honeymoons can be very special.\n\nshe also advises her millennial clientele to focus on growing your income. when you're young, your income is your best [financial] asset. take on overtime, take on side projects, ask for promotions and a raise. bigger picture: be extraordinary. go above and beyond. put together a unique skill set. network at events, and make great connections, leading to your next job opportunity. use money to match your values to lead an amazing life.\n\nat pawn usa in woodbridge, va., about 5,000 used rings line the glass jewelry case, and saleswoman pam salyers is having trouble finding time, between sales, to speak with a visitor.\n\nsalyers sees her customers coming and going, including the happily married contractor's wife who recently traded up to a $26,000 two-carat diamond as the couple's business prospers; and those who leave behind at the pawn shop the glittering memory of a failed marriage.\n\nyet in this way, the more expensive diamond rings can be handy after all.\n\nfor some women, salyers says, their engagement ring is sometimes the most valuable thing they own—and they might need the money.
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nbreaking up is that hard to do — and a new company wants to help you soften the blow.\n\nonward is a new on-demand service that helps people pack, find housing, move out and move on when a relationship enters splitsville.\n\nstarting at $99, the new york city-based service offers a 10-day plan for short and long-term housing — such as a hotel, airbnb, new apartment or co-living space — along with options and discounts for storage, moving services, packing and access to events to help singles beef up their social calendars. a 30-day, $175 package helps newly single folks furnish their new home, have someone assist with address and utility changes, and get discounts on moving company rates.\n\n it's the latest in a slew of new apps hoping to capitalize on time-poor and cash-rich people who yearn to take the awkwardness out of life. \n\nif you really can't be bothered with logistics, $500 will get you squared away with finding new housing, assembled furniture in your new pad, a customized new neighborhood guide with recommendations for restaurants, bars, gyms and health studios and access to self-care options such as therapy or lawyers if needed for a three-month period.\n\nnew york-based onward co-founders and childhood friends lindsay meck, 34, and mika leonard, 33, say they started the company after both suffered breakups of their own six months apart.\n\nwe both had to move out and restart our lives. i was seeing a lot of the similarities between the emotional and logistical turmoil of it all, meck told marketwatch. it was really challenging and, typically, after a breakup you have to get going quite fast.\n\nthe company soft-launched on valentine's day in new york city and, the founders say, has since received almost 100 inquiries. the demographics are an even split of men and women, aged 25 to 40, the company said. they plan to roll out in other cities like los angeles, san francisco, chicago and d.c. in the coming year.\n\n experts say a break-up service could help as long as you're not using it to avoid conflict or numb the pain related with severing ties with a partner. \n\nit's the latest in a slew of new apps and services hoping to capitalize on time-poor and cash-rich people who yearn to take the awkwardness out of life. instead of actually meeting people organically, for example, the app meetup allows users to attend events based on their interests — from outdoor exploration to music and technology — so people can connect with other members and essentially meet friends on-demand.\n\ninstead of having to ask a friend to pay you back for that coffee or lunch they owe you, mobile payment apps like venmo eliminate the in-person conversation and cut right to the chase with a notification instead. in 2017, startup called juicero offered pre-sold packets of chopped up fruits and vegetables to users willing to fork over $400 for the machines to do the dicing for them. people soon discovered they could squeeze the packets just as easily by hand.\n\nthere does, however, appear to be a market to help couples who are splitting up. a number of studies show that couples who co-habitate before marriage have a greater risk of splitting up, considering a little more than 50% of cohabiting couples ever get married.\n\nexperts say having a service like this could help — as long as you're not using it to avoid conflict or numb the pain or awkwardness related with severing ties with a partner. having difficult conversations with your partner is healthy, they say, and processing how you feel is good.\n\n it's a hard thing to deal with goodbyes. in fact, a number of break-up themed businesses have opened in recent months trying to bank on heartbreak. \n\nbe considerate of the importance of navigating how you end the relationship, said dr. shaun wehle, a clinical psychologist based in indiana. it's a hard thing to deal with goodbyes. there's richness in having the complex conversation.\n\nin other words, don't just ghost your ex by moving out when he or she is not there. and don't end the relationship, if at all possible, with a big fight either. it could go both ways, wehle said. you could be using it as a helpful service, but some benefits are going to be lost if you don't have the challenging conversation of goodbye.\n\nthat said, wehle said the service could be especially vital for those who experienced a turbulent relationship and don't want to look back.\n\na number of break-up themed businesses have opened in recent months trying to bank on heartbreak. an appropriately named breakup bar in hollywood, calif. opened as a pop-up venue in time for valentine's day this year giving singles a watering hole to flock to and not have to be surrounded by lovers.\n\n 'you need to develop the strength to get through these kinds of traumatic experiences. life is unfortunately filled with various traumas. it's part of being human.' \n\nbut some of these services don't come cheap: for a starting rate of $1,200, there's a luxe renew breakup bootcamp, which holds three-day retreats in upstate new york near woodstock and in malibu, calif, bringing together intimate groups of up to 20 women. attendees discuss feelings, stages of mourning and detaching with psychologists; practice yoga and meditation; learn about behavioral nutrition; and complete tasks like keeping a gratitude journal.\n\neven facebook fb, +2.02% has a tool that lets you hide your exes from your news feed after a breakup so you can limit how much of them you see on the social network. that comes free. in return, facebook, as per the social-media giant's privacy policy, will collect your data so it can target you with more products and services.\n\nnot everyone believes it's appropriate to use an app to help speed the plow with a breakup. paying to make your life easier to cut ties with a partner is a cop-out, says chicago-based relationship coach bela gandhi. you need to develop the strength to get through these kinds of traumatic experiences. life is unfortunately filled with various traumas. it's part of being human.\n\nit's good practice to face up to difficult situations rather than avoid them, she adds.\n\nwe

dear moneyist,\n\ni'm 35 years old and have been dating a man 20 years older than me who is 55. things were going good until we started having conversations about the relationship being serious and possibly merging assets. he has a home that he shared with his ex-wife after a failed marriage of 20 years that he currently still lives in and has recently taken out a second mortgage on the home. he also has adult children in their late 20s and they seem to still be heavily dependent on him for financial support.\n\n his ideal plan: i move into his current house that he shared with his ex-wife until he can pay it off which would be in 10 to 15 years and then we could purchase a new home together.  — anonymous\n\nhe has a lot of student loans that he is repaying for himself and his children's college tuition. i own my home free and clear with very little debt (student loans that will be paid off within the next two years) and i made a few good financial investments so i have quite a bit of funds in savings and a good retirement account. i have a child who is five years old and, of course, solely dependent upon me.\n\nalso see:my friend gave me some good stock tips — now he wants me to pay him\n\nwhen we discussed taking steps to moving the relationship forward and discussing marriage, i expressed that i would want to purchase a new home and would be willing to sell my current home and asked that he do the same so we can have a fresh start towards building a life together. he was completely opposed to this plan.\n\n he also said that i could help him pay off his house to move the process along quicker so we could purchase a new home together. if we decide to go with his plan, his adult children will inherit that home.  — anonymous\n\nhis ideal plan: i move into his current house that he shared with his ex-wife until he can pay it off which would be in 10 to 15 years and then we could purchase a new home together. he also said that i could help him pay off his house to move the process along quicker so we could purchase a new home together. if we decide to go with his plan, his adult children will inherit that home.\n\nhe's not willing to compromise in this area and it has created a roadblock in the relationship. i do not want to move into his home and he says i'm being selfish and unrealistic.\n\nwhat should i do?\n\nanonymous\n\nthe moneyist: when your partner wants to live with you for free\n\ndear anonymous,\n\nfirstly, kudos to you for reaching a debt-free status before you are even the age of 40. that is no small achievement. you should be very proud, especially given that you are also supporting a young child. according to our money milestones series (and fidelity investments) most people should have one year's salary saved by 30 and twice their salary by 35. few americans can afford such a luxury. it makes your financial situation all the more commendable.\n\n and so to your question. your request was a reasonable one. his response seems rigid. your first port of call is to ask him: why? how much equity does he have left on this home? is that why he needs to remain there?  — the moneyist\n\nand so to your question. your request was a reasonable one. his response seems rigid. your first port of call is to ask him: why? how much equity does he have left on this home? is that why he needs to remain there? could you both sell your homes and afford a new home by contributing 50/50? could he cover the mortgage with rent, if he decided to purchase a home with you? finally, is he emotionally attached to the home where he raised his family? (that's one for couple's therapy.)\n\ndon't miss: my mother-in-law is deceitful — can we stop her from stealing my wife's inheritance?\n\nthe moneyist facebook group members came down pretty heavily against your fiancé. i'm not telling you to stay and i'm not telling you to go, i'm recommending you find out more about his reasoning so your have more information to make a decision, and to understand his decision. the one red flag: his request for you to help him with the mortgage over the next 15 years seems unreasonable, especially if this home will ultimately be inherited by his children. name-calling is another no-no.\n\n the one red flag: his request for you to help him with the mortgage over the next 15 years seems unreasonable, especially if this home will be inherited by his children. name-calling is another no-no.  — the moneyist\n\nyou reached this place of financial security by not acting impulsively and making decisions — from what major to take at college to when and where you should buy your home — after deliberation and once you have all the information. a generous take: your fiancé is not in the same financial position as you. his request for help with the mortgage may have been a moment of not-so-quiet desperation. you should both lay your finances bare and a prenuptial agreement should be on the table.\n\ndealing with the financial wants of his adult children is a separate conversation. as far as your living arrangements are concerned, you have drawn a red line in the sand or, in this case, on the front lawn. i like that line: you both start fresh somewhere else.\n\nthat already seems like a good compromise to me.\n\nwhat happened next? anonymous tells the moneyist her decision.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
the can: fort point beer co.'s manzanita, $11.99 for a six-pack\n\nthe back story: call this a marriage of craft brewing and a campfire, with a woodsy california twist. fort point, a san francisco beer maker with an eclectic array of offerings, is one of the few american breweries to have introduced a rauchbier, a german style of smoked beer. in the german tradition, the drink gets that flavor of the fire through drying malted barley, a key ingredient in beer, over an open flame.\n\nwhen the fort point team came up with its recipe for rauchbier, working in partnership with a german beer expert, it decided to use beechwood-smoked malt. but it also added some wood from the manzanita, a type of shrub that grows widely in california. and in this case, they put the charred manzanita logs directly into the beer-making kettle. as soon as they did so, the brewing area was filled with this amazingly sweet campfire aroma, says fort point head brewer mike schnebeck.\n\nmanzanita has become a popular fort point seasonal offering, available in the fall and winter. and fort point itself is another example of a craft brewer finding its niche, even as the market becomes ever more crowded.\n\nfrom 2012 to 2017, the number of such breweries in the u.s. nearly tripled to 6,266, according to the brewers association. fort point, which was started in 2014 and distributes only in california at the present time, has seen its sales skyrocket of late: the company's projected revenue for 2018 was $15 million, up 57% from the previous year.\n\nwhat we think about it: we're big fans of the rauchbier style, though it's definitely not your everyday sip. fort point delivers a great version — just smoky enough, but not over the top. schnebeck says his goal was to make an accessible rauchbier.\n\nhow to enjoy it: the fort point team suggests pairing manzanita with savory meat dishes, including ones in the smoky vein (as in barbecue). but it also goes great with pizza, they say.
nearly half of all couples get divorced. and we've long been told it's because they fight about money. so people must be fighting about something else these days, because in a recent study, almost 90% of couples said they were happy with how they dealt with their finances.\n\nfinances are an integral part of a marriage — somebody has to pay the bills - and it's one of the most important topics a couple can discuss. it turns out, couples of all ages are doing a pretty good job with it these days, numerous studies show. not only do they have open communication about money, but when disagreements arise, they work through them.\n\nthe key thing is, make sure you're in it together, said marcy keckler, vice president of financial advice strategy at ameriprise.\n\nfor the most part, they are, according to a recent ameriprise study, which found 88% of the 1,500 couples ranging from 25- to 70-year-olds are happy with the way they manage their money in their relationships, and 68% say they communicate well about their dollars. the study asked both members of the relationship to answer questions about money to gauge if they were seeing eye-to-eye. it also revealed five steps to living in a successful financial relationship: making money a priority, talking through and agreeing on financial goals, setting spending limits and discussing big purchases, keeping a joint account, and planning retirement and investments.\n\nwhen couples do face disagreements, it often has to do with major purchases and children-related conversations, such as how much to spend on their kids, keckler said. spending limits can make a big difference, she added. the study found 82% of couples say they're able to resolve their disagreements.\n\nthis shows us couples are finding ways to work out their differences, keckler said. disagreements aren't necessarily a bad thing — they can lead to discussions that help couples work toward a common goal.\n\neach person in a couple doesn't need to be completely the same when it comes to how they handle their money. keckler said opposites do attract, even financially. a td ameritrade survey on millennials and money found that of the more than 2,000 american adults who responded, 59% of spender women are with saver partners and 39% of spender men with savers. still, savers work well with savers and spenders with spenders — most savers prefer their partners to also be savers, the study found.\n\nspenders like the security of savers, said dara luber, senior manager of retirement at td ameritrade. and savers, they are savers, and they see themselves that way so they continue to have their own security and feel they have their financial future in order.\n\nbut there's always room for improvement. a lack of communication between partners can fuel resentment, hurt and anger.\n\nmoney is such an emotionally charged topic, said kristy archuleta, a hartford funds' human-centric insights panelist and program director of personal financial planning at kansas state university. even from childhood, we don't see parents talking about it. we don't know how to talk about it, and we don't know if we should talk about it.\n\narchuleta says money needs to be discussed early on in a relationship, usually pre-marriage. couples should discuss what they see in their futures and what their financial expectations are for themselves and each other. roles should be determined for each significant other, playing to their strengths, such as who will pay the bills every month or who will begin the estate planning.\n\nmillennial couples seem to be starting good habits early. a second annual td bank survey on love and money found 74% of millennial couples talk about money weekly. it even goes before the first date for 48% of respondents who have used online dating services, saying they talk about finances before meeting. more than two-thirds of millennial couples have at least one shared bank account, though 60% say they keep their credit cards separate. this survey asked almost 2,000 americans of all ages in relationships about their finances.\n\nhomeowners buy back the family homestead\n\nthe millennial couples who responded did have their downfalls — one in five said they'd break up with their significant other over a financial secret, but the same percentage is likely to have one, and 15% of the latter say they don't plan to spill. the most common secrets all generations had include a secret bank account, steep credit card debt or a bad credit score.\n\narchuleta said when couples experience hard times -- whether financial or otherwise -- they should carefully word what they say and try to control how they act.\n\nit takes two people to have a conflict, so you each have a part, she said. the only thing you have control of is your part of the situation. you can't control your partner and they can't control you, but you can control how you react in situations and how you interact. it does have an impact.
in the midst of getting married last fall, carl drotleff, a 36-year-old senior compliance officer in indianapolis, and his wife knew they had to have an important conversation — the money talk.\n\nthey merged their finances and began working on budgeting -- they also thought a lot about how to save for retirement. a month before saying i do, drotleff changed jobs, and he was at a crossroads in his savings plan — he could hold off on funding his retirement account until their finances were meshed, to see what that balance sheet would look like, or he could go for the company match and figure out the rest later.\n\nthey decided he should take the company match, instead of stopping contributions to a new plan. and even as they move toward future goals, such as buying a home or a car, they'll look to grow their retirement accounts, he said — they'd rather push forward, than take steps back for their retirement savings.\n\nhere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\nlife is about making healthy choices and just like everything else, finance is something you need to create healthy habits for, he said. we decided rather than starting with an unhealthy habit and try to force it in later, to start with something that made sense.\n\ndrotleff and his wife did something most relationship experts suggest couples do before they get married. talking about money can make or break some relationships, and even though 88% of couples said they did not fight about money in one ameriprise study last year, experts say all the time that there's room for improvement and a lack of communication, especially with the way they manage money, can be dangerous.\n\ndiscussing how to save for retirement as a couple is an important component when combining two financial households, said dede jones, a financial adviser and managing director of innovative financial in golden, colo. it goes beyond financial goals, to envision the future and how each partner sees it. these people are a team, and it's important to know what these teammates are doing, she said.\n\ntalking about each others' priorities with money can also help them avoid misaligned goals — if two are not aligned it will be an uncomfortable situation, she said. that doesn't mean both parties have to have identical values, said erika safran, principal at safran wealth advisors in new york. one may be the saver, another the spender, but being open and honest about their intentions with money can help one spouse understand the other and plan accordingly.\n\nsee:these college majors predict when you will marry\n\nthey should also take stock and discuss what they've already been doing for retirement — one partner may have been saving since they began their career while others haven't gotten started, said stephanie genkin, founder of my financial planner in brooklyn, n.y. spouses can discuss investing in an employer-sponsored retirement account and how to maximize their savings while meeting other financial goals, such as a buying a home or debt repayment. they should also get educated, preferably together, about other savings avenues, such as an individual retirement account and how to claim social security down the line (spousal benefits come to mind). spouses should dive into each other's retirement plans, see which one has the best investment options and lowest fees, and perhaps coordinate putting more money in the low-fee plan, genkin said.\n\nthinking about retirement at the start of a marriage is crucial for building up a nest egg, genkin added. once you start a family, you have new financial pressures, so i think for many people this is the most you're ever going to be able to pay, she said. the financial pressures just get bigger. some young couples make the mistake of holding off because they think they may make more money over time, but time has value — and assets will grow with compound interest over time, she said.\n\nwhat spouses should not do is assume the other one is handling the finances -- both people should be saving for themselves, as well as their future together, but assuming your partner has it under control could put you and your future at risk.\n\nunfortunately, women have a bad reputation for not participating in their household's personal finances or their financial advisers don't talk to them about it, yet 80% of women die single, and knowing where they stand financially is imperative. women are also 80% more likely than men to be impoverished in retirement, so experts suggest they join in family money talks and keep track of their own financial and legal documents.\n\nsee also:5 times being single costs you a lot of money\n\nso if you're ready to walk down the aisle, here's what to do: take the time before or after you say your vows to talk about your finances, how you plan to manage them and how to save and build for your futures, together and separately. create an emergency fund, think of long-term goals and don't neglect your retirement accounts. it doesn't have to be such a heavy conversation — talk about finances over a cup of coffee or a favorite drink, said marlow and chris felton, authors of couples money, or write them down and show each other, jones said. also, revisit the conversation when changes are made at home or work, or because you make it a ritual — the feltons, for example, sit down every new year's eve and talk about what they want in the new year and gauging their progress. and lastly, keep each other accountable and remember you're working together.\n\nwe have a combined goal in making sure individual goals are in alignment with what we want as a couple, chris said. one doesn't take away from the other.\n\nwondering what your

dear moneyist,\n\nmy mother was married to my father for 40-plus years, but he passed away several years ago unexpectedly. during their marriage, they inherited money from both their parents. my dad gifted a lot of jewelry to my mother over the years, and my mother also made good investments.\n\ndeciding she was too young to just be a widow, my mother found herself a new husband. bringing considerably more in assets to her new marriage, my mother was smart and had a prenuptial agreement put into place.\n\n 'once my stepfather passes, whatever remains would be divided between my mother's three children and my stepfather's two children.' \n\nmy mother has now been married for a couple of years to my stepfather, and they recently each created a will. my stepfather and mother purchased their new home together, but much of the antique furnishings were handed down through my mother's family.\n\nmy mother lives in texas, as do i, but my two siblings live out of state. my mother recently gave each of us a copy of her new will. my siblings reached out to me as i live closest to our mother, because they are concerned about how her will was written.\n\nwe aren't legal experts, but this is how we read it. if she passes before my stepfather, he gets all personal household effects including her jewelry and our family heirlooms. also, her retirement accounts and other monetary assets are put in a trust for my stepfather for health and support. she named my stepfather's oldest kid as trustee.\n\nonce my stepfather passes, whatever remains would be divided between my mother's three children and my stepfather's two children (to whom he is estranged and our mother has never met).\n\n 'should i try to set up a video conference with all my siblings and my mother? my sister suggested we include my stepfather for transparency.' \n\nwe would like our mother to specify in her will that her jewelry prior to her new marriage will be bequeathed to us. additionally, any furniture, fine china and paintings that were in the family prior to the new marriage be left to us.\n\nwe don't mind her setting up a trust to ensure my stepfather has access to funds for his health and support after her passing, but we are concerned that his estranged son would be trustee and that my stepfather's estranged kids would get a share of my mother's assets upon my stepfather's passing. we haven't seen my stepfather's will, but my mother says it is identical for the reverse situation if he passes.\n\nwe want to have a conversation with my mother to discuss our concerns, but are at a loss on where to start. as i'm the closest to my mother, should i act as spokesperson for all my siblings? maybe set up a lunch date to discuss these things with her? or should i try to set up a video conference with all my siblings and my mother? my sister suggested we include my stepfather for transparency, but i feel that would be too awkward.\n\n we don't want to seem greedy. we are glad our mother is happy, but we've never met my stepfather's children as he doesn't have a relationship with them. \n\nwe don't want to seem like greedy or ungrateful kids. we are glad our mother is happy, but we've never met my stepfather's children as he doesn't have a relationship with them.\n\nthat's what is so baffling about the way the will is written. we would really like the family items to stay in our family. i should also add that if my stepfather passes before our mother, she could live comfortably without his assets if they were to go to his children.\n\nmy stepfather didn't bring much into the marriage. are there other things we are overlooking in this whole scenario that we should consider before talking with our mother? how would you suggest we approach this?\n\nanxious daughter\n\ndear anxious,\n\nthis is a very delicate situation, but keep in mind that you are talking about her money, her furniture, her jewels and, yes, her husband.\n\non the one hand, i see your point about precious family heirlooms possibly ending up in the hands of your stepfather's family. on the other hand, this is your mother's new husband and anything you say that could be construed as it's not fair or have an unhappy/ungrateful undertone could backfire on both you and your siblings.\n\n your observation that your mother 'found herself a new husband' makes me nervous. let's assume she feels grateful that love found her. \n\nplease tread carefully to avoid your mother viewing this as her children being opportunistic about owning these personal items, rather than realistic about who would most likely appreciate them most. she is entitled to leave everything to her new husband and she may even have included these items in her prenuptial agreement.\n\nyour observation that your mother decided that she's too young to just be a widow and found herself a new husband makes me nervous. it may not be the kind of thing you would say to your mother's face, but it does objectify her and her situation, and not in a good way. let's assume that she fell in love with her new husband and that love found her.\n\nframe this as a request rather than a concern or a demand. i believe you should do it yourself in person. i wanted to talk to you about our family's heirlooms and how it would mean so much to us if we could share them after you're gone, as we feel very emotionally attached to them. and ask her how she feels about that.\n\n frame this as a request rather than a concern or a demand. i believe you should do it in person and ask her how she feels about you asking. \n\ni agree that, if your stepfather is estranged from his children, it doesn't make sense to have one of them as an executor of their estate. in fact, it seems odd. you may want to raise that and allow her to think it over without suggesting that one of her children take that role instead. at the very least, it should be a party with no vested interest.\n\nthis conversation should be approached cautiously and, later, with a lawyer. one on one is better, as it is a family matter and, in my opinion, a video conference call would feel more like an intervention than a request, and involving your stepfather at this early stage (when it should be a simple request) could put both your mother and stepfather on the defense.\n\nthe more detailed her prenup and will, the better. she (and you) should also be aware that the terms of her prenuptial agreement may take precedence over her will in probate court.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

love and marriage don't always go together, no matter what sinatra says. if you're in a committed relationship but nuptials are on the back burner, just know your dream of buying a home doesn't have to be.\n\nsixteen percent of all first-time home buyers in 2017 were unmarried couples, an annual national association of realtors report found, the highest share the organization has recorded since 1981, says jessica lautz, managing director of survey research and communication for nar.\n\nbut many couples don't realize how risky buying a home with an unmarried partner can be. here's how to overcome these risks with some planning, a good lawyer and a slightly awkward conversation or two.\n\n1. sign a prenup…for the house\n\nno couple wants to talk about breaking up, but if you're going to be co-homeowners, it's a must, says renee bergmann, a real estate attorney and owner of bergmann law llc in westmont, new jersey. she recommends unmarried couples create a co-ownership contract with the help of a legal professional before closing day.\n\nthe agreement should answer basic questions like: what happens to the property if you split? what if one of you becomes disabled or dies? who pays utility bills or for major repairs?\n\ndon't just wait and see what happens, bergmann says, because without a written agreement things could get messy very quickly.\n\nhere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\n2. choose the right type of title\n\nturns out there's more than one way to own a house, and taking title the right way is especially important for unmarried couples. options vary from state to state but generally include:\n\nsole ownership. only one name is recorded on the deed, and that person has all the rights and responsibilities of ownership.\n\npros: sole ownership may yield tax savings if your incomes are drastically different. and, if your partner has bad credit, applying for a home loan in your name only may help with approval. remember, however, that ownership rights are determined by names on the deed, not the mortgage, anna fabian, vice president of product at sofi, said in an email.\n\nsole ownership may yield tax savings if your incomes are drastically different. and, if your partner has bad credit, applying for a home loan in your name only may help with approval. remember, however, that ownership rights are determined by names on the deed, not the mortgage, anna fabian, vice president of product at sofi, said in an email. con: if the relationship ends and you're not on the title, you'll risk walking away with nothing, even if you contributed money to the purchase or mortgage payments.\n\njoint tenancy. each person owns 50% of the property. if a tenant dies, their share automatically transfers to the other joint tenant.\n\npro: joint tenants enjoy right of survivorship, so you won't have to worry about fighting estates or relatives for the house in the event of your partner's death.\n\njoint tenants enjoy right of survivorship, so you won't have to worry about fighting estates or relatives for the house in the event of your partner's death. con: an unfriendly breakup could spell trouble, especially if one partner can't or won't buy the other out.\n\ntenants in common. allows unequal ownership, so you could own a 75% stake while your partner owns 25%.\n\npro: ownership shares can be tailored to match financial contributions; if you paid more toward the down payment, for example, you can own a larger percentage.\n\nownership shares can be tailored to match financial contributions; if you paid more toward the down payment, for example, you can own a larger percentage. con: if one tenant dies, the other has no automatic rights to that person's share of the property unless named in a will or living trust.\n\nno matter which approach you choose, if you tie the knot after buying, consider revising the deed to reflect your new legal status with a quitclaim deed, bergmann says.\n\n3. leave your parents at home\n\nbuying a home is a stressful decision, so younger unmarried couples often involve their parents, but sometimes this only makes things more confusing, says danielle moy, an agent with coldwell banker residential brokerage in orland park, illinois.\n\ni can tell the parents are unsure of the situation, and it causes a bit of an emotional roller coaster when they're looking at homes, moy says.\n\nparents may mean well, but ultimately it's your house and your decision, moy says, so make sure you and your partner agree about what you want — no matter what mom and dad think.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
delbert pete erickson was an avid outdoorsman who moved with his wife from washington state to petersburg, alaska, in the 1960s in search of adventure and opportunity.\n\nthe young couple's journey north led to them becoming part of the fabric of petersburg, a small island fishing community with norwegian roots. erickson, who'd dropped out of high school in his native washington state, arrived in alaska as a 23-year-old apprentice carpenter and went on to build many of his neighbors' homes.\n\nin his 40s, after shattering his leg in a fall from the roof of a building he was repairing, erickson left the carpentry trade and opened a plumbing business that he ran for the next three decades. the ericksons lived in petersburg for the majority of their more than 50-year marriage and raised two children who were born there, says his son, arlan erickson, who also goes by the name pete.\n\nthe 76-year-old erickson, who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) and other issues stemming from a heart attack about three years ago, died march 16 in a washington state hospital after contracting covid-19. his is believed to be the first recorded death of an alaska resident from the coronavirus.\n\nthe younger pete erickson, a tugboat captain who lives with his wife, kris, and their adult children in camano island, north of seattle, said friends remembered his dad's big smile, rosy cheeks, and constant generosity. he was an active member of the local elks and moose lodges and was named elk of the year for his volunteer service, which included laying a new tile floor and cooking for community members.\n\nhe was one of these guys who could do anything, his son says. when a friend suggested he ought to buy a boat, he replied that he would rather just build one—and he did, constructing a 26-foot cabin cruiser from plywood and fiberglass, which he put to good use catching salmon. he loved fishing and hunting.\n\nhe could fix engines, he knew how to weld, he spent so much time building houses that he was, well, he was brilliant at it, his son says.\n\nin an interview, the younger erickson detailed the last two harrowing months of his father's life.\n\nafter spending a week in the hospital in petersburg in february for treatment of ongoing heart issues, his father was taken by medevac to virginia mason hospital in seattle. it was just his latest medevac trip since the heart attack; he even joked about collecting frequent flier miles.\n\nwhen he arrived in washington in february, it was early in the u.s. outbreak of coronavirus, and it never occurred to the family that their patriarch may have contracted covid-19. he wasn't showing classic symptoms of the virus, such as fever or cough. in any case, the treatment he received for the fluid around his heart seemed to help, and he was briefly transferred to a short-term rehabilitation facility. but when his son went to visit him, he saw his father had taken a turn for the worse.\n\nit went from one day talking about (recovery) to the next, he was just crashing, his son says.\n\nerickson was taken by ambulance to a hospital near the rehab facility in federal way, washington, where a doctor covering a shift finally asked why the doctors caring for him hadn't yet done a covid-19 test. the test was done and erickson was moved to an airlocked isolation room to await results, his son says. four days later, as he continued to worsen, the test came back positive.\n\nit took the breath out of me, his son says.\n\nfor weeks prior, the family assumed erickson would recover and return to petersburg, spending his remaining months—or years, if he was lucky—with his wife, marilyn, who is 74. she was not well enough to make the trip to washington to be with her husband during his treatment. but there was talk of getting the whole family together again in alaska this summer for a fish feed, a feast of old-style norwegian lutefisk (a type of white fish) and boiled potatoes with butter.\n\ninstead, erickson's son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren put on masks, gowns, and gloves. one by one, they spent a few minutes sitting with him to say goodbye. within a few minutes of the last visit, erickson died, according to his son.\n\nit's unclear where erickson contracted covid-19, but his son suspects it was while receiving treatment at virginia mason hospital, the first facility he was sent to. virginia mason hospital confirmed in a march 1 statement that it was caring for a patient who had been diagnosed with covid-19.\n\nsee more stories of the lives lost to covid-19\n\nthe younger erickson later learned that he also tested positive for the virus but has extremely mild symptoms, he said. he and his wife, kris, are quarantining with their children at their home, located on a wooded 5-acre property outside of town.\n\nin a public facebook post, the younger erickson admitted that before his family's experience with covid-19, he had viewed the response to the outbreak as overblown. but after losing his father to the disease and contracting it himself, his views changed. he used his post to warn others who have brushed off social distancing policies to learn from his example.\n\ni still believe there's a lot of hysteria and bs out there, but after losing my dad to the virus i have changed my mind about the virus itself, he wrote. the panic is ridiculous, the virus is real. stay away from your elderly family and friends. this will kill them. if you [are] on immunosuppressive drugs, (like i am) talk to your doctor about stopping them. get outside in the sunshine, isolate yourself from others.\n\nerickson is survived by his wife, marilyn; four children, arlan pete erickson, tammy erickson, laurie erickson and robert carlson; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
it's the well-known, but little-discussed, reality of a life in the financial markets: very little business actually takes place on wall street, or anywhere in new york for that matter.\n\neven before coronavirus forced the world into an extended office hiatus, much of the financial services industry has been scattered around north america. between visits to clients on their turf, conferences and marketing events in far-flung corners, and more, a career on the street may just as easily have meant on the road.\n\nmarketwatch checked in with a few high-profile financial road warriors to see how they've handled having to hunker down, their overnight bags gathering dust. we asked what, if any, shifts in the way financial services operate might be here to stay when things get back to normal, if there is such a thing.\n\nthese are not stories of hardship. those interviewed know they're lucky to have jobs they can largely carry out on a laptop from anywhere, plus the luxury of time and money to make the most of this particular crisis. still, all describe a certain dissonance. it's a strange turn of events when a million-miler has no plans to go anywhere.\n\nthe conversations that follow have been edited for length and clarity.\n\ndavid rosenberg, a long-time economist and strategist for wealth managers including merrill lynch and toronto-based gluskin sheff, decided to strike out on his own in 2020. rosenberg research launched on jan. 6; two months later, covid-19 shuttered the global economy.\n\nrosenberg is often known as a perma-bear, but as marketwatch has frequently noted, that's not entirely accurate. he's had his bullish moments. now is not one of them.\n\nthings aren't going back to normal for a long, long time, he said in early june. i don't want to burst anybody's bubble, but we're going to be living not just with this situation, but with the consequences for many years. [u.s.] gdp bottomed in 1933, but the depression didn't end until 1942.\n\nthe latest:u.s. states slowly reopen after coronavirus lockdowns — some now permit visits to nursing homes\n\nrosenberg had expected that his travel schedule would be comparable to his time in previous roles. he was on the road about 25% of the time at gluskin. as for merrill, when he commuted back and forth between headquarters in new york and his home in toronto, he says, i had to list my suitcase as an official residence.\n\nmarketwatch: how often did you used to travel, and what's your best anecdote from your time on the road?\n\ndavid rosenberg: i'm platinum, gold or silver on five different airlines. one time i was flying from albuquerque to denver on a small six-seater jet and they couldn't land the plane. i didn't know what was going on. the guy made the approach at denver and the next thing i knew he was pulling up. he had to make four attempts. my fingernails are still in that plane.\n\ni once sat next to paul giamatti going to montreal when he was filming barney's version in 2008. i said, you know, we're both renowned for destroying an industry. you destroyed the merlot industry and i destroyed the asset management industry. [rosenberg was known for predicting the subprime mortgage crisis, which eventually did in his employer, merrill lynch.]\n\neconomist david rosenberg and his sons. david rosenberg\n\nmarketwatch: what have you had to get used to during the lockdown?\n\nrosenberg: the part of my job that i love is the social interaction — pressing the flesh — and the thrill of being on stage. that's a big change. the replacement of zoom zm, -4.26% for the real thing, that has been the biggest change. so much of my business is research and writing and you can do that anywhere. but the non-written interactions, that's been the biggest adjustment. i'm managing a team now and we had a nice office in downtown toronto and i think it's hard on them. it's nice when you're starting a business to be physically present, especially as a leader.\n\nthere's a lesson to be learned here for policymakers, especially in the u.s. and canada, that dug their heels in for this whole thing: a stitch in time saves nine. the planning and preparation for this pandemic gets a big fat f. people are so glib about this, they don't realize that in a situation like this, being ahead of the curve by a week makes a difference. i'm sad about the lack of political leadership everywhere.\n\n 'it's nice when you're starting a business to be physically present, especially as a leader.'  — david rosenberg, rosenberg research\n\nmarketwatch: is there a silver lining?\n\nrosenberg: i'm home with my youngest son, mikey, who's 20 and a fourth-year psychology student. he has been my bartender. he makes a mean manhattan, dark and stormys, whiskey sours, brandy alexanders, margaritas. we've been playing a sh-t ton of monopoly and they kick my ass. my middle son, jacob, who's 24, said, dad, i thought you were in finance. i said, jacob, this isn't finance, this is real estate.\n\nbut i feel really sad for the young people like my two boys who have had what could have been the best summer of their lives never come to fruition. i'm not wallowing in self pity, i feel sad for the young people. they are having memories robbed. i feel badly for that.\n\nthe best-selling john mauldin meets his readers pre-virus. mauldin economics\n\njohn mauldin has written his popular macroeconomics newsletter, thoughts from the frontline, for two decades, and is a best-selling author of several books about investing. his firm, mauldin economics, offers research and resources for all kinds of investors, and runs one of the most sought-after annual conferences in the investing world, with attendees ranging from jeffrey gundlach to ian bremmer.\n\nthe strategic investment conference was virtual this year, and mauldin says he was both pleasantly surprised with its success, yet still convinced that nothing beats the real thing. he had recently relocated from dallas to puerto rico, and while beach life has its perks, he misses getting together with a group of financial fellow travelers to try to solve the problems of the world over dinner.\n\nmauldin has kept up a grueling travel schedule since the early 2000s, starting with years of 100,000 miles and expanding from there.\n\nmarketwatch: how often did you travel?\n\njohn mauldin: american airlines aal, -2.78% called me last week and said, you're now part of this special group, you have 8 million miles. that's their tracking, not mine. but i'm used to traveling a lot. i've had a few years of 250,000 miles a year. i have traveled to 65 countries, (including) 15 in africa, all 50 u.s. states and most of the canadian provinces.\n\ni have no scheduled plans to get on a plane, which is kind of weird. i'm writing a book and i'm doing a lot of video. we do [our strategic investment conference] every year — last year we had 750 people. this year it was exceptionally large and well-responded-to over a span of 10 days. it was easier to get speakers because they're all locked down, and we couldn't have ever gotten all these people together at a regular conference.\n\nbut honestly i do miss sitting at meals, being in meetings with friends, and given how much i traveled, that was just a regular part of my life. that i do miss. and i miss my gym.\n\n 'i once went to cyprus and had dozens of people come to see me including the minister of finance. i've been doing this for years and i still find that cool.'  — john mauldin, mauldin economics\n\nmarketwatch: what's your best work-travel anecdote?\n\nmauldin: people coming up to you, holding up a book in an airport, saying would you autograph my book, or when you're walking around say, rome, and people walk up wanting to take pictures. those are kind of cool moments. you meet people that recognize you because your face is on your newsletter that goes out or they see you on tv. people sitting next to you and they're reading your newsletter and you look over and crack a joke, hey, i like that guy. i miss the dinner conversations, six to eight people in a room and you plow into stuff.\n\ni once went to cyprus and had dozens of people come to see me including the minister of finance. i've been doing this for years and i still find that cool.\n\nmarketwatch: is there a silver lining?\n\nmauldin: the glass half full is more time to research and read. i'm finishing up a book that i've been trying to finish for years. [my wife] shane and i do get more time together and that's good. we're like every other entrepreneur in the country, you scramble and try to figure out, okay, that was a curveball, what do i do now? i've got good partners and good teammates and so far, so good. but man, i've got lots of friends in the restaurant business and i thank god i'm not having to deal with some of the stuff they are. i really feel blessed.\n\nmarketwatch: when will you feel comfortable getting back on a plane?\n\nmauldin: i've thought about that a lot. it's not the plane that's the problem. it's the airports and the security lines and everything getting to and from the plane. one of the conclusions is that we think that for a period of time — six months, nine months — everyone should wear a mask, to make everyone else feel safer. we really do need masks to make other people feel comfortable.\n\njohn mousseau before the lockdown, and during john mousseau\n\njohn mousseau is president and ceo of sarasota, fla.-based cumberland advisors, a fee-based investment advisory firm with about $3 billion in assets. before the lockdown, mousseau regularly traveled about one-third of the time.\n\nfrom his home in sarasota to cumberland's office is about a two-minute drive, and mousseau says he felt safer creating a command center for himself in the office, where he was all alone with multiple computer screens, televisions and phones.\n\nhe's a bit rueful about being stuck at home during lent, however. that's when i try to do something nice for someone every day, you know, just 'can i give you a hand with that?' that fell by the wayside this year. the sad part is unless you're wearing a mask, that's something you won't do in the new normal. to the extent there was any chivalry at all, it's going to take a big hit.\n\nmarketwatch: what's it been like being homebound?\n\njohn mousseau: there's an upside to this: the solitariness isn't that bad because i spend most of the day on the phone. there's never any isolation. there's been good aspects: you're not out doing entertaining, being entertained, not eating donuts that people bring in. i've been swimming, working out, and while the gym was closed, i would go home and go on a run. i'm down 18 pounds.\n\nbut i tell you, if i had been working at home, i would have been a gloomy gus. i'm sure my marriage would have taken a hit. the sad part is, we've seen domestic violence and child abuse statistics pick up markedly all over.\n\ni have learned just how important communication is. in march and early april, since we weren't going anywhere, i was probably doing 10-12 client calls a day, lined up like planes on an airstrip. people wanted to hear from us. what you find out in a panic, you find out a lot from clients who say, oh, i have some money elsewhere, so we actually wound up with some accounts that way.\n\nmarketwatch: what's your best anecdote?\n\nmousseau: a few months after 9/11, we went to charlotte. we decided to catch an early flight back to newark and were on standby. they're calling standby passengers and the gate agent called mister moussaoui. [marketwatch note: zacarias moussaoui was arrested in late 2001 and pled guilty to being part of the 9/11 attacks.] security guards were reaching for guns and people were cowering. as i went up to the desk, the gate attendants parted like the red sea. of course, she took one look at my irish-looking face and got on the intercom to say, i'm sorry, i meant mousseau. that's a true story. i've lived a very forrest gump life.\n\n '...[a] as soon as a client gives me a green light to see them, i will be on a plane. i will be doing that not only because i want to see clients, break bread, and do business the old fashioned way, but because i think i can add value. '  — john mousseau, cumberland advisors\n\ni think what you get out of this is that the country is probably going to get back to normal faster than people think, even if it's a new normal. all these people out, it tells you the american people have a thirst to be out there and to be with each other. to the extent that's a positive for markets, you're seeing it. there's an attitude on the part of a lot of americans: damn the torpedoes, let's go. i can't tell you i don't feel the same way.\n\nmarketwatch: so what's the new normal, then?\n\nmousseau: i don't expect it will ever go back to the way it was before. you would expect that the first normal you go back to is: people back in the office but not traveling. step two, people may want to have visits, probably next spring. i will say this: people that say, well, my business model has now permanently changed and i'm going to be doing everything on zoom and microsoft teams msft, +1.24% and my travel and entertainment budget will be one quarter of what it was, i'm not thinking like that. i'm thinking as soon as a client gives me a green light to see them, i will be on a plane. i will be doing that not only because i want to see clients, break bread and do business the old fashioned way, but because i think i can add value.\n\ndon't miss:some tech workers are slowly trickling back to the office now\n\nbarry ritholtz is co-founder, chairman and chief investment office of ritholtz wealth management, a new york-based investment advisory with about $1.3 billion in assets, but he may be better known for his outsized media presence. he was one of the first — and remains perhaps one of the most prolific — financial bloggers, starting the big picture in 2003. he also launched the wildly popular masters in business podcast at bloomberg news in 2014.\n\nritholtz also writes regular columns for bloomberg, tweets frequently, and regularly publishes suggested reading lists on markets, the economy, policy and more.\n\nhe never spent as much time on long-haul travel as some of the other participants mentioned here — but may have had one of the longest regular commutes from long island to mid-town manhattan. that may change, he's been thinking. and ritholtz can't help but try to game out the various impacts of the covid-19 hit: to the way we live, invest and more.\n\nmarketwatch: how often did you used to travel?\n\nbarry ritholtz: i speak at a lot of conferences and new york is a terrible place to host a conference so we host them away from new york. i'm not one of those people who was a road warrior but i'm silver medallion on delta dal, -3.14% .\n\n 'i love the concentration of intellectual capital. there's a reason cities have been the dominant economic engine for the past few hundred years. i'm not in the camp that thinks it's going away, but i do think offices have learned something.'  — barry ritholtz, ritholtz wealth management\n\nmarketwatch: what's it been like being stuck at home?\n\nritholtz: it's me, the wife and two dogs. i have jokingly said there are two types of people in lockdown: those who are having fun with it, and those who have small children. i'm happy that we live in suburbia. i miss going into the office in the city but dear lord, what a delight it is to be surrounded by greenery. if i'm in my office over the garage and my wife is on the other side of the house, we can't even hear each other. we have two big dogs that require a lot of exercise so every day there's a long walk either with them or just us walking. we also get in the car — we have a convertible — and drive for half an hour just to explore new areas.\n\nthere's definitely cabin fever, but we have settled into a very nice routine. around 5:30 p.m. i try and wrap up whatever i'm doing work-wise, and we have cocktail hour, we open a nice bottle of wine. and we have been cooking from scratch, stuff you never have time to do. i keep pulling out these gadgets that were wedding gifts or anniversary gifts all these years, i mean, who has time for an air fryer? but bacon and chicken wings in the air fryer are amazing. i am waiting to see which of our favorite restaurants don't make it.\n\nbarry ritholtz doesn't mind this commute one bit.\n\ni don't miss fighting my way through tsa, through the airports, whatever. this has helped me discover how inefficient traveling to other places is. if you're going to give a keynote for 45 minutes to an hour, that requires 72-96 hours, not counting prep for the actual presentation... if you're doing a zoom presentation, it takes less time to prepare than it would normally take me to pack. i do miss getting out to other cities, seeing clients. it's really nice having face time.\n\nmarketwatch: what will the new normal look like?\n\nritholtz: our office is right on bryant park. i had been thinking about getting a second floor. and working from home has kind of made me think, gee maybe i don't need to [expand]. on any given day there's eight to 15 people, and i thought like 15 people were our ceiling. now i think maybe 20-24 people are our ceiling if [work-from-home arrangements become more permanent, and people stagger their time in the office.] i love the concentration of intellectual capital. there's a reason cities have been the dominant economic engine for the past few hundred years. i'm not in the camp that thinks it's going away, but i do think offices have learned something.\n\nread:work-from-home productivity pickup has tech ceos predicting many employees will never come back to the office\n\nmarketwatch: what's your best anecdote?\n\nritholtz: the masters in business podcast came about because of a layover. i was watching tv while waiting to make a connection from vancouver to new york. i remember being infuriated watching an interview with, i think, bill ackman. it was the dumbest questions: what's your favorite stock, what's the fed going to do. on the plane, i bumped into someone i knew and we swapped seats to sit next to each other to talk. i remember saying, i can't believe how dumb that was. this person said, well, what would you ask?

dear moneyist,\n\ni was born out of wedlock. while my mother did marry my biological father, it was a forced marriage and they divorced about three months after i was born. my mother then married a man (i'll call paul to keep this story straight) when i was about one year old, but they divorced when i was about nine years of age. my mother moved out and my half-sister and i stayed with paul.\n\nwhen i was about 12 years old, i learned that paul was not my real father. however, i had always gone by his last name. you can imagine the betrayal i felt at such an impressionable age knowing that i had been lied to by so many people. paul subsequently adopted me, with the permission of my mother and my biological father.\n\nwhile my mother gave her consent to the adoption, she did not realize that paul would do it as a single parent adoption. therefore, i have no mother listed on my birth certificate. i shared this with her when i was in my 30s and she was furious. paul was a very controlling, manipulative man and was feared by many of us, so we never thought to challenge this as a result and, at the time, i couldn't think of any reason why that would matter.\n\nalso see:my wife and i want to have a second child — is this a good time to buy a new house?\n\npaul is now deceased and now that i am much older (late 50s) and my mother is fortunately still a sprightly 70-plus stunner, it is bothering me greatly whether this will impact my status regarding inheritance from my mother.\n\nmy mother had a falling out with my sister almost 10 years ago and changed her will such that my sister will not receive any inheritance from our mother. my mother has plans in her will to leave some inheritance to my sister's children, just not my sister. my sister was such a b**** when paul passed away. (oh, the horror stories i could tell you about that!) that i fear what my sister will do when she finds out she's been disinherited.\n\nshe's extremely vindictive and i fear that she may try to use the fact that my mother isn't legally my mother against me. i'm trying to decide if i need to bother trying to get my adoption overturned and get my mother back reinstated on my birth certificate.\n\ni was born in alabama and was adopted in alabama. my mother still lives there. i currently live in missouri, but plan to move back to alabama in a few years after my husband retires. my sister currently lives in illinois, but will be moving to missouri in the next couple of months.\n\nadopted daughter\n\ndear adopted daughter,\n\ni'm sorry to hear everything you went through with your stepfather and your family, but i'm heartened to hear you now have a relationship with your mother.\n\nwhen a child is adopted, the original birth certificate is usually sealed by the court. according to the alabama department of public health: in 2000, the legislature amended the vital records law to allow an adult whose original birth certificate was placed in a 'sealed file' to obtain a non-certified copy of that record and any other documents in the 'sealed file.' you could always request a copy of that original and include it with the will.\n\nthat said, the more explicit and detailed your mother is in her will, i am relatively confident that it would stand up in court. any adult of sound mind can make a will and can exclude legal heirs. she could refer to you as her biological daughter, and once you're named and your sister is disinherited by name, any challenge would be unlikely to stand up in court. in such cases, it's important to name a child who is excluded. otherwise, that person could argue that their parent merely omitted to mention them.\n\ndon't miss:should we divorce so my husband can get more social security?\n\nthe problems arise when a parent fails to make a rock-solid will with the assistance of an estate lawyer. but don't take my word for it. i asked not one, but two, lawyers who specialize in estate planning and adoption law to put your mind at ease. all laws regarding adoption and inheritance are state specific. however, as a general rule, the mere act of adoption grants inheritance rights only if a parent dies intestate without a will, said robin fleischner and theodore metzger, two new york-based attorneys.\n\nthere is no legal impediment for jo's mother to make a specific bequest to anyone, including jo, they added. there is also no legal impediment for jo's mother to disinherit anyone, but a spouse. while jo's sister could try to contest her birth mother's will for reasons such as incapacity, duress, or undue influence, the fact that jo is not her legal daughter would not be a ground for attacking the will. i hope that puts your mind at rest. step 1: make a will. step 1: name the beneficiaries. step 3: name those who are excluded.\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\nrecommended:after my father died, my brother has been pressuring me to lend him money\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear moneyologist,\n\nmy husband and i have been married for several years, and we have both always worked. when we married, we agreed to split the expenses equally and we both earned the same income. since then, circumstances have changed. i am now a mother who only works part time while my husband was promoted and makes more money. while we each had our own savings accounts (and a small joint account) mine is almost depleted while his is growing.\n\nstill, he insists that each of us contribute equally, and that he is free to spend his extra money on whatever he wants (a drum set, new computer, toys for boys). we don't make a lot of money so these luxuries are not really from extra money and i would like to see him move some to our joint account. i know we promised to share expenses equally, but it feels more like he wants a business partner, not a wife, when it comes to sharing finances?\n\nam i wrong to push the issue or is he right in keeping what we agreed to?\n\nlauren from indianapolis\n\nare separate bank accounts fair for couples?\n\ndear lauren,\n\nif you are a mother who only works part-time, chances are you are working more than full-time, given that you are also at home taking care of your home and family. meanwhile, your husband works full-time and gets to pocket the difference in your income, minus expenses. that doesn't seem fair to me. i appreciate it's nice to have some financial autonomy, but the deck is stacked in your husband's favor. homemaking and child-rearing are unpaid jobs and, while i'm sure your husband helps out, you are not receiving any income for the time you spend at home, looking after everyone.\n\njoint accounts are popular with younger couples. millennial couples – people born between 1981 and 1996 – are more likely to maintain joint accounts than their older cohorts, a 2014 td bank survey of 1,000 americans who were either married or living together, found. only 70% of millennial couples waited until marriage to start a joint account versus 88% of couples 55 and older. men were 38% more likely than woman to cite convenience as a reason for separate accounts. other reasons included independence (38%) and funds for emergency spending (20%).\n\nread: how much should you spend on an engagement ring?\n\nthere are extremes, of course. i recently received a letter from a brother who was concerned about his sister's financial arrangements. in this particularly tricky situation, she did not work and her husband kept the family finances locked behind a door (and passwords). she had no idea what her husband was investing in or how he was spending the family's money. the letter writer was particularly concerned because they had already refinanced their home several times. he may not have been the next bernie madoff, but i did call out his behavior as weird.\n\nlisten: frances stroh — memoir of a brewery heiress (and subscribe to the money, markets and more podcast on itunes)\n\nthere are arguments for and against joint accounts. those in favor say couples have one less thing to fight about. while operating a joint account won't stop arguments, it encourages less penny-pinching and creates more transparency. it also reaffirms that you are a team and in this relationship for the long haul, not just shacking up together. on the other hand, separate accounts might discourage co-dependence in a relationship. the td america survey found that 42% of couples have both: household accounts and (i'm going to call them) mad money accounts for other fun stuff.\n\ntell your husband that you should pool your resources. there's no reason you should have to ask for money when you are short, or sit on the sidelines while he lives the high life. you're his wife, not his child-minder or his housekeeper.\n\nalso see: don't make this mistake when a guest in someone's home\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.\n\n(this story was republished.)
gig workers and labor unions on thursday continued their challenge to california's proposition 22, filing a lawsuit in a lower court as urged by the state supreme court, which last week rejected a request for an expedited review of the case.\n\nthe plaintiffs, who filed the lawsuit in january, say the measure, which 58% of the state's voters passed in november and exempts companies like uber technologies inc. and lyft inc. from a law that would require them to treat their drivers as employees, is unconstitutional.\n\namong other things, they say prop. 22 precludes gig workers' inclusion in the workers' comp system and keeps them from collective bargaining.\n\nbecause the legislature has 'plenary power, unlimited by any provision of this constitution' to address workers' compensation, including occupational safety,\n\nan initiative statute cannot limit the legislature's authority in this area, the lawsuit, which they filed in alameda county superior court, states.\n\nthe lawsuit also says prop. 22 is too broad because ballot measures are supposed to focus on only one issue: [it] also attempts to impose other restrictions that are not substantively addressed in the measure.\n\nsee: lawsuit seeks to throw out california measure that protects 'gig economy' business model\n\nthe plaintiffs include the seiu california and the national seiu, individual drivers and a ride-hailing customer.\n\ni'm joining together with my fellow ride-share drivers to continue our fight against prop. 22 because we know that in a democracy, corporations shouldn't get the final say in determining our laws, said saori okawa, one of the plaintiffs, in a statement.\n\nin a news release, the plaintiffs mentioned other constitutional challenges to state ballot measures and acknowledged that those efforts took a long time.\n\nin the case of prop. 187 — which denied undocumented immigrants access to basic education and healthcare — it took nearly five years, multiple appeals, the end of gov. pete wilson's administration and the passage of federal legislation for the initiative to be struck down, the plaintiffs said. it took almost seven years for prop. 8 — which denied marriage equality to same-sex couples — to make its way to the united states supreme court, where it was struck down in 2015.
dear quentin,\n\ni don't know where to start. so i will start at the beginning. i met a man at a friend's wedding a few years ago. he was charming in that british-man-in-america sort of way (hugh grant has a lot to answer for), he told jokes (perhaps too many jokes, in retrospect) and made me laugh (at first). he was the life of the party, with a wide circle of friends, and everyone seemed to love him.\n\nhe also had a very lavish, conspicuous lifestyle: he had a house upstate where he entertained his friends at weekends, he sailed in the summer, and he was regularly photographed at charity events on both sides of the atlantic. he posted photos of himself on facebook at royal ascot for several years (before the coronavirus pandemic). he seemed like the most popular guy in the world.\n\n 'the first six months were good, the next three years? there are three topics: my husband, his business and his family.' \n\nhe was a generous man and financially stable, or so i thought. of course, his success and ease with which he seemed to navigate the world made him attractive to me, but i fell in love with him, and when he proposed, i said yes.\n\nthe first six months were good. the next three years? let's just say there are three topics of conversation: my husband, his failing business and his terrible family. the pandemic hurt the already shaky family firm.\n\nas his financial troubles worsened over the course of our marriage, he became short-tempered. i attributed that to the stress he was under. he actually shared this business with two brothers, so his expense account and champagne lifestyle were being funded by his family as much as actual profit. in fact, it soon became clear that he was neither the brain nor the brawn of the operation.\n\nour life has descended into stress and instability. his flashes of anger appear with increasing frequency, as do his allegations that i am a gold digger, which conveniently cast me as a villain deserving of no respect. for the record, i always work and pay my own way. (six months ago, he pushed me and i fell backwards over the arm of a sofa. fortunately, it broke my fall.)\n\ni have no idea who this man is. his friends, as much as one could call them that, deserted him a couple of years ago when the expense account ran out. he ridicules me, holds over my head the fact that i wanted a child (i'm 38), and did not hide his disgust last year at the birthday gift i got him (a photo album of our courtship, in addition to a dinner and silver cufflinks).\n\ni'm exhausted. there is only one person in the world who matters, and it's him. some days he's up and friendly, usually when we are on zoom calls with family and (my) friends, but when that camera is off, you better watch out. i'm living with a stranger. i have no clue what will happen next. his birthday is coming up in march, and i am dreading choosing a gift for him after last year.\n\nwhat would you get him for this birthday? any other suggestions about what i should do?\n\ntrapped & exhausted\n\ndear trapped & exhausted,\n\na ticket to london, england. one way.\n\nbut your situation is quite different from my hypothetical one. i'm not sure it's possible to know who you married if he doesn't know who he is himself. hugh grant has actually come into his own playing villains and rogues (jeremy thorpe in a very british scandal on netflix nflx, +0.08% , phoenix buchanan in paddington 2 and jonathan fraser in the undoing on hbo).\n\nin each role, he was playing a man with many faces, but was not who others believed him to be in either role, and i'm not sure thorpe, a real-life british politician; fraser, a fictional character who may or may not be a murderer; and buchanan, a cartoon villain of many disguises, knew who they were either. in fact, they each went to great lengths to present many saintly faces to the world.\n\ni suspect the same is true for your husband. is he an amusing, camera-ready socialite and life-of-the-party and risk-taking business mogul by day, and a bumbling, scowling ne'er-do-well and black sheep of his family by night? if he doesn't know who he is, and where his own values lie — and value lies — i can't blame you for not knowing. rule no. 1: don't blame yourself.\n\ni do not believe you are a gold digger, but i do believe that you bought into whatever it was he was selling to the world: a debonair, bicontinental bon vivant who had not a care in the world and who got by on chutzpah, smarts (let's assume), likability and talent for navigating high society. that's natural. we tend to believe who people say they are, unless we have reason to doubt them.\n\nfor every jeffrey epstein or robert maxwell, there are a thousand phoenix buchanans. everything and nothing in life is about money. a child is not a bargaining chip. a marriage certificate or property deed is not a life sentence. a birthday present is not a time bomb. presenting oneself as a success on social media is not real life. it is the 21st-century version of buchanan's act at the village fête.\n\nwhen domestic violence or emotional abuse rear their head, the fear persists. that's why domestic abuse includes coercion, threats, stalking, intimidation, isolation, degradation and control. once is enough for a physical altercation or force. when will it happen again? today? tonight? tomorrow? any moment now? close your eyes. imagine your dream life. and choose that.\n\nthe door is waiting for you, if you choose to walk through it.\n\nare you experiencing domestic violence or coercive control? call the national domestic violence hotlineat 1-800-799-safe (7233) or visit thehotline.org.freefrom works to establish financial security for domestic-violence survivors, and the national coalition against domestic violence supports efforts to change conditions that lead to domestic violence and coercive control. you can also learn about creating a personalized safety plan here.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nalso see: 'we've seen an alarming spike in domestic violence reports:' for some women, it's not safe to leave the house or stay home\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch. by submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
dear moneyist,\n\nabout two years ago, i received inheritance from my father. he had not spoken to me in 40 years and i had no idea i would be included. i had a house with a small mortgage left to pay off and had been saving as best i could for retirement in california with a less-than-stellar job. the inheritance changed everything.\n\nmy parents were lutherans and had gone through the great depression. we had raised all our own food — my father was the son of a farmer, not a farmer himself — and we made our own clothes. this upbringing served me well and i was able to survive and be a single mother to my two sons.\n\n my parents were lutherans and had gone through the great depression. this upbringing served me well and i was able to survive and be a single mother to my two sons. \n\nwhen the wife of my younger son found out about the inheritance, she thought i should help them. i was not against it. i received enough money from my father and i am a frugal person. they have two teenaged sons and because she has never worked in the whole of their marriage it was difficult for them to even think about buying a house.\n\ni flew to nevada from my home in california, where i fully funded a joint bank account with my son, and he used that to purchase a house in his name only. but then i realized that i would have to be accountable to the irs to prove that this was a loan, not a gift. i took that to mean that if for some reason he couldn't pay or didn't pay.\n\nrecommended:my friend owes me thousands of dollars and wants cash instead of a wedding gift — should i write off part of the loan?\n\ni thought about it, looked into irs questions, and decided that i would just gift them the house. i still have over $1 million left between my dad's inheritance and the money i saved. my house in the san francisco bay area is valued on zillow z, -2.88% for over $800,000 and will be paid off in the next couple of years.\n\n my daughter-in-law wants to divorce my son, wants half the proceeds from the sale of the house i bought him and told me my son was a monster. she said my other son was a creep. \n\nmy daughter-in-law made no contact after the house was bought (july 2018) until january 2019 when she sent an email, saying my son was a monster, my other son was a creep, and i was just a sinner that had produced bad sons. my son said she wants a divorce and wants to split the proceeds from the sale of the house.\n\nthis was not what i wanted to do with my father's money. she's never even paid bills before so i don't imagine it would last her for very long. her other idea was my son could move out and she would continue to live in the house and have my son support her and the boys.\n\nthe house was titled in his name only. in january, my son and i signed a quit claim transferring the title to me; 100% of the purchase price came from me and i have the bank records to prove it. they have been together for a long time, but only married for about 5 years. my son wants to take care of his boys and, strangely enough, his wife.\n\n the house was originally titled in my son's name only. in january, my son and i signed a quit claim transferring the title to me. will i have trouble over this transaction in the future? \n\nhis wife thinks they should wrap their marriage up this summer. my son has not told her about the property transfer. she wasn't interested in any of the details and didn't put her name on the title when she had the chance. it goes along with her idea that she is the benefactor of this family, rather than a contributor.\n\nmy question is whether i'll have trouble over this in the future. all the discussions about the house were between me and my son. i figured i had until april 2019 when i filed my 2018 taxes to characterize the transaction. we went through a number of options: family loan, gift, and then me retaining possession of the property.\n\ni just wanted to share my good fortune with my son and his family. my boys and i went through some hard times and housing insecurity was always looming over our heads. somehow, we made it and i just wanted to make life easier for them. it seems unbelievable that she just wants to funnel it to herself, not her family.\n\ngrandma trying to make a difference\n\ndear grandma,\n\nyou tried to do the right thing, and i understand that you love your family.\n\nnevada is a community property state, and anything your son acquires during the marriage is marital property. if your son owned his own home outright and renovated it using money from their own funds, it would turn that home into community property. there are exceptions to that. in this case, the home was a gift from you. in nevada, it is separate property if it was acquired during the marriage as a gift, by inheritance, or as an award of damages for personal injury, according to the las vegas defense group.\n\n housing insecurity keeps low-income families locked in an endless cycle of poverty, and has so many other emotional and financial ramifications. it can cause depression among parents. \n\ntake heart. whatever happens you will have achieved that. all things considered, your grandchildren will, i assume, eventually inherit this home from their parents when they die, and your investment will have been worth it. fortunately, you were wise not to put the house in both your son and daughter-in-law's name. housing insecurity is one of the most difficult things for any family to deal with, and you helped to bring more financial stability to the lives of your grandchildren.\n\nhousing insecurity keeps low-income families locked in an endless cycle of poverty, and has so many other emotional and financial ramifications. research shows that eviction can have enduring effects on families' ability to obtain basic necessities (for example, food, clothing and medicine) and can cause depression among mothers, and a strong body of evidence links inadequate housing and homelessness to child abuse and neglect, according to the urban institute.\n\nthis will also help your grandchildren in the long run. stable housing also prevents students who don't have wealthy parents from graduating from college, and can lead to absenteeism and low test scores. it is one of the most stressful things to deal with in life. some 36% of survey respondents at four-year schools said they faced housing insecurity, including struggling to pay their full rent or utility bills. at community colleges, roughly 46% of students were housing insecure.\n\nalso see:i'm 65, my mortgage is paid off and i have $370,000 in savings, so why i am still worried about money?\n\nmake sure you consult a lawyer when you are dealing with such large sums of money in future. it's nice that your son wants to take care of the mother of his children. you have raised him well.\n\nalso see:my fiancé's father is custodian of his ira — how can i get him to relinquish control?\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

dear quentin,\n\ni am planning on marrying someone who has a substantial amount of money. i do not have much. i own my home, have a military retirement and work part time. i want a prenuptial agreement and she does as well. we don't, nor will we, have children.\n\nso what is the issue? i do not want spousal support. if we were to separate, i only want to maintain my full military benefits and the difference between my personal savings (at the time of divorce) and $50,000. so if i had $45,000 saved, she would only pay $5,000.\n\ni have worked very hard for everything i have. i take pride in the fact that i've overcome a lot of adversity to be where i am now, and i'm happy with my finances. she wants me to have a standard-of-living payment. i want my morality intact, should we divorce.\n\ni think what i'm asking for is totally reasonable. but perhaps it isn't?\n\nany advice?\n\nproud & practical\n\ndear proud,\n\nwhile i take off my hat to you for being realistic and practical enough to plan ahead, you may both feel differently if you do decide to divorce. you are both acting out of love and pride. divorces are more often than not tumultuous and costly. prenuptial agreements, while not perfect, also reflect the state of mind you are in prior to marriage: practical, magnanimous, cautious, optimistic. in this context, fairness is the goal rather than the outcome. like love, fairness in the eyes of the beholder.\n\n 'fairness is the goal rather than the outcome. like love, fairness in the eyes of the beholder.'  — the moneyist\n\na prenup should have both parties represented by separate lawyers and it is vital to make sure there is a complete and full disclosure of liabilities and assets and the marriage is being entered into between two consenting adults, according to the canterbury law group. the agreement needs to be fair when it is signed and the enforcement should be fair as well, regardless of whether it is five years down the line or decades later. these are all primary aspects of a good and healthy prenup.\n\nthe law firm also warns: some unfair features can include when both parties have to pay their own fees for legal fees during a divorce. equal divisions of assets obtained in marriage when individual states often have different rules governing the allocation of assets, especially regarding property. sometimes, agreements state one party will receive a set income in the case of a divorce which decades later can be wholly inadequate because of inflation and the shifting cost of living.\n\nwithout a prenuptial agreement, your fiancée could certainly scale back in a dramatic fashion on her current magnanimous standard-of-living costs proposal. you, meanwhile, might feel traumatized by the financial reversal of fortune in the aftermath of a divorce and realize that $50,000 is not that much money after all. time, experience and a marriage gone awry can turn your lives — and your perspective on who deserves what — upside down.\n\nyou're both right. there is no wrong answer. perhaps agree to revisit the agreement after five years of marriage in case either of you wishes to make an amendment. you can't force each other to change the terms of a prenup. otherwise, it would defeat the purpose of signing one in the first place. however, it may help open up that conversation should there need to be one in the future, and also take the pressure off both of you now ahead of your big day.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nthe moneyist: when my parents died, my sisters and i split their estate. i chose a painting that may be worth $50,000. should i tell them?

it pays to be kind.\n\none of the secrets to being happy in a relationship is finding a kind person, according to recent research from michigan state university, which examined the personality traits of more than 2,500 heterosexual couples who have been married roughly 20 years.\n\nspecifically, the researchers found that a partner who is two things — conscientious and agreeable — leads to higher relationship satisfaction. being conscientious speaks to a general awareness of being a good partner and responsible--remembering their birthday, doing things they ask, and making an effort to enrich and sustain a relationship, bill chopik, associate professor of psychology and director of msu's close relationships lab, told marketwatch.\n\nas for agreeableness, it speaks to kindness that you can display to your partner. agreeable people are less aggressive and more considerate of partners. as a result, their partners are happy with those who are kinder, he adds.\n\nmeanwhile, people with partners who are neurotic and more extroverted have lower relationship satisfaction. highly neurotic people make mountains of molehills--making any fights or relationship problems much worse than they can be (or can even create new ones). partners of neurotic people are always on edge and that doesn't translate to a good relationship, he explains.\n\n people may want to ask, 'are they a nice person?' 'do they have a lot of anxiety?' those things matter way more than the fact that two people are introverts and end up together.  — - bill chopik, director of msu's close relationships lab\n\nchopik says they're not entirely sure about why extraversion predicted relationship satisfaction but added that its effect was small. the researchers gave the participants a 15-item personality test to determine personality traits, and determined relationship satisfaction by asking participants this question: how satisfied are you with your marriage or romantic relationship? they also measured life satisfaction and affect.\n\nthe researchers also found that having a similar personality to your partner did not predict relationship contentment. i think the fact that similar couples weren't happier was among the more shocking findings--i think everyone thinks they should find someone similar to them (and dating companies certainly profit off the idea), chopik says.\n\npeople invest a lot in finding someone who's compatible, but our research says that may not be the end all be all, chopik said in a statement. instead, people may want to ask, 'are they a nice person?' 'do they have a lot of anxiety?' those things matter way more than the fact that two people are introverts and end up together, chopik added.\n\n\n\nthese findings could save you time — and money. single people spend an average of $146 per month on dating, a survey of more than 1,000 people from giftcards.com last year found. those in relationships drop $139 per month. and data from match.com found that the average unmarried person in the u.s. spent $1,596 on dating in 2016.\n\nthe good news: many of us — particularly women — know to look for kindness in a partner. a 2016 survey from dating site elite singles found that 81% of women and 62% of men said kindness was a very important trait in a partner.\n\nand there are plenty of other reasons to be kind besides a quality relationship: people who are kind are slightly happier than those who aren't, a meta-analysis of 21 studies revealed. and being kind may also improve your health.\n\nthis story was originally published in february 2019 and has been updated.
the $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid package making its way through congress is set to be the venue for a new debate between democrats and republicans — how best to get more money to families with children.\n\ndemocratic taxwriters in the house unveiled their plan late monday, ahead of an expected markup session later in the week of their portion of a bill that would go to the senate and be immune to the 60-vote filibuster requirement.\n\nthe pandemic is driving families deeper and deeper into poverty, and it's devastating. we are making the child tax credit more generous, more accessible, and by paying it out monthly, this money is going to be the difference in a roof over someone's head or food on their table, said rep. richard neal, a democrat from massachusetts.\n\nunder draft legislative language obtained by marketwatch.com, the democrats' plan would boost the $1,000 child tax credit currently in law for one year up to $3,000, or $3,600 in the case of families with children below 6 years old.\n\nthe credit would be refundable — meaning that if a family's tax bill was bigger than the credit, they would still be eligible to receive it. the credit would begin to phase out at income levels of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples.\n\nthe liberal economic security project praised the plan, saying, monthly direct payments are the quickest and most effective way to get help to families who need it.\n\nthe democratic proposal was unveiled only days after sen. mitt romney, a utah republican, released his own proposal, which would also give money to families with children but instead use the social security administration to cut the checks, not the internal revenue service.\n\nunder romney's proposal — which, unlike the democrats' plan, would be a permanent program — families would be eligible to receive a monthly benefit, starting during pregnancy. for children 5 and younger, the benefit would be $350 a month. from the ages of 6 to 17, the benefit would shrink to $250 a month.\n\nromney would offset the costs of his plan with a combination of cuts elsewhere in the budget. they would include eliminating the state and local taxes deduction, which was limited in the 2017 tax cut bill and republicans say benefits the wealthy most. other cuts would eliminate the temporary assistance to needy families government assistance program, the head of household tax status, and the existing child and dependent care tax credit.\n\namerican families are facing greater financial strain, worsened by the covid-19 pandemic, and marriage and birth rates are at an all-time low. on top of that, we have not comprehensively reformed our family support system in nearly three decades, and our changing economy has left millions of families behind, romney said thursday.\n\nnow is the time to renew our commitment to families to help them meet the challenges they face as they take on most important work any of us will ever do — raising our society's children.\n\nliam donovan, a principal with bracewell llp's policy resolution group in washington, said the fact the democrats led their aid package rollout this week with details of the child tax credit boost shows they're serious about it, and its chances for inclusion in a final package are good.\n\nit's a longstanding priority, he said. in terms of the interplay with romney, i think it's almost kind of incidental, but in terms of their intentions here, they seem pretty clear this is a high priority.\n\nwhile the democratic plan as proposed is temporary, history has demonstrated lawmakers' willingness to extend popular temporary tax breaks when they are set to expire. that could make the proposal, for which the democrats did not specify any offsetting cuts or revenue increases elsewhere, one of a group of provisions called tax extenders that are routinely given new life on an annual or biennial basis.\n\ndonovan said that including the idea in the coronavirus bill and passing the bill through the budget reconciliation process, which means it can't be blocked by republicans in the senate, shows how the tax code will reflect the political polarization of the times.\n\nso long as the only route to major legislation is through reconciliation, i think the tax code is going bear all the hallmarks of what it takes to get something done through reconciliation. it's going to make it more complicated, but that's just the nature of the beast at this political moment, he said.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy wife and i have been married for 18 years and met at work in 2000. she is college educated and has worked her entire life with the exception of a few years off when our kids were very young.\n\nfor the past 13 years of our marriage my wife has worked for the same employer, and in my opinion, it is an abusive and opportunistic relationship. the company simply does not value her and is taking advantage of her good will.\n\ni have good reason to believe that they are making a healthy margin contracting her out to government projects.\n\neach year, her company has a sob story about why raises will not be given or will be so small (1% or 1.5%). each year, she says to me, they can't afford to pay me more. in inflation-adjusted dollars, she makes less now than she did when she started.\n\nthe moneyist:my ex-husband put his new wife on his life-insurance policy before he died, going against our divorce decree. now she's battling me in court\n\nher employer has furloughed her multiple times over the past 13 years to suit its lack of proper contract management. she stays year after year out of fear, and a form of stockholm syndrome.\n\ni just received her 2020 w-2, and she made $25,000 last year given her low pay rate and lack of hours. why would a college-educated professional with 13 years at her current employer continue to work for this amount of money?\n\ni do comparatively well, so she has the luxury of telling her employer to stuff it and finding literally any other job she wants. i asked her to look beyond her job and possibly her profession, and she said, what do you suggest given that money is not at issue for us as a couple?\n\ni feel like she has joined some abusive cult. she needs to look for a new job. but i fear she is unmotivated to improve our financial situation, and will just stay with her abusive employer out of fear. what should i do?\n\nconcerned husband\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here\n\ndear husband,\n\nyou don't say what your wife does for a living, but $25,000 a year is more than $10,000 below the median annual salary in the u.s. her employer has, more often than not, given her an annual pay increase that does not even keep up with inflation. i can see how this would take a toll on her self-esteem — and, if this job does give her a sense of self-worth and identity, how she might cling to it, fearing that she would not find another job elsewhere.\n\nbeyond your and your wife's own relationship and psychology, there are issues here that are bigger than both of you, but not insurmountable. women make an average of 80 cents on a man's dollar; women of color often make even less. the more people who share their salaries at work, the more empowered employees will be. a culture of sexism persists. female managers, for instance, are not only underrepresented in tech companies, they're paid significantly less than men.\n\nin a poll of 1,200 people released last month, more men (81%) than women (75%) said they would rather negotiate for a higher amount and settle for a number in the middle than ask for nothing. more women (57%) than men (51%) say they have never negotiated their pay. and more men (66%) than women (60%) say they would leave their role to find an equivalent position at a different company just to make a salary jump that they won't get if they stayed at their current company.\n\nthe moneyist:when my parents died, my sisters and i split their estate. i chose a painting that may be worth $50,000. should i tell them?\n\non the other hand, you don't say what it is your wife actually does, whether she enjoys her work and finds it fulfilling, and whether she likes the people. i wonder if this is something of a hobby job for her, or somewhere she likes to go every morning, something that gives her structure and a sense of purpose. it may be that — given that you are financially comfortable and your wife does not need to work — she enjoys her independence and looks forward to going to work every day.\n\nwithout more information, it would be better for you to ask questions of your wife: do you like this job? does it make you happy? if so, do you care about the stagnant salary? if it does not make you happy, why don't you want to ask for more money or leave? what are you afraid will happen? what do you have to lose? you could even role play to test-drive these conversations, each playing her employer and, looking ahead, each playing a job interviewer for a future position.\n\nyou never once mentioned that she is unhappy. why is it important for you that your wife changes jobs, assuming she doesn't mind the one she currently has? i suggest you address these questions in counseling together. even if she does enjoy this work, i agree that she could and should push for more money. it's a good fear barrier for her to overcome, and advocating for herself while divorcing herself emotionally from whatever response may come is also good practice.\n\nhow does your wife see herself in the world? and what does she think her employer sees in her? and what do you see in each other? who is she without her job, and how does she feel about herself when she goes to work? these are questions we should all ask ourselves from time to time. the world is not bigger than our job that inhabits it. the answers to those questions may provide more than just the key to your wife's salary negotiations. that, at least, would be the hope.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com

on the struggles of america's working class and the rise of donald trump, the number crunchers often get confused.\n\nthey'll say there's no crisis of economic mobility. they'll say there's no stagnation of wages among blue-collar workers. and, in the realm of politics, they'll say that donald trump's base, while reacting to his proclamation that the american dream was dead, had no legitimate grievances.\n\nthat's because the number crunchers too often see individuals in too abstract a context, as rows or cells on a spreadsheet, to be sorted by individual traits such as age, sex, or income. they fail to see people as they actually live: in places, as members of a community with a particular location on our globe.\n\nit's the fatal abstraction.\n\nonce we look at people in places, we see a much more complicated picture.\n\nwe see that many parts of america have incredible economic mobility, but many regions are dreadful on that score.\n\nwe see that the places most affected by trade with china have seen serious wage drops and unemployment spikes for blue-collar men, and plenty of worse consequences that follow. **and we see that, even if donald trump's earliest supporters were doing fine on paper, they were living in places that were not doing fine.**\n\nstart with how trade affects certain places in america.\n\nthe free-market story of free trade says that all involved nations benefit when they reduce trade barriers between them. this is true. the united states economy, as a whole, is richer thanks to freer trade—by one estimate our economy made an extra $2 trillion from trade liberalization since the 1950s.\n\nbut free trade was always going to produce some losers. in the u.s., low-skilled workers in manufacturing suffer, because that manufacturing shifts to cheaper overseas locales. the lower prices of goods, though, free up consumer money to spend on new goods or services, to be produced, presumably, by the ex-factory workers, even if at a slightly lower wage.\n\n'never gonna be anything here'\n\nvisit the monongahela valley where the wheeling-pittsburgh steel factory used to operate, though, and you'll see things didn't work out that way.\n\nmain street in fayette city is crumbling. andrew duda sr. used to work at the steel mill. he was at vargo's newsstand, practically the only business open on main street when i visited in 2016.\n\njust drive down through the river roads, his son, andrew duda jr., said, from here through monessen… it's all shut down.\n\nareas like this, the clerk at vargo's piped in, there's never gonna be anything here.\n\nthe senior duda, an old union guy, used to be a democrat, but in 2016, he was fully behind trump. when trump talks about the trade deals, he's a hundred percent right. that nafta—that was the worst thing.\n\neven before nafta and china's entry into the world trade organization, international competition helped kill the wheeling-pittsburgh plant and countless others. the result wasn't merely lower wages in the mon valley. it was economic and social devastation, including high unemployment, more men on disability, more drug abuse, and even more babies out of wedlock.\n\ntrade shocks hit some places hard\n\neconomist david autor of mit, focusing on the later, more dramatic trade shock caused by china, found: rather than modestly reducing wage levels among low-skill workers nationally, these shocks catalyze significant falls in employment rates within trade-impacted local labor markets.\n\nautor has also found that the places in america exposed to competition with chinese manufacturing also saw more deaths, more men on disability, and less marriage.\n\nthat is, the u.s. economy got cheaper goods, and some factory towns got destroyed.\n\neconomist raj chetty has produced very different studies with a very similar theme: where you live dramatically effects how you end up. places themselves have causal impacts, is how economist melissa kearney summed it up.\n\neconomic mobility is not really decreasing in america, most of the numbers show. some economists hold this up as evidence that the working class and poor aren't really stuck. but chetty dug into the numbers on a local level and found very uneven levels of opportunity and mobility.\n\namerica may still be the land of opportunity, he found, but it's really many lands of opportunity and many other lands of hopelessness. chetty writes: intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the u.s.\n\na kid born into the bottom quintile in salt lake city has an excellent chance (one in ten) of reaching the top quintile. that same kid, born in charlotte, has only a 4.4% chance.\n\nfamilies and communities matter\n\nwhat distinguishes the places with the best mobility from those with the worst? school spending or progressive taxation don't make much of a difference, the data suggests. the two biggest factors are the percentage of kids raised by intact families and the area's score on measures of social capital—civic participation, number of churches, amount of volunteering, and so on.\n\nthat is, places with strong communities and strong families provide the most opportunity.\n\nfinally, there's the question of trump. my new book, alienated america explores why people believe the american dream is dead, and how that belief contributed to trump's instant explosion onto the political scene in mid-2015.\n\ndifferent studies of trump's core voters turned up different results. we found little evidence to suggest individual economic distress benefited trump, one typical study proclaimed. one study at vox.com explained that science disproved the common sentiment that poor white americans came out in droves to put trump over the top in 2016.\n\nbut a different study, published at fivethirtyeight, found trump significantly outperformed romney in counties where residents had lower credit scores and in counties where more men have stopped working.\n\nthe same researcher found,  more subprime loans? more trump support. more residents receiving disability payments? more trump support. lower earnings among full-time workers? more trump support.\n\nplenty others found the same thing. so how to explain the difference between the studies that found economic woe behind trump's win, and those that found nothing of the sort?\n\nthe studies that denied the connection between economic woe and trump were studies of individuals. the studies that saw that connection were studies of places.\n\nit can be easy, if you live in a well-connected community in a thriving locality—as so many of our academics, commentators, and politicians do—and if you only study the topline aggregate data to miss what's going on beneath the surface and on the other side of the tracks.\n\nthe true story of america today is that we are a great country, with many struggling places.
dear quentin,\n\nmy son, 35, has been married for three years and has one child. he recently came to me with what i consider to be a stunningly unusual dilemma.\n\nhe wanted my counsel on the idea of a second child, something he desires greatly he was married in 2017, and the first child was born in 2019.\n\nit turns out that his wife, 35, is very reluctant — not to have another child, as she claims, but to bear another child. she says she would agree to surrogacy at a cost exceeding $200,000. she claims this is her right, as a feminist, and that she is entitled to control what happens with her body.\n\nat this point, i was at a total loss. it's something i can't even imagine physically, emotionally, socially, or financially.\n\n this does not seem to be a good use of money for a healthy couple who have not had trouble conceiving. \n\nthis does not seem to be a good use of money for a healthy couple who have not had trouble conceiving, and seems to indicate a significant lack of judgment and sensitivity.\n\nmy son inherited a decent amount of money at 30 (about $1 million), an amount that once might have sounded like a lot, but what is now basically the ability to purchase a house and fund education for children.\n\nin our family, we have always adhered as closely as possible to the rule never dip into capital.\n\nyet he has already dipped into capital by covering his wife's $250,000 in college and credit-card debt before they were even married — a pretty heroic rescue!\n\nafter the fact, i was shocked to learn that she had received a full scholarship to a perfectly good university (tuition, room and board), but turned it down in favor of nyu, with zero financial aid. she had no particular plan for repaying this debt — in fact, her initial ambition following college was to be a yoga instructor.\n\nnot surprisingly, that did not pan out terribly well. they now live near san francisco, where both are employed in tech-ish jobs — my son is a data scientist, and my daughter-in-law has a job involving social media.\n\ntheir compensation is decent — hers possibly much as $100,000, his maybe $130,000 — but not spectacular, certainly not in expensive northern california. i'm fairly sure my son's job (at an established company) has a better future than hers (at a startup that is teetering due to covid-19).\n\n on top of this, my daughter-in-law's parents are indigent, unemployable and completely dependent upon them. \n\non top of this, my daughter-in-law's parents are indigent, unemployable and completely dependent upon them. as of now, they are living with them and providing daily child care for their daughter — better than paying both a nanny and the parents' expenses in a separate domicile, but a tough situation in a small apartment. the parents are only in their late 50s.\n\nbut wait, there's more. my daughter-in-law is objecting to my son's desire to obtain a postnuptial agreement, designed to segregate what is left of his inheritance from marital assets; in fact, she has indicated that she will only feel they are true partners if he allows her to share equally in his assets.\n\nso far, my son has resisted, and seems determined to hold the line on this; she has reluctantly agreed, but has yet to see a lawyer. i'm not optimistic that a lawyer will be helpful in this case. but my understanding is that in california, assets brought into a marriage are excluded in a divorce settlement, particularly in a short-term marriage.\n\nfinally, she is very determined to buy an expensive house, which to me seems like an end run around the postnup, as once that capital goes into a home purchase, it becomes a marital asset.\n\ndespite this history, which makes her sound like an unrelenting gold digger, she is a nice person who loves and cares for her daughter and, i hope, my son. she just seems to have an astonishingly casual attitude toward money — if it's there, spend it! (or, in the case of college, even if it's not there.)\n\ni realize that there are all kinds of problems here, not just the cockamamie surrogacy one, but i would appreciate your perspective and wisdom on the tricky financial intricacies.\n\nsincerely,\n\nconcerned mother-in-law\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear concerned,\n\nthe gods will judge us for the choices we make. they will also judge us for judging others for the choices they make. the best way forward is to think carefully about the former, and do as little as possible of the latter.\n\nwith that in mind, let's assume that her parents are good people, and that your son and daughter-in-law are happy to help her parents, unless we have any other reason to suspect otherwise. child care can cost up to $22,000 a year in san francisco, so it's also a blessing to have them to help take care of their child while they are at work. multigenerational households are not unusual in many cultures. working at a startup can be lucrative, and having studied at a prestigious university can open doors, whether it's through smoke and mirrors or not.\n\ni agree with the first part of your daughter-in-law's position. it's her body and her choice. whether or not she considers herself a feminist, she and she alone gets to choose whether or not she wants to bear another child. all people should have agency over their own bodies, despite constant interference in this most basic of civil rights. one thing i know for sure: childbirth and reproductive rights and finances are not two separate issues that exist in isolation of each other. they are not. the cost of surrogacy can range from $90,000 to $130,000 in california, and much less in other states.\n\n if your worst fears are realized about their gulf in priorities, the bounds of this marriage will be tested to breaking point. \n\nand so to your son. he too has a choice to make on how to spend his inheritance, or not. i understand that his wife may wish to explore the financial requirements of surrogacy, but inheritance is deemed separate rather than marital property for a reason. this is money that the bequeather wished your son to have and use as he sees fit. if his inheritance is seen as a jar on the mantel that can be dipped into at will, it will soon fritter away to nothing. if your daughter-in-law's financial requests are part of a larger pattern, of course it worries me that your son's inheritance may drained at the request.\n\nultimately, it's a much bigger conversation than surrogacy or even your daughter-in-law's student debt. and that too is where my concern lies. your daughter-in-law must weigh up the pros and cons of having a child by surrogacy, assuming your son agrees to pay for it, with the pros and cons of having another child at all. your son must balance his desire for a second child with the cost of surrogacy. we can't answer those questions for them. if your worst fears are realized about their gulf in priorities, the bounds of this marriage will be tested to the breaking point.\n\nmaintaining his $1 million as separate property, given the highly emotive issue they are grappling with, seems like a wise and fair move to me. your son may say, your body, your choice. my inheritance, my choice. sometimes, such directness and bluntness is required. it's not a pretty or easy conversation, whatever way you decide to embark upon it. but it's better that they both draw lines in the sand now — without apology — on how far they are willing to compromise, and what their expectations and plans are for how they see their family and finances moving forward.\n\ndelaying such conversations rarely leads to a better result.\n\nthe moneyist:when my parents died, my sisters and i split their estate. i chose a painting that may be worth $50,000. should i tell them?
after nearly a week of trade-talk booya, they're finally getting down to business in beijing.\n\nand potus's market-pleasing deadline squashiness may hinge a lot on how the next couple of days go between china vice premier liu he, u.s. trade rep. lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin:\n\nno pressure guys, but investors seem to have a lot riding on the trade-optimism. we've seen fresh highs 2019 for wall street, and the s&p 500 bust above its 200-day moving average and the nasdaq on the cusp of breaking out of bear-market territory as cheery trade headlines float past.\n\ntrouble on the horizon? cracked market's contrarian jani ziedins notes the s&p is fast approaching the upper end of the well-established 2,600 to 2,800 trading range. even under ideal conditions, we would expect the market to pause here. and if the headlines are less than good, that pause could easily turn into waves of profit-taking, he said.\n\nonto our call of the day, from ronald temple, head of u.s. equity and co-head of multiasset at lazard asset management, who worries investors are too sanguine about trade, as he flags another fast-approaching and overlooked deadline for negotiators.\n\nthe upcoming section 232 report related to autos and auto parts is not as well-known as it should be. among the people who are aware of the report, it appears that the consensus is that the report and the consequences thereof will be a non-event, temple said in a recent interview with marketwatch.\n\nin a nutshell, potus directed the commerce department last may to investigate whether to impose 25% tariffs on imported autos and auto parts, and the deadline is fast approaching — sunday, feb. 17.\n\nin the front line of the trade wars, the auto sector sp500.2510, -4.09% is nowhere near highs of last summer and further away from january 2018 highs, though it is up a respectable 15% so far this year. ford f, -5.38% and gm gm, -1.42% are also up, though tesla tsla, -4.39% has had a tougher time. in short, a ruling to lay down the full 25% of tariffs would batter the industry, said karl brauer, executive publisher of cox automotive, in emailed comments.\n\ntotal new cars sales could drop 2 million units, or more than 10%, and the average vehicle price could increase more than $4,400, or approximately 12%, he said, adding that for imported cars, prices would rise closer to $7,000, but then even domestic cars could see over $2,200 added just because of higher costs for imported parts. and then job cuts would hit dealers, supplier and manufacturers.\n\nfor these reasons it's unlikely the administration and congress will implement these tariffs, though it's impossible to know for certain, brauer adds.\n\nlazard's temple says investors should get used trade tensions persisting for years to come with periodic flare ups followed by temporary respites.\n\nand they should steel themselves and stay invested these days, as the market will likely shift from trade to fed worries by midyear, he says.\n\ngiven macro risks, policy risks this is really a good time for people to drill down on individual security level and focus on what they own, said temple, whose firm seeks out so-called compounders — companies that have the ability to sustain returns better than their peer group and have the highest returns on capital across the market.\n\nover time they can compound earnings growth book value capital because they have good competitive advantages, and tend to outperform when the market goes wrong, he says. do your homework and you'll find them in tech, health care, the consumer space and even industrials, said temple.\n\nread:why stocks have gone from record-low correlation to extreme highs since october\n\n\n\nthe market\n\nthe dow djia, -0.39% , s&p 500 spx, -0.16% and nasdaq comp, +0.09% indexes are all moving lower in early action. the dollar dxy, +0.09% is flat, gold us:gcu8 is down and crude us:clu8 is higher.\n\neurope stocks sxxp, +0.88% were mostly up, and asia paused for breath, outside of a 1.1% gain for the kospi 180721, -0.83% .\n\nthe chart\n\nin 2015, billionaire hedge-fund manager ray dalio spoke of eerie similarities between economic events in the 1930s and current ones, warning of a potentially significant selloff in risk assets. the combination of these monetary and fiscal tightening pressures created a significant selloff in risk assets, dalio wrote.\n\nproviding a then-and-now chart of the s&p 500, jesse felder of the popular felder report blog picked up on that analog last summer and found close tracking for the analog. here's that chart:\n\nand here's our chart of the day, where felder updated the above and it's no less unsettling:\n\nso maybe it wasn't just the stock market selloff late last year that inspired the dovish flip-flop on the part of jay powell & co. it could have been just a bad case of déjà vu, says felder on his blog.\n\nread:kicking yourself for missing the recent rally?

tuesday saw the launch of a pair of exchange-traded funds built along biblical values, holding companies that offer christian-themed products or services and excluding the ones that, in the view of the fund managers, don't.\n\nin a prospectus that has already been met with controversy, the fund explicitly bars any company that has any degree of participation in what it describes as the lgbt lifestyle, referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. specifically, it avoids companies that advance the issue of gay marriage, which was approved by the u.s. supreme court in 2015.\n\nwe're meeting a demand from investors with conservative values, and one of the things they want to support is traditional marriage, said robert netzly, chief executive officer of inspire investment, which operates the funds. our investors don't want to be involved with gay marriage.\n\nthat stance puts the funds in stark opposition to many u.s. corporations, which have largely adopted policies that are inclusive for same-sex couples. it also makes it a thematic inverse of sorts to the workplace equality etf us:eqlt, a three-year-old fund that chooses its holdings based on the company's support of lgbt employees and policies.\n\nread:why wall street went for gay marriage\n\nthe fund was developed as a way for lgbt-focused foundations to invest in companies that didn't discriminate on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, for fiduciaries to fulfill their obligation for broad exposure without supporting companies that don't support workplace equality, said john roberts, a portfolio manager at denver investment, which operates the index that the etf tracks.\n\nthe fund is part of the growing trend toward social-based investing, or aligning one's portfolio with their moral point of view. the anti-lgbt fund would also fall under this category, as would the spdr ssga gender diversity index etf she, -1.71% , a fund that only holds companies where women are in senior-level positions.\n\nlike the workplace equality fund, the gender diversity etf was developed for essentially political reasons, as a way to offer investors a convenient instrument for supporting a progressive cause. however, both also claim financial reasons to invest, arguing that their focus results in improved performance.\n\nsee also:morgan stanley wants analysts to look at gender diversity in evaluating companies\n\nthere's a shareholder case for equality, which is a very positive statement and one that no one had previously tried to quantify. causation is a tough thing on wall street, given how many factors can influence a stock, but we think we stumbled on how companies that treat lgbt employees with dignity and respect, the numbers show their returns are better, roberts said. if you treat your employees better, you get a better outcome.\n\naccording to denver investment's data, a company that doesn't have lgbt-friendly policies—such as prohibiting discrimination, extending benefits to same-sex partners, and supporting employee lgbt groups—has a 50% chance of outperforming its sector peers. after that same company adopts such policies, however, the odds go from 50-50 to over 70% likelihood that it will outperform, roberts said. denver's data looks at 20 years of statistics.\n\nthat thesis has been born out in the performance of the fund, which has about $12.9 million in assets. over the past 12 months, it is up 26.5%, above the 21.3% gain of the s&p 500. over the past three years, it has posted annualized gains of 10%, according to factset data, twice the gain of the msci all country world investable markets + frontier index, its chosen benchmark.\n\nwhile the fund offers broad market exposure, it has a bias toward what roberts described as new economy companies, which he said were more likely to offer lgbt-friendly policies. it is overweight on consumer discretionary, finance and technology names, and has less exposure to materials and energy, the latter of which is the worst-performing sector of the year. holdings of the equally weighted fund include apple inc. aapl, -3.26% , tesla inc. tsla, -6.86% , and ameriprise financial inc. amp, +0.33% .\n\nthe workplace equality etf rose 1.5% on wednesday while the inspire global hope large cap etf bles, -1.29% —the biblical values fund—rose 1.1%.\n\nasked about the anti-lgbt criteria of the inspire fund, roberts said, in the end, investors want performance. the fact is that companies that support equality outperform the ones that don't. so if you're going the other way, good luck with that.

dear moneyist,\n\ni am 35 years old and have been happily married for eight years. my husband co-owns the house that we currently live in with his stepmother. originally, we all agreed that if my husband owns the house with his stepmother and helps with our portion of the mortgage, she'd have to start putting her eggs in better places and be more financially responsible. the years living with my stepmother-in-law have been hell to say the least. i don't even remember the amount of times i've cried.\n\nalso read: my fiancee has $90,000 in student loans. should i call off the wedding?\n\nat this point, my stepmother-in-law could no longer afford her part of the mortgage and she hasn't been paying for the past three months. we've been covering her share. we want to sell the house and get our own place and start a family. however, my stepmother-in-law refused to sell or help with the mortgage. we can't afford the mortgage by ourselves for much longer and quite frankly we don't want to keep sustaining her lifestyle as well. she's behind on the mortgage because she's always going out and spending her money on name-brand merchandise.\n\nwhat are our legal options? will there be any repercussions if we move out of the house at the moment? her name is the first name on the house title, if that helps.\n\ndaughter-in-law\n\ndear daughter-in-law,\n\nyou are in a sticky situation. you can't force your stepmother-in-law to sell. and you are both jointly and solely liable to pay the mortgage in order to avoid a default and subsequent hit to your credit rating and, ultimately, the bank repossessing your house. she appears to be a very crafty character if she is spending her money on designer duds. why? because she knows you and your husband will pick up the financial slack and pay her half of the mortgage. of course, you've seen it first-hand so you don't need me to tell you that.\n\nthere are three people in this situation with two separate relationships. your husband may be less willing to get tough with your stepmother-in-law, but if someone is using a familiar relationship as leverage to keep you hostage in your own home how valuable is that relationship to begin with? it also might help that she is a stepmother-in-law. i've answered other letters with similar family financial dysfunction and advised people to take legal action against their own mother, so i'm not about to tell you to stop short of that here.\n\ndon't miss: how should parents divide assets between children and stepchildren?\n\nwithout knowing more specifics or the jurisdiction, it's hard to give iron-clad advice, but take this nugget from a lawyer who specializes in property. a co-owner of real property can bring a partition action against another co-owner to either physically divide the property or to force a sale of the property with the proceeds divided per their respective interests, says julian white, an attorney with greenberg & wilner, a law firm in new york that specializes in helping homebuyers. the fact that your stepmother-in-law has not being paying the mortgage should help.\n\nproperty prices are on the rise, so this is not a bad time to sell. it might help to your stepmother-in-law appreciate that and enlist the help of other family members to help. according to simmel, stimmel & smith, a san francisco-based law firm, not only can your use of the property be drastically altered but you may be forced to sell property at a time that is disastrous for you due to personal events in your life or the state of the market. the right to partition can be waived if the correct agreement is executed.\n\nfamily health: winning against opioid addiction\n\nread also: my dad didn't love me! he only left me $10,000\n\nand, yes, the moneyist facebook group has had plenty to say about this scenario. some members questioned your definition of a happy marriage and believe that your husband should have had your back during the past eight years. i can't imagine how eight years of living with her mother-in-law and having 'cried' is happily married, one member wrote. if she continues to accept this, she will lose everything when he goes bankrupt and the house is repossessed. you can walk away, if your name isn't on the deed, but your husband can't.\n\nthere are other options, of course. another moneyist facebook member advises: you may be able to move out and rent your part of the house to someone else — a roommate or boarder — if you can find such a person. the boarder could cover your portion of the mortgage and you could then move into a rental that you can afford for now. that won't help you with your stepmother-in-law's half of the mortgage, however. another points out something that i missed: are your comments representative of your husband's feelings, too? yikes! i hope for your sake they are.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published?

dear quentin,\n\nmy daughter was a tv starlet in her youth, and thanks to the magic of compound investing, has a large amount of cash on hand (approximately $1 million).\n\nshe wants to take some of this money and make the down payment on a co-op or a condominium. she and her boyfriend would then move in, and split the monthly expenses.\n\n she wants to take some of this money and make the down payment on a co-op or a condominium. she and her boyfriend would then move in, and split the monthly expenses. \n\nif she puts down the entire down payment, they move in, and then split up, i believe she should have clear claim to the asset(s) she brought into their arrangement.\n\nhowever, if he contributed to any part of the mortgage payments, could he claim he contributed to the (increased) value of the property, asking for money if/when it is sold?\n\nand if he were to directly pay her, would that be considered income for her? she would have to add that to her taxes, right? seems like a huge amount of added paperwork!\n\nthey've been a couple for more than 3 years; she still hasn't told him she's rich; apparently, that is too embarrassing for her. i appreciate your input.\n\nthe mother\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear mother,\n\nit's worse to have important conversations about money for the first time during a marriage or, perish the thought, during the heat of a divorce — instead of during the courtship. the earlier this discussion happens about assets and expectations and income and contributions, the better.\n\nif your daughter was a tv star and she's browsing million-dollar listings — whether or not they have had many of the conversations they ought to have ahead of a property purchase — it's safe to assume that her boyfriend knows more about her finances than she might believe.\n\nlet's say they live in california, a community property state: anything they bring into the marriage, assuming they get hitched, they take with them in the event they divorce. other community property states are arizona, idaho, louisiana, nevada, new mexico, texas, washington and wisconsin.\n\nyour daughter could classify any payments her boyfriend makes as rent and, yes, she would declare that on her taxes. again, the extra paperwork — filling in forms online — is small potatoes compared to the hassle of being audited. put everything in writing, and keep finances separate.\n\nif they did decide to marry, and your daughter's boyfriend contributes to the mortgage directly and/or improvements to the house, the property would almost certainly then become a commingled asset, and convert from being separate property to marital/community property. she has been warned.\n\nhow much rent he pays in a house that she owns, i will leave for them to figure out.\n\nthe moneyist: 'warren buffett and harry potter couldn't get those two retired early': our spendthrift neighbors said our adviser was 'lousy.' so how come we retired early?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
american homeowners can take pride in these prices.\n\nat the nadir of the housing market in 2012, homebuyers had to pay an average premium of almost 29%, or $209 per square foot, to live in communities with a higher share of gay, lesbian and bisexual residents. this year, homebuyers will need to pay a premium of nearly 37%, or $320 per square foot, to live in these same neighborhoods, according to a study released thursday by real-estate website trulia and online dating site okcupid iac, -1.73% . the conclusion? clearly, america's gay neighborhoods have recovered at a faster rate than non-gay neighborhoods.\n\ntypically, researchers had to use u.s. census data on same-sex couples in order to determine where gay populations concentrate. there is an obvious downside to that methodology, however: not all lgbt people are in relationships and, as such, researchers may be inaccurately measuring where they live. to address this, trulia and okcupid developed the neighborhood pride score, using okcupid data on the location of gay singles combined with u.s. census data on the location of gay couples. the researchers then cross-referenced this with house prices in those areas.\n\nthe highest premiums were in west hollywood, the castro district in san francisco, uptown in dallas, palm springs, hillcrest in san diego and edgewater in chicago. on the one hand, the legalization of same-sex marriage in june 2015 may have led to more married couples buying homes together in those neighborhoods. on the other, since gay individuals and couples tend to have fewer children and higher disposable incomes, they may also seek to live in neighborhoods with more desirable amenities, or they may simply attract such amenities after they move in.\n\ndon't miss:what barack obama, justin trudeau (and jerry seinfeld) teach us about hugging it out\n\nanother theory: if you are not raising children, you have two male incomes and have more money to devote to improve their home environment, says gary gates, the recently retired distinguished scholar at the williams institute for sexual orientation law and public policy at the university of california. there are possible limitations to house-price rises within a gayborhood. it may need to be socially liberal for an increase in same-sex households to increase house prices, a 2011 study by researchers at konkuk university in seoul and tulane university in new orleans found.\n\nthe trulia/okcupid study also calculated neighborhood pride scores. to calculate this, the researchers added the percentage of okcupid users in each zip code to the percentage of households that are same-sex couples, based on the 2015 census bureau's american community survey. so if 30% of okcupid users in one zip code were looking for love and 15% of those households were same-sex couples, they got a score of 0.45. these scores spiked in new york, new orleans and boston, and fell the most in miami, buffalo and san francisco.\n\nultimately, diversity is good for the economic development and housing prices, richard florida, an urban theorist and author of the rise of the creative class: and how it's transforming work, leisure, community, and everyday life, concluded. he found that high-tech hot spots followed the gay neighborhoods. his own separate bohemian index, which measured the prevalence of artists, writers and performers, had similar results. artistic and gay populations, he wrote, cluster in communities that value open-mindedness and self-expression.
when cary carbonaro's seven-year marriage ended in acrimonious divorce almost a decade ago, she reflected on what went wrong. letting her emotions control her financial decisions proved a particularly costly mistake.\n\ncarbonaro's protracted battle to extricate herself from her marriage taught her the value of maintaining a calm, clear perspective on even the most wrenching personal conflicts. a certified financial planner, she vowed then to help women gain financial independence.\n\ncarbonaro, 49, has since applied the lessons of her divorce to assist clients in need. she's especially attuned to having married women take steps to safeguard their assets and protect their credit.\n\nmy divorce gave me the empathy to say, 'i know what you are feeling, because i was there,' said carbonaro, author of the money queen's guide. knowing all the red flags and pitfalls lets me advise my clients better.\n\namong her own pitfalls in her marriage: taking out a home mortgage in her name, while agreeing (based on her then-husband's insistence) to put the legal deed to the property in both their names. as a result, carbonaro could not sell, rent, or refinance the house after her marriage broke up, even though she was responsible for the mortgage.\n\n 'so few women even know what their husbands make.'  — cary carbonaro\n\ntoday, she urges clients to enter into marriage with eyes wide open. she instructs each spouse-to-be to engage in full financial disclosure — of their assets, credit history, debts, and investments. they should also reveal the source of all their income. any reluctance by either party to disclose such financial matters merits attention — and should not be waved off or excused.\n\nso few women even know what their husbands make, she said. before getting married, they need to find out where all their assets are and the source of all their [household] income.\n\nhere's how much money you need to last for your entire life\n\nwhen carbonaro meets a couple, she looks for subtle cues that may signal a rocky road ahead. examples include how they describe their mate (and their marriage) and discuss their finances.\n\nif a woman seems mystified by her husband's assets or earnings, carbonaro might start to suspect something's amiss. if the client adds, i want to protect myself, carbonaro's concern spikes.\n\nsometimes i'll feel uneasy based on my gut, she said. i see how they talk to each other, how they talk about their goals and money. if one of them, perhaps the woman, is unengaged most of the time and then when she tries to talk, she's interrupted, that's not good.\n\n5 simple steps to reach $1 million\n\ncarbonaro's experience gives her credibility to advise women in trouble. but despite her best efforts, her influence has limits. she recalls a female client who was mired in a disastrous relationship with a man who squandered her savings and even crashed her car.\n\nyou're on a collision course, carbonaro warned the client. you need to see a therapist and deal with this situation.\n\nthe client rejected carbonaro's advice and continues to struggle amid her dwindling finances.\n\nnevertheless, carbonaro comforts divorcees by providing emotional support. she calls herself a massive cheerleader for them. there are times you'll think there's no light at the end of the tunnel, she tells them. you'll think it will never end. i've felt all those things that you've felt. i've lost weight. i've gained weight. your whole life is upside down.\n\nbut she doesn't just empathize. she says her real value comes from empowering besieged clients to persevere. this is the lowest point you'll ever be, she assures them. it can only go up from here. i'm proof.
no more drama in this family affair.\n\nrepublican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel stressed thursday that her harsh words for her uncle mitt romney — the junior senator from utah who criticized president trump's character and conduct in a recent op-ed — had nothing to do with family and everything to do with fostering unity as party chair.\n\ni love my uncle. my tweet yesterday had nothing to do with family, mcdaniel, who dropped the maiden name romney after assuming her rnc post, said on fox and friends. i would have done this to any freshman incoming senator, and i would have said, 'hey, let's focus on the real issues here, which are the democrats, who are proposing dangerous policies for our country. and let's remind americans about the good things that have come out of the trump administration.'\n\nmcdaniel, following romney's swipe in the washington post at trump's leadership, had tweeted, for an incoming republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive. the reality is, i acted as party chair, she later told fox news. he's going to act as senator. romney had given her advance notice of his op-ed, she added, and sent her a note after she tweeted.\n\nwhile the rnc chair and the republican senator serve separate employers with different goals, there's a lesson in their public clash for how family members who work together — whether it's in a family business or just a company that employs them both — ought to interact in the workplace and off the clock.\n\nfor instance, workers in a family-owned business need to learn that they wear different hats on different occasions, like the family hat, the business hat and the business-ownership hat, barbara spector, the editor-in-chief and associate publisher of family business magazine, told moneyish. are you talking to someone as if he's your dad and you're his child, or are you talking to him as if you're the employee and he's the boss? she said. that can be hard to navigate.\n\nhere's how to decide whether working with your own flesh and blood is a good idea — and how to make sure your relationship survives intact. (if you're either considering or regretting working with a romantic partner, read moneyish's tips for couples who work together and advice on how to work with an ex.)\n\nmake sure you both can handle working together. brianna marshall, a las vegas-based licensed marriage and family therapist, urged having a frank conversation about whether your relationship can weather the potential conflicts. we know ourselves: are we able to leave it here at work and not have this interrupt our personal family life? she told moneyish. if we can't do that, then maybe we shouldn't be doing this. and that's ok — it's not a weakness of any sort.\n\ntalk through worst-case scenarios, advised johnny c. taylor jr., president and ceo of the society for human resource management. as an extension of the interview and hiring process, he said, both parties should sit down with a certified hr professional to role-play various hypotheticals: could you stay objective if your mom were consistently late to work, or if your brother passed you over for a promotion? what would you do if a family member were caught stealing? are you prepared to call law enforcement on your son, your daughter, your cousin, your mother? taylor said. if the answer is no, then both of you can't work (there). the third-party hr presence can help push the conversation forward and pick up telling body language, he added.\n\nset parameters. (it) depends on the job and the kind of work, but in general i think firewalls are good, psychologist mary alvord told moneyish. it is nice to have separation of work time and work issues versus family time. have clear boundaries on when and where it's ok to discuss work stuff, marshall said, and designate a work-free zone where you don't discuss business. it's generally understood that to the extent that you are working with a loved one, then work is work and home is home, and we really try everything we can to avoid bringing those two things together, taylor added.\n\nstay above board. a family member shouldn't join your workplace if they're not prepared to be treated like every other employee, taylor said. in some ways it's an even (more) heightened standard, because once people realize you two are related, they're expecting favoritism to come into play, he said. for the good of the morale of the organization, you almost have to go one step further to prove that this person does not have an unfair advantage.\n\ntaylor says transparency was key during his previous tenure at the thurgood marshall college fund, where he was ceo and his sister worked as a vp who didn't report to him. while her married surname could've made it easy to obscure their sibling status during the three years they worked together, the two opted to inform everyone up front. perception is everything, he said. employees need to know that you're not hiding anything. his sister understood she was subject to the same consequences as anyone else, he added.\n\nrevise your old assumptions. siblings and cousins, for example, may need to redefine their relationship to think of each other as business partners, spector said — after all, their reputations as kids may have been the flaky one or the screw-up. it's hard to realize that 'ok, that was decades ago, and now this person is an adult and a competent professional,' she said. don't pigeonhole people. if you're the one trying to shake an outdated image, she added, demonstrate your capability, your competence, your credibility in your role.\n\ndon't be afraid to change course if it isn't working. agree to reassess within the first year or six months of working together, taylor said. if there have been a number of uncomfortable instances in which work and personal issues bled into each other, he said, we should agree that one of us is going to go the other way.
in my last column, i wrote about how you could use beneficiary designations and transfers on death directives to make sure your assets at financial institutions go to the people you want them to, without the need for a will.\n\nnow, continuing with the concept of a do-it-yourself estate plan, we'll focus on how to transfer real property (i.e., your home) primarily to a spouse, without much fuss or trouble.\n\npassing on property depends on how the property is titled, or who the owners are. that's the first thing to clarify when you're deciding who should inherit it. there are three principal kinds of ownership, which vary from state to state: joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, tenancy by the entirety, and community property. there are some differences between them, but all have in common the ability to pass on property to a partner, particularly a spouse, without going to probate court.\n\njoint tenancy with rights of survivorship (jtwros) can be used for ownership of not only real estate but also checking, savings, fund and brokerage accounts. under jtwros, all tenants have equal ownership rights and upon the death of one owner the property automatically passes on to the surviving tenants. unlike the two other principal forms of ownership, jtwros applies to non-married couples as well. to establish it, you'll need to meet four criteria, called unities.\n\nthere's one drawback to jtwros, and it has to do with taxes. when a property is transferred to an heir or heirs, the basis of the property increases, or steps up, to the current appraised value, rather than the original purchase price. that can save sellers a lot of capital-gains taxes if they sell the property at a profit.\n\nbut in jtwros the surviving spouse gets only half the step up, representing the half owned by the deceased spouse. the main issue with joint tenancy is whether the surviving spouse sells the house during his or her lifetime, said oren ross, a trust and estates attorney at oren ross & associates in roswell, ga., which happens to be a joint tenancy state.\n\nlet's say joe and joanne jones bought a house in 1995 for $200,000. when joanne died in 2020, the property was appraised at $400,000, so her half was stepped up to $200,000, from the $100,000 that represented half the purchase price. if joe sold the property soon after, the capital-gains tax basis would be $300,000 (her $200,000 + his $100,000), so $100,000 of capital gains would still be taxable. (however, joe would be exempt from paying taxes on up to $250,000 of capital gains on a primary residence if he's single and $500,000 of gains if he's filing a joint return and has lived in the property for two out of the last five years.)\n\nif, instead of selling, joe died soon after, his heirs would receive the property with a step-up basis of $400,000, and they would owe capital-gains taxes only if they sold the property for more than that.\n\ntenancy by the entirety is another form of common ownership in which each partner, who in most cases must be legally married spouses, owns an equal share. upon the death of one spouse, the surviving spouse automatically becomes the sole owner of the property but the same one-half step-up basis for capital gains we saw in joint tenancy applies here, too. tenancy by the entirety is recognized in 26 states, including florida, new york, new jersey, virginia, north carolina, and pennsylvania.\n\nfinally there's community property, which is the principal form of joint ownership in nine states, including the two largest, california and texas. in a community property state, the asset is assumed to be both spouses' held together, so when one spouse passes, it should pass to another, said megan gorman, a tax attorney and owner of chequers financial management, a boutique advisory firm in san francisco. community property includes all real and financial assets, which are assumed to be owned in common, except property bought before the marriage or assets covered in a prenuptial agreement.\n\nbecause both spouses own the entire property in common, when one spouse passes away the surviving spouse gets the full step-up basis for calculating capital gains. if you bought the house for $100,000 in 1985, and today it's worth $2 million, which sounds crazy but isn't in california, the survivor's new income tax basis is $2 million. which means joe jones would pay capital-gains taxes only if he sells it for more than that (plus the $250,000 or $500,000 exclusion).\n\nso, transferring a home to a spouse after death is pretty simple in most states, and you can do it without a will. passing it on to others is another story and in our next column we'll deal with when you need a will or a living trust.
in 2011, darin shebesta faced two heavy blows. first, his father died. then he got divorced.\n\na certified financial planner in scottsdale, ariz., shebesta recalls how that double dose of difficulty changed him — for the better. persevering through painful circumstances strengthened his resilience and propelled his career.\n\nshebesta, now 34, could prepare for his dad's passing. his father, suffering from brain cancer, fell and broke his clavicle and that sped his decline. he couldn't take care of himself after that, shebesta said. i saw him several times a week, and that time allowed me to say anything to him. so there was nothing left unsaid.\n\nbut the second blow — the end of his two-year marriage — took him by surprise. his wife demanded a divorce out of the blue, six months after his father's death. i was shocked, he said. we'd been together for six years. i never envisioned my life without her. i was blindsided.\n\nshaken by such trying circumstances, shebesta reassessed his life. at the time, the then 27-year-old was working for a wealth management firm. [those two experiences] freed me up to think i should go for it and write my own ticket, he said. they were the catalyst. so on january 1, 2012, i launched my own practice.\n\ndarin shebesta\n\nshebesta reflects on how tragedy has since reshaped him. for starters, he extracted lessons from the divorce and asked himself, if i get married again, what will i do to make it work?\n\ni was a shy kid who didn't speak my mind, he said. and in my marriage, i didn't express an opinion. now i've built a voice. i have a say. i'll take a stand. (his divorce was amicable. in fact, shebesta is marrying again in march, and he reports that his former wife likes his fiancée.)\n\nin terms of his father's passing, shebesta's big takeaway involved his mother. for years, he had harbored some grievances towards her. now i cherish my relationship with my mom, he said. i don't take it for granted. and that relationship has taken a quantum leap. we're closer than ever.\n\nthis self-awareness informs his work as an adviser. from managing his father's estate to handling divorce proceedings without rancor, shebesta came away with practical insight that has worked to his professional advantage. he also has greater empathy for clients, especially those going through personal challenges.\n\nhe also developed a new attitude. i used to label things 'fair' or 'unfair' and look at my life through that filter, shebesta said. now i realize you become subjective and judgmental when you assess everything in those terms. it's more fulfilling to just live a life of love and joy.\n\nhere's how much money you need to last for your entire life\n\nin his work, shebesta has learned to listen more acutely. beyond hearing a client's words, he's attuned to what they don't say. in these iceberg conversations, he says he's able to uncover what's truly important to them. for example, when a client in his 60s declared, i don't want to leave any money to my child, shebesta sought to expose what was below the surface. i want to know more about that, he replied. go on.\n\nas a result, clients are more apt to open up to him. because he does not judge what he hears, they feel safe sharing innermost feelings and thoughts. it's not about good or bad, shebesta said. it's about what works and what doesn't.\n\nread: beware of financial advisers who act like ambulance chasers\n\nplus: how to find the best volunteer gig in your retirement
an interesting development over the last several years has been the financial independence/retire early (fire) movement.\n\nfinancial independence is defined as having sufficient passive income and/or sufficient investments to cover your living expenses. the turning point is when you have saved enough or reduced your expenses enough to achieve financial independence.\n\nonce you have reached financial independence, you are now free to live the good life, or at least that is how the story goes.\n\nsince financial independence is a formula, those seeking fire often focus on both sides of the equation, being the reduction of living expenses and increasing passive income and investments. many on the fire path will go to such heroic efforts to minimize expenses that they can achieve the definition of fire with comparably very little saved, sometimes referred to as lean fire.\n\nlean fire is steeped in anti-consumerism, simple living, and even homesteading. despite the proliferation and popularity of blogs, books and web forums, the pursuit of fire is not new. the acronym is a recent development; however, the concept of reaching financial independence and retiring early was not born of the internet nor of recent time.\n\nthe concept easily dates to the 1960's, and i bet that one could easily make an argument that the u.s.a. was founded by the godfathers of geo-arbitrage.\n\nfortunately, people pursuing fire or lean fire have the benefit of learning from those that came before them.\n\nare you pursuing fire or lean fire?\n\nsome people may argue the difference is just semantics. i believe words matter. a yacht and a kayak are both vessels; however, if i told you i took my vessel out on the open water this weekend, you could be forgiven for thinking i owned something much grander than a kayak.\n\nsimilarly, if someone told you they reached financial independence, i doubt the image that comes to mind is of one living in a yurt in their neighbor's backyard. being frugal and living simply is impressive and admirable. as a community, though, we need to ensure we are all on the same page.\n\na proposition\n\nas such, i propose we modify the definition of fire. in my opinion, financial independence should equal having sufficient passive income and investments to replace your wages or the median income (like the cost of living) for the community you are living in.\n\nfinancial independence should entail some form of contingency planning and/or redundancy. as well, i would argue that failing to plan for variables is not a plan at all: if one variable threatens your independence, then by definition, you are not as financially independent as you believed you were.\n\nlean fire would mean that you have chosen a fire path that focuses on simple living and frugality to achieve your goals. it also means you do not have sufficient resources for fire.\n\nof course, if you are leaving your job to turn a side hustle into your main gig, and you need that active income to maintain your standard of living, i would consider that as self-employment on the path to fire.\n\nwhy does any of this matter?\n\ngood planning entails considering what could reasonably go wrong and plan ahead for contingencies. good planning needs to work in good times and bad. both forms of fire have some risks. the leaner the fire, the more risks you may need to plan for.\n\nlet's talk about what can go wrong.\n\nliving expenses\n\nliving expenses will go up over time, and inflation is hard to measure or even forecast. this is in part because inflation affects households differently. if you ask a cattle farmer, a truck driver and a technology consultant how much expenses go up annually, you are likely to get three very different answers.\n\nthe farmer and the truck driver are much more sensitive to changes in energy and commodity prices than the tech consultant. in fact, the tech consultant may argue that expenses decline.\n\npeople express their belief that their stock market-linked portfolio will keep up with inflation. they make the assumption that the stock market returns will beat the average rate of inflation. the question is, will you experience average rates of inflation? will people, such as retirees that need to allocate a high proportion of the passive income to living expenses, tend to be more sensitive to inflation in energy and commodities?\n\ntip: make sure your inflation protection strategy is correlated to the inflation you are likely to experience, not just a general cost of living inflation.\n\ntaxes\n\ntax policies change and evolve over time. the only thing we know for certain is that we don't know anything for certain. luckily, the various income taxes are easy enough to plan for.\n\nthe challenge is in the property taxes and indirect taxes. in many areas of the country, property taxes have steadily increased at rates greater than the rate of inflation. an extremely lean fire plan may not be able to keep up with property tax inflation.\n\nwe must worry about indirect taxes, are you prepared if the town you live in doubles or triples the water bill? if you reside in the country and rely on a well or septic system, do you plan for the potential cost of conversion to public water and sewer if the township mandates that change? a mandated change like that today could cost $15k. what would it cost in 10 or 15 years?\n\ntip: consider setting aside extra money for rainy day emergencies before leaving the workforce.\n\ncorrelations change\n\nthe great recession and financial crisis taught us several lessons about portfolio design and volatility in income-producing portfolios. we have also learned that correlations change. in 2008, multiple asset categories experienced losses. one thing i often hear people on the path to fire say is if their portfolio loses value they will just go back to work.\n\nthe financial crisis taught us that weakness in the stock markets tends to correlate highly with weakness in the job market. if that wasn't bad enough, the same finance downturn that damaged your portfolio could also trigger a layoff where your tenant works, and now he is unable to pay rent. it has become popular for those seeking fire to make money online, just keep in mind the economic forces that rattle your investments could impact your side hustle as well.\n\nhealth care\n\nhealth care and health insurance are some of the biggest challenges to those aspiring to fire and lean fire. the affordable care act has created some opportunities for people to purchase affordable health insurance they have structured their taxable income in an ideal manner.\n\nthe issue remains that, over the course of 15 to 25 years, we do not know what health insurance programs will look like. historically, health care costs increase at a greater than average rate versus the rate of inflation. it would be prudent to plan accordingly.\n\ni have heard people in the lean fire community indicated that they will engage in medical tourism. as appealing as traveling to belize for your health care may sound, unexpected health issues don't often give us much warning. quite often, health issues do not make time for travel either.\n\nlawsuits\n\nmany individuals on the path to fire include some form of rental properties for income in their fire portfolio. real estate offers some compelling advantages: namely, you can purchase a rental property with little to no money down. i cannot begin to count the number of satellite radio commercials or infomercials that pitch the rental property passive income dream.\n\nrental properties are not without risk; landlords can and often get sued. recently, a tenant was awarded $300,000 over a bedbug infestation. even with adequate insurance, a lawsuit can be costly. neither property insurance nor liability insurance covers property owners if the town or city levies fines or requires improvements on the property.\n\ntip: should your path to fire include rental properties, consult your lawyer and your accountant about what planning may be necessary to protect your assets. asset protection is not a substitute for quality liability insurance.\n\ndivorce\n\nmany marriages end in divorce. out of the number of people who get divorced each year, i'm willing to bet there's a handful of couples that would have insisted before their marriage going south that they would never possibly get divorced. your spouse may be on board with your lean fire dreams now. ask each other what happens if opinions change.\n\nmany couples that embarked on homesteading or self-sufficiency found out that overly simple living wasn't as romantic and charming as it sounded. alternatively, if you are lean fire, and your spouse is not able to visit the children or grandchildren as often as wanted because it's not in the budget, will that spouse remain on board? potentially, too lean of a fire plan could lead to anxiety and resentment. please do not risk your marriage by retiring too early.\n\ntip: make sure you have adequate prenuptial and/or postnuptial agreements.\n\nfailed fire: what is the cost?\n\ni have attempted to point out some of the risks to people on social media. their responses are usually a glib answer such as i will just go back to work. the problem with that answer is, if your plan fails, it could be too late. it's doubtful you're going to abandon your fire dream due to a bad day in the stock market, or even two.\n\nyou may not realize your plan is not working until it is too late. you may be several years, or even a decade into your plan when you realize you have a problem. in the case of a medical emergency, you may be physically unable to work. re-entering the workforce may be harder than you anticipated.\n\nlet's be clear: should you leave your profession prematurely and find out a handful of years down the road that your planning did not work out, you're unlikely to get much sympathy. it's highly unlikely your previous employers will hire you back. even if they do, it may not be at your previous pay level. a 10-year hiatus in your resume may cause difficulty in seeking employment, if, for no other reason, that 10 years is a long time in certain industries, and skills perish over time.\n\nyour definition of fire\n\nyou should be prepared for the above situations, although i am hopeful these things do not happen to you. when you are prepared and have a plan in place to deal with the curveballs that life tosses at you, then that is the moment when you are truly financially independent.\n\nthere is nothing wrong with trying to retire early or live simply. good planning means you can enjoy your retirement with peace of mind and security.\n\nthe key is to choose a path to fire that is sustainable and works for you, your family, and your goals. ​\n\nmichael dinich is the lead writer of your money geek blog. he previously worked in the personal finance industry helping families plan for retirement, reduce taxes, cut expenses and plan their estates.\n\nthis column originally appeared on your money geek. it has been republished with permission.
i'll bet that few of president trump's supporters will actually read the article in the new york times outlining just how he was able to blow $1.17 billion between 1985 and 1994. they won't either out of antipathy towards that paper, or because the article's too long, or because they're so in the tank for trump that they think he walks on water, is more honest than mother teresa and all the rest—and anyone who says anything that doesn't validate this world view is automatically a far left stooge.\n\nbut they might learn something, because the disclosures rip a titanic-sized gash in the myth trump has spent a lifetime peddling, namely that he's a big-brained, super deal-making genius. i mean, you don't have to be a trump university grad to know that losing $1.17 billion in ten years isn't exactly the definition of success.\n\nbut that's what trump did, we now know, thanks to reporting by the dogged russ buettner and susanne craig, who obtained tax data (but not actual returns) for that period—giving americans the most detailed look ever at the financial dealings and shenanigans of the man who now sits in the oval office.\n\nwhat's interesting here is that even with one mild recession, the overall period in question—1985 to 1994—was a boom time for the u.s. economy. gdp grew 43%, and the stock market, as measured by the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% , grew 171%—not counting dividends.\n\nif you parked cash in an index fund on new year's day 1985 and went away for a decade, you would have done quite well. yet trump was blowing through cash, even at his flashy atlantic city casinos. how anyone could lose money in a casino in the 1980s—when the only options were nevada or new jersey—is beyond me. trump's lack of a midas touch was also evident at everything from a failed airline to a football team in a league that thought it could actually compete with the nfl.\n\nrelated:trump is justified in saying that his billion-plus of tax losses may not have been financial\n\nthe times's reporting adds important context to other stories that have been written about trump in recent years. david fahrenthold of the washington post—another great newspaper trump loves to bash—won a pulitzer prize in 2017 for exposing trump as a charity-stiffing charlatan. buettner and craig report that one possible reason for this is that because trump's adjusted gross income was in the red for each of the ten years (again 1985-1994), he was not allowed to deduct any charitable contributions.\n\nthe problem here—and a reflection of trump's phoniness and shameless self-aggrandizement—is that this didn't stop him from pretending to be a big donor to charitable causes. he got his photo in the new york papers a lot by showing up at events to benefit charities he never gave a dime to.\n\nit's hard to get much slimier than this, though i think trump managed to top himself in later years by cheating on his third wife with a porn star and then paying her off to the tune of $130,000 (think of how that could have helped a worthy charity).\n\ntrump's gusher of red ink may also help explain his reputation for cheating the very people who worked for him. a sweeping investigation by usa today in 2016 revealed that trump, over the last three decades, has been the target of some 3,500 lawsuits by employees and contractors over alleged non-payment. the paper notes that many of the people who sued trump were hard-working blue-collar types like dishwashers, painters and waiters—the very kind of small guys that candidate trump claimed he was always looking out for. the president's alleged cheating continues to the present: trump has been hit with at least $5 million in unpaid liens by workers at his lavish new hotel here in washington—just five blocks from the white house.\n\nto square the circle, trump's history of financial incompetence and alleged swindling also helps explain how he eventually got into bed with the russians. in the early 1990s, the soviet union had collapsed (i was working in moscow at the time), and there was a lawless, wild west free for all as russians grabbed whatever assets they could (sidebar: there are 71 billionaires in moscow alone today, forbes reports). many russians needed to launder cash; trump needed cash. it was a marriage made in heaven. for decades, at least 13 people with known or alleged links to the russian mafia held the deeds to, lived in or ran criminal operations out of trump tower in new york or other trump properties, the washington post has reported. trump may be off the hook on colluding with the russians during the 2016 campaign, but his collusion with dirty russian money is beyond question.
daniel packer, a 29-year-old data analyst at an online advertising agency in los angeles, knows more responsibilities will stack up as he hits the big 3-0 this summer, so he's been religiously stashing away money in his retirement accounts the last few years.\n\nretirement is a long ways away for him, he says — at least 30 years — but saving money early on means not worrying about putting away as much later down the road if he weren't able to do so. he's already seeing his strategy pay off, given he has a 1-year-old daughter and raising kids is expensive (try somewhere between $284,000 and $600,000). i'm glad i was able to take advantage of [saving] for the last nine years, he said.\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 20s\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 40s\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 50s\n\nread: this is how your finances should look in your 60s\n\nthirtieth birthdays are an excellent time to take stock of your future funds, especially as short-term financial obligations solidify, such as continuing to pay off the last of student loans, living on your own (or maybe starting a potentially three-decade stretch of mortgage payments) and raising children. millennials, the generation 20s to mid-30-year-olds fit into, have delayed marriage and home ownership from happening in their 20s (as was the norm decades ago). now 57% of today's 30- year-olds are or have been married, 47% are living with a child and a third are homeowners, according to the united states census bureau.\n\nsee:how our 'everyone gets a trophy' culture can lead to financial ruin for millennials\n\nhere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\nby 30, you should have a decent chunk of change saved for your future self, experts say — in fact, ideally your account would look like a year's worth of salary, according to boston-based investment firm fidelity investments, so if you make $50,000 a year, you'd have $50,000 saved already. by 35, you should have twice your salary, the firm said. the median retirement savings for a worker in their 30s was $45,000, according to transamerica center for retirement studies, which looked at workers' retirement accounts including employer-sponsored accounts and individual retirement accounts.\n\nthe problem? not everyone is saving — or can save — that much toward retirement. either they're living paycheck to paycheck, don't know about the accounts available to them or simply aren't thinking about the amount of money they'll need in their futures. only a third of americans are saving money in an employer-sponsored or tax-deferred retirement account, according to the u.s. census bureau.\n\ntoday's 30 year olds (and the soon-to-be 30 year olds) are plagued with crippling student debt, which just hit a record $1.31 trillion and affects millennials more than any generation before them. on top of that, some millennials are skipping starter homes altogether for a bigger home and, as nice as that is, home prices are rising as are mortgage rates. some may also be splurging for a wedding — scary fact: the average american wedding costs about $35,000. the last thing someone in their 30s should do, though, is leave retirement to the wayside.\n\nsee also:how we got to $1 trillion in debt: an illustrated history of student loans in america\n\nit's important to be saving for retirement while doing all these things at the same time, said alexander rupert, assistant portfolio manager at laurel tree advisors in cleveland, ohio. retirement savings should be growth-oriented for someone in their 30s, he said, which means they should be stashing money away whatever they can and considering a high risk tolerance. market ups and downs will affect the portfolio, but young investors should remember their money (and they) are in it for the long haul, rupert said.\n\nand if you're not investing in an employer-sponsored account (after all, only 14% of employers offer such plans, according to the u.s. census bureau) consider a roth ira, which more forgivingly allows investors to use those assets for an emergency should a situation arise. as opposed to other accounts, like a 401(k) plan, that place penalties on individuals who withdraw money from these accounts, investors can take money out of a roth ira penalty-free so long as they only take out the money they invested, and not the investment earnings of those assets. some 30 year olds, like packer, have numerous accounts. packer and his wife, for instance, have been maxing out their 401(k) plans and roth iras for a few years.\n\nit will take a load off my shoulders later, packer said. setting ourselves up now will pay benefits in the future.\n\nwondering what your savings should look like during a major money milestone? send your questions to personal finance reporter alessandra malito.
dear quentin,\n\ni live in new jersey. my husband and i have had a very rocky relationship and are contemplating divorce for the second time. my parents are both elderly but in good health, thankfully.\n\nit has been suggested that when they die, i will inherit some money (about $50,000), plus an estimated $300,000 profit that would come from the sale of their home, which i would split with my sister. is there a way i could put that in a trust or someplace where my husband would not be able to access in the event we actually file for divorce?\n\nhe burned through all of our finances and has left us with nothing for the future, so you can understand why i would be scared. and, of course, if we choose to divorce, i don't want my husband to get one penny.\n\nready to call it a day\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear ready,\n\nfirst, the good news. inheritance is not treated as community property in most states. (new jersey is an equitable distribution state.) it's left to you and you alone, according to the law. your husband does not get a look in. so if he has any ambitions about spending this money in order to keep him in the lifestyle to which he would like to become accustomed, he can think again.\n\nthere are some caveats to this, however. this rule only holds true so long as you have never 'gifted' part of it to your spouse, according to attorney stephen j. kaplan in colts neck, n.j. what if your husband claimed that you did? there would need to be some significant evidence of a gift in order for your spouse to succeed on his or her claim in this regard.\n\n never commingle inheritance received before or during a marriage, and always keep the money in a separate bank account. \n\nif you, for example, deposited the entire inheritance that you received into a joint bank account, and if that money stayed in the joint account for a significant period of time and then there was a divorce, the court will likely treat that money as a joint marital asset, having been 'gifted' roughly equally from you to your spouse, he added.\n\nnever commingle inheritance received before or during a marriage, and always keep the money in a separate bank account. you don't need a trust to ensure this money remains yours should you decide to divorce. this is a rule specifically made for inheritances. it does not, for example, apply to work-related bonuses or, indeed, lottery winnings.\n\ngood luck figuring out a way forward as a married woman or a divorcée. your concerns about an inheritance that is hopefully years away likely speaks volumes about your doubts about this man and your marriage. whatever you decide, choosing a life partner is the most important quality-of-life decision you will make, and often the most financially important one too.\n\nthe moneyist:my boyfriend, 9 years my junior, does not want to move out of my home should i die before him. my adult children are not amused
rock legend david bowie's death at the age of 69 has prompted an outpouring of tributes to the late singer-songwriter.\n\nbut bowie's influence reached beyond the impact of his music, which remained on the cutting edge throughout his 40-plus-year career: he was also a financial innovator.\n\nin 1997 he introduced an unusual marriage between the rock scene and wall street: he issued bonds backed by future revenue of the 25 albums he had recorded before 1990, paying a generous 7.9% interest rate over 10 years. the bond issue earned bowie $55 million, which he reportedly used to buy back songs from his catalog owned by his former manager.\n\nit may have sounded like a good idea on paper, but in march 2004, moody's investors service cut the bowie bonds to just one notch above junk. a spokesperson from the ratings agency said the downgrade was prompted by lower than expected revenues generated by the assets due to weakness in sales for recorded music, according to the telegraph.\n\nthe bowie bond was among the first of several so-called celebrity bonds, pioneered by investment banker david pullman. celebrity bonds from other artists, including james brown and the isley brothers followed.\n\nbowie's financial adventures didn't end with the bond issue. in 2000, he launched his own online bank, bowiebanc, in collaboration with usabancshares.com.\n\nrobert goodale, the singer's business partner at the time, was excited about the project, saying it opened the door for future ventures: we wouldn't rule out 'bowie's trading desk,' if someone came to us with a good proposal, he said, according to forbes.\n\nbowie's trading desk never materialized, and the bowiebanc was short lived.\n\ninterested in other unconventional bond issues? check out this slideshow.
forgot to get a valentine's day gift for your sweetheart? there is still time to permanently etch your love on the blockchain.\n\nstartups, initial coin offerings, and other services are allowing lovebirds to immortalize their feelings using crypto technology. the blockchain is the technology on which bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built. it functions essentially as a decentralized public ledger used to record and verify transactions. many forms of cryptocurrency are built on their own unique public ledgers. every time a transaction is made, it's verified across the blockchain allowing different parties to share information in real time without a central administrator.\n\nbuilding smart contracts on top of such ledgers is expected to disrupt everything from transportation and banking industries to government. but others have found ways to use it for love.\n\n 'for me, the blockchain is very symbolic. it symbolizes the removal of intrusive government processes out of everyday life.'  — —david mondrus, whose 2014 wedding was the first to be put on the blockchain\n\nin 2014, david mondrus and joyce bayo recorded their wedding vows into the blockchain: for better or worse, 'til death do us part, because the blockchain is forever, their message read. mondrus said for him, recording their marriage on the ledger meant more than getting a certificate at the courthouse (which they did as well).\n\nfor me, the blockchain is very symbolic, he said. it symbolizes the removal of intrusive government processes out of everyday life.\n\nmondrus claims his was the first blockchain wedding, but others have since followed suit in 2016 and 2017. some legal experts have called for a more widespread use of the blockchain for marriage, as the contract would span geographic borders that can complicate some marriages now.\n\ndecentralizing marriage could provide an immense liberating force — allowing international standards of marriage to proliferate, wrote divorce lawyer john oxley in city a.m., a london-based financial newspaper. just as bitcoin allows a currency to function without the state, so too could bitmarriage restore the proverbial broken link between where you live and where your marriage is registered, he wrote.\n\nhow blockchain can revolutionize government\n\nsmart love, a blockchain-based marriage app released in 2016, claims to do just that. it is built on the ethereum blockchain, which is optimized for smart contracts. because blockchain marriages are not recognized by the government, the app said it currently serves as a meaningful voluntary agreement between two consenting individuals rather than a legal one.\n\n 'bitmarriage' could restore the broken link between where you live and where your marriage is registered. \n\nto complete a blockchain marriage with the app, users create a smart contract through its chat function, sign the contract digitally with their individual key, and then time-stamp the contract in the ethereum blockchain, where it will remain permanently. this comes as more americans are giving bitcoin itself as a wedding gift.\n\nfor those not ready for marriage who still want to immortalize a message, try cryptocurrency. the valentine coin allows couples to engrave a message of their love on the ethereum blockchain. similar services existed in the past, including eternitywall.it, which let anybody embed a message in the bitcoin blockchain. the valentine coin sells itself as a permanent token of affection.\n\nit is the equivalent of the love padlocks on bridges, the company says, except it's on the blockchain for eternity.

dear moneyologist,\n\nmy husband and i married last year. this is a second marriage for each of us. i have two adult age children and he has two minor children. in his divorce decree it states that he shall maintain a $300,000 life insurance for his children as beneficiary until they reach the age of 23. however, on the actual policy he only has me listed as beneficiary. there is nothing indicating that this is left for his children should he pass prior to them reaching age 23. what would the legal liability be on this if he should pass before me?\n\nam i legally obligated to turn this over to the children because it states it in his divorce? there is no written will at this time indicating anything for his children.\n\ndiane\n\ndear diane,\n\nlife insurance is regarded as non-probate, provided there is a named beneficiary. but even without a will, the divorce decree still matters.\n\nthis is not the first time a reader has suggested giving step-relatives the short shrift when it comes to inheritance. in november, elsee in vancouver, wash., wrote to the moneyologist to say that her late mother had effectively cut her step grandchildren out of her will before she died by transferring assets beyond the reach of probate, even though her mother's late husband wanted to divide his estate between elsee and his grandchildren. in this case, she could have kept the lot. but i advised her to divide it.\n\nif you wanted to become beneficiary of your husband's life insurance policy after he's gone, you would likely win the battle (the payout from the life insurance) but lose the war ($300,000 from your husband's estate). the divorce decree places the obligation on your husband to maintain the life insurance policy, says john slowiaczek, president-elect at the american academy of matrimonial lawyers and an attorney based in omaha, neb., and even with you as the beneficiary on his policy, he would likely be in contempt of court. his children could make a claim of $300,000 against his estate, if he died with you as his beneficiary on that policy.\n\nlisten to our new podcast:money, markets & more (or subscribe on itunes): walking a mile in dead men's shoes and millennials tap home equity for frivolities.\n\nthis kind of case is pretty common, slowiaczek says. he's seen many cases over the years where the second wife doesn't want the first wife or first wife's family to have anything. they want it all. often times, the men don't want to fight with their new wives. but changing a life insurance policy that goes against the terms of the divorce decree would be asking for trouble. he would likely be in contempt of court, he adds, and that could get ugly. sticking it to the ex-wife is one thing, he adds, but changing the terms of this policy would be trying to stick it to the children.\n\n if you wanted to become beneficiary of your husband's life insurance policy after he's gone, you would likely win the battle, but lose the war ($300,000 from your husband's estate). the divorce decree places the obligation on your husband to maintain the life insurance policy.  — the moneyologist\n\nstill, you wouldn't be the first second wife to want to claim a life insurance policy that was written for her husband's first family. in 2013, the u.s. supreme court ruled in favor of a 66-year-old man's ex-wife (rather than his widow) as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth over $124,000. in this case, he may not have wanted his ex-wife, who he divorced 10 years before his death, to claim his life insurance policy. but with or without a divorce decree, the document given to the insurance company had his ex-wife's name on it.\n\nin many cases, there is financial chaos among warring children when a parent dies without leaving a will, especially if one child has been quietly working their way into the parent's finances. case in point: s. in virginia wrote a letter to say she had discovered that her father had died without leaving a will and, even though he wanted to split his estate between his children, her father had accidentally made her sister an owner of his bank account, not just a signatory, meaning she owned the money in that bank account. nice work, if you can get it.\n\nyou appear to be flirting with the idea of going head-to-head with your husband's children over his life insurance policy, should he die before his children reach the age of 23. that's a move that would make you $300,000 richer. of course, he could also write a will to say he wants you to have the loot. but if a will did exist, some state courts have ruled that life insurance contracts honor the divorce decree rather than the will. the takeaway? people should be clear about their wishes and put them down on paper, and not rely on the goodwill of others to do the right thing after they're gone.\n\nit's more likely that you're out of luck and out of $300,000.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

(honeydue asks you to tip them a few bucks monthly, but you can choose not to do so.) in the app store and google play, honeydue has the most reviews and highest ratings of the three apps, as of this writing. most reviews are positive, but some users point out that the app could be more streamlined and quicker to show updated account balances. unlike honeyfi and zeta, honeydue doesn't provide a way for couples to collaborate on savings goals, but it does offer a joint bank account.\n\nyou might like: my husband sprung a prenup on me days before our wedding. he kept all copies\n\n2. honeyfi\n\nthis app offers a free 30-day trial. if you choose to stick with it, you can pay $60 per couple for an annual subscription ($5 a month) or sign up for a monthly subscription of $9.99 a month. in the app store and google play, honeyfi had only a few hundred reviews, but its ratings were nearly as high as honeydue's. honeyfi has the most robust goals feature among the three apps. users can set rules specifying a certain amount of money to be regularly transferred from a checking account to a separate fdic-insured account. honeydue and zeta recommend linking accounts to get the most from the apps, but they allow you to skip that step and manually enter transactions if you'd prefer.\n\n3. zeta money manager\n\namong the three apps, zeta has the fewest reviews and lowest ratings, with some users (mostly in google play) noting that the app has glitches. that said, zeta is free and offers features similar to honeydue and honeyfi. couples who use zeta can also use its ious to track and split expenses and pay each other back via venmo or paypal pypl, +0.87% .\n\nthere are other apps that aren't designed for couples but could still work for you and your partner. for example, goodbudget is an app based on the envelope system that allows household budgets to be synced across multiple devices. there are also ways to share a budget in the you need a budget app. learn about these and other tools in our best budget apps list.\n\nhow to budget with your partner\n\nno matter which app you choose — or if you go the low-tech budget spreadsheet route instead — talking about money with a loved one can feel pretty loaded. when exploring each other's finances in tools and conversation, certified financial therapist ed coambs stresses the importance of financial empathy. aim to better understand each other, rather than identify if decisions are right or wrong.\n\npart of being empathetic is remembering that you and your partner have had a different set of financial experiences, says coambs, who's also a marriage and family therapist based in charlotte, north carolina. even if you two have similar financial backgrounds, he says, there are still going to be subtle micro-differences in what you prioritize or value.\n\nrelated: 3 money mistakes couples make and how to avoid them\n\nideally, you and your partner will get to the point where you can get financially naked, as coambs puts it. that means no one is worried about criticism or judgment about their money and what they do with it, he says, and there's a shared sense of future direction around finances.\n\nachieving that kind of transparency is a massive undertaking for many couples, coambs says. before using a shared budget app and disclosing your finances, agree to a no-judgment policy. if it turns out that you or your partner can't quite swing that, maybe it's not the time to budget together.\n\nat that point, coambs says you may want to work on building the relational skills that are needed to feel safe and secure with each other. that could mean working on communication, listening and empathy or addressing past traumas.\n\nhow to get the most from the app\n\nif you and your partner feel ok forging ahead on a shared budget app, mchale suggests spending the first month or so connecting your accounts, learning how to use the app and letting it track your money. after that, meet with your partner and review the past month's data.\n\nawareness is the gateway to change and is at least half of the battle, says mchale, who's also the founder of the financial services business moneyfull. with this frame of reference, you can try to spend $50 less on takeout next month, for example.\n\nalso see: men: here's how to help the women in your life get ahead at work\n\nthese kinds of changes aren't for the sole purpose of depriving you of late-night pizza fixes. they can help you and your partner be more intentional with spending and put your money toward stuff you really want. for example, if you two want to buy a house this year, maybe that $50 a month that you save on takeout can go toward a down payment.\n\nthe whole point of the budgeting app is to align your spending with your priorities, mchale says. that's how you experience the joy of money.\n\nmore from nerdwallet\n\nlaura mcmullen writes for nerdwallet. email: lmcmullen@nerdwallet.com. twitter: @lauraemcmullen.
dear moneyist,\n\ngrowing up, i was quite close to my paternal grandparents. they were very active in my life.\n\nwhile they were living, they frequently disagreed with my dad's financial decisions and felt my uncle, my dad's brother, did well for himself and therefore did not need any money. so they repeatedly told all the grandchildren, including me, that their estate would be divided among us, the grandchildren.\n\nmy grandparents were transparent with regard to their finances, and even told us where they kept their will. when my grandparents finally passed away, my uncle was named the executor, and finally read the will. their will specified that everything would be split between my dad and my uncle, contrary to what they told all of us growing up. naturally, that came as a great disappointment to us.\n\nmy uncle, with his half, decided to honor the spirit of what my grandparents had said over these years, and decided to give each of his children some money. he tried to convince my dad to do the same with his half. my dad refused.\n\nlearn to master your money:sign up for marketwatch's free live series to boost your financial iq\n\nmy dad took to facebook, telling people of his newfound wealth, and bragging about his supposed investing prowess when he did not earn that money himself.\n\nmy grandparents were frugal and worked for that money. additionally, my grandparents financially supported my dad as i was growing up.\n\nmy dad would go on and share the various ways he helped my sister and me financially — only that is a lie. it is all quite embarrassing. everything in my adult life i worked for. my dad did not pay for or support me throughout college.\n\nhe got remarried and has done more to support his wife's children, whom my grandparents never met. he went against my uncle's advice and never signed a prenuptial agreement, and is in poor health. it is very likely that my sister and i will never see a penny of our grandparents' money.\n\nhe has even told me that he has no obligations to me, his daughter, and we were on non-speaking terms for two years.\n\nthe moneyist:i want to propose to my girlfriend — but how do i divide my estate between her and my daughter from a previous marriage?\n\ni never asked my dad for money until more recently, when i started a new chapter of my life and wanted a loan to bolster a down payment. he went ballistic that i even asked — never mind that i asked him a year in advance of the planned house purchase.\n\nfor additional context: a few years ago, i was in a position to buy a property and my grandparents said they would help, but later had to withdraw the offer due to market downturn.\n\nmy relationship with my dad has soured to the point where i find it difficult to talk with him. my father lives in his own world where he believes what he wants to believe, and he has an adoring group of people who admire his supposed investing prowess and his financial generosity toward his family. he is not the type of person who would agree to go to counseling.\n\nit makes me sad what our family has become.\n\nthe only way i could see things changing is by starting with the truth. i would like my dad back, but i am afraid he is too far gone.\n\nany ideas?\n\nloving daughter\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\ndear daughter,\n\nseparate your relationship with your father from your financial needs and wants. if you want him in your life in a way that suits you both while maintaining healthy boundaries, be sure of your own motivations first and foremost. mixing up your emotional needs and wants with your financial needs and wants will quickly rust the wheels of this relationship. in fact, you may need a new set of training wheels.\n\nit might be possible to sustain a relationship with this man in a way that is healthy for you, but it may not be the kind of relationship you had hoped for five, 10 or even 20 years ago.\n\ndon't expect him to change. if you reconnect with your father, and give time out of your life for him and vice versa, maintain realistic expectations. sometimes, when we repair a broken relationship, we believe it will be the kind of happy, nourishing experience we had always dreamed it would be, but then slowly realize that the reasons it broke down are still present, and the reasons two people don't quite click are also still there. furthermore, if he is not capable of being honest with himself or others on or off social media, he will find it difficult to be honest with you.\n\nthe moneyist:we were friendly with our neighbors for decades, until recently. one day, they introduced us to their financial adviser…\n\nany requests for money are a trigger for him. whatever buttons you inadvertently pushed when you asked him for financial help will get pushed again. who knows why? maybe they triggered insecurities or resentments he harbors about his first wife and/or first family. inadvertently or not, it sounds like your grandparents used money to ensure that you would remain engaged with them throughout your life. but remember that your father is their child. don't allow history to repeat itself. the financial codependency ends here. by all means, tell him how you feel. it may not be enough.\n\nyour dad may or may not be organized enough (or, indeed, embittered enough) to leave a will and exclude his children from his first marriage. if there is no will? you will receive a percentage of his estate along with his second wife, according to intestate laws of his state. whatever happens, try not to take it personally. it's difficult in the best of times, but your father's antipathy toward you in all likelihood has absolutely nothing to do with you at all. it's much more likely that it is related to how you and your siblings make him feel about himself. you can't control that.\n\nwhat does it all mean? take care of yourself, first and foremost. be good to yourself, because you can't count on others being good to you.\n\ntread carefully — and remember, if at any time this relationship makes you unhappy or causes you grief or stress, it's ok to walk away.\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. by emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch.
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nkit, 49, an english professor from minnesota, who married in 1996, says staying married makes more financial sense. however, he says he has grown bored in his marriage.\n\nhe met his wife in college, and was drawn to her assertive and sarcastic personality. but years into their marriage kit says he felt like his wife became demeaning and unkind. they were never able to reach a compromise. they fought constantly, and he grew to resent her.\n\n 'it never occurred to me that i'd have an affair. it just happened. i don't think either of us saw it coming.'  — —kit, who had an affair on his wife and eventually moved into a one-bedroom apartment\n\nshe wanted a great big fancy house, i wanted a little house so we could travel more. in the end, we got a big fancy house. it was pretty clear that if i didn't give in to what she wanted every time it was a constant battle of you give in, and then you resent it, he said.\n\nthey had a sexless marriage for five years. one weekend in 2015, during a work trip, kit had his first affair with a colleague.\n\nit never occurred to me that i'd have an affair. it just happened. i don't think either of us saw it coming, he said. he wife later found out by reading messages on his ipad. kit moved out, and they started couples therapy a year later.\n\nelectronics regularly pop up in divorce cases, experts say. over 80% of u.s. divorce attorneys say they've seen a rise in the number of cases using social networking, according to the american academy of matrimonial lawyers, and more than a third of divorce filings contained the word facebook, according to a u.k. survey by divorce online, a legal services firm.\n\ndon't miss: millions of americans keep this dirty secret from their partner\n\ncheating has arguably gotten easier. dating sites like discreetadventures.com cater to married men and women, and apps like snapchat snap, -2.37% and slingshot allow adulterers to send messages that disappear on arrival. but technology cuts both ways: there are apps that also allow suspicious spouses to track their partner's online activity. (ironically, couples that met on an online dating site and married were less likely to split, according to a 2013 study published in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences.)\n\nkit, who preferred to withhold his last name, kept his affairs private, and lives separately in a one-bedroom apartment paying $385 a month for rent. he's spent around $50 a month on dating sites to meet women, $200 a month on grooming and new clothes, and around $100 a month on dinners and drinks he will typically split with his date.\n\nkit says divorce is off the table because he and his wife ran into some financial trouble after a flood destroyed their home around the time they separated. paying for their daughter's private school tuition is also the priority right now over hiring divorce lawyers.\n\n the average affairs costs around $444 per month. infidelity is the most common reason divorcees choose to end a marriage, result in 37% divorces. \n\nhe's currently in a relationship with a married woman. he'll spend $25 on gas to see his partner, and he has spent $100 on gifts and champagne. a recent outing at a casino cost $110 a night. for a room, and on each date kit spends between $75 to $100, he says.\n\nhe's not alone. about one in five men and women admitted to cheating on their partners, according to a survey of more than 70,000 adults by msnbc. com.\n\nmen are more likely to commit infidelity, according to a recent survey from private investigator company trustify. out of the 200 people polled, 36% of male respondents, and 21% of women said they cheated on their partner. the findings showed that 40% of male participants said their marriages ended following the infidelity, while only 19% of women said their marriages ended in divorce, regardless of the unfaithful spouse.\n\nmen and women cite different reasons for being unfaithful. some 14% of men cited the lack of sexual satisfaction in their marriages and desire for more attention as a reason for cheating. for women, 22% said the reason they were unfaithful was a desire for revenge on a cheating partner, according to the survey.\n\nalso see:5 apps for spying on your spouse\n\nthe average affair costs around $2,664, or $444 per month, according to a survey by discount code site vouchercloud. all those hotel rooms, travel, dinners and gifts add up. but the most costly expense related to infidelity stems from divorce. indeed, infidelity is the most common reason divorcees choose to end a marriage, providing the basis for 37% of divorces, according to a 2014 report from the austin institute for the study of family and culture, a conservative think-tank.\n\npeople are also more likely to prepare for the unmentionable: infidelity and divorce. in one survey of 1,600 members of the american academy of matrimonial lawyers, some 63% of attorneys said they've seen an increase in the number of clients seeking prenuptial agreements.\n\n 'divorce is like going through a terrible recession. often couples must split their assets in half which feels like losing 50% of your wealth.'  — —sterling neblett, a founding partner of centurion wealth management in mclean, va.\n\nprotection of property that was owned by one spouse before the marriage was the most popular stipulation of the prenups the lawyers saw (80%), followed by alimony/spousal maintenance (77%) and division of all property bought during the marriage (72%).\n\neve helitzer, a matrimonial attorney in new york city, says that because people are marrying later, they've often accumulated significant assets by the time they wed, making a prenup more desirable. what's more, they may want to keep the family business out of reach of a future spouse in the event of a divorce, helitzer says. rising property prices may also encourage people to consider signing a prenup.\n\nmarriages, themselves, are an investment. aside from the thousands of dollars a couple may have spent on a wedding, nurturing the relationship at the core of a marriage typically involves a great deal of time and money. engaging in an extramarital affair is like throwing that investment away. it's a waste of money if you're not willing to make your partner the priority in your life, said tom gagliano, author of the problem was me and life coach.\n\nthe average divorce's price tag is $15,000 in legal fees, according to legal information site nolo.com. divorce is like going through a terrible recession, said sterling neblett, a certified financial planner and founding partner of centurion wealth management in mclean, va. often couples must split their assets in half which feels like losing 50% of your wealth.\n\nmany americans appear to be monogomish — that is, they would cheat if they knew they could get away with it, according to a survey of 1,000 people carried out in july by the usa network. while 82% professed zero tolerance for cheating, 81% still said they would cheat if there were no consequences.\n\nparenthood appears to be one major motivator of infidelity, the study found. some 55% of married couples with children agreed that marriage is more difficult than i thought it would be, compared with 34% of couples without children.\n\n marriages are an investment. aside from the thousands of dollars a couple may have spent on a wedding, nurturing the relationship typically involves a great deal of time and money. \n\nelizabeth and her husband is one married couple who agreed to meet other people for sexual encounters, but they only agreed to do so together.\n\nshe met her husband when she was a freshman in college in 1999. he lived a half hour away in central illinois and would bring flowers when he'd come to visit her at school. she was attracted to his take-charge personality, a refreshing change from her ex who she says was too much of a pushover.\n\nhe'd come up on the weekend. we spent a lot of time in the bedroom, elizabeth, who preferred to withhold her last name, told marketwatch. we'd go out to eat and hang out with his friends. we never really dated. he'd call every other night and we'd talk on the phone for a couple of hours.\n\nhe proposed a year later, but elizabeth, who was studying to be a teacher, insisted on finishing her degree before tying the knot. they got married in 2003. we were the family with the white picket fence, kids and a dog, she says. i was working as a teacher and i'd come home had have supper cooked for him. i was the homemaker. i kind of let all of my girlfriends go and my friends became his.\n\nsee also:meet the wives whose husbands committed white-collar financial crimes\n\nafter they had their son in 2008, they both got bored in their romantic relationship.\n\nboth of us were each other's firsts sexually. we kind of wondered what other people would be like, she says, adding that they started swinging in 2008 using a dating site for married couples, and occasionally posted ads on craigslist.\n\nwe found out that we weren't actually physically attracted to each other like we thought we were, and sex was so much better with other people. we liked completely polar opposite things in the bedroom, elizabeth admits.\n\nelizabeth met another man at a gas station she frequented on her commute to the school she worked at an hour away from home. he asked for her number.\n\ni didn't stop and say, 'hey i'm married.' i was like, 'ok, yeah.' i came to find out he was married too. we kind of stumbled into this affair where my husband didn't know, she says.\n\nthey met in his house when their respective partners were at work, she says. he was the cheapest of all the affairs, she recalls of not having to spend money on hotel rooms or more than $10 on gas everyday.\n\n 'we were the family with the white picket fence, kids and a dog. i was working as a teacher and i'd come home had have supper cooked for him. i was the homemaker.'  — —elizabeth, who has had multiple extra-marital affairs after she and her husband 'opened up' their marriage.\n\nthat affair lasted six months, but ended when he got a divorce and expected elizabeth to do the same. she wasn't planning on it. instead, she told her husband about the affair. it put a rift in their marriage for years. they stayed married, but agreed to live financially separate lives. they had separate bank accounts, and split the bills.\n\nfrom that point on it was very easy for him not to see the cost of my affairs and for me not to see the cost of his, she says. we had a huge blow out fight yelling and screaming.\n\nelizabeth joined another dating site for married couples that costs between $35 and $89 to message other people. the main cost is hotels, says elizabeth, who has racked up bills between $62 and $190 a night. she's offered to split the costs each time, but says her partner's usually pay the tab.\n\nelizabeth says divorce is not an option for her. i honestly love my husband. i do. he and i are like best friends who live together. we have two children together. though we're not financially tied together, we have a farm house on five acres on land. we built this life together.\n\nfor his part, kit knows what he's doing is wrong, but says he has no regrets about his affairs, and plans to pursue a divorce from his wife when he can afford a lawyer.\n\ni spent 20 years in a marriage thinking i was trying to do it right and make it work. life is too short to feel that way about things. if you have a partner who doesn't want to be an equal partner it's time to move on.\n\n(jacob passy and quentin fottrell contributed to this story.)
i made a bold declaration: in the year i turned 50, i'd leave my north carolina home and visit 50 places around the world i'd never seen. then the universe said, hold my beer.\n\ni never expected that a pandemic would crash my intended year of travel. but then again, i never expected to be on such a journey in the first place.\n\nthree years ago, my marriage of 23 years was over, i'd just left a successful career as a tv news producer to start a content creation business and my daughter, sidney, was becoming a teenager. all the expectations i had for my life were shaken up like a snow globe and i was watching the pieces fall, uncertain where they'd land. life felt out of control.\n\nmile marker 50 was my solution. i've lived long enough to see how mile markers like divorce, death, job loss or a health diagnosis can change people for the worst. i didn't want my turning-50 mile marker to result in a smaller version of myself. instead, i wanted to show others that rising above circumstances that bring us to our knees can be a beautiful and fun journey.\n\nplanning my mile marker 50 trip\n\nit took over two years of planning, saving and sacrificing to make my plan a reality.\n\nthose plans included booking a paella class in spain, plotting a 12-day tour of italy, finishing the trip with a northern lights tour in iceland. i was just as excited about the domestic trips i'd planned, including a train ride from los angeles to seattle, camping in marfa, texas and hiking in joshua tree, calif.\n\ndon't miss: bison gored a woman multiple times after she tried taking a picture with it in yellowstone national park\n\npaying for these trips was a tall order for a single working mom. there were moments it sounded crazy even to me. but i stayed focused on my goal, and by the time 2020 came around, i was ready to start seeing the world.\n\ni completed eight trips before the pandemic closed borders and covid-19 cut my trip to europe short with my daughter and goddaughter in early march.\n\nrelated: your bucket list crashed and burned—now what?\n\none day, we were standing in awe of the eiffel tower. the next, we were in geneva being awakened by frantic texts warning us that the u.s. was implementing travel restrictions. we rushed to get home before chaos erupted. it was a spring break the girls will never forget.\n\ni think the hardest thing about canceling so many trips has been missing the chance to spend time with people i love. i was looking forward to a cruise to the bahamas with my college roommate, a trip to greece with another single friend i don't get to see enough, and dog sledding in jackson hole, wyo. with a former work colleague who is one of my favorite people.\n\nfacing the unknown again\n\nafter sitting grounded at home by a global public health crisis and unable to travel freely, i found myself again facing the unknown. the feelings of grief i'd experienced about the loss of my old life resurfaced.\n\nconsequently, i've been putting to good use some of the lessons i learned from those first trips.\n\nthanks to the way mile marker 50 began, i am now more comfortable with not being in control. since my mission was, in part, about learning to embrace the unknown, i had decided to let a travel agency choose my initial destination. i didn't know i was going to burlington, vt. until i got to the airport.\n\nthat experience has helped me focus on what i can control during this quarantine, instead of getting upset by what i can't.\n\nmy mile marker trip to key west, fla. with my 71-year-old mom and four sisters reminded me that i come from a long line of strong women who have gracefully weathered adversity. i know now that i'm made to handle whatever life throws my way.\n\nalso see: why having a bucket list can be a big mistake\n\ni returned from palm springs, calif. with a renewed appreciation for small, thoughtful acts of kindness. that trip was filled with kind gestures like my friend packing me a snack bag for our cross-country flight and watching the charming way a restaurant celebrated a patron's birthday.\n\nwhile i waited out the shelter-in-place order, i sent a puzzle to one friend, surprised another with takeout and dropped off food on a neighbor's porch.\n\nmy new itinerary\n\ni'm now turning to travel once again to help get me through, albeit with a very different itinerary. to me, travel is more than just checking things off a bucket list. it offers a healthy distraction to our routines. it gives you something to look forward to and reminds us that the world is bigger than our problems.\n\nno, international travel likely won't happen for me this year, but i can take shorter trips closer to home. and i will.\n\ni've already found a few that easily allow for social distancing.\n\na trip to ocean isle beach, n.c. and a mountain getaway in a renovated caboose on a bison farm in the mountains of western north carolina are both just a few hours drive from my mooresville, n.c. home.\n\ni'm still planning to include some more unusual destinations, like the great dismal swamp in virginia and a visit to mile marker 50 on route 66.\n\nfor farther destinations like cape cod, mass. and mackinac island, mich., i'm following expert advice and outlining a vague itinerary that doesn't rely on exact dates. i'm also watching flight and hotel cancellation policies as they continue to change from city to city.\n\nyou might like: is it safe to go back to the gym if you're over 50?\n\ni could say i was supposed to be sitting in a cafe in venice right now… but then that negates the beauty of the moment i am in.\n\nthe truth is: i'm exactly where i am supposed to be right now.\n\nperhaps that's the real lesson of the pandemic. we never know how life is going to go, even when we think we do. all we can do is learn to find stability and balance amid every uncertainty in our now.
wading into partisan politics (without a pair of duck boots) has landed l.l. bean in the crosshairs.\n\nwith post-election tensions high, l.l. bean is in the spotlight thanks to linda bean, an heiress to the bean fortune, company director and fan of president-elect donald trump. bean had donated at least $30,000 to a pro-trump political action committee that was only allowed to accept $5,000 from her, federal election commission filings show. (news of the discrepancy was first reported by the associated press.) for her part, bean indicated on fox and friends on jan. 12 that she had only donated $25,000 to the committee.\n\nliberals like those behind the online campaign #grabyourwallet, which is organizing a boycott of brands doing business with the president-elect and his family, are calling on their ideological allies to avoid buying from a brand that bears the last name of the fervent trump supporter. in response, the incoming commander-in-chief tweeted on jan 12, encouraging his supporters to buy l.l. bean products as a sign of support.\n\ntrump professes loyalty to the camping- and outdoor-gear maker that portrays itself as an american heritage brand. since being founded in 1912 in freeport, maine, the bean brand has maintained a manufacturing facility in the united states, a rarity for a company that sells across product categories. l.l. bean's 200,000-square-foot flagship store in freeport juxtaposes the efficiency of corporate america—it's open 24/7—with small-town charm. the company boasts that it has never locked the store's doors.\n\nl.l. bean has tried to distance itself from controversy over the linda bean largesse. it responded by saying that linda bean was one of 50 family members involved in the business, and, in a jan. 8 facebook fb, -1.61% post, executive chairman shawn gorman wrote, l.l. bean does not endorse political candidates, take positions on political matters, or make political contributions. simply put, we stay out of politics.\n\nbut in an age of global supply chains, the situation may be more complex than both parties portray. l.l. bean has a facility in nearby brunswick, maine, where local labor produces some of the company's most iconic products, like the signature duck boot. it also has a thriving export business: it did $1.5 billion in sales in 2015 and sells in serves 200 countries, with canada a fast-growing market.\n\nl.l bean has moved to appeal to a younger and less middle american demographic. since 2010, it has held a wintervention tour, sending a truck shaped like its duck boot to college campuses in the northeast, hardly conservative hot spots. l.l. bean reportedly imports 75% of its merchandise from overseas, and at least some of its clothing is produced in china and vietnam, according to sourcing data supplier panjiva. consumer advocate and former presidential contender ralph nader wrote in 2011 that over 90% of the goods featured in an l.l. bean christmas catalog were not made domestically. (l.l. bean did not respond to request for comment.)\n\npotential boycotters, on the other hand, should note that snubbing l.l. bean could have a negative effect on employees regardless of their feelings toward trump. for instance, the majority of the company's 50 u.s. retail stores are located in blue states, including new york and massachusetts. factory workers in l.l. bean's foreign manufacturing plants could be hurt, as could those at the almost two dozen boutiques it operates in japan. (and it's not the only americana-celebrating brand that makes goods overseas. so does jeans brand levi strauss & co. and computer company apple aapl, -3.25% , among many others.)\n\nwhat's more, a sustained boycott of a brand is also tough to carry out. consumers will continue to shop at l.l. bean because of the quality, fitting and sizing of clothes and footwear that they offer, says ayako homma, an analyst at euromonitor international. for instance, comedian whoopi goldberg separated personality from politics when she ended a two-year boycott of fast-food brand chick-fil-a, which the gay-rights supporter had avoided after chick-fil-a's president, dan cathy, made the remark that supporting same-sex marriage was inviting god's judgment, which some considered homophobic. (cathy later told usa today: all of us become more wise as time goes by. we sincerely care about all people.)\n\nregardless of whether they're recipients of praise and criticism from trump's social-media accounts, brands may benefit anyway. just ask the media companies that have seen subscriptions rise as the president-elect's criticism of them intensified. in his latest tweet on the issue, trump wrote, thank you to linda bean of l.l.bean for your great support and courage. people will support you even more now. buy l.l.bean. @lbperfectmaine the president-elect tagged linda bean's maine-based lobster business instead of the family's iconic outdoors brand.

take heart. as a political cartoonist, de adder told me that the only kind of writing he can do is funny.\n\nif you want to take a stab at writing an interesting or humorous obituary, consider gathering all the basic information together, and adding more colorful details.\n\nin her blog post, anatomy of a great obit, obituary writer jamie passaro shares tips, including using imperfections and contradictions, humor, quotes and more. most obituaries she writes are around 800 words, and she is a member of the society of professional obituary writers.\n\nread next: covid became a pandemic one year ago — normalcy is coming back\n\npassaro can be hired; her basic package is $400, but she also works with clients on obits and eulogies at an hourly rate. since the coronavirus outbreak, passaro has seen an uptick in sales of her $4.99 ebook, how to write your own obituary.\n\nsays passaro, covid has led some people to be more reflective and to think about what they want in terms of death care, memorials and their digital legacies. one way to do that is by writing their own obits, including information about their wishes.\n\nhere are a few additional obit writing tips:\n\nchoose a writing tone based on the person. the best obituaries reflect the personality of the person who died, says passaro. if someone is a serious person, a more traditional obituary may be the right choice.\n\nthe best obituaries reflect the personality of the person who died, says passaro. if someone is a serious person, a more traditional obituary may be the right choice. plan ahead, if possible. make obituaries part of death preplanning. in addition to funeral and burial arrangements, ask your loved ones how they want to be remembered, says skidmore. not only will this make the obituary more meaningful, but it's really hard to write an obituary when someone has just passed away and you're grieving.\n\nmake obituaries part of death preplanning. in addition to funeral and burial arrangements, ask your loved ones how they want to be remembered, says skidmore. not only will this make the obituary more meaningful, but it's really hard to write an obituary when someone has just passed away and you're grieving. include what future descendants would want to know. an obituary may be the last thing written about someone, says de adder. three hundred years from now someone may not care what your loved ones did for a living, but they will want to know about them as people.\n\nmargie zable fisher is a freelance writer and the founder of the 50-year-old mermaid, where she and other 50+ women share their learnings and experiences on living their best lives after 50. her website is margiezfisher.com.\n\nthis article is reprinted by permission from nextavenue.org, © 2021 twin cities public television, inc. all rights reserved.\n\nmore from next avenue:
after a volatile first week of 2021, the second week of the year has started in a slightly calmer fashion.\n\nhaving said that, markets are once again closely watching u.s. politics, after house speaker nancy pelosi said the house would proceed with legislation to impeach president donald trump if the 25th amendment isn't invoked.\n\nall three major u.s. benchmark stock indexes closed at record highs on friday, despite a report showing the first monthly job losses since april amid surging covid-19 cases. investors instead focused on president-elect joe biden's promise of more financial aid for americans, at the end of a week in which the democrats won both senate runoff elections, shifting the balance of power in congress. u.s. stocks djia, +0.58% spx, +0.29% comp, +0.40% fell slightly in early trading on monday, pulling back from record highs.\n\nhowever, in our call of the day, credit suisse strategists said the exuberance was likely to continue, raising their target for global stocks and the s&p 500 spx, +0.29% . the investment bank's analysts, led by andrew garthwaite, raised their end-year msci world ex-u.s. target from 362 to 375, giving a 12.3% potential return from here. they said it was in line with the bank's u.s. strategists, who raised the year-end s&p 500 target to 4,200.\n\nthey said three key important components — the put-call ratio, the bull-bear ratio and risk appetite — were slightly extended but not at sell signals.\n\nbullish sentiment is high but at these levels markets continue to rise two-thirds of the time over the next month and we think the bullish sentiment is not reflected in retail or institutional position — indeed net speculative longs on the s&p are below average, they said.\n\nthe strategists' only worry was that 80% of stocks currently sit above their 200-day moving average, which would typically see markets fall two-thirds of the time over the next month. however, they said: but in the very early cycle, as we are, this is not a short-term sell signal.\n\nwe think a democratic clean sweep and the vaccine rollout underpin 5% global gdp growth this year.\n\nbeyond the near term, there were a number of strategic reasons to stay positive, they said, including ultraloose policy and an additional u.s. fiscal boost of close to 2% of gross domestic product. they also saw the start of a bond-to-equity switch, as institutions start to realize that bonds are becoming increasingly less diversifying, return-less risk. excess liquidity was also consistent with a further rerating and earnings revisions were supportive, the analysts added.\n\nfinally, there was the potential for a funds-flow squeeze, with corporate buying of stocks accelerating and retail buying having returned, while pension funds —

valentine's day means love is in the air and some people are popping the question, but those proposals should come with one more thing beside a ring: serious money talks.\n\ngetting engaged is romantic and talking retirement plans and budgets are not, but forgoing money talks, because they're awkward or taboo, can doom a relationship. before they get hitched, experts say couples should discuss finances.\n\nit may be awkward to have these conversations, but here are 5 mistakes to avoid:\n\n1. spending too much on a wedding\n\nnobody should start their married lives in debt because of a wedding. young couples already go into marriage with debt for other reasons, whether it's consumer debt or because they are one of more than 44 million americans with student loan debt.\n\nyet weddings are expensive, and people often get caught up in the planning process. the average cost of a wedding, according to wedding site the knot, is more than $30,000, for those who opt to get married at a fancy venue, hire professional wedding planners and insist their guests have access to a photo booth. but it's possible to do it for a fraction of that amount. advisers suggest keeping wedding costs in check if couples can't afford them, and saving appropriately for both the wedding and honeymoon. make a budget and assign an amount to each aspect of the big day and any following vacation, said dara luber, family finance specialist at td ameritrade.\n\n2. starting money talks after marriage\n\nalyssa fischer, a personal finance blogger at mixed up money, has plenty of soon-to-be-married friends who say they'll talk about budgets after the wedding day. i think a lot of couples assume that their partner feels the same way about money as they do, and that's not always the case, she said. no one wants to hurt another person's feelings by stating they spend too much on wing night or sephora runs. however, once you're married those conversations will be unavoidable.\n\ndoes this mean consolidating finances before marriage? no, said erin lowry, author of broke millennial, but couples do need to have full frontal financial nudity. before you get married, you need to know all the ins and outs.\n\neverything you need to do in your 20s for a great financial future\n\nsee: are engagement rings passe?\n\n3. keeping your dreams and expectations to yourself\n\nthe silent killer of relationships is unmet expectations, wrote lifestyle blogger derek harney, i think healthy, realistic expectations that are communicated are good to have, he said. they're something to reach for. financially, the most dangerous expectations could be that everything in the couple's shared life will remain the same, said bridget casey, a personal finance blogger at money after graduation. your financial lives will change over the years because of layoffs, children [and] illness/disability, she said. what are the expectations for income, saving, debt repayment as individual circumstances change and affect the couple?\n\nalso see: 10 things married couples won't tell you\n\n4. hiding your bank accounts and shopping addiction\n\nout of fear or shame, one in five people in live-in relationships said they commit financial infidelity, meaning they have a private bank account or credit card their partner doesn't know about, according to a recent creditcards.com survey.\n\nfinancial infidelity can be just as threatening to a healthy relationship as physical cheating and can ultimately lead to a breakup, said kimberly foss, a financial adviser and president of empyrion wealth management in roseville, calif. anything like that needs to be getting shared with a partner moving into a marriage because you're building a financial life together, lowry said. have regular talks and be empathetic toward your partner, who may feel uncomfortable about his or her difficulty managing money. even if you bank separately, you're still a team, she said. what one person does impacts the other's life.\n\n5. avoiding conversations about your salary\n\nnot everyone shares the details of their paychecks with their partners. only half of men tell their partners how much they make, compared to 60% of women, according to a survey by financial firm aspiration. and if they do share that information, it's only likely to happen when they move in together. some 41% of respondents said that was the best time to talk salary.\n\nanother survey, recently published by bank of america, found almost one in five millennials did not know how much their spouse or partner earned. but when you are sharing utilities and taking equal responsibility for paying the rent every month, even that may be too late. and for some people, there's another good reason to get these figures on the table: half of the participants said they think married or cohabiting couples should split financial responsibilities by income.
with the rules for life idea currently popular, here are my thoughts on work and finance.\n\n• don't confuse your workplace with your family.\n\n• when you have little left to learn on your job, it is time to move on.\n\n• take risks with high plausible upside. avoid risks with high plausible downside.\n\n• save and invest to get rich slowly.\n\ndon't confuse your workplace with your family\n\npeople bring all sorts of family drama into organizations. your supervisors can seem like parents. the people you supervise can seem like your children. your colleagues can seem like siblings, with all sorts of jealousies and rivalries involved.\n\nbut in fact you are better off seeing your work relationships as transactional. that is, you do things for other people, and in exchange they do things for you. the people that you transact with on the job are not perfect, and neither are you.\n\ntry not to load any additional emotion onto those relationships. it is not deplorable that some of your siblings (co-workers) appear to get higher pay and better treatment than you do. it is not a tragedy that sometimes your parents (bosses) make poor choices. in fact, if the organization were run flawlessly, then it probably would not need you.\n\n5 simple steps to reach $1 million\n\norganizational conflict and friction are inevitable. some people are difficult to get along with. i call it corporate soap opera. it always seems gravely important when you are in the middle of it and then childishly trivial after you have moved on from it.\n\ntry as hard as possible not to take things personally. in relating to others, think in terms of professional and respect. treat others professionally and with respect. show that you expect them to do likewise with you.\n\nabove all, your employment relationship is not a marriage. you can stay interested in other opportunities without being unfaithful. you can walk away without going through a bitter divorce.\n\nwhen you have little left to learn on a job, it is time to move on\n\nin my career, i never stayed in one position very long. often, i took on a role that was newly created, or one which i could re-define by changing how it was done. once i learned how to be effective in a role, i trained a successor and looked for something else.\n\neveryone feels uncomfortable when they are just starting a job and have a lot to learn. but you should also feel uncomfortable when you reach the point where you can do the job so well that there is not much need for learning. that is when you should think in terms of training a successor and finding something else.\n\nfinding something else often involves changing organizations. every organization has its own culture, and what you can learn is limited by that culture. think of an organization as something like a college. after a few years, it is time to graduate and go elsewhere.\n\nof course, if you are rising within an organization, then each promotion introduces you to new people and new challenges. you are learning in that case. but if you have not been given a new challenging opportunity in more than a year, then in order to continue to grow and learn you may have to leave.\n\ntake risks with high plausible upside. avoid risks with high plausible downside\n\nin 1994, i quit a well-paying job to start a commercial website. i thought that the upside was very high, and the downside was limited to lost salary and the cost of setting up the website. i thought that learning about starting a business and learning about the internet would make up for some of the losses. as it turned out, luck was with me, and the business evolved into something that could be sold profitably.\n\nrecently, we were looking at the possibility of buying a new house. we found one that had some of the characteristics we were looking for. but in my opinion there was not much upside. because moving to a different house can always bring unexpected problems, i took the view that this is not the sort of risk i wish to take.\n\njust to be clear, i think of a plausible upside as something that has at least a 5% or 10% chance. buying a ticket in the state lottery has a high potential upside, but it is way below the threshold of plausibility. real life offers you better lottery tickets, and you should bet on those.\n\nan example of a real-life lottery ticket is striking up a conversation with a stranger. you can do this while waiting in line in a store or sitting next to someone on an airplane. it has plenty of upside and little downside. make a habit of doing it and you will turn into a lucky person.\n\n'rich dad' author robert kiyosaki on how to get rich in real estate\n\nsave and invest to get rich slowly\n\nthe difference between living within your means and spending beyond your means may be small in terms of percentages, but it adds up over a lifetime. if you save 10% of your income every year, then you will be able to retire early and well. instead, if you spend all of your income, you will constantly suffer from financial stress.\n\nfor investing your savings, i will offer standard advice from economists who study finance.\n\na diversified portfolio is better than trying to find a hot stock. an index fund that invests in the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% is fairly standard. the expense ratio should be really low. fidelity and vanguard offer such funds. for even more diversification, you can put, say, one-fourth of your stock investments into an international index fund, such as vanguard's total international index.\n\na form of u.s. savings bonds, called i-bonds, offers a safe, reasonable return. the safety comes from the fact that they are indexed for inflation.\n\ntake full advantage of employer-subsidized and tax-advantaged savings plans, such as 401(k) plans.\n\ni personally try to time the stock market, in a limited sense. that is, when price/earnings ratios are historically low, as they were in 2009, i put relatively more of my assets into stocks and less than one-fourth into safe assets, such as money-market funds or i-bonds. when price/earnings ratios are historically high, as they are today, i choose a more conservative mix, with more than half of my savings in safe assets.\n\nthis form of market timing is suggested by some financial research that i find plausible. but it is not a proven strategy. robert shiller, the financial economist whose research influences me, is very cautious about trying to apply it.\n\narnold kling is an economist. this

the cathedral of st. john the divine is the latest iconic new york city location to be repurposed as a field hospital to assist the city in handling the increased capacity of hospital beds needed amid the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nthe number of confirmed cases in the city reached 80,204, and the number of deaths 4,260, as of wednesday evening, according to the department of health.\n\nin order to help address the overflow of patients in our hospitals, samaritan's purse and mount sinai health system are working together to establish a second field hospital respiratory care unit at cathedral church of st. john the divine, which will be run as a part of mount sinai, the hospital said in a statement. the famously unfinished cathedral is across the street from mount sinai morningside hospital.\n\nhowever, when asked if they could confirm that they are working with mount sinai to set up the field hospital, samaritan's purse told marketwatch it was not confirmed.\n\nthe evangelical christian humanitarian organization samaritan's purse—which worked with mount sinai on a field hospital in central park—is run by franklin graham, son of the late evangelist billy graham.\n\nthe group's statement of faith, available on their website, espouses anti-lgbt rhetoric, noting that we believe that marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female.\n\nwhile our organizations may have differences of opinions, when it comes to covid-19 we are fully united: we will care for everyone and no patients or staff will be discriminated against, said mount sinai.\n\nan inquiry to the cathedral was not immediately returned.\n\ndon't miss: blacks, latinos in nyc disproportionately fall victim to coronavirus\n\nnew york city is in the midst of undertaking the herculean task of upping hospital bed capacity from 20,000 beds to 85,000 by may to handle the influx of coronavirus cases, and pop-up emergency hospitals have become crucial to the endeavor.\n\nthough positive statistics have begun to emerge, such as lower-than-predicted ventilator use and a stabilizing in the number of new hospitalizations for respiratory illness, mayor bill de blasio has cautioned against overconfidence.\n\nwe have to be careful not to take this initial information and make more of it than we should, the mayor said wednesday morning. it is only based on a few days, and it's only initial information. it's not something we can draw much bigger conclusions from.\n\nthis is still going to be a very long battle, he said.\n\ncertainly the most recognizable of the facilities being utilized as part of the effort to increase hospital beds is the usns comfort, the gargantuan navy ship that docked at pier 88 on manhattan's west side on march 30. gov. andrew cuomo announced tuesday that the comfort would be taking on covid-19 patients. cuomo said 500 beds would be available on the ship.\n\na few blocks south on 12th avenue, a further 2,500 beds for coronavirus patients are in the jacob javits convention center.\n\nread next: on the covid-19 front lines in minnesota: a full e.r., low supplies and fear\n\nin queens, the billie jean king national tennis center will see 12 courts and around 100,000 square feet of space converted into 250 hospital beds, according to the u.s. open. with the first 150 beds close to completion, the first covid-19 patients are expected to be admitted on friday.\n\nthen there's the surreal set of white tents on central park's east meadow. the 14-tent unit is the culmination of the work of mount sinai and samaritan's purse and houses a 68-bed respiratory care unit for covid-19 patients.\n\nat the end of march, cuomo announced that four more locations had been approved as emergency hospital facilities, the new york expo center in the bronx, the aqueduct racetrack in queens, the brooklyn cruise terminal and the college of staten island.\n\nall are considered overflow facilities, designed to take regular patients from traditional hospitals when they're inundated with coronavirus cases.
dear moneyist,\n\ntwo decades ago my friend (now 67) divorced his wife and left her with three kids (20, 17 and 14 years of age at the time) for a much younger single woman. in the settlement, he transferred his share of their town house — which still had mortgage on it — to his wife.\n\nhe agreed to pay the mortgage repayments in lieu of child maintenance for his youngest daughter. he paid the mortgage repayments for about a year when he realized his ex-wife had taken on a new partner and he was living with them.\n\nhe had a daughter, who is now 16 years, with his second partner. they bought a house together 10 years ago which has a mortgage. he put all his money toward the mortgage. he is now separating from his partner and they are selling the house.\n\nalso see: my father suffers from dementia—and my siblings forced him to sign a new will\n\nhe plans to nominate his youngest daughter as the sole beneficiary of his share (worth about $200,000) and also plans to leave her whatever assets he may have after death. his view is that the assets he has now have been generated in his second life and, therefore, must stay with the child from the second union.\n\nrecommended:my fiancé's father treats him like an atm—how do we protect our financial future?\n\nhe does not think that his three daughters from the first marriage are entitled to any inheritance from him as he gave up everything he had when he left them. their mother, his ex-wife, still owns the house and gets rental income from it and, unfortunately, has not shared any money with her daughters.\n\nhe asked for my advice and i consider that he has already provided a lavish lifestyle for his daughter from his second relationship. she will inherit a substantial amount from her mother's share. i consider that whatever assets he ends up with should be shared between all four daughters. he thinks this is not fair.\n\nwhat do you think would be fair?\n\na concerned friend\n\ndear friend,\n\nit seems like he has not seen his ex-wife or children in two decades. he can't buy that time back. they may not want anything from him. he is, of course, entitled to leave his money to whomever he wishes and, reading between the lines, appears to have a close relationship with his youngest daughter. so why not leave his $200,000 to his favorite?\n\nbecause he can do something in death that he, perhaps, didn't get a chance to do in life: recognize all four daughters and give them the respect and acknowledgment they deserve. of course, this has very little to do with money. but a small portion of his estate could help his daughters with a down payment on a house or their education.\n\nalso see:we plundered our 401(k) to invest in a friend's business — now we fear it's a ponzi scheme\n\nhe should also talk to his ex-wife and ex-partner or, at the very least, correspond with them. they could come to a mutual arrangement to leave his four children a certain amount. that would give him more clarity to make sure that his children receive an adequate amount after he and their respective mothers have gone.\n\ni once received a letter from a mother about her two daughters. their father had passed away. but he had sexually abused her two daughters and they didn't want any inheritance. they were admirably selfless. again, that was their choice, but i advised her to think again. it could help their education or they could give the money to a charity of their choice.\n\ndon't miss: my fiancé wants to take care of me financially, but i would have to leave my kids\n\nso i will leave you with this quote from sherwin nuland, the late author of how we die, which i gave another letter writer whose father wanted to cut two of his daughters out of his will: getting old is hard and dying ain't pretty, he told npr. what gives dignity to death is the dignity of the life that preceded it. i love that quote. it speaks to so many issues of inheritance and lives lived with resentment and bitterness.\n\nwith a will, we all have one last chance to make amends and to make a statement that is bigger than any of the missed opportunities or broken relationships during our lifetime. we spend so much time wondering how we would like to be remembered when we are trying to make our mark with our work, friends and family. but we should spend just as much time thinking about how we would like to remember others.\n\nwhatever your friend does, i hope that he at least remembers that.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
with today's relatively generous $11.18 million federal estate tax exemption, estate planning is only a concern for the rich. right? wrong! in fact, regardless of your income or net worth, there's one estate planning move you should probably make right now: check the beneficiary designations for your life insurance policies, bank accounts, brokerage firm accounts, retirement accounts, and so forth. if you've not yet turned in the proper forms to designate beneficiaries, do it now. if your forms are out of date, refresh them.\n\nthe consequences of failing to take these simple steps can be dire. if you don't believe it, consider the following trifecta of real-life horror stories.\n\ndon't miss:new york launches tax investigation into trump after n.y. times report\n\nhorror story no. 1\n\na 2012 fifth circuit court of appeals decision reversed an early district court decision by finding that a pension plan administrator didn't abuse her discretion in determining that a deceased plan participant's stepsons weren't considered his children under the terms of the plan. therefore, the deceased participant's siblings, rather than the stepsons, were entitled to inherit the plan benefits. source: herring v. campbell, 5th circuit 2012.\n\nfactually, john wayne hunter died in october of 2005. he had retired from marathon oil company, where he was a participant in the company pension plan. the plan allowed hunter to designate a primary and secondary beneficiary. hunter designated his wife as the primary beneficiary but failed to designate any secondary (contingent) beneficiary. after his wife died, he failed to designate a new primary beneficiary. under the plan's terms, when a participant died without designating a valid beneficiary, the deceased participant's benefits were distributed in the following order of priority: (1) surviving spouse, (2) surviving children, (3) surviving parents, (4) surviving brothers and sisters (siblings), and finally (5) participant's estate.\n\nafter hunter died, the plan administrator considered, and rejected, the possibility that hunter's two stepsons might qualify as children who would therefore be entitled to all of hunter's benefits. instead, the plan administrator distributed the benefits, which totaled more than $300,000, to hunter's six siblings.\n\nthe stepsons sued, claiming they should have inherited the benefits. evidence presented in the resulting texas district court proceeding showed they had a close relationship with hunter. his estate had been left to them, and hunter referred to them as his beloved sons in his will. the stepsons claimed they were in fact hunter's children because, by his actions, he had equitably adopted them.\n\nthe evidence seemed to indicate that hunter probably did intend to leave his benefits to the stepsons, and the district court took their side by concluding that the plan administrator had abused her discretion by failing to consider the stepsons' equitable adoption claim. however, the plan administrator wasn't ready to give up the fight. she appealed to the fifth circuit.\n\nthe fifth circuit found no error in the administrator's interpretation that the term children for purposes of the plan meant biological or legally adopted children as opposed to un-adopted stepchildren. as to the stepson's claim that they had been equitably adopted by hunter, the fifth circuit found that nothing required the plan administrator to incorporate the theory of equitable adoption into the plan's definition of children.\n\ntherefore, the district court's decision was reversed, and all of hunter's pension benefits went to his six siblings.\n\nhorror story no. 2\n\nhow would you feel if you died and your ex, who you intended to get nothing further after your recent divorce, was allowed to collect all your company pension benefits and the proceeds from your company-provided life insurance? probably not very good if you wanted your son and daughter from an earlier marriage to get the money. unfortunately, the dad in this case failed to change the beneficiary designations for his pension benefits and life insurance after the divorce, so his ex-wife remained the named beneficiary. two months later, dad was killed in a car crash. the supreme court ruled that the beneficiary designations trumped state law that would have automatically disinherited the ex. so the ex got the money, and the kids got the bills for an expensive and unsuccessful legal fight. source: egelhoff v. egelhoff, supreme court 2001.\n\nhorror story no. 3\n\nin yet another real-life case, an ex-wife collected $400,000 from her ex-husband's company savings and investment plan even though the ex-wife had specifically waived any interest in the plan under the divorce agreement. believing the divorce agreement was the last word on the subject, the ex-husband failed to turn in the form required to officially change the plan beneficiary from his ex-wife to his daughter. he died seven years after the divorce. the plan document stipulated that beneficiaries could only be changed by submitting the form. the supreme court ruled that the hideously out-of-date beneficiary designation trumped the divorce agreement. so the ex-wife got the $400,000 and the daughter got stiffed. source: kennedy estate v. plan administrator for the dupont saving and investment plan, supreme court 2008.\n\nthe moral\n\nof course, beloved stepchildren and divorces aren't the only scenarios where failing to turn in or update beneficiary designation forms can cause big problems for someone's intended heirs. you face the same basic issue if you've become disgusted with one of your offspring because he has decided to become a professional frisbee golfer. or you might want to leave more of your life insurance benefits to an adult child who just had triplets and a bit less to your childless heirs. bottom line: when your circumstances change, your beneficiary designations may need to change too.\n\nwarning: don't depend on your will or living trust document to override outdated beneficiary designations. as a general rule, whoever is named on the most-recent beneficiary form will get the money automatically if you die — regardless of what your will or living trust papers might say.\n\nspecial advice if you're married\n\nif you're married and have accounts set up with you and your spouse named as joint owners with right of survivorship, the surviving spouse will automatically take over sole ownership when the first spouse dies. if that's what you intend, great. still, you may want to name some secondary beneficiaries to cover the possibility that your spouse dies before you do. note that in the nine community property states (arizona, california, idaho, louisiana, nevada, new mexico, texas, washington and wisconsin), you will usually need your spouse's consent to make beneficiary changes because assets accumulated during your marriage are generally considered to be owned 50/50.\n\nturning in beneficiary forms can also help you avoid probate\n\nbeyond just ensuring that your money goes where you want it to go, another advantage of designating individual beneficiaries is that it can help you avoid probate — because the money goes directly to the named beneficiaries by operation of law. in contrast, if you name your estate as your beneficiary and then depend on your will to parcel out assets to your intended heirs, your estate must go through the potentially time-consuming and expensive process of court-supervised probate.\n\nthe last word\n\nif you don't have any minor children, keeping your beneficiary designations up-to-date can sometimes eliminate the need for a will (if you do have kids, you need a will to designate a guardian for them). the key words here are up-to-date. so it's a really good idea to check your designations at least once a year or whenever significant life changes occur. for example, when grandchildren arrive, you may want to name them as secondary (contingent) beneficiaries if their parents (your adult children) pass away.\n\nin any event, you can usually conduct a beneficiary checkup and make needed changes in just a few minutes. even better, beneficiary forms can often be accessed and submitted online. but if you wait, it could be too late — as the unlucky folks in the aforementioned horror stories can attest.\n\nsidebar: beneficiary to-do list\n\nlife insurance policies, annuities, iras and other tax-favored retirement accounts, employer-sponsored benefit plans: fill out and turn in beneficiary designation forms to establish or change beneficiaries.\n\nbank and brokerage firm accounts: fill out and turn in transfer on death (tod) or payable on death (pod) form to establish or change beneficiaries.\n\n529 college saving accounts: fill out and turn in beneficiary change form if you want to change the account beneficiary.\n\nname secondary beneficiaries: naming a primary beneficiary isn't enough. name one or more secondary (contingent) beneficiaries to inherit your money if the primary beneficiary dies before you do. sadly, this is a common occurrence that must be taken into account.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy wife and i have been married for 13 years and live in new jersey. i'm 44 years old and she is 41. things have not been perfect, but three years ago we had a beautiful daughter whom i love very much.\n\ni have been committed to making the marriage work, and i'm trying to give my daughter a stable, loving family environment. but about four months ago, our arguments became more severe.\n\ni think that having a child in a relationship places a responsibility on both parents to design a family plan that lays out financial stepping stones for education, retirement and general budgeting.\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here\n\nmy wife and i have never agreed on budgeting or spending. the conversation would always end in an argument. i'm sick of it and i don't see a future if we can't plan, or talk about a financial plan.\n\none month ago, i had a talk with my wife after seeing a therapist. the therapist session revealed that she didn't trust me. i pushed for us to talk outside of a counseling session.\n\ni explained to her that if we don't have trust, we can't have a relationship. my wife revealed that she had saved up $40,000 and withdrawn $25,000 from her retirement account.\n\nthe moneyist:'i'm worried that my daughter would blow through her inheritance.' my family has a trust fund worth $6 million. should i keep this money a secret from my kids?\n\nshe told me she had spent most of the $40,000 and the $25,000. i was shocked, but remained calm.\n\nat the time, i worked after i finished my full-time job as an uber uber, -2.23% driver to pay half the mortgage. i felt a tremendous amount of pressure to stay out on friday and saturday nights driving an uber until 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.\n\nwhy am i killing myself while my wife has the financial flexibility to save and i don't?\n\nthe moneyist: 'i just don't care for my stepdaughter.' i want to give my two kids $100k a year. would it be wrong to leave my stepdaughter out?\n\ni looked through her paperwork while she was on vacation in jamaica and found out that she was laid off six months prior. i couldn't understand why she didn't tell me. she still hasn't admitted it.\n\ni feel like my wife made a fool of me. what she has done is so disrespectful. we still can't talk about money and future plans, among a whole long list of other issues. i'm on the path to getting a divorce.\n\nwhat do you think?\n\nliving in an unhealthy marriage\n\ndear living,\n\non a financial-infidelity scale of zero to 10, this rates close to a 10. you are left with so many painful questions. how could your wife watch you leave home every friday and saturday night to drive an uber until the early hours of the morning? where did she go when she was supposed to be at work? why did she save $40,000 in secret? what reason could she have for dipping into her retirement account for $25,000, likely at a hefty penalty?\n\nhonest answers to these questions may or may not save your marriage, and save you from pulling the lever on divorce proceedings. but ultimately they're for her to grapple with. your wife's problems are bigger than your marriage and almost certainly predated it, whether it's been a rocky one or not. these are not the run-of-the-mill monetary secrets and lies that take place within a marriage. typically, one partner runs up credit-card debt or buys something indulgent.\n\nthe moneyist: my father left everything to my son. when i called the attorney about the will, my son got very upset. i now need financial help. should i ask him for money?\n\nbut this is a credit card of a different color. more than half of adults (55%) say keeping a secret account is as bad as actually cheating on someone, and one in five say it's worse than physical infidelity, according to a survey released last year. older people with higher incomes and education levels were more likely to believe that physical cheating is worse. in your case, i believe an affair would be less egregious than what has happened in your marriage.\n\nwithout trust in your partner and respect in your marriage, what is there? two people living together who once had a romantic connection and now share multiple responsibilities, including a child, a home, and the promise that they would love and support each other in sickness and in health. your wife could be putting together an emergency fund so she can leave the marriage and restart her life somewhere else. no one knows what she's thinking except for her.\n\nthe moneyist: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nthe good news: you don't have to figure out why your wife did what she did, nor is it your job to make her see how hurtful this is to you and damaging to your relationship. that's for her to do. your job is to help take care of your child and yourself. without any explanation or even acknowledgment that she is no longer working, assuming that's the case, you can't move forward. notwithstanding more marriage-counseling sessions, it's time to make your own exit strategy.\n\nyou can and should be transparent about your future plans. a woman recently wrote to me about her husband's secret will. she wanted to write one herself, but i advised her not to allow her spouse's behavior to change who she is. i offer the same advice to you. new jersey is an equitable-distribution state. your assets will be divided in a manner that is deemed fair to the court, but not necessarily equal. your wife's financial infidelity will be taken into account.\n\nthe moneyist: 'my husband's ex-mistress is ruining our life.' she claims she gave birth to his child and is extorting us for money\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

dear moneyist,\n\ni am a 49-year-old woman about to be married for the second time. i work and i am self-sufficient and have been my entire life, but as a single mom, i don't have much in savings. i have a 23-year-old son who works and shares an apartment with two roommates.\n\nmy fiancé is a wonderful 56-year-old man who is caring and giving. he is a widower with two adult children, who are also on their own. my fiancé owns his own business and has done well for himself. however, i don't want to be out in the cold. let me explain why.\n\nafter we're married, my fiancé wants me to give up my apartment that i rent and move into his home. i live in one of the most expensive cities in the u.s. however, i've lived in my apartment for over 10 years and the rent is affordable, and i love the location.\n\ni don't expect him to put my name on a house he owned with his first wife, but i'm concerned about what would happen if he died. i assume he would leave the house to his children, but what would happen to me?\n\nwould i be forced to leave his home and find an apartment that most likely would be more than i could afford? by the way, my landlord won't allow me to sublet my apartment because she could get so much more if i moved out.\n\nwhat should i do before i say i do?\n\ngetting married in new york\n\nwant to read more? follow quentin fottrell on twitter and read more of his columns here.\n\ndear getting married,\n\nthese are good conversations to have before getting married, and before giving up your beloved home. i suggest having the conversation about your financial future(s) separately, and not tying it to your current living situation. segues into this conversation like i need to know before i hand in my notice to my landlord, or why should i give up this great apartment without knowing what i'm walking into… are not advisable. it would trivialize the larger conversation.\n\nthere is not a small amount of uncertainty with this apartment. from what you say, it sounds like you are getting a good deal with this apartment rather than living in a rent-stabilized apartment — they are sought after in new york city like jason searched for that golden fleece. anything could happen, in that case. the rent could go up, your landlord could sell the building, or she could decide she wants to rent it to someone else and get more money for it.\n\nthere is a lot of uncertainty in marriage, too. you could live happily ever after or divorce after 10 years, and you would have to find another place to live, and rely on your own savings and whatever settlement you agree upon, and that is your responsibility, and not that of your future husband. assuming that does not happen, however, you could always agree upon a life estate or tenancy for life: if your fiancé predeceases you, you live there for the rest of your days.\n\nmost big decisions involve some kind of risk-reward calculation: will i take that new job? but what if it doesn't work out and the company goes under, or i hate my new boss, and then i've left this perfectly comfortable job where i wasn't that unhappy anyway? or, am i over-invested in stocks for my age and constitution? what you are coming up against ahead of your wedding is your own risk tolerance. this is a good opportunity to figure out yours.\n\nthe moneyist: my ex-husband put his wife on his life-insurance before he died, going against our divorce. now she's battling me in court\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.
zynga inc. founder and former chief executive mark pincus is a poster boy of why many investors are opposed to founder control.\n\nand in an ironic move, pincus may also end up as the poster boy for not keeping control into perpetuity, as many other tech founders seem bent on doing.\n\non wednesday, pincus actually gave up his voting control of zynga, potentially becoming an example for those advocating for time limits to founder control. pincus, who founded the social gaming company in 2007, said wednesday that he had converted all of his super-voting shares into zynga's class a common stock, enabling zynga znga, -2.37% to move to a single class structure, and he will become non-executive chairman. the move will convert his overall voting rights in the company to 10% from a whopping 70%.\n\nat the time of zynga's ipo in 2011, pincus mimicked the founders of google inc. goog, -2.62% and kept total control of his company, raising concerns among some investors. since then, those concerns were proven valid. the company, which started out growing like gangbusters on the popularity of its games played on facebook, such as farmville and words with friends, hit tough times as its core games lost their popularity, and many were not initially mobile-friendly.\n\ntwo years ago, pincus stepped down for the second time as ceo and longtime electronic arts inc. ea, -1.99% executive frank gibeau took his place, all while pincus retained control of the company.\n\nwith zynga in a strong position and a team focused on our players, it's a good time to evolve my role again, pincus said wednesday in a medium post. he told the san francisco chronicle in an interview that he is going to pursue his entrepreneurial interests, including blockchain technology, and that he is making lots of investments. zynga's earnings wednesday were better than expected, and this management team has gotten positive reception from some wall street analysts. but its shares are down about 9% so far this year, compared to the s&p 500 spx, -1.48% , which is down 1.42%. zynga jumped 1.37% in after-hours trading.\n\nwhile pincus is adopting the time is right stance in the media, it's possible that there are other things going on in the background that led him to make this move, such as his contentious and potentially very expensive divorce with alison gelb pincus, the co-founder of online furniture retailer one kings lane. she asked a san francisco superior court judge to nullify their prenuptial agreement, on the grounds that pincus's net worth soared during their marriage.\n\nmy guess is that it simplifies his divorce, said michael pachter, an analyst with wedbush securities, in an email. it seems likely that simplifying the voting structure allows him to pay her with zynga shares. in addition, he noted that the lack of a controlling shareholder could make the company more attractive to potential buyers. i've been saying for years that nobody would buy them because pincus wouldn't sell under $10 (the ipo price), he added. now, that obstacle is removed.\n\nin an interesting twist, pincus could end up becoming an example of sorts for a movement afoot among regulators, as one of the commissioners at the securities and exchange commission has been advocating for time limits on founder-led control. in a speech earlier this year in san francisco, sec commissioner robert jackson jr. asked whether investors in the public markets benefit when corporate insiders maintain control in perpetuity.\n\nit raises the prospect that control over our public companies, and ultimately of main street's retirement savings, will be forever held by a small, elite group of corporate insiders — who will pass that power down to their heirs, jackson said. he noted that by allowing founder-controlled companies, investors could miss out on the next google or facebook fb, -1.90% . jackson noted that he does not believe that exchanges should ban dual-class structures, but that shareholders should get to vote on the structure.\n\npincus is an example of why founder control can be a bad idea. but ending that control early is going to make him look more heroic, even as the cynics among investors may agree that the move is not likely coming from any noble intentions, but instead as a way to clean up a messy divorce.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband of 21 years is expecting an inheritance payout in the next month or two. he wants to use the money to pay off the mortgage on our home. i am familiar with co-mingling and am sure he is as well. if the money is not co-mingled, will i be required to pay him half of the amount used to pay off the mortgage if we divorce before the end of the year? if so, is there a set amount of time that has to pass from the time the mortgage is paid until we divorce for me to not be required to repay him?\n\nwife in ohio\n\ndear wife,\n\nbeing married for 21 years is quite an achievement. i'm sorry to hear that it has come to this. or that it might come to this. you're correct. inheritance is not considered marital property in ohio, so the only way for it to become part of your community property would be to commingle it in some way. that would, in theory, include renovations on a home or paying off a mortgage. your husband could still prove that the money came directly from his inheritance, assuming he had a good lawyer.\n\nin that case, the judge would deem the inheritance as separate property. there are many divorce cases in ohio that have quoted this salient piece of the law: the commingling of separate property with other property of any type does not destroy the identity of the separate property as separate property, except when the separate property is not traceable. so proceed with caution, if you intend on staying in a marriage for financial reasons, particularly if it is an unhappy one.\n\ndon't miss:my father left his home to his kids — my stepmother sold it for $1 million\n\n4 things rich people do with their money that you should be doing too\n\ni offer up this juicy story: in 1996, a california woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. she didn't tell her husband about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out all about it and sued her. superior court judge richard denner ruled did not appreciate her shenanigans and awarded her husband all of her winnings. if a judge suspected you were planning to divorce when your husband made these payments, your plan could also backfire. any good divorce lawyer would balk if he saw such payments prior to a divorce.\n\nalso read:will my brother's $300,000 debt to our mother die with her?\n\nnot everyone agrees that your husband paying off your mortgage is a problem. it will likely be water under the bridge, unless he could really prove you orchestrated the depletion of his separate property, says randy kessler, an atlanta-based lawyer and author of divorce: protect yourself, your kids, and your future. kessler doesn't advise against it. you'd be in a better position than if the money was still in his separate account. again, my caveat: it may not go your way.\n\nintention counts as much as timing. your husband might be the nicest guy in the world. or he may be someone who has treated you very badly over the years. you may have given up years of peak earning potential to raise a family. or, perhaps, you have both had your fair share of good and bad behavior. i will refrain from judging, given that i don't know the circumstances, and leave the soul-searching up to you. waiting for him to spend his inheritance, however, seems opportunistic.\n\nand sooner or later that sort of double-dealing tends to catch up.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear moneyist,\n\nwhen i was two years old, i was kidnapped by my father's family and my mother was told that i had been killed in a car accident. i found her 5 years ago. she died in january 2018. when i met her, she had married another man.\n\nshe said she would change her will, but we never got a chance to change it and i was wondering if i'm still entitled to half of her home and her belongings once my stepfather passes or can he control everything now and leave everything to his children?\n\ndon't miss:my dying father gave his girlfriend his debit card to buy food — and she kept on spending\n\nam i greedy? i lost over 40 years with my mom and her stepdaughters were not very kind to her all the years that she and my stepfather were married. she never had any other children. i feel like that my girls and i are entitled to her personal belongings.\n\nmy mother's stepdaughters never spoke to their father or my mother, or had much interaction with them while my mom was alive and, now that she's passed, it sounds like they're trying to take control of everything because he's in his 80s.\n\ni know that's not what my mom would have wanted. i feel awful because all i really wanted was to meet her and i got what i wanted, but i also know that my mom wanted me and my family to have half of what she had.\n\ncan you tell me how i would start the process to try to do something like that?\n\nmary\n\ndear mary,\n\ni'm glad you found your mother and i'm sorry that you feel she was not taken care of by her stepchildren during her lifetime. i hope her husband treated her well. you are her legal heir. but her husband has rights too, and he may not want to part with half her estate and your mother may not have been in a position to leave you half of the home she shared with her husband. there are so many unanswered questions about your mother's home, her estate and her will.\n\na last will and testament should be filed with the probate court in the county where your mother died. you may be reliant on the kindness of your stepfather to give you some of your mother's personal items of sentimental value. that would not be an unusual or unreasonable request. you could argue that your mother believed you were dead for many years and meant to include you. the statute of limitations on challenges varies; typically, you must file a challenge within one year.\n\nrecommended:my boyfriend wants me to invest in his home without putting my name on the deed\n\nyou are her legal heir and, depending on what state she lived in, could be entitled to your mother's separate property if your challenge to the will was successful; that is, anything that is not deemed community property or marital assets under that's state's laws. in california, for instance, you would receive one-half of the separate property and your stepfather would receive the other half. adopted children are considered legal heirs. your mother's stepchildren, nice or not, are not.\n\nalso see:my dying friend wants to marry me so i can have his social security — should i do it?\n\nthe home is complicated, even if a challenge to the will was successful. did she own her home with her husband? if this home is co-owned or was purchased by your mother during their marriage in a community property state, it would go to your stepfather. did she own this home outright, but leave her husband with rights of survivorship? you would inherit the home after your stepfather dies. did she own the home outright, but leave it to her husband in her will? you're probably out of luck.\n\nultimately, approaching your stepfather is the best step. you only had five years with your mother. you may have many more left with your stepfather. if he and your mother loved each other, this is a way you can continue the connection to the mother you never had, and by looking out for him if, as you say, his own children do not. rather than focus solely on what you are owed, think about what you can do for him. you would also be doing your late mother a great service, too.\n\nwhen a couple with opposite attitudes about money buys a house\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
this article is reprinted by permission from nerdwallet.\n\nwith 10.7 million americans out of work as of november 2020 (and 3.9 million of those workers unemployed for 27 weeks or more), many have been forced into having tough money conversations as a result of the pandemic.\n\nwhenever your life changes significantly, it's a good time to check back in on your financial plan, because things like marriage, divorce, a new baby or a career change can profoundly affect your household's situation and cause you to rethink who is responsible for what.\n\nwhether you share expenses with a roommate, a partner, adult children or parents, now is an especially good time to talk about money. here are some ways to ease into these difficult conversations.\n\nfirst, feel your feelings\n\nfew had the 2020 they thought they'd have, and no one knows when normalcy will return. mark reyes — a los angeles-based certified financial planner who works for albert, a financial wellness mobile app — experienced a major disappointment of his own: earlier this year, he and his wife canceled their wedding after more than two years of planning, opting to elope in his aunt's backyard instead.\n\nthough they feel they did the right thing, we kind of grieved our wedding, reyes says. we planned so much and worked so hard for one special day.\n\nhe notes that it's ok, even necessary, to process those emotions; burying them can make it difficult to meet financial goals because you'll continue to fear the unexpected.\n\nmy wife and i were just real with how we were feeling, reyes says.\n\nhe's seeing plenty of emotional turmoil from clients, too, he says. his company works with people who have been laid off, and those who've lost their jobs may feel like they've also lost part of their identity and what they thought their role was in their household.\n\njust because there's a lack of income, or you're not earning income, doesn't mean you don't have value as a person, reyes says.\n\nreyes says his company helps such clients with actionable steps, such as identifying and cutting back on nonessential spending, and considering side gigs as a way to get to the next month.\n\nbut giving yourself the space to feel sad and angry can also help. let the process of voicing your worries get you back on the path to setting financial goals and dreaming again.\n\ndon't miss: vaccine distribution will take 'better part of a year':\n\nbring it back to what's realistic and important to you in these trying times, reyes says.\n\ncompassionately renegotiate household responsibilities\n\nit's an age-old recipe for resentment: one spouse loses their job, yet the working spouse still carries the larger burden of household chores. or both spouses work from home while supervising kids in remote school, but one of them feels like they get interrupted more often and can't focus on their job. (and let's be real about whose work gets interrupted more in many opposite-sex couples: it's the mom.)\n\nchores don't just include cooking and cleaning. money management takes time, too, and all adults in a household need to be involved. according to ubs ubs, +1.55% financial services' own your worth 2020 report, 49% of women defer to their spouses when it comes to financial decisions.\n\nthe report also found that because of the pandemic, more than half of women take care of responsibilities like child care, cooking and cleaning, while nearly three-quarters of men handle the finances.\n\nalso see: how to talk to your kids about the storming of the capitol\n\ndepending on your household's situation right now, the division of labor may no longer make sense, and that means it's time for a talk. of course, these conversations can get heated.\n\nnathaniel ivers, an associate professor in the department of counseling at wake forest university, believes that interpersonal conflicts stem from your desire to be understood by the other person, while at the same time, you don't understand where the other person is coming from. he recommends using i statements when discussing hot-button issues.\n\nif you say, 'i'm feeling overwhelmed with the extra responsibilities i have now,' that will sometimes trigger compassion, ivers says. but if it comes with finger-pointing, the last thing you get is compassion and empathy.\n\nset boundaries when helping loved ones financially\n\nif a friend or family member needs money and you're in a position to help, you can do them a world of good at a difficult time. but this can be tough if lending or gifting money means you'll struggle to pay for your own expenses.\n\nit's so challenging. you want to help — you are helping — but you only thought it would be a one-time or two-time thing and now it's been six months, reyes says. that's a very difficult position to be in.\n\nread: my co-worker owns 10 homes, 9 of which are rented. how did he get a stimulus check while i didn't?\n\nrather than providing open-ended help when you can't afford to do so, offer to pay for specific things, like a month of rent or three months of electric bills. your loved one gets some relief, while you cover a predictable expense you can budget for over a set period.\n\nyou have to be firm yet kind, ivers says. what i would say is, 'i can help you with this particular thing for this amount of time.' that's where the boundary piece is.\n\nmore from nerdwallet\n\nsara rathner writes for nerdwallet. email: srathner@nerdwallet.com. twitter: @sarakrathner.
marriage after age 50 is a wonderful thing, but it has some financial challenges, too. there is plenty to take into account, and plenty of money myths, if you plan to tie the knot in midlife — especially if your spouse-to-be has children from a first marriage.\n\nhere are six common myths:\n\nmyth no. 1: prenups are only for the rich and famous\n\nactually, if you've been married before and have children from a previous relationship, a prenuptial agreement is essential to ensuring that property will pass to children from the prior marriage, says christine m. searle, certified internal auditor and owner of searle business solutions in arlington, va.\n\nand, she says, even if you're getting married for the first time, chances are you've accumulated significant assets by this point in your life (and perhaps even some debt). so you'll need to plan how to handle those if, sadly, this marriage doesn't work out.\n\nalso read: is a prenup unromantic, or the smartest thing you could ever do?\n\ndon't think of a prenup as prearranging your divorce, searle says, but more like writing your will. if you don't have certain things arranged, she says, the state gets to make decisions for you and that's like dying without a will.\n\nafter 50, the focus of a prenuptial agreement should be on protecting your children and grandchildren. the context of a prenuptial should be how to do we provide together for our extended families, says carla dearing, ceo of sum 180.\n\nfor instance, in the u.s., states can let a surviving spouse claim his or her elective share in place of what was left in the decedent's will. a prenup allows your spouse to waive the elective share so you won't need to fear your estate plan will be challenged by your surviving spouse, says philadelphia divorce lawyer linda a kerns.\n\nsimilarly, many states automatically give spouses some rights to life insurance or retirement benefits, but a prenup would let your spouse give up their rights to them. kerns says that if both spouses have substantial investments, they might want each of their own children to be the beneficiaries.\n\nby 2020, 50% of workforce will be remote. here's how.\n\nmyth no. 2: never discuss estate planning with your stepfamily\n\nestate planning is essential if you have children from an earlier marriage, kerns says. otherwise, your entire estate could pass to your new spouse and not to your own children.\n\nkerns recommends having frank conversations about your estate planning and prenup with your adult children and your new spouse. grown kids are sometimes wary of their parent getting remarried because they are concerned about how it will affect their inheritance, kerns notes.\n\nif you have concerns about providing for a new spouse and children from a previous marriage, you can get creative with your estate planning, says kelley c. long, cpa, a chicago financial planner with financial finesse. one of her clients created a formula for how much money he wanted his new wife to have when he died; the amount fluctuated based on their wealth and age. he also had regular meetings with his new spouse and his children to discuss how much each could expect to receive when he was gone.\n\nmyth no. 3: holding assets jointly is always best\n\nthe older we get, the more set we are in the way we spend and save money, says kerns. so it becomes increasingly more challenging to combine households and money.\n\nbefore getting married, couples should decide: will we have separate or joint accounts? will one of us sell our current home? will we change the deed to a house?\n\nit's not uncommon for one spouse to sell a house and move into the other's, says kerns. but before doing this, she advises, be clear about whether the one keeping the home will add the other's name to the deed. that's especially important if you plan to use money from the sale of one house to renovate the other one. otherwise, kern says, the spouse whose home is sold will spend money on a house he or she doesn't own and will have nothing to show for it.\n\ninstead of automatically selling a house, long suggests considering renting it out and using the rent money to pay for any renovations on the home you move into.\n\nmyth no. 4: your new spouse's debt won't affect you\n\nin fact, debt can be a significant issue in second marriages, says dearing. that's why spouses should be upfront about how much they owe before marrying so they can decide together how they'll handle debt that's still on the books. it's a good idea for each person to see the other's credit report, too.\n\ndearing recalls a 69-year-old client who had a sufficient retirement income and a comfortable life but thousands of dollars of credit card debt, too. if something happened to him, his retirement wouldn't go to his second wife, but all his debts would, she says. dearing recommended he buy a life insurance policy that would, after he died, provide enough money to pay off his debts and get their son through college.\n\nmyth no. 5: it always makes financial sense to get married\n\nwell, not always. it depends on your personal and financial situations. for instance, a spouse receiving alimony or child support from a first marriage can't assume that will continue after remarrying, kerns says.\n\ngetting married can also reduce your social security benefits, long notes — especially if you didn't work while you were married the first time and can claim spousal benefits that are significantly higher than your own social security benefits. for instance, if you were married at least 10 years, are at least 62 and are currently not married, you can collect a spousal benefit equal to half your spouse's social security benefit, even if your ex-spouse is remarried. in addition, long says, an ill partner on medicaid might want to remain unmarried so he or she can continue to qualify for that federal program. a combined marital income might be too high for your partner to qualify for medicaid.\n\nalso read: how to get the biggest social security check you can\n\nmyth no. 6: your spouse can automatically make your medical decisions\n\nwithout an advance health directive that spells out your wishes regarding end-of-life care, there's no guarantee your new spouse will be able to make medical decisions for you or tell your doctor what treatment you'd prefer.\n\nyou need to be very clear in writing what your wishes are so your new spouse and your adult children don't end up at odds over your care, long says. although your spouse is generally who your physician would look to for information about this, it can't be assumed that your spouse will make such decisions, she says.\n\nlong recommends talking with your new spouse and your adult children so they know your wishes and setting up an advance health care directive at mydirectives.com. file it electronically so your physicians will have easy access to this key document.
with pete buttigieg enjoying significant buzz over his dark-horse presidential candidacy, it is an opportune moment to consider his time as mayor of south bend, ind. i do so with the critical eye of an economist who has visited, studied and written about the city for more than a decade.\n\ni am not an unabashed supporter of mayor pete, and south bend's renaissance after decades of decline is far from complete. but don't take this as an indictment of buttigieg or his leadership. change is slow. what he has done is place south bend on a road to recovery. in my judgment, he has led three important changes that should in time change the fortunes for one of america's most troubled large cities.\n\nread:rising in polls, pete buttigieg makes his presidential bid official\n\nmayor pete clearly loves south bend. his academic and military career offered him a passport to virtually any world city, but he returned to a city that would appear to have lost its charm many decades ago. the city's population peaked in the 1960 census, and is today has 30% fewer residents. it now has about 100,000 people — roughly the size of tuscaloosa ala., sparks, nev., lakewood, nj, or burbank, calif.\n\npopulation loss has been hard on south bend. a study published earlier this year by my research center reported that the average home there was worth less than it would cost to rebuild it. in his book, shortest way home: one mayor's challenge and a model for america's future, buttigieg mentions a home he owns in the city that cost a mere $60,000. that same home would be worth between 10 and 15 times that amount in almost any major city in the united states.\n\nlike many other rust belt towns, south bend has been in demographic decline since the 1950s, and in economic decline since the 1960s. when mayor buttigieg took office, south bend's per capita income lagged the u.s. by a decade and a half, and the share of adults with a college degree was only 75% of the national average. today, the city's per-capita gdp has hardly changed in six years and has yet to top the pre-financial-crisis level.\n\nthe simple fact is that other than sharing in the unemployment-rate reductions of the national economic expansion, none of the top-line economic indicators for south bend have changed markedly over buttigieg's mayoral stint. but a half-century of deep neglect can't be fixed in half a decade. what he has done, though, is provide a blueprint for other troubled rust belt towns.\n\nhow buttigieg has been transformational\n\nfaced with an archaic and ineffective economic development apparatus, a global university (notre dame) that did little locally, and dim economic prospects, buttigieg convinced the city to look forward, not backward. the tool he used was the closed studebaker plant, which ceased operations in 1963, nearly two decades before the mayor was born. convincing the folks of south bend that manufacturing employment growth would not resurrect south bend should've been easy, but it was not.\n\nacross much of the midwest the wistful and fact-starved belief that prosperity is only one factory relocation away isn't just common, it is ubiquitous. in no place was it stronger than south bend. by flatly exposing facts and transforming the old factory into a nascent technology center, buttigieg spoke the truth in a hopeful way. this alone would have marked him as a transformational mayor, but he also took concrete actions to address the city's most intractable real problems.\n\nthe south bend metro area has a housing vacancy rate of roughly 13%, or more than 13,000 excess homes. most are abandoned. these properties decay, attract crime and reduce the value of homes across the county. bulldozing these properties is administratively challenging and an unpopular use of money, but necessary for a south bend renaissance. the buttigieg administration embarked on the most ambitious blight reduction effort in decades, meeting its goal of eliminating 1,000 abandoned homes in 1,000 days.\n\nsouth bend's rotary\n\nmayor pete's leadership style also involved a dramatic change in citizen involvement in civic affairs. the best evidence i have of this elusive trait comes from a talk i gave to the south bend rotary last year. i often gives these talks, and it should come as no surprise that rotary luncheons in the midwest are mostly comprised of older men and their fathers. this is a demographic tragedy given the importance of the rotary in a healthy civic culture.\n\nthe south bend rotary looked radically different. it was more like in interdisciplinary research colloquium, combined with an interfaith conference and millennial business forum. the buttigieg administration knows this organization is important and makes clear to its constituents that their participation is critical.\n\nto be clear, this is not an endorsement of pete buttigieg for the presidency. i think him wrong on a number of important policy issues confronting our nation. nor do i think the improved prospects for south bend are his alone. notre dame has become deeply involved in the community, and the vast fiscal reforms ushered in by mitch daniels, who was governor from 2005 to 2013, made possible many of the business opportunities that south bend has seized.\n\nmost importantly, the regional cities initiative from daniels' successor, mike pence, vastly enabled the types of policies buttigieg was working toward. if there is a single state or national policy that boosted south bend's prospects, it flowed from the pence administration's visionary efforts. buttigieg's book gives too little credit to pence's regional cities initiative. moreover, other mayors in indiana, particularly kokomo's greg goodnight, were more successful in generating long-term change.\n\nread:pete buttigieg wants 'the mike pences of the world' to know his same-sex marriage 'moved me closer to god'\n\nstill, south bend is poised for an economic recovery, maybe even a renaissance. it will take time, maybe another two decades with lots of hard work. when it does come, it seems clear to me that residents of this long-troubled rust belt town can look back to pete

roses are red. and debt is too. but if you owe too much money, i'm not dating you. sadly, that's how a lot of finance-conscious americans feel about romance in 2018.\n\nthis is the time of year when people sign up to dating sites in the hope they don't see in the new year alone. but they're fussy, especially when it comes to three little digits.\n\ngiven that many people are finally getting back on their feet after the great recession and now looking at an eerily familiar sight of a stock market gripped by turbulence, it's probably understandable. more than 77% of people consider credit-card debt unattractive, according to a survey released earlier this year by personal-finance site finder.com. on average, people say $11,525 in credit-card debt is enough of a red flag to swipe left or walk away.\n\nrecommended:do americans marry for love or money? finally, an answer\n\npayday loans, which can have astronomical interest rates as high as 400%, are the second most unacceptable forms of debt for daters. as such, it only takes a payday loan of $1,830 to turn off a potential partner. surprisingly, given that americans carry $1.4 trillion in student debt, student loans are also off-putting to prospective dates and, on average, anything above $51,000 could be a deal-breaker. that's considerably higher than the average student debt balance of $37,000.\n\nfinancial instability, debt and the american dream\n\nmillennials are the least tolerant of student loans: over 80% consider it unacceptable in a partner, followed by credit-card debt and payday loans. generation x-ers appear to be the most tolerant generation when it comes to debt of any form, although payday loans sit highest for most unacceptable (75% find them a turn off), followed by credit card debt and student loans. with the exception of student loans, baby boomers considered all kinds of debt unacceptable.\n\ndon't miss:my fiancé wants me to move into the home he shared with his ex-wife — and help with his mortgage\n\nwhat people do and say in the early days of dating might have an impact later on. people are combining their finances when they marry, after all, and that can impact their future happiness. in fact, the higher your credit score, the less likely you'll separate from your partner. more than half of americans (58%) said they wouldn't marry someone with significant debt, according to a separate study released last year by legal industry site avvo.\n\nand for those who marry someone with bad credit, high debts and a reckless attitude to money? it can be detrimental to their own financial future and, ultimately, lead to discord in their marriage. a cautionary note: debts incurred during the marriage are, under certain state laws, are considered community property. if your spouse has run up a large amount of debt in their name during the marriage and you divorce, you too will likely be responsible.
not even harry potter could pull this one out of his book of spells.\n\nj.k. rowling celebrated the publication of her first harry potter book 20 years ago this week and thanked her 10.9 million fans on twitter. but as she told this bbc television interviewer, her publishers advised her against putting joanne rowling on the book jacket. so rowling did what mary anne evans did when she used the pseudonym george elliot more than a century earlier.\n\nshe used her initials, which led young boys to assume she was a man.\n\nthat was the publisher's choice rather than mine. i think they thought j.k. rowling was a more memorable name, she said. they might have wanted to hoodwink a few boys into thinking a man had written it. similarly, rowling's follow-up detective novel to her harry potter series, which she initially tried to publish anonymously, was written under the pen name robert galbraith.\n\nthe harry potter franchise has earned billions of dollars. the sunday times listed rowling as a billionaire, but forbes magazine removed the author from its own list of billionaires four years ago, citing her 160 million pounds ($203 million) in charity donations and high u.k. tax rate. after her latest film, fantastic beasts, some estimates put her back at (or close to) billionaire status.\n\nit's no surprise that rowling had to hide her gender, says kelsy kretschmer, assistant professor at the school of public policy at oregon state university's college of liberal arts. studies have shown that women fare much better in auditions for orchestras when the judges cannot see their gender and when students think they are being taught by a man, they evaluate them better.\n\nand this study published in the american sociological review last year showed that even women from very elite colleges get evaluated as less desirable job candidates by 316 top law firm offices in 14 cities, because of assumptions that they will be less committed to full-time, intensive careers than their male counterparts. men, not women, benefited in this elite labor market.\n\nunder these circumstances, it makes sense that when they can, women will disguise their identities in order to reduce the penalties associated with their gender, kretschmer says. there is just a raft of research that shows gate keepers make assumptions about women they don't make about men, outside of actual measurable ability, and use those assumptions against women disproportionately.\n\nwomen are too often held to a higher standard and countless double standards too, as we face down stereotypes that don't apply equally to men, says jennifer weiss-wolf, vice president for development at the brennan center for justice, a law and policy institute at nyu. men, she says, are never called bossy. is it any wonder we might want to pass as a man to avoid those inequities?\n\n 'thankfully, it is all of our privilege to know who the real j.k. rowling is. she is a role model for young readers, girls and boys alike.'  — jennifer weiss-wolf, vice president for development at the brennan center for justice\n\na publisher reportedly told s.e. hinton, author of the teen classic the outsiders, first published 50 years ago, to abbreviate her name (susan eloise) so male reviewers wouldn't dismiss her book. even today, there is still residual negative stigma about the idea of soft female fluffy content turning off rugged masculine men from written material, says fran walfish, a beverly hills psychotherapist.\n\nmany female authors have successfully inhabited the minds of male characters: carol shields (larry's party), donna tartt (the secret history), mary shelley (frankenstein), ayn rand (the fountainhead), adelle waldman (the love affairs of nathaniel p.), doris lessing (the golden notebook) and, most recently, gillian flynn (gone girl, which explores marriage and murder).\n\nbias runs so deep in our culture that we all make assumptions that can interfere with our ability to experience a text at face value, says kat gordon, an advertising creative director in palo alto, calif. my mother is a fiction writer and her very best piece — told in the first-person from the point of view of a vietnam vet — didn't get published until she initialized her first name.\n\npublishers somehow couldn't make the jump from a female author's name at the top of the page and a male protagonist's story beneath, she adds. it was like a cognitive bottleneck. my fear is that every time a female author hides her gender, we reinforce stereotypes about what subjects women can cover authoritatively and even how deserving female authors are to be read in the first place.\n\nalso see:why millions of teenage girls need 'wonder woman' now more than ever\n\n a publisher told s.e. hinton, author of the teen classic 'the outsiders,' which was first published 50 years ago, to abbreviate her name so male reviewers wouldn't dismiss her book. \n\nrowling's female heroine, hermione granger — who would be in her late 30s today — was just as skilled a wizard as harry, but in the real world she would face obstacles related to her gender. today some women are afraid to take maternity leave, perhaps fearing career breaks and paid leave could take a toll on their career, says lisa maatz, a political analyst on women and public policy.\n\ndon't miss: meet amazon's first customer — this is the book he bought\n\nif women are going to make real economic progress, congress must take legislative action, she says. maatz is a proponent of the proposed paycheck fairness act, an update to the equal pay act that aims to create stronger incentives for employers to follow the law, protect workers from retaliation for discussing wages and strengthen enforcement efforts.\n\ncombining data for full- and part-time work, women earn 83% of what men earn, according to the pew research center, a nonprofit think-tank based in washington, d.c. based on this estimate, it would take 44 days of extra work for women to earn what men did that year. the u.s. census bureau found that women full-time workers earn around 80% of what their male counterparts earned.\n\nread also: this is what american teenagers want to be when they grow up\n\nwhile there have been some very high profile cases of wage discrimination based on gender, gender pay gap figures don't adjust for job choice and duration, which all influence pay. women dominate fields like education, which are not typically high-paying, and take costly career breaks to raise children. men dominate it, math, engineering and sciences, which tend to have higher-paying jobs.\n\n 'even today, there is still residual negative stigma about the idea of soft female fluffy content turning off rugged masculine men from written material.'  — fran walfish, a beverly hills psychotherapist\n\nmore than 25% of all employed working women are in jobs that pay less than $15 an hour and the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations in the world that does not require employers to offer paid parental leave. of 186 countries examined by the world policy analysis centre adult labor database, 96% provide some pay to women during maternity leave. the u.s. is not one of them.\n\nbias lingers about certain jobs — nurses and care givers — being for women. many men do not want to associate themselves with feminine preferences, walfish says. for the longest time, i didn't know j.k. rowling was a woman. men who are truly comfortable with their sexual identities are at ease with both sexes, as well as reading materials written by both men and women, she says.\n\ntoday, rowling stands as a powerful female force in literature, philanthropy, politics, social justice and even twitter where she on occasion mercilessly skewers president donald trump. thankfully, it is all of our privilege to know who the real j.k. rowling is, jennifer weiss-wolf says. she is a role model for young readers, girls and boys alike.
time to splurge.\n\nwhile march doesn't have a huge volume of new series and movies (netflix excepted), it seems almost every streaming service has one or two or three high-quality, highly promising and star-studded new offerings — and budget-minded consumers might have to face the fact that if they want to see all the good stuff, they're going to have to splurge a bit. for a month, at least.\n\nas we have previously mentioned, consumers can take full advantage of cord-cutting by capitalizing on the ability to add and drop streaming services each month, and all it takes is good planning and timing. remember, a billing cycle starts when you sign up, not necessarily at the beginning of each month.\n\nconsumers can also take advantage of deals for free streaming trials, as disney and apple in particular focus on building subscriber bases rather than growing revenue (for the time being, at least). you're never going to get a better deal than free, and the offers won't last forever.\n\nread:how to get disney+, apple tv+, amazon prime video or netflix for 'free' — and what to know before you sign up\n\nfree possibilities aside, when it's time to decide where your subscription dollars should go, what's worth streaming will be here to help. we will rate each major streaming service every month as a play, pause or stop, similar to investment analysts' ratings of buy, hold and sell, and pick the best content that will help you make your monthly decisions.\n\nhere's a look at what's coming to the various streaming services in march 2020, and what's really worth the monthly subscription fee.\n\nnetflix ($8.99 or $12.99 a month)\n\nnetflix nflx, +0.73% is relying on big names and sheer quantity in march.\n\nafter a year-and-a-half hiatus, the super dark (in both tone and lighting) ozark, starring jason bateman and laura linney, returns for a third season (march 27). it's reportedly one of netflix's most-watched shows, and season 3 will doubtlessly feature more terrible decisions as the byrde family adjusts from just trying to stay alive to actively leaning into a life of crime as they run their new casino, all the while trying to stay one step ahead of the law, the casino union, and oh yeah, a murderous drug cartel.\n\nremember the '80s robert urich private-eye show spenser: for hire? well, netflix is rebooting the classic character from the robert b. parker novels with a movie, spenser confidential (march 6), starring mark wahlberg as the former boston cop/ex-con solving mysteries with his buddy, hawk (winston duke, in the iconic avery brooks role). peter berg directs, and it looks to be about what you would expect — a pulpy, dumb-but-fun action-comedy. there are a ton of stories in the spenser universe, so if it's a hit, don't be surprised if this becomes a recurring movie series.\n\namy ryan and octavia spencer are two of hollywood's most reliably watchable actresses, and each has an offering in march that will likely be worth watching. ryan's lost girls (march 13) is a based-on-real-events movie about a mother whose dogged effort to find her missing daughter helps uncover a string of unsolved murders on long island. spencer stars in the limited series self made: inspired by the life of madam c.j. walker (march 20), the true story of an african-american woman whose haircare empire made her america's first female self-made millionaire.\n\nmeanwhile, a ton of foreign-language series are coming (sorry, is that a metric ton then?), including season 3 of germany's babylon berlin, a lavish mystery set in 1929 berlin which this column heartily recommended last month, before its release date was pushed back to march 1. then there's the german miniseries unorthodox (march 26), about a young jewish woman exploring her identity and building a new life after fleeing to berlin to escape an arranged marriage by an ultraorthodox sect. it's based on a bestselling memoir and directed by maria schrader, who did the excellent german spy series deutschland 83, and could be very good. spain's elite (march 13) is also back for a third season, with rich kids and poor kids scheming away following a murder at a prestigious private school. it has a good gossip girl-like balance of trashy teen melodrama and super-addictive twists, and there are certainly worse ways to spend a blustery march weekend than by uncorking a cheap bottle of spanish tempranillo and bingeing the new season. also on the binge-worthy radar of international shows that are fun but won't test your brain: turkey's weird, supernatural thriller the protector (march 6); south korea's kingdom (march 13), a zombie thriller set in medieval korea; and norway's horror anthology bloodride (march 13).\n\nback in the real world, comedian and podcaster marc maron has a new stand-up special, end times fun (march 10), and new seasons of chef david chang's food travelogueugly delicious (march 6), and dirty money (march 11), a docuseries about corporate creed and corruption, are on tap.\n\nread:here's everything coming to netflix in march 2020 — and what's leaving\n\nthere's a lot more too. as mentioned before, sheer quantity in march.\n\nplay, pause or stop? play. streaming is a volume game, and netflix continues to have the most volume.\n\namazon prime video ($12.99 a month)\n\namazon prime video lacks the sheer volume of originals, but the quality is there. march will add four more that should be worthy watches.\n\nthe most high-profile offering is making the cut (march 27), a fashion-design competition from former project runway icons heidi klum and tim gunn. it comes on the stylish heels of netfix's next in fashion and just after the conclusion of a new season of project runway on bravo, which threatens to saturate the market for viewers. but the big names, bigger budget and sheer talent of its participants could elevate making the cut. i would say 'project runway' is the undergraduate program, 'making the cut' is the graduate and phd program, gunn said in january at the television critics' association press tour. twelve designers will face off to create the next big global fashion brand, with a whopping $1 million prize on the line. being as it's amazon.com inc. amzn, +0.33% , the winning designs will also be available to buy immediately after each episode airs (10 episodes, dropping once a week after a two-episode debut). bottom line: whether you're into fashion or not, if you enjoy watching very talented people doing what they do best, you'll probably enjoy this.\n\nread:here's everything coming to amazon prime video in march 2020\n\namazon will also roll out a miniseries adaptation of agatha christie's the pale horse (march 13), starring the creepy-yet-captivating rufus sewell as an ordinary man thrust into a murder investigation after his name is found on a list in a dead woman's shoe — and everyone else on the list is dead. mystery ensues. then there's zerozerozero (march 6), a sprawling crime epic tracing the global cocaine trade, from mexican cartels to italian mafiosos to american businessmen — think a blend of narcos, gomorrah (from the same producers) and traffic. there's a lot to unravel, and the scale of the story seems perhaps too ambitious and dark, since it's pretty much all bad guys — and you know things won't end happily. but if pulled off correctly, this could be compelling.\n\namazon also has one original movie, the quirky thriller blow the man down (march 20), which drew raves at last year's tribeca film festival. it's about a pair of sisters on the coast of maine, a grisly death and their attempt to cover it up, and veers from dark comedy to breathless suspense. while it only has a handful of critics' reviews on rotten tomatoes, it's also got a 100% fresh score, which makes one think this could be a hidden gem.\n\nplay, pause or stop? play. there looks to be legitimately good stuff rolling out in every week of march.\n\nhulu ($5.99 a month or $11.99 with no ads)\n\nhulu has always been good, but march just might be the month it becomes great.\n\nin the wake of last year's purchase of fox entertainment assets by walt disney co. dis, -1.28% , which owns a majority of hulu, march 2 will see the launch of fx on hulu, as one of cable's most high-quality channels migrates most of its series, past and present, to their new exclusive streaming home. that includes the shield, justified, sons of anarchy, atlanta, it's always sunny in philadelphia and much, much more. hulu viewers will also get new episodes of current fx shows the day after they air on cable.\n\nthe deal will also include new series exclusive to hulu, the first of which is devs,a limited sci-fi series from alex garland, director of two of the most brain-popping sci-fi movies of recent years, ex machina and annihilation. the series stars sonoya mizuno as a software engineer in the near-future who suspects the head of a quantum-computing company (nick offerman) was behind her boyfriend's disappearance. as with all things alex garland, don't expect a laid-back story where your mind can stray as you fiddle with your phone — there's gonna be some trippy, existential, techno-religious stuff coming your way. that'll turn off some potential viewers, but should be right up the hard-core-nerd crowd's alley.\n\noh, have we not mentioned reese witherspoon and kerry washington yet? the two hollywood heavyweights teamed up to produce and star in little fires everywhere (march 18), a limited series based on the bestselling novel by celeste ng, about two mothers who must confront issues of race, class and privilege when their lives cross paths. this is pretty much the definition of prestige tv in 2020, and here's a prediction: you'll be hearing about it again come emmy time.\n\nspeaking of emmy bait, hulu will also roll out a deep-dive into the life of hillary clinton, in the four-episode docuserieshillary (march 6). reviews have called it messy yet compelling, which sounds about right for a portrait of one of the more divisive public figures of our politically partisan era.\n\nread: here's what's new on hulu in march 2020, and what's going away\n\nplay, pause or stop? play. the addition of most of fx's library alone makes hulu worth the price. add the new offerings, and it's a no-brainer.\n\ndisney+ ($6.99 a month)\n\nthere's not a lot coming to disney+ in march, but — spoiler alert — you'll probably still be willing to pay for it.\n\nthe two big original premieres are stargirl (march 13), a romance movie about a pair of teen misfits, and be our chef (march 27), a family cooking competition where teams make meals inspired by disney characters and get judged by disney chefs. (hey, did you know you're watching a disney production?) it looks like nothing that hasn't been done already by food network (family food showdown) and netflix (the big family cooking showdown).\n\nbut disney+ will also be adding one of the biggest blockbuster movies ever — the superhero smash black panther — along with 2018's teen fantasy a wrinkle in time and kids' faves ice age and doctor dolittle 2.\n\nplay, pause or stop? pause. if you don't have kids who will revolt, then there's really no reason to subscribe in march. however, if you do have kids, disney's vast vault will likely still make it worth your money.\n\napple tv+ ($4.99 a month)\n\napple tv+ is getting there, and in march will add one more big name to its limited lineup.\n\nthat would be steven spielberg, who acts as executive producer for his reimagined anthology series amazing stories (march 6), which originally ran on nbc from 1985-'87. not quite sci-fi, the series is billed as stories of wonder, five of which will span the 10-episode season, with appearances from kerry bishé (halt and catch fire), josh holloway (lost) and the final acting performance by robert forster before his death. maintaining consistent quality in an anthology series is tough to pull off, but apple's done it already with the very good little america, and there's enough talent (and cough cough, money spent) to make it work here too.\n\nalso on the slate is the long-delayed premiere of the banker (march 20), which at one point was a potential oscar contender before it got its release pulled after one of the movie's co-producers — and son of one of the movie's protagonists, played by anthony mackie — was accused of sexual misconduct. the banker is the first movie to be distributed by apple inc. aapl, +1.27% , and stars samuel l. jackson and mackie as real-life pair of african-american entrepreneurs who use a white man to be the public face of their business as they fight for housing integration and equal access to banking in the 1960s. it'll get a limited theatrical release starting march 6.\n\nplay, pause or stop? stop. there's still not enough in apple's content library to make it worth the admittedly low price, but for consumers who are already getting it for free, there's finally enough there to make it worth a look (including the satisfying workplace comedy mythic quest, which launched last month).\n\ncbs all access ($5.99 a month or $9.99 with no ads)\n\nstar trek: picard has reportedly broken streaming records for viacomcbs's viac, -0.09% cbs all access service. and for budget-minded fans who've been waiting to binge, now's the time.\n\nthe sci-fi spinoff, starring patrick stewart in the iconic role, wraps up its 10-episode first season march 26, and signing up for the streaming service in march should give plenty of time to slow-binge the whole season in time to watch the season finale the day it drops.\n\nfor everyone else, though, there's not much there. the service still has very little original content, though that will likely change later this year, when it expands to add viacom shows, paramount movies and potentially showtime content.\n\nplay, pause or stop? stop. unless you're a die-hard star trek fan, it's just not worth it.\n\nmike murphy is a marketwatch editor and former tv blogger who still watches way too much tv. follow him on twitter at @mmmmurf or email your streaming questions to mmurphy@marketwatch.com.
dear moneyist,\n\ncan i protect my credit and not lose my family? i live in wisconsin, which is a community property state. my husband does not have the best financial history, which has led to him filling bankruptcy prior to our marriage. he has now attempted to get a loan several times and he has not been approved.\n\n i am not comfortable with acquiring new debt, but also fear this will begin to place a strain on our marriage. his bad credit score is ruining our marriage. i have placed a freeze on my credit with all three credit bureaus.  — jacinta in milwaukee\n\nit is very concerning to me because we are married, i am liable for any debt he carries. i am not comfortable with acquiring new debt, but also fear this will begin to place a strain on our marriage. his bad credit score is ruining our marriage. i have placed a freeze on my credit with all three credit bureaus. is there anything else i can do to protect myself?\n\njacinta in milwaukee\n\ndear jacinta,\n\nhis credit score isn't ruining your marriage. but his inability to manage his money is destroying your peace of mind. and with good reason.\n\nyou can read more about whether you are liable for your husband's debt here. debts incurred during the marriage are, under wisconsin family law, considered community property. if your spouse has run up a large amount of debt in their name during the marriage and you divorce, you will likely be responsible, according to the fitzgerald law firm in beloit, wisc. and this applies even if your husband dies.\n\nyou're not the only one to worry about your husband's credit score, but it's important to know where the line is drawn. this stepmother wrote in because her husband had co-signed on his children's student loans. she was worried about her husband's finances and how that would impact her if, for instance, he died or one of her stepchildren died. but even if your husband went bankrupt, that would not impact your credit score.\n\n a low credit score could increase the finance charges on a $20,000, 60-month car loan by more than $5,000.  — the moneyist\n\na credit score between 661 and 780 is considered good and one between 781 and 850 is regarded as excellent, according to financial website credit.com. the site rates fair credit as between 601 and 660, poor credit between 501 and 600 and bad credit as anything below 500.\n\nthere are ways it your husband's bad credit score can impact you: if you co-mingle your finances to take out a mortgage or a loan (or if you feel like you will be carrying the financial load now or in retirement) i understand why you are spooked. if you want to buy a home with your husband or even a car then, yes, it becomes your problem.\n\nbanks will look at your combined credit score and you will either (a) be refused or (b) end up paying a higher rate of interest. a low credit score could increase the finance charges on a $20,000, 60-month car loan by more than $5,000, according to the consumer federation of america, a consumer advocacy group.\n\n​what does-and doesn't-affect your credit score\n\ndon't miss:my boyfriend has $40,000 in student debt and two kids\n\nit's not surprising that some single people take credit scores as the most important number when choosing a partner. nearly 40% of adults say knowing someone's credit score would affect their willingness to date that person, according to a survey released earlier this year of 1,000 adults by personal finance website bankrate.com.\n\nit's a more important factor for women (43%) than men (32%) and college graduates (47%) than those with just a high school education (29%). and 50% of people with annual household income of $75,000 or more would prefer to know someone's credit score before dating them.\n\nyou have the cut of your husband's jib. don't sign any loans with your husband and, as his wife, try to help him budget with the help of a financial adviser, if necessary. that means paying bills on time, paying his taxes promptly and not over-extending himself.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear moneyologist,\n\ni'm planning to divorce my husband of eight years, as he's never worked in this time or contributed to bills. we live in california, a community property state. we live in a house which i bought before the marriage for $700,000, and it's appreciated to $1.2 million. i continue to pay my mortgage on it. i don't have much in savings, just $20,000, and $100,000 in retirement. is there anything i can do to protect my money? should i put extra money towards my car or house payments? should i send money to my parents?\n\nunlucky in california\n\ndear unlucky,\n\nyou could do that, but a judge is likely to notice your sudden generous payments towards your mortgage and car loan, and could even penalize you for them. that's the kind of surreptitious action that has gone against others years after the fact. in 1996, a california woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later. she didn't tell her husband or anyone else about her windfall, and two years later her husband found out about it (they always do) and sued her. superior court judge richard denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. had she been honest, they both would have walked away with half.\n\nlisten to our new podcast:money, markets & more (or subscribe on itunes): walking a mile in dead men's shoes and millennials tap home equity for frivolities.\n\nin most divorce cases, especially in california which is a community property state, couples are instructed to divide their shared assets down the middle (in monetary terms) and, as part of that settlement, they're allowed to keep what they own personally, such as clothing and jewelry. in your state, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it, but this grows more complicated when a home has appreciated during a marriage and/or when marital assets were used to pay the mortgage (even though, in this case, your husband never actually worked). i'm not against your giving a little money to your parents if they need it for a specific reason, but not to hide it before your divorce is over. if you do have to split those savings, $10,000 is a small price to pay for your freedom. (interestingly, i told a similar thing to a fellow earlier this week, who learned a $10,000 lesson.) one more consideration: you may need that $10,000 in savings for legal fees.\n\n you could spend your savings, but a judge is likely to see your sudden generous payments to your mortgage and car, and could even penalize you for them. that's the kind of surreptitious action that is likely to go against you in the long run.  — the moneyologist\n\nwhat's more, the judge is likely to take into account that your husband never worked over this time, or paid the bills, and a good lawyer will make sure that's front and center in your divorce case should your husband's lawyer ask for alimony in lieu of you living in your house (sorry to bring that up). the upside: alimony is tax-deductible for the payer and must be reported as income by the payee. divide it all down the middle, start over and look to the future, says randy kessler, an atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, divorce: protect yourself, your kids, and your future. you should feel better that when the case is over, you will still have a job and can replenish so even if it is all divided, you will still be better off than him. it pays to have a good (and honest) divorce lawyer.\n\nthere are so many dirty deals that happen before people file for divorce. i recently heard of a case where a husband took $1 million equity out of the home that he lived in with his wife (his name was on the deed) shortly before they filed for divorce. that's the kind of paper trail that leads all the way back to a disgruntled judge in divorce court. i've had so many letters in recent months from or about people who want to pull a fast one: the wife who wanted to disinherit her stepchildren in the event that her husband of one year dies, and even a psychotherapist who wanted to be in cahoots with his client to cheat the insurance company.\n\nyou've lived honorably up until now and paid your own way and, yes, your husband was a mooch. leave this marriage with your head held high and don't let him change who you are.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
brad pitt, ensconced in missoni and armani for a sweeping gq interview published wednesday, dishes on everything from the breakup of his family to his drinking problem to his newfound appreciation for rebar to sleeping on a friend's floor.\n\nthe fight club star, who says he grew up with that ozarkian mistrust of politics, also touched on the current state of our country.
dear moneyist,\n\non may 30, 2018 my mother moved out all her belongings and informed my father that she was leaving him after 30 years of marriage, and that she would be seeking a divorce.\n\nno papers had been filed at that point. the next day my father went to work and claimed that he was divorced and wanted to change the beneficiary of his pension plan over to his mother instead of his wife. they believed him and let him change the beneficiary. the following day, he took all of his guns over to his mother's house and took his own life.\n\nrecommended: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nnow my grandmother and my mother are fighting over the pension. i know he didn't list me as the beneficiary as he knew i would share the money with my mom if she needed it. my grandmother and mother both have lawyers, and they both say that they are going to get this pension. it's been dragging on for nearly two years.\n\nlast month, they finally had a deposition during which my grandmother lied under oath. that required me to do a deposition. they asked painful questions, as i have not quite come to terms with my dad's suicide. i don't want this to get dragged into a long saga, where i have to go to court again. i don't expect to get any of this pension, nor do i want any of it. it was my dad's money.\n\nmom probably would have been entitled to half if they divorced. the way i see it grandma should get half and my mom should get half. what's your opinion?\n\ntired of being caught in the middle\n\ndear caught,\n\nit sounds like you have been through a terrible ordeal and the ongoing fracas over your father's pension has compounded that trauma. i can understand why you are eager to put all of this behind you and wish that your grandmother and mother would lay down their swords, so you can all move on with your lives. people are grieving and, i imagine, both sad and angry. your grandmother will do her best to ensure that she is the sole beneficiary.\n\nalso see:my stepfather and mother pooled resources to buy a home. my mom died in 2003 and he just passed away. his kids are selling their house c am i entitled to anything?\n\nwe could speculate about what might have happened had your father lived and your parents had gotten a divorce, but divorce law varies by state, and permission to remove a spouse as a pension beneficiary falls under federal law. it's easier and, perhaps, wiser to deal with what happened rather than what would have happened if they had developed differently. your parents were still married when your father died and unfortunately he lied to change the beneficiary on his pension.\n\nalso see: 'my daughter has been chiding me for frivolously spending her inheritance. now she won't speak to me'\n\nthe court and/or company will likely make a ruling sooner rather than later, and that will take it out of your mother and grandmother's hands. the healthiest move for you now would be to remove yourself from the feud between these two women and, even better, ask them not to discuss the issue with you. this is a stressful enough time, and feeling trapped between these two family matriarchs cannot be easy. my hunch is the court will find in favor of your mother.\n\nalso see: 'he owed a lot of back taxes.' my ex-husband forgot to split a $100,000 investment account — then he died. can his estate come after me for the money?\n\nmy view is your grandmother should abide by the law: your parents were not divorced when your father died and, as such, your grandmother had no legal right to this pension. would it be nice for your mother to split the pension with your grandmother and vice-versa? sure. however, given that your grandmother is vying for the entire pension, i don't see them coming to such a resolution anytime soon. the onus here, in my opinion, is on your grandmother to stand down.\n\nin the meantime, take care of yourself and remove yourself from this acrimonious situation.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nread also: 'he owed a lot of back taxes.' my ex-husband forgot to split a $100,000 investment account — then he died. can his estate come after me for the money?\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.\n\ndon't miss:my father left everything to my son. when i called the attorney about the will, my son got very upset. i now need financial help. should i ask him for money?
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nlisa lawler, 61, thought her husband's affair was the final nail in the coffin for ending her 26-year marriage. then, a month after he moved out in 2006, she learned he had embezzled $2.5 million from the health-care company he worked for in massachusetts.\n\ni got a call from him saying, 'you have to get home immediately,' lawler says. i was afraid something happened to our son.\n\nshe raced home and he sat her down to reveal the news. i said, 'you're crazy.' it was surreal.\n\n nearly 69% of white-collar criminals are men, according to the association of certified fraud examiners. \n\nthe news prompted her to file for a divorce one year later in 2007. she sold her home in massachusetts, and moved to austin, texas with her son.\n\nshe lived off the money she made from the sale of her massachusetts home which, she says, was around $200,000. her husband was sentenced to 24 months in jail in november 2009.\n\nlawler's own emotional and legal trauma inspired her to start a blog in 2013 called white-collar wives club, an online support group to de-stigmatize the shame families of white-collar criminals often face, and help educate women like her get through the legal process and financial hardships of having to start over again after losing everything.\n\nlisa lawler started her own blog 'the white collar-wives project' after her ex-husband was sent to jail for embezzling $2.5 million dollars. courtesy of lisa lawler\n\nshe writes on her blog with candor: they took everything, including my husband.\n\nnearly 69% of white-collar crimes are committed by men, according to a 2016 report from the association of certified fraud examiners. as a result, their wives are often times left financially crippled, in addition to facing the social shame and judgment associated with their husband's crimes.\n\ndon't miss:6 white-collar criminals for hire\n\nlawler, who had a job in social services before her son was born, had been out of the workforce for 20 years while she was married. her husband supported the family on his $150,000 annual salary. in austin, she started her career from scratch, getting a job as a visual merchandiser at a big box store – creating clothing displays and decorating for the holidays — making $14 an hour.\n\nit was like going to the gym for 10 hours a day, she says. i had no choice, i had to pay the bills.\n\n in march 2010, after her husband had been in jail for four months, she was hit with a $384,000 tax bill. \n\nin march 2010, after her husband had been in jail for four months, she was hit with a $384,000 tax bill. i thought 'what the hell is this?' she called the name on the bill. talk about being left with the tab, she recalls.\n\nwhen spouses file a joint tax return they are both held liable, and can be financially responsible for a tax bill if their partner falsely reports or omits items on their tax return.\n\nlawler's husband had omitted to disclose the money he had embezzled between 2006 and 2007. people in lawler's position can request what's called innocent spouse relief from the irs, which takes them off the hook for paying tax, interest or penalties on improperly reported income for which had no knowledge of.\n\nthose who do not qualify for innocent spouse relief can apply for equitable relief if they can prove they are suffering from a significant economic hardship and cannot afford basic living expenses. in 2017, there were 3,407 appeals for innocent spouse relief by the irs, the most recent statistic available.\n\nit took me six months to get out from under that, lawler said. how can we report income that we didn't know existed?\n\nwhen a white-collar criminal can't pay up the court-ordered money from a legal settlement or restitution for financial crimes, the government can seize property owned by both spouses, including houses, cars or money.\n\n 'i went from riches to rags. i moved out of my house days later. i left with nothing. i sold whatever i could.'  — jenny, 40, whose husband pleaded guilty to wire-fraud in 2017\n\nhowever, an innocent spouse can argue that she has a right to keep any accounts that weren't connected to the financial fraud, even if they signed the tax returns, says stuart slotnick, a pittsburgh-based attorney who specializes in divorce and matrimonial law.\n\nit basically says that you're not responsible for the penalties that are associated with filing a false tax return because you were an innocent spouse, he adds.\n\nlong island, new york native jenny, 40, who asked to be identified by her first name only, went from lavish vacations to key largo and driving a mercedes-benz to the country club to losing everything she owned when her ex-husband, a former investment adviser.\n\nhe pleaded guilty in 2017 to wire fraud in connection with a scheme to defraud investors using his babylon, n.y.-based investment advising business.\n\nthey divorced in august, 2018. her ex-husband agreed to pay $5.3 million in restitution to victims, forfeit $215,000 in proceeds and was sentenced to 57 months in prison last april.\n\ni went from riches to rags, jenny told marketwatch. i moved out of my house days later. i left with nothing. i sold whatever i could. she made $2,000 selling furniture and household goods, hardly putting a dent in what she paid for it all.\n\nlike lawler, jenny was hit with a massive tax bill from 2015, this time for $85,000. she was also on the hook for a $40,000 credit-card bill.\n\n jenny, the wife of a white-collar criminal, declared bankruptcy and took jobs for little above the minimum wage. \n\nhe lied on his taxes, and now i'm stuck with paying, she said. she chose to declare chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nsince the split from her now ex-husband, jenny worked for little above minimum wage as a camp counselor, starbucks barista sbux, +2.24% , and waitress to make ends meet. she's currently living with her parents and two kids in long island.\n\njenny applied for innocent spouse relief in june 2017, but says she was denied. she reapplied two weeks ago, and says she's waiting to hear if she's been approved.\n\nsome 100 women join from the u.s. and as far afield as france, new zealand and canada have joined her white-collar wives club. the women offer advice on topics like how to apply for innocent spouse relief, navigating legal woes like asset forfeiture or asset seizure (when assets are confiscated by the state) and how to protect her fair share of marital assets.\n\ni began blogging about the social stigma and the horror of learning your husband's a crook, she said. she has advice for other wives out there: be careful what you sign because it can come back to haunt you years later.
when most people get married, they have love on their minds.\n\nif (or when) they get divorced, it's usually all about the money.\n\noccasional novelist and former wall street research associate mackenzie bezos, 48, could end up banking about $7.4 million for every single day she was married to amazon boss jeff bezos, financial records show.\n\nmackenzie, who once said, i have no business sense whatsoever, may still walk away with around half the couple's roughly $139 billion fortune ($69.5 billion) as a result of their divorce, which was announced wednesday.\n\n that would make her the richest woman in the world and probably in history. she'd be 26 times richer than oprah winfrey and more than 100 times richer than the queen of england. \n\nthat would make her the richest woman in the world and probably in history. she'd be 26 times richer than oprah winfrey and more than a hundred times richer than the queen of england.\n\n(amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nmackenzie, who has published two novels during her career, would also end up about 70 times richer than fellow novelist j.k. rowling, whose harry potter books, movies and spin-offs have netted their creator a comparatively paltry $1 billion.\n\nsales of mackenzie's two novels, the testing of luther albright and traps are unknown. one received just 77 reviews on the website founded by her husband. the other received 20 reviews.\n\ntraps is described on amazon thus: reclusive movie star jessica lessing is finally coming out of hiding — to confront her father, a con man who has been selling her out to the paparazzi for years. the amazon description for her other novel reads: luther albright is a devoted father and a designer of dams, a self-controlled man who believes he can engineer happiness for his family by sheltering them from his own emotions.\n\n 'luther albright is a devoted father and a designer of dams, a self-controlled man who believes he can engineer happiness for his family by sheltering them from his own emotions.'  — amazon description from mackenzie bezos's novel, 'the testing of luther albright'\n\njeff and mackenzie bezos have been married for 25 years. they met when he hired her to work for wall street hedge fund firm d.e. shaw in the early 1990s, biographers have said. jeff bezos was a vice-president at the time.\n\njeff bezos graduated from princeton in 1986, after majoring in electrical engineering and computer science. mackenzie graduated from the same college six years later. she majored in english, with a certificate in creative writing, says princeton.\n\nfinancial details of the bezos separation are being closely guarded, but the couple live in washington state, where amazon has its headquarters. if you're married to someone rich and you're going to get divorced, this is one of the best states in which to do it, say legal experts.\n\nwashington is among a handful of so-called community property states in the u.s., where most marital assets are simply split 50/50 regardless of who made the money or how. such rules can even override prenuptial agreements, say experts.\n\n washington is among a handful of so-called 'community property' states in the u.s., where most marital assets are simply split 50/50 regardless of who made the money or how. \n\nwashington is a community property state, says spokane, wash. financial advisor sarah carlson. in a community property state, everything is 50/50, she said. even if you have a prenup, there's a lot of precedent in the courts that ruled in favor of ignoring it.\n\nthere's little reason to believe the court would do anything other than divide up those assets 50/50, agrees seattle divorce lawyer david starks, a partner in the washington law firm mckinley irvin.\n\nthe pair were married in 1993, before jeff bezos launched amazon, so the wealth has all been made since the marriage and would probably count as community property, experts say.\n\nmackenzie bezos' windfall would take her wealth way beyond that of wal-mart wmt, -0.03% heiress alice walton, currently the world's richest woman with approximately $46 billion. it would also make her richer by far than almost any other entrepreneur or business person of either sex. she could buy sergey brin, the co-founder of google goog, +1.26% , one and a half times over.\n\nby most measures, indeed, mackenzie bezos will be worth more than any other woman in history, although some fanciful estimates suggest egyptian empress cleopatra and russia's catherine the great might have had more.
dear moneyist,\n\ni dated a guy for a couple of months, but we agreed to just be friends. he wanted to continue to date, but respected my choice. over a couple of years, we have gotten together monthly for dinner and have enjoyed a great friendship. he is a major introvert, has a long career at the national security agency, has few friends and has never been married (no kids).\n\nthis past november he was diagnosed with stage iv lung disease, which has metastasized throughout his body. he has been told the median time frame for him to live is 6 months. i have helped him with doctors, went to an appointment with him, and remain as a close support.\n\n he asked me to marry him, so i would receive his social security in addition to his health-care benefits. he has made the case to me over several meetings. \n\nhe has asked me to be his estate trustee and i agreed to that. he is upset that the portion of his pension that the government contributed to over the last 30-plus years will be lost. he asked me to marry him, so i would receive this, in addition to his health-care benefits. he is clear-eyed about this and has made the case to me over several meetings.\n\ni am 62, work hard at a modest career with a huge commute, put away 30% each paycheck into retirement, and have been divorced and have never intended to remarry for any reason. my financial independence has been hard fought. i have job security for at least five more years, but my retirement will be quite simple and a bit of a struggle.\n\nis this ethical receiving government benefits in an arranged marriage? what if he recovers ? if i were to accept, is this money-grabbing on my part? is this just his way to bring me closer? what other parts of this dilemma am i missing? i have shared this with a couple of close friends and they have made strong arguments for both sides. the proponents feel that this is just a financial decision. those against feel it is unethical to essentially marry for money.\n\nunsure\n\ndear unsure,\n\nyou wouldn't be the first person to marry for money, and you won't be the last. when people do marry for money, they tend to keep it to themselves. people marry for all kinds of reasons, for companionship, passion, children, or because they just don't want to be alone. some people marry even when they don't love the person, maybe because he or she is beautiful or well connected, the person would make a good mother or father or — i'm clearly exaggerating here — has a low 18-hole handicap and would be a good partner to win the coveted prize at the country club's husband and wife golf competition.\n\nother people marry for love and end up hating each other, and remain tied together because of money — perhaps because one person has health insurance with their job, or because they share a home and neither wants to give it up, or they simply can't afford to split it. maybe they just got used to having each other around. many couples who no longer live together or love each other — they may even loathe each other! — remain married for the sake of the children. that may or may not be a good idea, depending on how well they get along. some people, of course, even end up living happily ever after. just like in the movies.\n\n people marry for all kinds of reasons, for companionship, passion, children, or because they just don't want to be alone. \n\nand so to you: you both dated and now share a valuable friendship. there are all kinds of love. you can dislike a person and still love their humanity. you can love a friend who used to be a boyfriend or girlfriend, but in a different way. you can love the idea of making someone financially secure and giving them a gift that will ensure their peace of mind or bring financial stability after they're gone. there are complications to his plan: you would, however, have to be married for nine months and/orhe would have reasonably expected to live for 9 months to legally claim widow's benefits. here are the other conditions. ask a lawyer about any exceptions for federal employees.\n\ni tend not to listen to the greek chorus of friends, frenemies or family when making important personal decisions. sure, i have my trusted sources, but everyone brings their own political, personal and ideological views to your predicament. i don't see this arrangement as unethical. on the contrary, it's an act of love for a dying man to make this his last wish. maybe it's not an act of romantic love, but it's an act of love nonetheless. many arranged marriages are very successful. in fact, all marriages are — in one way or another — arranged. if anything, there are more accounts that you, if you were his widow, could benefit from.\n\nsome of your friends may even feel resentful that you would also be his beneficiary to (i'm guessing) a very healthy pension, retirement plan, thrift savings plan (similar to a 401(k) or 403 (b)) and/or civil servant retirement system (if you were designated a surviving beneficiary). you may, if you were his widow, benefit from his health insurance even after he dies. this goes far beyond just social security, and it could help you have a retirement free from worry and financial instability. think carefully about all of these possibilities and talk them through with your friend.\n\n you can love the idea of making someone financially secure and giving them a gift that will ensure their own peace of mind or financial stability after they're gone. \n\nyou are the very opposite of money grabbing. i've received a lot of letters from people who have indulged in all sorts of shenanigans over money, some legal, some involving stolen money and altered wills; some letter writers have even accused family members of murder. all for money, money and more money. sometimes, there is a difficult moral problem where the social contract has been irrevocably broken — and for what? to settle an old score that goes all the way back to childhood or cut a sibling out of a will. you are the last person i would want to hammer, even if it was my style, which it's not. please, be kind to yourself.\n\ni'm not telling you to marry him, and i'm not telling you not to marry him. if you are not comfortable with marrying him, maybe you have your answer. if you feel like it puts you in a spot, proceed cautiously. if it would make you feel like you're not a good person, think twice. if this offer is made in good faith based on a loving friendship, however, give it some thought. if he wants a beloved friend to benefit from his social security after he dies, money that he has earned during his lifetime, that's actually a beautiful thing. you don't seem sure that you will live comfortably on your existing income. he is your friend and he may have found a way to help.\n\nwhatever you decide, it's a thoughtful and generous offer. if you go ahead with this, you could always get a second opinion from a doctor and, of course, a lawyer regarding his medical bills and other financial details, and hope that your friend has more time than six months or a year, for his sake. if he or she says your friend can only expect to live six months or he only lives six months, of course the ethical and moral quandary you find yourself in may be moot, given the nine-month rule. marriage may deepen your friendship and enrich your life in ways you did not expect. are you saying no for the wrong reasons? sometimes, it's hard for people to ask or receive help.\n\none final thought: your friend has both the luxury and difficulty of knowing when he is likely to leave this planet. it's rare that we have the ability to choose how we die. if you look at it that way, you would be doing him a great service too.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

dear moneyologist,\n\nmy father-in-law got remarried 14 years ago. he wrote a new will, leaving his home and money to his new wife should he happen to die first. he has now gotten alzheimer's and she no longer wants to care for him. she has asked his son to take him as she does not want to put him in a long-term care facility. this is only after she tried to move him to an assisted-living care facility and he totally resisted. he has enough of his senses to know that this is not what he wanted.\n\nhis wife had my father-in-law sign a power of attorney a year ago (when he was partially of sound mind and body) and has taken it upon herself to sign the house over to herself. they had a shared bank account with $100,000 and she put it in an annuity in her name only. the only money he has left is his government pension which she can't touch and is in his name.\n\nalso see:my brother stole my $110,000 inheritance by altering our mother's will\n\nmy brother-in-law is now caring for his dad and seems to have no recourse to get half of his ownership in the home and half of the $100,000. they are still married and we want to complete a separation of assets. she still has the power of attorney and has only given my brother-in-law a medical power of attorney. once we get approval from his wife to move the pension over to his own bank she will no longer be able to afford their home and be forced to sell.\n\nif she was going to put him in an assisted living facility there would have been a cost associated and she would have had to pay some money. since my father-in-law is in the care of his son, his wife has not offered to provide any assistance. what recourse do we have to get half his assets?\n\nshe lives in ohio and my father-in-law now lives in south carolina with his son.\n\ninterested son-in-law\n\ndear interested,\n\nshocking stories? the moneyologist has heard a few. but there was a point in your letter — she no longer wants to take care of him — where my jaw actually dropped.\n\nit seems like she does not or cannot pay for a private nursing home or she does not want to explore the options available to your father-in-law under medicaid, which is administered by the states. as richard eisenberg from nextavengue.org recently wrote on marketwatch, roughly 52% of people turning 65 today will require long-term care at some point and, he added, i'm sad to say that the new aarp 'long-term services and supports state scorecard' finds that most states aren't doing a great job helping people needing such care. and ohio ranked 34 out of all 50 states.\n\nalso see:how can i ensure my husband and his lazy kids honor my will?\n\nthere seems to be very little you can do to challenge the will your father-in-law wrote 14 years ago, but i'm not convinced that power-of-attorney that he signed one year ago is beyond reach. he may not have been diagnosed with alzheimer's a year ago, but this is a progressive disease and the symptoms can start a long time before a person requires medical care. what's more, he may have been mentally fit enough to be aware of how he would be dependent on his wife of 14 years. he was scared, he trusted her, his mental state could also have been even slightly impaired (as his or any doctor could attest based on other alzheimer's cases).\n\nhe must have been of sound mind and not under or subject to duress, restraint, fraud or undue influence.\n\nalzheimer's can last a long, long time, says anne tumlinson, founder of daughterhood, a washington, d.c.-based organization that provides information and resources to people caring for aging parents. people with alzheimer's are much more likely to be among the 14% of older adults who have very high care needs that last beyond 5 years. it's definitely the one care situation that can bankrupt everyone in the family. as a result, she says, seeking seek legal assistance immediately is really important.\n\nwhen care needs go on this long, often the only option or recourse — particularly for the extremely demanding care needs of someone with alzheimer's — is a nursing home, which because of the high cost, will end up being reimbursed by medicaid, tumlinson says. there is one major possible complication, however. his wife could be standing in the way of this man's eligibility for medicaid because states do not let the 'community spouse' keep all the money while the state medicaid program pays for care. the community spouse can keep some of the money but not all of it.\n\nas i have told other people who have written into this column, hire a lawyer who specializes in conservatorship and challenge this power of attorney now, rather than later. you could petition a court to have yourself appointed instead. and advice i have given to divorcing couples, may apply here too. california, arizona, idaho, louisiana, texas, nevada, new mexico and washington treat all marital assets as community property, meaning that assets acquired during the marriage only are divided equally between the two spouses. but in california, for example, children may receive a portion of separate property.\n\nyour wife's mother-in-law may have washed her hands of her husband of 14 years, but he has a family to take care of him and give him the respect and love that he deserves. but he will need financial support. some 42% of people caring for a family member with alzheimer's spend $20,000 or more a year on caregiving, which includes out-of-pocket expenses for assisted living, in-home caregivers, medication and medical bills, according to one report by caring.com. one-third of that number spend $30,000 or more. the cost of end-of-life care for dementia (at $278,000) is far more than cancer ($173,400) or heart disease ($175,100), another survey by metlife last year showed.\n\nfor these reasons — ethical and financial — you owe it to your father-in-law, wife and brother-in-law to seek legal advice and do for this man what he cannot do for himself.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

will the divorce rate spike in the u.s. in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic? cooped up couples quarantining to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, be on guard.\n\nread our coronavirus coverage\n\nin xi'an, a city of 12 million people in china that was placed in lockdown, the divorce rate spiked up when restraints were lifted, according to news reports.\n\nbeing forced together can certainly magnify underlying disagreements in a relationship.\n\nbut tread lightly, divorce can tear the heart right out of you, to paraphrase tammy wynette's hit song on the topic.\n\nit can also rip the stuffing out of your financial life, especially when it slams into you when you're age 50 and older–the cadre whose divorce rate has roughly doubled since the 1990s, according to a pew research center report.\n\nread: this is why baby boomers are divorcing at a stunning rate\n\nmore than one-third of divorcées haven't fully recovered financially after five years, according to fidelity investment's recently released divorce and money study of 1,107 americans, ages 25 to 75, who had divorced within the past six months to 10 years.\n\nthe study showed that older couples in longer marriages–83% of older couples married more than 21 years–were more inclined to wing it through the divorce proceedings, even though the length of time together would suggest they would have a complicated financial picture.\n\nwith retirement looming around the corner for these older couples, 'winging it' may result in some unexpected surprises when it comes to retirement preparedness, said meredith stoddard, life events experience lead at fidelity.\n\nfor women approaching or in retirement, becoming divorced has detrimental effects on their income security, according to the u.s. government accountability office. for example, women's household income, on average, fell by 41 percent with divorce, almost twice the size of the decline that men experienced.\n\nall i have to do is look around at my 50-something year-old childhood girlfriends to see the havoc. sure their hearts were bruised, but it's their financial lives that were upended after a divorce. it was more than just the distribution of assets that upset the cart. in many cases, their careers had been back pedaled for child-rearing, costing them years of income and retirement savings.\n\nbiggest mistake i ever made was to stop working to raise my son, one of my friends told me. now i'm living all alone and can't find a job that pays anywhere near what i used to make.\n\ndivorce for women can shatter financial security, as i write about in my book, money confidence: really smart financial moves for newly single women.\n\n remember this is a business partnership that is splitting \n\nso it was no shock to find that the study shows that: for women, financial stress begins to exceed emotional stress shortly after the divorce is finalized. for men, it's right before the divorce is finalized, according to stoddard.\n\nthat made me laugh and not happily. well, of course, men freak that they will have to share their assets before a settlement. afterward, for women, the reality of what they have left to live on sinks in, and their money angst skyrockets. maybe i'm being a little harsh here, but i've seen this scenario played out again and again.\n\nif a couple has shared financial responsibilities during their marriage it can make women financially stronger to weather a divorce, stoddard said. that is certainly true. only 60% of the women in the study, however, said they were involved in long-term and retirement investing during their marriage, compared with 82% of men.\n\nwhat clings to me is even though the majority of married women are involved in day-to-day finances of their households, many women never seriously think about their long-term financial situation until it's too late. and the consequences for such a do-nothing attitude can be calamitous.\n\none way to recover more quickly from the 'sticker shock' associated with divorce: be completely engaged in all aspects of the finances, stoddard said. getting involved and staying involved improves outcomes over the long-term.\n\nas i wrote in this column: it's not easy, even without a divorce, for most women to stash away enough retirement savings to cover potential living expenses for our last decades.\n\nit doesn't have to be a permanent savings setback. even when retirement accounts take a big hit due to divorce, or have to take a back burner for a while, don't feel as though it's a lost cause, stoddard said.\n\nwhen you're able, rebuild the habit of contributing, checking in where you stand periodically, and taking advantage of catch-up contributions when you're eligible, she advised. you can still put yourself in a good position over the long term.\n\nas a reminder: you can contribute up to $19,000 to a 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the federal government's thrift savings plan this year. and you can contribute up to $6,000 to an individual retirement account (ira). if you're aged 50 or older and qualify, you can contribute an additional $6,000 to an employer-sponsored plan and $1,000 to an ira.\n\nif a divorce is pending, there are some things you should do straightaway. begin by figuring out what you own, what you earn and what you owe as you prepare for negotiations.\n\ndon't let emotions drive your decisions — going through a divorce can bring up a wide range of emotions — such as sadness, fear, anxiety or relief, stoddard said.\n\nremember this is a business partnership that is splitting. most people look back and wish they kept their emotions in check, she said. it's a lot easier said than done, but reaching out to friends, family, or a therapist, can help process your emotions.\n\nbut there is a decision that is truly heart-wrenching. almost four in 10 divorcées (39%) say deciding who was going to get the pets was one of the hardest things to deal with emotionally, according to the report.\n\nfor me, that would be the one that would take me down. you can't put a dollar value on that.\n\none positive parting thought: for couples staying home together right now, instead of getting caught up in the dark side of simmering issues, i recommend you consider using this time to learn about each other's fears about money and more. have those money conversations you have avoided. talk about your hopes and dreams.\n\nin the end, this sequestered togetherness, might not have to turn into the fuel for a split, but a time of coming together and moving forward as a team.
dear moneyologist,\n\ni have a question about my divorce situation. i went through a fairly amicable divorce. we will still see each other at family dinners from time to time. it's a little awkward, but friendly. we share an individual retirement account but, while going through the divorce, my husband said he did not want to split his retirement account because it was just short of seven figures. he's been saving forever and his reasoning was that he didn't want to split it yet when it was so close to $1 million. a year has passed, the account is over $1 million, and nothing has happened.\n\ndon't miss:divorcing? get your affairs in order first\n\ni do not think my ex-husband has bad intentions, but i am now worried. i personally believe he should have split the account during the divorce proceedings. it is an uncomfortable situation to bring up, but i believe it should be sorted out as soon as possible. do you have any idea what the tax implications would be if he held onto the account together and split it in around 15 years when we both retire? are we risking having to pay the gift tax by doing this? we may be less friendly in the future, and marry new spouses, etc.\n\nconcerned ex-wife\n\ndear ex-wife,\n\nthis is a textbook case of how not to divorce a millionaire, or anyone else. since your divorce is final, any changes to your current arrangement will be near-impossible, especially if you did not live in a community property state. you need to get up to speed on many missing pieces.\n\nyou cannot share an individual retirement account. you need to hold them separately under internal revenue service rules. but there are so many missing pieces here. has your ex-husband named you as beneficiary on his ira? does your divorce decree state that you are to receive the ira, or at least part of it? if it is the latter, you need to make sure you are a named beneficiary on this account. alternatively, establish whether or not you married in a community property state where the money contributed to the ira during your marriage is automatically owned by both parties.\n\nread: the foundations of our california dream home are rotting\n\nwhen it comes to family assets worth $1 million or more, people start acting funny, and not in a good way. not everyone, in my experience, is quite so willing to divide them. in fact, some people go to great lengths to hide assets from spouses and soon-to-be former spouses. to withdraw the funds early would incur massive penalties. if your husband doesn't want to make any changes on his retirement account — especially if you are not already named as a beneficiary on his account and you don't live in a community property state — it's possible that he has other plans for it. that is, what's his remains his.\n\nalso see:my wife is divorcing me after 21 years — and wants everything\n\nwith your ex-husband's agreement, you could modify your divorce decree to provide for a qualified domestic relations order — a court order requiring workplace retirement benefits, says david levi, senior managing director at cbiz mhm, a minneapolis-based accounting provider. that would ensure that no penalty or tax would be paid on the separation and/or withdrawal of these assets. iras are more typically split using a transfer of property between spouses or incident to divorce. either way, it must be a recognized pension or benefit plan under the employee retirement income security act. you should, of course, consult a lawyer to make sure that you invest any funds you might get in a way that protects you from further taxes or penalties.\n\nremember, if your divorce decree is already signed you will need to file an appeal. talk to your former husband and your lawyer, probably in that order. however this turns out, i wish you both good health (and an amicable separation of your assets) in your new lives.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband and i are soon to be retired. i have saved in a 401(k) and have pension benefits. he owned a small business for many years, but never created a nest egg for retirement. he is a vet. he may be entitled to more social security if he's single. we thought about divorcing and coexisting to ensure we can make ends meet throughout retirement, but that means placing our modest home in my name only, right?\n\nkim\n\nalso see:my wife and i want to have a second child — is this a good time to buy a new house?\n\ndear kim,\n\nthere is no marriage penalty or limit to benefits paid to a married couple.\n\nand that's a direct quote from the social security administration website. a working woman is not limited to one-half of her husband's social security, the site states. (that rate applies to women who never worked outside the home.) so, for example, if you are due a social security benefit of $1,200 per month and your husband is due a social security benefit of $1,400 per month, you will be paid $2,600 per month in retirement benefits.\n\nthere's no point in getting divorced for monetary reasons, although i've heard of people staying together for the health of their finances (joint health insurance policies and lower housing costs). since you have a pension when you are married, the spouse gets it as well if you pick the joint life option, says cary carbonaro, a certified financial planner and managing director at united capital. if you were not married, you would not get that option.\n\ndon't miss:my husband wants our house and half my 401(k) in our divorce — and he's hiding his assets\n\nwhat's more, home ownership is excluded from your qualification for social security. as for your husband's veteran status, his time in military service can boost his lifetime earnings record as far as calculation of his social security benefit, which can result in a higher benefit, but it does not add directly to his monthly check, says kimberly foss, certified financial planner and founder of empyrion wealth management.\n\nalso see: my cheating husband just inherited $3 million from his father's estate — should i still divorce him?\n\nthat 10-year marriage rule is good for people who actually want to divorce, if you remain unmarried post-divorce and you're over 62 years of age. sometimes, divorced spouses can both claim full spousal benefit and allow their own benefit to grow until age 70, foss adds, but the actual benefit amount varies by age and employment status, so you should do some careful calculation using both married and divorced scenarios and your current data to make sure of which way makes the most financial sense.\n\ntalking to a financial adviser instead of a divorce lawyer would be far less costly.\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\nrecommended:after my father died, my brother has been pressuring me to lend him money\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear moneyist,\n\ni never thought i would be writing to you, but here it goes: i am a second wife. my husband has two daughters from a previous marriage — we all get along quite well and my husband has a wonderful relationship with both girls. after we got married i arranged for us to meet with an attorney to have our trust set up. i wanted to ensure we were planning accordingly in the event anything should happen to us.\n\nmy husband has two properties that he owned prior to our marriage. in our original trust plan his daughters would receive one of the properties (the one they lived in for many years and that now is collecting rental income) and i would receive the other property. the rest of the trust was straightforward; assets would go to the survivor on first death and upon both deaths the trust would be split 50/50.\n\nalso see:my father excluded my siblings from his will — should i give them money?\n\nfast forward a few years: we have bought a new house and had a son.\n\nwe are revisiting the trust and it's become a bit more complicated. i think it makes sense for my husband's daughters to receive the property they grew up in. however, i want to ensure that everything is fair and inclusive of my son as well. i think my husband is also concerned that if we both die my son would receive my share of the trust as well as one-third of my husband's portion of the trust. i think this is completely fair, but i am not sure my husband agrees. i would not be comfortable with my share being split evenly between all three kids.\n\nwe have generally always been able to reconcile and agree on financial decisions and philosophies, but now we're stuck. i want to be fair to all the kids, but my husband's kids are not my kids.\n\nwhat should we do? what would be the most fair?\n\ncheryl\n\ndear cheryl,\n\nthere's one way of looking at this: your assets belong to you and they do not belong to your husband, and certainly not your stepdaughters. with that assumption, 100% of the assets you bring into the marriage should go to your biological son. but it seems like you have started this marriage by mingling your assets. i don't think you can have it both ways.\n\nhere's an example: your husband had two properties coming into this marriage. in community property states, those homes would not be considered marital property and — if you decided to divorce — you would both take out of the marriage what you brought into it. in that case, your husband would take both homes. on his death, his daughters would inherit them.\n\ndon't miss: my father left his home to his kids — my stepmother sold it for $1 million\n\ni agree with your husband. to tip the scales in favor of your son with the family trust would do an injustice to your marriage and your entire family. your stepdaughters may receive an inheritance from their biological mother too, but to split up the trust where your son gets one-third of your husband's share and 100% of your share — which is 50% of the trust — seems unfair to your stepdaughters, especially given their father's money is invested here too.\n\nalso see: my adoptive parents ostracized me because i'm gay — do i have a claim on their estate?\n\nbut you're wise to set up a trust for all three children and have this conversation about who gets what now. not all spouses honor their wife/husband's wishes after they're gone. in most jurisdictions, a couple can enter into a contract not to change their respective wills, should they wish to leave their own children more or ensure that each child and stepchild receives an equal amount. without a will, the state's laws take precedence and typically stepchildren get nothing.\n\nthere was broad consensus on your dilemma from the moneyist facebook group, including suggestions of a life insurance policy for your son. one member wrote, life's not fair. once you marry, you get it all, children included. they become your children too. splitting three ways is equitable. another added: essentially the daughters split a house and he gets a house to himself. perhaps the rest of the assets should be split equally between the three.\n\na good estate attorney will help you navigate this dilemma and, of course, the answer may also depend on how many assets you brought into the marriage.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
this article is reprinted by permission from nerdwallet.\n\nbeing asked to be an executor is an honor you might want to pass up.\n\nsettling an estate typically involves tracking down and appraising assets, paying bills and creditors, filing final tax returns and distributing whatever's left to the heirs. at best, the process is time-consuming. at worst, it takes hundreds of hours, exposes you to lawsuits and thrusts you into the middle of family fights.\n\nrobert braglia of new york, a certified financial planner, was executor of an estate where the woman disowned three of her four children and left most of her money to just one of her many grandchildren. that could have caused an uproar even if the family got along, which it didn't: two of the woman's children were fighting over the woman's ashes before she actually died.\n\neven without conflicts — which there always are — it is an enormous job, braglia says.\n\nbefore you agree to take on this role, be clear on what's involved.\n\nyou could be doing it for many months\n\nthe time involved in settling an estate varies enormously. a small estate with few debts might be distributed within six to 12 months. it may take years to finalize a large estate with contentious heirs, lots of creditors or assets that are difficult to value, such as a business or rare collectibles.\n\nread: larry king had a secret will that excluded his wife — estate planning gets messy\n\na survey by estateexec, an online tool for executors, found the typical estate took about 16 months to settle and required 570 hours of effort. the largest estates, worth $5 million or more, took 42 months and 1,167 hours to complete.\n\nthat doesn't necessarily mean the executor has to put in that many hours, says cfp russ weiss of doylestown, pennsylvania. an executor can use some of the estate's funds to hire an attorney and other help that could be more efficient than trying to figure everything out on their own.\n\nif you have other professionals involved — an attorney, a cpa, an investment person or wealth adviser — they're doing most of the heavy lifting, weiss says. executors are like the quarterback in the administration of the estate.\n\nexecutors may also collect a fee, with the amount depending on state law or what's specified in the estate documents.\n\nyou might have a tough time finding assets\n\neven with help, executors should expect to spend many hours finding documents, inventorying assets and debts, arranging appraisals, communicating with financial institutions and government agencies, managing property and keeping careful records. if the estate includes a home, the house may have to be emptied of possessions and readied for sale.\n\nthe less organized the estate, the more time it may take to track down assets. estateexec ceo dan stickel said his father, who died at 69, rented multiple storage sheds without telling his children where they were. finding the various backyard sheds was challenging enough, but then they had to sort through the dusty contents. those included piles of newspapers, battered furniture and several bars of silver bullion hidden under a dirty tarp.\n\nyou might like: i want to propose to my girlfriend — but how do i divide my estate between her and my daughter from a previous marriage?\n\neven then, they missed something. the auction company stickel hired to dispose of the rest of the sheds' contents found a box containing $30,000 in savings bonds. fortunately, the company returned the bonds to the family.\n\nyou could be sued\n\nexecutors have a fiduciary duty to the beneficiaries, which means the executor is required to put the beneficiaries' interests first. people are typically advised to choose executors who are responsible, honest, diligent and impartial.\n\nit's an honor. if somebody asks you, it's to say, 'i trust you, and i trust you implicitly that you will handle my affairs in a way that's fair,' weiss says.\n\nbut the fiduciary duty comes with potential legal and financial consequences. executors can be held personally responsible for mistakes and other problems. for example, one child may remove items from a parent's home that are bequeathed to another child. the heir whose items were taken could sue the executor for failing to secure the home.\n\nexecutors also may have to make judgment calls, such as whether to spend the estate's money to fix up a house for sale and if so, how much. unhappy heirs can sue over those decisions, as well.\n\ngiven everything that can go wrong and the time commitment, people should think carefully about whether they really want the job before agreeing to be an executor, says cfp kate gregory of huntington beach, california, who has settled both her mother's and her husband's estates.\n\nrelated: embroiled in a family feud? these people could help\n\ngregory says she would agree to serve again only if a family member asked, and only if there wasn't likely to be a lot of conflict among the beneficiaries. even then, she would want to see the will or trust documents to ensure there aren't any unpleasant surprises that could cause discord. she also would insist that the documents name alternates in case she can't or won't serve. no one can be forced to be an executor, but gregory says she would feel better about saying yes if she knew there was a plan should she later say no.\n\ni want to make sure that i could resign, she says.\n\nmore from nerdwallet\n\nliz weston writes for nerdwallet. email: lweston@nerdwallet.com. twitter: @lizweston.

after having just filed your 2015 return and possibly being shocked at how much you owed, you may be ready for some tax planning to reduce the pain from now on. while tax planning is a frequently used term, it's not necessarily well-understood. here's the scoop:\n\nwhat tax planning really means\n\ntax planning is the art of arranging your affairs in ways that postpone or avoid taxes. by employing effective tax planning strategies, you can have more money to save and invest or more money to spend. or both!\n\nput another way, tax planning means deferring and flat-out avoiding taxes by taking advantage of beneficial tax-law provisions, increasing and accelerating tax deductions and tax credits, and generally making maximum use of all applicable breaks available to you under our beloved internal revenue code.\n\nwhile the federal income tax rules are now more complicated than ever, the benefits of tax planning are arguably more valuable than ever.\n\nof course, you should not change your financial behavior solely to avoid taxes. truly effective tax planning strategies are those that permit you to do what you want while reducing your tax bills along the way.\n\nwhy are suburbs trying to look more like cities?\n\ntax planning and financial planning are closely related\n\nfinancial planning is the art of implementing strategies that facilitate reaching your financial goals, be they short-term or long-term. sounds pretty simple: however, if it actually was simple, there would be lots more rich folks out there (including yours truly).\n\ntax planning and financial planning are closely linked, because taxes are such a large expense item as you go through life. as your income goes up, taxes will probably be your single biggest expense over the long haul. so planning to reduce taxes is a critically important piece of the overall financial planning puzzle.\n\nhorror stories when folks fail to make the connection\n\nover the years as a tax professional, i've been amazed at how many people fail to get the message about tax planning until they commit a grievous blunder that costs them a bundle in otherwise avoidable taxes. then they finally get it. the trick is to make sure you don't have to learn this lesson the hard way. to illustrate the point, consider the following example.\n\nexample: joe is a 45-year-old unmarried professional. he considers himself to be financially astute. however, he is not very knowledgeable about taxes. one day, joe meets joan, and they quickly decide to get married. caught up in the excitement of a whole new life, joe impulsively sells his home right before the marriage. the property is in a good area and has appreciated by $500,000 since he bought it 15 years ago. joe and joan intend to move into joan's home, which is, frankly, a dump. but joe is an ace diy remodeler, and he plans to work his magic on joan's property. ignoring taxes, this a good plan.\n\nresult without tax planning: for federal income tax purposes, joe has a whopping $250,000 taxable gain on the sale of his home: $500,000 profit minus the $250,000 federal home sale gain exclusion allowed to an unmarried seller.\n\nresult with tax planning: if joe had kept his home and lived there with his new bride for two years before selling, he could have taken advantage of the more generous $500,000 home sale gain exclusion allowed to married couples. that way, he could have permanently avoided $250,000 of taxable gain. if necessary, the couple could have sold joan's home instead of joe's. since her place is a dump, she could have sheltered any taxable gain with her separate $250,000 gain exclusion. alternatively, the couple could keep joan's property and work on remodeling it while still living in joe's highly appreciated home for the requisite two years.\n\nmoral of the story: by selling his home too soon without considering the tax-smart alternative, joe cost himself $62,500 in taxes: completely avoidable $250,000 gain taxed at an assumed combined federal and state rate of 25%. in a higher tax bracket, the damage would be even worse. the whopping tax bill on the home sale is a permanent difference, not just a timing difference. the bill could have been zero. the point: you cannot ignore taxes when contemplating major transactions. if you do, bad things can happen, even with seemingly intelligent moves.\n\nthe last word\n\nthere are many other ways to commit expensive tax blunders. examples include selling appreciated securities too soon when hanging on for just a little longer would have resulted in low-taxed long-term capital gain instead of high-taxed short-term gain, taking retirement account withdrawals before age 59½ and getting hit with the 10% early-withdrawal penalty tax, and failing to arrange for payments to an ex-spouse to qualify as deductible alimony. the list goes on and on.\n\nthe cure is to plan transactions with taxes in mind and avoid making impulsive moves. seeking professional tax advice before pulling the trigger on significant transactions is usually money well spent. as the rest of this year unfolds, some of my future columns will focus on tax-planning strategies that many folks can benefit from. hopefully, we can together do a better job of keeping your tax bill on the right side of reasonable from now on.
dear moneyist,\n\ni have never been married or bought a home before. the guy i am with said we would marry on april 18. he then decided to delay and buy a foreclosure and told me this all on april 16. i was shocked, to say the least. he owns a home already and said that he did not plan to put me on the mortgage or deed even after we were married. i, again, was in shock. he said i could just pay some of the bills and rent to him. he claims he did not involve me in getting the loan, because i don't make as much money as him and that would affect the mortgage rate.\n\n 'i wanted skin-in-the-game, so i feel like we both have ownership and a part in this marriage.' \n\ni have very good credit. he knows this. i thought my credit could have helped us. would it have? i even offered to sell some of my stocks to help with a down payment. i may have never owned a home or made a substantial amount of money, but my credit is good. i wanted to enter marriage first and then buy a home together, not have him do this all solo and spring it on me. i wanted skin-in-the-game, so to speak, so i feel like we both have ownership and a part in this marriage.\n\ndon't miss: my sister took care of our mother for 10 years — shouldn't she be entitled to her house?\n\nis it a good idea to enter into a marriage like this? is he just trying to take advantage of my naiveté? i understand i would not have any rights to the property, even if we got married, is that true? this house is in winthrop harbor, ill. i wanted him to look at houses right over the border in pleasant prairie, wis. because the taxes are substantially lower. he insisted no. i thought it odd because he is always about saving money, especially in taxes. my suspicion is that it is differs in property rights somehow. does it? what benefits is he getting from all of this?\n\n 'i don't want to be made a fool of or just keep giving him money as 'rent' without ownership of some type.' \n\ni don't feel he is looking out for both of us and, perhaps, is only looking out for himself. can you enlighten me on how this works and is he trying to take advantage of me? he is 45 and i am 42. would you enter into marriage with someone under these measures? this would be both of our first marriages. i don't want to be made a fool or just keep giving him money as rent without ownership of some type. he claims i have a house to live in and i shouldn't complain.\n\nit makes me sad because everyone i know who is married shares the house mortgage, deed, etc., even if the wife makes less or does not work. is it normal for me to think that is just what happens in marriage?\n\njp\n\ndear jp,\n\nshould you be a renter in a marriage that you had hoped would be a joint venture? no. you're looking for a partner in life, so far you've gotten a landlord. that sounds like a really bad start.\n\n is it healthy to delay a wedding buy a home, if one partner does not know about it? no. \n\nwhat is normal? you need to find out what is normal—or a better word, healthy—for you. is it healthy to delay a wedding buy a home, if one partner does not know about it? no. there is an unsettling element of subterfuge here. of course, one should be very careful about whom you marry, and buy property and/or co-mingle your assets with. your boyfriend decided against all of the above, without consulting you first. that should be enough for you to make your decision about the future of this relationship, given that much of that decision has already been made for you.\n\ndon't miss:i built a nest egg of $1 million — how do make sure my kids benefit?\n\nillinois is an equitable distribution state: marital property is typically divided 50/50, but the ultimate decision is made on what is deemed fair and equitable by the courts. if a husband or wife paid the down payment and most of the mortgage repayments and the couple divorced, a judge may take that into account when dividing the assets. wisconsin is a community property state, on the other hand, so if he bought a house there during your marriage, that's considered community property. and, yes, a lender would look at both your credit scores if you decided to buy a home together.\n\nalso see: my husband cashed out his retirement and, after 36 years, filed for divorce\n\ni've received all sorts of letters that suggest one should be cautious about co-mingling assets or marrying someone who earns significantly less or has a lot of debt. you don't have a bad credit history and you want to participate financially in your relationship. i'm thinking of the man who paid off his wife's student loans and she divorced him after two years. that story got a lot of comments and feedback, but not because most people enter into marriage with a plan to have their spouse pay their share of the nation's $1.5 trillion in student debt. it's a shocking story because they don't.\n\nyour boyfriend has behaved in a way that is far beneath most people's reasonable expectations when embarking on a life together. let him have his house in winthrop harbor—and move on.\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

dear moneyist,\n\na friend of mine is getting married this summer. over the past few years he has occasionally borrowed money and has been paying it back in small amounts regularly, but he still owes an amount in the low four figures. at this rate, it will be a few years before it's paid off.\n\nrecommended:the next time you go anywhere, remember the $1 tip is dead\n\nthey are going to ask for cash donations to go towards a honeymoon or setting up housekeeping. both of them have had their own living arrangements and do not need toasters, etc. i want to contribute, of course, but would it be better to forgive part of the loan, or give them the cash they are requesting?\n\nbefuddled best man\n\ndear befuddled,\n\ni have two pieces of advice for you: don't lend your friend any more money and don't mix up the long history of these ill-advised loans with his wedding present. he might hope you will forgive a large portion of the loan as a wedding gift, but that doesn't seem fair to either of you. he borrowed the money and he should repay it. you can give him money as a wedding gift if you like, but i see a request for money in lieu of a wedding gift as just that — a request. give him a nice gift. some tea cups or a bottle of champagne to be opened on their first anniversary with two champagne flutes.\n\nhis marriage is, however, a good opportunity for you to sit him down and arrange a payment plan a couple of months after the wedding. he will (or should) want to start making financial plans with his new wife, and she definitely should be aware of any outstanding debts, especially debts that involve a dear friend. you may or may not choose to give him a haircut, but in the spirit of transparency and this new payment plan, ask him to notarize the loan agreement. about two-thirds of loans to friends and family are not repaid, and oral agreements are notoriously difficult to enforce.\n\nalso see:my boyfriend and i have two kids — should i pay off his $130,000 student debt?\n\nmy approach may sound harsh, but there's a reason why some people borrow money from their closest friends. banks have turned them down, other friends and family have seen how they mismanage their finances and they have also said no. plus, it's easier to rely on friendships for both loans and the non-payment of loans. after all, the collateral here is the friendship itself. if you insist on your friend paying the money back, it rocks the balance of power in the friendship. he can end it and walk away. but people who borrow from friends often rely on that as leverage.\n\ndon't miss:should two people with $1 million in debt even consider getting married?\n\nwhen you borrow thousands of dollars from a friend, it is a business arrangement. unless the borrower wants to see it as a personal matter and, as such, relies on the friendship to keep borrowing — as this man did. that only benefits one person: the borrower. i get too many letters from people who gave money to friends and family. their friendship and good name was the only credit score they needed. if your friend is man enough to ask for thousands of dollars, he should be man enough to sign a loan agreement. it would, like i said, be polite to wait until after the wedding.\n\nif you really want this money back from a friend, you cannot treat him as anything else but a debtor. you need to treat them like a customer. that doesn't mean you have to be mean or lose your cool. by not making any real effort to return the money, he has put a price on your friendship. in this case, it's a low four-figure sum. the only thing standing between you and the money he owes you is the risk of losing this friendship. so go to the wedding, don't mention the loan, be there for your friend and, when the confetti has been swept away, sit him down to clear this debt once and for all.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
10. establish an emergency fund.\n\nyou don't hear much about emergency funds these days but they serve as the first line of defense against having to take on unwanted debt. (if you don't have an emergency fund, you will likely have to borrow money when an emergency pops up.) as such they are one of the most fundamental and important money moves anyone can make. this is why dave ramsey lists having an emergency fund as no.1 of his seven baby steps.\n\nwhy have an emergency fund? because unexpected financial problems happen rather regularly. washing machines break, cars need repairs, kids need braces, and so on. and heaven forbid that you lose your job. that's one really big reason to have an emergency fund.\n\nso how much should you save in your emergency fund? a good rule-of-thumb is to have six months' of living expenses saved up. in addition, be sure to keep your emergency fund in a safe place — you certainly want it to be there when you need it. don't worry about earning a ton on it, no one ever became rich by making money off their emergency fund, just make sure it's safe and accessible.\n\nwe have always had at least six months of cash on hand and usually store it either in a bank or online savings account. with today's technology, it's easy to transfer from any of these one account to another when needed.\n\n9. have a will.\n\nthe question here is whether you want to decide where your money goes if you pass away or whether you want the government to decide. for me, that's a rather easy question to answer.\n\neven more important, if you have children in your home, you'll want to both provide for them as well as direct where they go in case of your death. a will can do all these things for you.\n\nin addition to a will you'll need the other documents that account for good estate planning – probably at least patient advocate and medical records release documents for most people.\n\nand be sure to keep all these up-to-date as your life situation changes.\n\nwe have had a will since our kids were young. now that they are both legal adults, we will be updating our will to reflect those changes.\n\n8. get good insurance coverage.\n\nto me insurance is a very big emergency fund that supplements your cash emergency fund. it covers the things you couldn't save up to cover in advance, helping to replace/protect the largest assets you have — your career, your home, your investments — if you experience a major accident, death, or injury.\n\nhere are the insurance categories where you may need coverage:\n\n• auto — of course. auto accidents happen frequently. and some (all?) states require you carry insurance.\n\n• homeowner or renter's — your home is a major asset that you want covered in case of disaster. and if you rent, you likely have thousands of dollars in assets you'll want to cover.\n\n• life — if other people rely on your income to survive, you need life insurance. we got $1 million on me and $300k on my wife several years ago. now we really don't need it but will let the 20-year policies run their course.\n\n• long-term disability — many employers provide this but you'll want to be sure you're comfortable with the terms if you need it. if not, you may want to buy supplemental insurance on your own.\n\n• health — again, covered by many employers. if not covered, let me just say getting health insurance in america is a mess these days. and that's all i have to say about that.\n\n• umbrella — as your net worth grows, you'll want to have this fairly inexpensive insurance to protect your assets in case you're sued. i usually have it set at the next million dollars above my net worth (i.e. if my net worth was $1.6 million i'd have $2 million of umbrella insurance).\n\n• long-term care — this one isn't mandatory yet in my opinion, but i'm still considering it. i'm interested in your thoughts on it.\n\none more bit of advice: do not go overboard and become over-insured. no one needs to win the lottery when misfortune occurs (for example, your family most likely does not need a $10 million life insurance policy on you. if you have one and you don't make $1 million a year or so, you're probably spending too much on life insurance.) but you do want to be sure you have enough insurance to replace your assets in times of trouble or loss. take a balanced view and only pay for what you truly need.\n\n7. track net worth and cash flow.\n\nit's hard to know if you're winning if you don't keep score and it's hard to get somewhere if you don't have a map. your net worth is your financial scorecard and your cash flow plan is your money map.\n\nnet worth is how you measure and track your wealth. it allows you to keep score with how you're doing financially. without it you have no idea whether or not you're making progress.\n\nyou can track it many ways: on paper, in a spreadsheet, with a program like quicken (which is what i use), or online at a site like mint. the method doesn't really matter — use what works for you — but you need to track it. i update mine once a month as i update my accounts in quicken. that's probably the most frequent you want to look at yours as any shorter and it gets obsessive. calculating net worth once a year is a bare minimum, so pick something between a month and a year that works for you and record your net worth. as you do you'll see things you need to change, moves you should make, etc.\n\nnet worth goes hand-in-hand with tracking and managing your cash flow. cash flow lets you see how much revenue comes in and where it goes. it allows you to make spending decisions that ultimately create your gap — the difference between your income and expenses. your gap then fuels your net worth as it is money that can be invested and grown.\n\nyou can create and track a cash flow plan (aka budget) in many ways, very similar to tracking your net worth. personally i use a spreadsheet because quicken's budgeting tool isn't as flexible as i like. i set the budget for a year and review actuals versus projections at the end of each month. then i can make timely adjustments that help me get where i want to be financially.\n\n6. create a plan.\n\nyou may be surprised that this is so far down the list and certainly an argument can be made that it should be higher. but in my experience the items that are ahead of this are much more important. i know this from personal experience. for years i didn't really have a financial plan (at least a well-thought-out one), but i took the other steps on the list and did very well. i would have probably done better if i had a plan, and that's why i'm including this on the list.\n\none of my favorite business books of all time is the 7 habits of highly effective people. habit no. 2 is begin with the end in mind. in other words, think about the outcome you want to have in one, five, 10, or however many years down the road. once you then know where you want to end up, you can develop a plan to get there.\n\nso what do you want? to retire early? financial independence? something else?\n\nwhatever you want, having a plan to get there will help you focus as well as make decisions that speed the process.\n\nas i mentioned, i was not the greatest in this area. i knew in a general sense that i wanted to retire early and live off the income of my assets, not drawing them down. i also had general numbers in mind that i thought would get me there ($4 million in net worth and $100k in annual income.) then i started developing a specific retirement plan and running the exact numbers. i found out that i could retire whenever i wanted, and shortly thereafter, that's what i did. if i had a plan earlier and focused on it, i think i could have retired many years earlier.\n\n5. marry well.\n\nit takes two to tango and it certainly takes two on the same page to build net worth. this is, of course, if you're married. you don't have to be married to have a solid net worth, but there are financial advantages to marriage (two incomes, division of labor, etc.) that help.\n\nan absolute killer to your finances is having different views and plans for your money. there will be differing opinions, of course, but there needs to be compromise and an agreed upon plan that both people work toward for you to reach your financial goals.\n\nthe biggest issue generally is that one spouse ends up being a saver and one a spender. this is ok if each is in moderation, but an out-of-control spender will kill anyone's finances no matter what income you have.\n\ni love this quote from the millionaire next door:\n\nwhat if your household generates even a moderately high income and both you and your spouse are frugal? you have the foundation for becoming wealthy and maintaining your wealth. on the other hand, it is very difficult for a married couple to accumulate wealth if one is a spendthrift. a household divided in its financial orientation is unlikely to accumulate significant wealth.\n\non the other hand, spouses that work together can be a powerful financial force — much greater than either of them individually. in our house i was great at earning a good income and my wife was great at keeping spending under control. those were perfect complements that allowed us to develop a significant net worth.\n\nand let's not forget the cost of divorce. whenever you take a 50% hit to your net worth, it's a bad thing indeed.\n\nthis is why it's vitally important to your financial success that you marry well.\n\n4. avoid debt.\n\nthis one may be controversial as i know some readers advocate using debt as a way to grow your net worth. it may be a valid option, but i'm sticking with what got me where i am today and that's why i list avoiding debt as a top money move.\n\nwe'll begin with the fact that debt costs a fortune, especially consumer debt. how much does it cost? consider this the tip of the iceberg from nerdwallet:\n\nthe average u.s. household carries $15,675 in credit card debt paying a total of $6,658 in interest per year. this is 9% of the average household income ($75,591) being spent on interest alone.\n\nthat is an absolute killer.\n\nthen there's auto debt, which is almost as bad, and almost twice per household of what credit card debt is. ugh.\n\ni have used credit cards for years and have never paid 1 cent in interest. in fact, i use rewards credit cards to make money. as for cars, i pay cash.\n\nnow to be clear i don't have this tip listed as eliminate debt as i do think there are times when it's worthwhile. but those times need to be under the right circumstances and for limited periods. other than that, debt needs to be avoided.\n\nsome times i would say debt is ok are:\n\nto get the right college degree. this is a separate conversation in and of itself, but if you go to college for the right reasons and control your costs/debt relative to what you'll earn when you graduate, borrowing for college can be a great deal. i borrowed (only $5,000 total — i worked and paid for most of my college) for six years of college including getting an m.b.a. that put me on a very solid financial path. i paid that debt off within a couple of years and it was all upside from there.\n\nto buy a house. the key here is buying a house you can afford — and not stretching to buy a dream house that taxes your finances to the point where if one small thing goes wrong you're in trouble. because things will go wrong (see the notes on an emergency fund). do this and you should have your house paid off in 10 years.\n\nto invest. i do not borrow to invest, but some people do, especially with real estate. i'll leave it to them to argue their case below, but this comment summarizes the issue quite well in case you're interested.\n\nwe paid off all our debt early in our marriage and didn't look back. by the way, because we were able to grow our income, we didn't sacrifice things like 401(k) contributions while we paid off our debt.\n\n3. invest for the long-term.\n\nif you want to become wealthy you've going to need to invest early and often — the more the better. initially you'll want to invest for growth in something like index funds. later you're going to need income so you might consider p2p lending, real estate, or dividend stocks.\n\nthe key is to invest as much as you can for as long as you can. if you do this you will supercharge your net worth.\n\n5 simple steps to reach $1 million\n\n2. grow your income.\n\nthis could be 1a as much as 2, it's that important. but i had to pick one as better and this one scored second.\n\nthat said, it's still vitally important for you to grow your income. and while it may go without saying, i'm going to say it anyway: the higher, the better.\n\nfor most people, this means making the most of their career. the good news is there are established steps to maximizing your work income and by doing so, you can make millions more dollars over the life of your career.\n\nin addition, you might want to look for other ways to earn money like buying a business, starting a side business, or even making money with credit cards.\n\ni've made money with credit cards throughout my life, but have also had a freelance writing business (it helped pay off my mortgage), run a blog (though most years my profits were given away), and even been a soccer referee. i've also done some side consulting and board work that has added extra money here and there.\n\neventually i got into real estate which delivered significant income for many years before retirement.\n\n1. control your spending.\n\nthis is ranked as no. 1 because no matter how much you earn, you must control your spending to get ahead financially.\n\nhere's what stop acting rich: …and start living like a real millionaire says about the issue:\n\nmost people will never earn $10 million in their lifetime, let alone in any single year. in fact, most households (97%) are unlikely to ever earn even $200,000 or more annually. so what if you are unlikely to become rich by generating an extraordinarily high realized income? the only way you will become rich is by being like those millionaires at the other end of the continuum: by living well below your means, by planning, saving, and investing.\n\nthere are two types of overspending that can ruin your finances:\n\noverspending on the little things: the small amounts that seep out of your pockets here and there and eventually become large.\n\noverspending on the big things: homes, cars, boats, cottages, and so on. even where you live has major implications on your finances.\n\nnow don't get me wrong. you don't have to be a miser to get ahead, but you need to balance your saving and spending.\n\nto do this, develop a budget and live on it, as we discussed above.\n\nso, that's my list of the best money moves anyone could make. what do you think of my list?

dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband and i live in minnesota. my husband's only child lives in tennessee with her husband and their daughter. they both have very good incomes. i am an only child and, when my parents die, i will have no family at all. when i married my husband, i assumed he and i were now a family and would always look out for each other.\n\nrecommended:'the atmosphere soured hard and early.' how meghan and harry's break for the border will make them rich beyond their wildest dreams\n\ni recently found out that he is leaving half of all his assets to his daughter and half to me. i have always had my husband as 100% beneficiary on all my assets. now i feel like a third wheel and feel like he and i are not really family. i feel betrayed. the way i feel may be wrong, but it is still the way i feel. i am very depressed about this.\n\nalso see:prince harry's friend: harry and meghan were 'driven out' — alleges the house of windsor is 'poisonous' and 'machiavellian'\n\nmy parents are leaving everything to each other and, when they are gone, whatever is left will go to me. so it took me by surprise that my husband is not doing the same. and women with children that i work with are doing it that way also. they told me that if they found out their husbands were only leaving half to them and the other half to their kids, they would be very angry.\n\ni can't help but think that — even though i am now 63 — there may be a man out there looking for someone to marry and have as his family.\n\nt.s.\n\ndear t.s.,\n\nyou are equating your husband's estate plans with his level of love for you. if he is only leaving you 50% of his assets, does that mean he loves you less? even 50% less? does that mean he doesn't fully have your back? that might be how it feels now, but that doesn't make it true.\n\none could argue you are doing exactly what you accuse him of doing: making money a barometer of how much you love each other. if you don't receive 50% of his assets, does that mean you love him less? even 50% less? does that mean you don't have his back anymore?\n\nalso see:as a baby boomer, i didn't grow up with this culture of entitlement — do i have to leave my estate to my children or spouse?\n\ni frequently received letters from second spouses about their stepchildren's inheritance. some are more generous than others. but it's not unusual for a husband or wife to leave his/her spouse a percentage of the estate and the rest to their own children. it also makes good sense.\n\nif your husband died without a will, minnesota intestate law would award you the first $225,000 of that intestate property and 50% of the balance. so you would actually fare better if he were to die without a will. but that's why people make wills: to make sure their wishes are carried out.\n\nit's natural for a person to make sure their spouse is taken care of and won't be left out on the street after they're gone, and assuming that you will have enough money to live on and a place to live, i don't see why he should make a choice between you and his daughter.\n\nrecommended: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nlooking for a new husband because you won't receive 100% of your husband's estate when he passes away strikes me as an overreaction, at best. what were your expectations going into this marriage? did financial security figure into your decision to marry him?\n\ndo you co-own the family home? if he bought that before you married and it's only his name on the deed, will you have a life tenancy where you can live there — and, in the event you predecease his daughter, she would inherit it? these are fair questions to ask.\n\nbut this is also a good time to ask questions of yourself.\n\nalso see: i discovered through ancestry.com that my biological father is someone else — can i claim an inheritance as his heir?\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
the phrase death cleaning may sound jarring to unaccustomed ears, but the concept makes sense. it's about getting rid of excess rather than leaving a mess for your heirs to sort out.\n\ndeath cleaning is the literal translation of the swedish word dostadning, which means a decluttering process that begins as people age. it's popularized in the new book the gentle art of swedish death cleaning by margareta magnusson.\n\nmagnusson focuses on jettisoning stuff, but most older people's finances could use a good death cleaning as well. simplifying and organizing our financial lives can make things easier for us while we're alive and for our survivors when we're not.\n\nyou might like: why your clutter is costing you a bundle\n\nthis task becomes more urgent when we're in our 50s. our financial decision-making abilities generally peak around age 53, researchers have found, while rates of cognitive decline and dementia start to climb at age 60. as we age, we tend to become more vulnerable to fraud, scams, unethical advisers and bad judgment, says financial literacy expert lewis mandell, author of what to do when i get stupid. cleaning up our finances can help protect us.\n\nsome steps to take:\n\nconsolidate financial accounts\n\nfewer accounts are easier to monitor for suspicious transactions and overlapping investments, plus you may save money on account fees. your employer may allow you to transfer old 401(k) and ira accounts into its plan, or you can consolidate them into one ira. for simplicity, consider swapping individual stocks and bonds for professionally managed mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (but check with a tax pro before you sell any investments held outside retirement funds). move scattered bank accounts under one roof, but keep in mind that fdic insurance is generally limited to $250,000 per depositor per institution.\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nautomate payments\n\nmemory lapses can lead to missed payments, late fees and credit score damage, which can in turn drive up the cost of borrowing and insurance. you can set up regular recurring payments in your bank's bill payment system, have other bills charged to a credit card and set up an automatic payment so the card balance is paid in full each month. head off bounced-transaction fees with true overdraft protection, which taps a line of credit or a savings account to pay over-limit transactions.\n\nprune credit cards\n\ncertified financial planner carolyn mcclanahan in jacksonville, florida, recommends her older clients keep just two credit cards: one for everyday purchases and another for automatic bill payments. closing accounts can hurt credit scores, though, so wait until you're reasonably sure you won't need to apply for a loan before you start dramatically pruning. if you're not carrying balances or heavily using any of your cards, you can close several at a time. otherwise, close them gradually over several months or even years to minimize the credit score impact, and consider keeping your highest-limit cards.\n\nset up a watchdog\n\nidentify whom you want making decisions for you if you're incapacitated. use software or a lawyer to create two durable powers of attorney — one for finances, one for health care. you don't have to name the same person in both, but do name backups in case your original choice can't serve.\n\ndon't miss: how to talk to your family about your estate plan\n\nconsider naming someone younger, because someone your age or older could become impaired at the same time you do, says carolyn rosenblatt, an elder-law attorney in san rafael, california, who runs agingparents.com. grant online access to your accounts, or at least talk about where your trusted person can find the information she'll need, rosenblatt recommends.\n\nalso create in case of emergency files that your trusted person or heirs will need. these might include:\n\nyour will or living trust\n\nmedical directives, powers of attorney, living wills\n\nbirth, death and marriage certificates\n\nmilitary records\n\nsocial security cards\n\ncar titles, property deeds and other ownership documents\n\ninsurance policies\n\na list of your financial accounts\n\ncontact information for your attorney, tax pro, financial adviser and insurance agent\n\nphotocopies of passports, driver's licenses and credit cards\n\nalso read: how to provide for your pet in your estate plan\n\na safe-deposit box is not the best repository, because your trusted person may need access outside bank hours. a fireproof safe bolted to a floor in your home, or at minimum a locked file cabinet, may be better, as long as you share the combination or key (or its location) with your trusted person. scanning paperwork and keeping an encrypted copy in the cloud could help you or someone else re-create your financial life if the originals are lost or destroyed.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
reddit co-founder alexis ohanian announced on wednesday he will step down from daily duties at the internet company and focus his attention on initialized capital, the early stage venture capital firm that he co-founded and is known for investments such as coinbase and instacart. he will continue to sit on reddit's board.\n\nohanian, 34, said the timing of his decision reflected a number of personal and professional factors, including his marriage last year to tennis superstar serena williams and the birth of their daughter, alexis jr. ohanian said the decision also reflected his confidence in reddit's renewed growth, and his desire to focus his professional energy on investment opportunities in emerging technologies such as blockchain.\n\ni had a pretty productive last year, personally, when it came to getting married, as well as having a baby, ohanian told cio journal. i came back from parental leave at the start of january, and really started thinking about where i wanted to be, what i wanted to be doing.\n\nreddit was in stronger shape, he said, claiming that it boosted revenue fivefold during the last three-plus years since he had re-engaged with the company. reddit, which has been ranked as the fourth most popular u.s. internet site, raised $200 million last year and was in good hands with co-founder steve huffman as ceo, he said. the company, launched in 2005 and backed by y combinator, says it was valued in last year's funding at $1.8 billion.\n\nan expanded version of this report can be found at wsj.com\n\npopular on wsj.com:\n\ndow swings sharply, finishes 2.3% higher\n\nbanks cheer return of wild markets

a last will and testament is one of the building blocks of a sound estate plan. however, a will that is not reviewed and updated to keep pace with changes in the law and the testator's goals and circumstances could be worse than useless; it could, in fact, result in an inheritance and/or tax result that is opposed to what the testator intended. (a testator is one who makes a will.)\n\nhere are some important reasons to update your will and overall estate plan.\n\n1. the will needs an update if individuals named in it have died since it was signed. this issue was highlighted in the massachusetts supreme judicial court's recent ruling in ciani v. macgrath, where a decedent married a second time after his first wife had died, but his will — which only provided for his first wife and his children (by his first wife) — was never updated. not surprisingly, this situation resulted in litigation. the second wife filed a claim for her statutory elective share, the implementation of which became hotly contested. surely, the decedent would have not only wanted to avoid that litigation for his family but also to create a plan for his second wife on terms that he designed, not the default under state law. an update to the will would have made all the difference.\n\n2. while problems may obviously arise when a will is not updated after heirs or fiduciaries named in a will have died, there is also the potential for conflict between heirs when an individual dies intestate, i.e. without having a will. this may be especially true where the surviving family members are distant relatives. each state has its own intestacy laws that dictate the distribution of a decedent's assets when an individual dies intestate. similarly, each state has its own preprinted forms for undertaking probate. relying too heavily on the static wording in these forms could result in serious problems. another recent massachusetts case (leighton v. hallstrom) highlighted one such hazard. in hallstrom, a cousin in sweden was an intestate heir pursuant to state law, but he was omitted from the probate petition's list of beneficiaries. although the cousin timely filed the appropriate form in an attempt to assert his beneficiary status, the preprinted form's language did not sufficiently state his objection to his omission. after months of litigation and appeals, the foreign beneficiary was ultimately successful in confirming himself as a rightful heir, but it did not come without significant time and cost to the beneficiary and the estate.\n\n3. the tax laws frequently change. the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act is a recent example. in the estate area, the federal estate, gift and generation skipping transfer tax exemptions were increased to $11.18 million per person in 2018, indexed for inflation. (this increase is set to expire dec. 31, 2025, when the federal estate, gift and generation skipping tax exemption amounts are scheduled to revert to the prior $5 million amounts, adjusted for inflation.) many states also have an estate tax, but the tax regimes differ from state to state, with respect to lower exemption amounts and the rules governing how a will (or a trust) must be drafted in order to receive the benefit of those exemptions. income tax changes may also have a meaningful impact on how assets are left to intended heirs. an updated will (and trust) is critical to taking advantage of various tax benefits as relevant tax laws change and evolve.\n\n4. there are any number of changes that might occur in one's life. personal circumstances, which affect decisions about the transfer of wealth to intended heirs, such as a marriage or divorce, a change in net worth, the birth, adoption or marriage of a child, the aging of one's parents, the development of a disability or special needs, the possibility of long-term-care, can change an estate plan significantly. what might have seemed reasonable and prudent when a will was first drafted may very well be less so as these or other life changes occur. contractual obligations might also arise, such as a prenuptial agreement, separation agreement or a stockholders agreement, which should (or must be) incorporated into an estate plan. a change of state residency is another reason to consider will changes since each state has its own estate planning laws. updating the will helps to avoid the potential personal and legal problems arising from an outdated plan.\n\n5. an estate plan should be goal-driven, and the will is a key component of the planning blueprint. planning for one's children should be especially evaluated on a continuing basis as changes happen in their lives and the parents' goals and priorities correspondingly evolve. common scenarios involve designating a different guardian for minor or disabled children; changes to better assure that inheritances are protected from the claims of creditors (such as a divorcing spouse or a long-term-care provider); estate tax reduction planning for the child's own estate; maximizing the efficiency, privacy and cost- and time-savings for estate settlement, and mitigating the risk of the children fighting with each other over the estate. grandchildren, other family members, beloved friends and/or charities might come to the fore as intended beneficiaries. some of these and/or other goals might be nonexistent when an initial will is executed but may become critically important over the course of time. a regular review of the will (perhaps every two to four years, though the need varies case-to-case) will help ensure that the estate planning goals and the provisions that are meant to fulfill those goals are refreshed and aligned.\n\nit's vital to keep a will up-to-date, but it's important to remember that the will should not stand in isolation, but should be part of a comprehensive estate plan. a revocable trust is frequently a crucial complement, for inheritance, tax and probate avoidance planning purposes. advance directives, such as durable powers of attorney for property and health care and a hipaa authorization, can be invaluable to implement planning goals during a person's lifetime and to avoid a court's involvement via a guardianship and/or conservatorship. still, more planning structures and document options are available, depending on the level of wealth and estate complexity. yet, no matter the scope of one's planning, regular reviews and adjustments are a must.\n\ndon cordell is a partner at casner & edwards, focusing on estate and related tax planning and business law. he specializes in administering trusts and estates, long-term-care planning and other elder law matters, estate planning for disabled persons, guardianship and conservatorship matters and representation of clients in probate controversies. don can be reached at cordell@casneredwards.com.\n\nlaura ames is an associate at casner & edwards, representing high net worth clients in meeting their long-term wealth management goals by creating and implementing strategies to minimize tax burdens including estate, gift and generation skipping transfers. she advises individuals and families on estate and probate administration, and counsels fiduciaries and beneficiaries on the administration of complex trusts. she can be reached at ames@casneredwards.com.\n\nemily beekman is an associate at casner & edwards, concentrating her practice in the areas of estate planning, estate and trust administration and tax planning. beekman also specializes in estate planning for disabled persons, guardianship and conservatorship matters, and long-term-care planning and other elder law matters. emily can be reached at beekman@casneredwards.com.\n\nmeghan e. mccullen is an associate at casner & edwards specializing in estate planning, tax planning and probate and trust administration. meghan works with clients to implement estate plans tailored to the personal objectives of individuals and families with a view toward estate tax minimization and probate avoidance. she can be reached at mccullen@casneredwards.com.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband and i have five children: two are mine from a previous marriage and three are his. we raised all the children together and they refer to each other as siblings. i consider them all my children. they are all now in their 50s.\n\nmy husband passed away three years ago. i am relatively healthy for my age, financially secure, and have full mental capacity. lately, one of my daughters (let's call her jill) has been chiding me for frivolously spending her inheritance and her siblings' inheritance. i think none of this is any of her business and, sadly, told her so to her face. now she won't speak to me.\n\nour most heated discussion to date stemmed from her asking me how her sister, brenda, could afford to send her children to science camp this summer. i explained i was paying for camp because i thought it was a good opportunity for my grandchildren and will be a nice break for my daughter and son-in-law. brenda is a full-time mom, working part time from home. they both made decisions based on their personalities and lifestyles.\n\nalso see: i discovered through ancestry.com that my biological father is someone else — can i claim an inheritance as his heir?\n\nour previous confrontation regarded our physically disabled son who is no longer able to work at his chosen career. he works less hours now and at a lower pay. jill wants me to stop enabling him to work from home. she thinks he should be looking for a better paying job.\n\ni do not have many expenses other than my occasional travel with friends. i have medicare, supplemented through tricare for life, and paid up long-term care insurance. my financial adviser assures me that if i live within my current budget (which includes these frivolous items) i'll still have over $1 million in savings at age 100.\n\nwhat can i do to build bridges with my daughter, jill, and also make her understand that i take care of my own financial affairs?\n\nmarjorie\n\ndear marjorie,\n\nbrava! you appear to have done a pretty good job already.\n\nusually, tense moments such as the one you described with your daughter don't occur in a vacuum. if your daughter was not upset about how you choose to spend your money, she would likely be concerned about something else. in other words, her belief that she may be left behind in some way or overlooked is probably rooted in deeper resentments that even she may not even be aware of.\n\nalso see: 'we're in a happier place now!' my husband wrote a secret will when our marriage was rocky — should i now write one too?\n\ninvite her to lunch. tell her that you know she is coming from a good place and her intentions were good, even if you feel like some of those intentions were based on her own self-interest. sometimes, it's nice to write a card, put a stamp on it, go to the post office, and mail it in person, because it shows that you care enough to put time and thought into such a gesture. keep it short.\n\nyou could also call a family meeting to inform your children of your plans for your retirement and say how you appreciate everyone wants to make sure you are both solvent and have long-term care plans in place. you are under no obligation to tell your children how much they might inherit upon your passing. of course, you can't spend someone's inheritance. it's your money, no one else's.\n\nduring my 40-odd years on this planet, i have discovered that i don't always need to point out when i feel others have done me wrong, as tempting as that can be. and it is! i try to say what i need to do for me and how a comment or behavior might make me feel, and acknowledge there is not ill-intent. i know you're trying to help, but these are decisions i prefer to make. i appreciate you care.\n\nrecommended: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nnone of us chooses our words wisely all the time, but we can acknowledge when we might have done a better job. your daughter's behavior is hers to own, and you can only show her where your boundaries are if/when she attempts to cross that line again. pull out a tried and tested stock phrase from your financial boundary tool box, change the subject, and leave it at that.\n\nplease let me know how you get on. have a great year ahead.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
the problem with both marriage and divorce is that they are decisions usually made with the heart and not followed through with logical thinking.\n\nhow would it be if all marriage proposals included choices for an exit strategy? many wealthy families, people marrying later in life, and people who have been married more than once include that strategy. it is called a prenuptial agreement, or prenup, a written contract created by two people before they are married.\n\nmany people think asking for a prenup is like saying i love you, now, but who knows how i will feel a few years from now? especially if somebody better comes along.\n\naccording to pew research in 2013 40% of new marriages included at least one partner who had previously been married. the rate of divorce is about 60% in remarriages and 50% for all other marriages.\n\nanother big issue is that although the divorce rate has remained steady from 1990 to 2010 the amount of people over age 50 splitting up is on the rise. so with longer life expectancies and more gray divorces retirement planning is crucial.\n\nalthough the use of prenuptial agreements has gone up drastically in recent years, it is still far from the norm. when you are marrying and in love, you may find it hard to imagine that your marriage will ever end. when faced with the decision of ending a marriage, most people become hurt, angry or sometimes mean. having a prenup that establishes the property and financial rights of each spouse in the event of a divorce should help reduce the legal fees and keep the fighting to a minimum.\n\nread: why baby boomers are divorcing at a stunning rate\n\nso let's say there was no agreement and it is time to split the assets. the judge just said you each get 50% of the assets with no spousal support, now what? well, be very careful.\n\nhere is an example of a divorcing couple: the year the husband decided to retire, he also decided to reunite with an old girlfriend and leave his wife of 35 years. the husband had been the main breadwinner, the wife stayed home to raise their children and didn't go back to work until later in life. she also had taken a local not-for-profit position with no benefits and low salary. so when the judge (after much fighting) said split the assets 50/50 with no spousal support, what was the couple to do?\n\nbefore splitting any assets it is imperative to understand the complete value of the assets, the needs of each person and their goals. as the adviser for the wife, we needed to put together her request based on how she will be able to survive in retirement.\n\nhere are the assets that needed to be split between a 64-year-old man and woman:\n\nprimary new york residence (condo) $300,000 (no mortgage) florida condo $100,000 (no mortgage) joint accounts $285,000 401(k) husband $445,000 traditional ira husband $600,000 traditional ira wife $110,000 roth ira husband $45,000 roth ira wife $45,000\n\nso together they had $1.93 million, which would be a very comfortable divorce for them as a couple. however, now they must each live off half of the assets. there was also a very small pension for the husband from a previous company of $240 a month.\n\nthe good news, is splitting the homes was not an issue since the husband had already moved into the florida condo. the issue was how to equalize the housing dollars. the wife's residence had a value of $300,000 and the husband's only $100,000. if he accepted a larger share of the 401(k), he would be forgetting that there is officially a lien on that money by the irs for the taxes that have not yet been paid. if he received a larger portion of the roth iras he would be getting an unfair advantage of receiving tax-free dollars. so the joint account was split $242,500 for the husband and $42,500 for the wife.\n\nwe will leave the easy splits until last. so now we will do the qdro. a qdro qualified domestic relations order is a judgement, decree or order entered as part of a property division in a divorce or legal separation that splits a retirement plan or pension plan by recognizing joint marital ownership interests in the plan. in pretax retirement accounts the couple had $1,155,000. that would mean they would each get $577,500. since there is a significant fee to do a qdro, can this part of the case be handled without a qdro? absolutely.\n\nas i said above iras do not need a qdro. they can be split under a divorce or separation agreement. so in this case each spouse needs $577,500. the husband can keep his entire 401k and split his ira so that he keeps $132,500 and his wife will do a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to her ira of $467,500. that along with her $110,000 ira will give them each $577,500. the roth iras are equal so there is nothing to do with them. the final transaction to separate the assets is a qdro for the small pension.\n\nwhen all the accounts are set up, it is important to make sure the beneficiary designations are changed.\n\nso now are we done? no, we still had to discuss medical insurance. the wife has to apply for cobra for medical insurance until she reaches 65 and can apply for medicare. since she is already 64, she will only need cobra for a few months.\n\nfinally, we had to discuss social security. the husband is 64 and not yet claiming social security benefits yet and says he does not expect to claim them until he is 70. the wife will not be eligible to receive ½ of his benefits until either he starts collecting or after they have been divorced for two years. we decided to wait until the wife reaches full retirement age of 66 to collect social security. that will be a few months before the two-year anniversary of the divorce. so she will go back a few months later and bring her divorce decree and marriage certificate (to prove they were married more than 10 years) and file for one-half of her ex-husband's social security, which is higher than her full social security. (just a note: if at age 70 her social security would be higher than ½ of her ex-husband's she would be financially better off if she waited to collect one-half of his at the two-year anniversary and collect her larger amount at age 70.)\n\nmany people also forget the next step after the divorce attorney is the estate attorney. if something happens to you leaving the court house, who is your beneficiary under your will? who is your executor? who makes your medical decisions? who is your durable power of attorney? when you set up the court date to dissolve the marriage, make sure you have an appointment to sign your new legal documents.\n\nthere you have it. the accounts are split and now all that is left to do is finish paying the legal bills, which as i said earlier are significantly higher than if they'd had a prenup.\n\nerisa regulations trump prenuptial agreements. if you have decided to get a prenup or are already married and want to get a postnup it will not overrule spousal rights to a 401(k). the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa) is the federal law that governs pension plans in private industry. erisa says that a spouse has the right to be the beneficiary of a retirement plan unless they specifically elect to waive that right.\n\nso, there you have it marriage can be hard but divorce can be expensive.\n\nbeth blecker is a family wealth manager at eastern planning and a member of ed slott's elite ira advisor group. for more information abouted slott's elite ira advisor group.
some details on the split between jeff bezos and his wife, mackenzie, became public thursday — not splashed across tabloid pages, not in some dramatic courtroom flourish, but in a dry securities and exchange commission filing and a brief statement from the splitting pair saying the amazon.com founder was keeping 75% of the couple's company stock.\n\nafter 25 years, four kids — and the creation of amazon.com amzn, +0.33% — jeff bezos, the tech behemoth's ceo, and mackenzie announced in january they were deciding to divorce.\n\nthe parting pair will join the hundreds of thousands of americans who split every year. but that's pretty much where the similarities end. carving up complex assets, dealing with white-hot media curiosity and the sheer amount of money at play are all ways this is not the undoing of any normal nuptial, divorce lawyers told marketwatch.\n\nbezos, 55, the world's richest man for now at least, is someone who's very used to getting his way, said california matrimonial attorney peter walzer, president of the american academy of matrimonial lawyers.\n\nin this arena, he's got to compromise and work out a deal or the end result could be bad for him, his investors, the company, everyone involved.\n\nkind of a corporate deal\n\nand it looks like a deal did get hammered out. apart from agreeing to jeff bezos' hold on 75% of the couple's shares, mackenzie will receive about 4% of the company's outstanding shares and is giving up voting rights, according to an sec filing. she also will not have a stake in the washington post, the complexifier national newspaper bezos owns, or his space-travel company blue origin, according to her statement on twitter twtr, -1.47% thursday afternoon.\n\nmackenzie tweeted thursday she was grateful to have finished the process of dissolving my marriage with jeff with support from each other and everyone who reached out to us in kindness, and looking forward to next phase as co-parents and friends.\n\nback in january, the couple didn't delve into details on the financial terms of separation and amazon, headquartered in seattle, wash. didn't respond to a request for further comment.\n\nthe bezos' statement at the time said they envisioned wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures.\n\n 'we might learn the most by whatever sec filing is made.'  — —david starks, a partner at mckinley irvin in seattle, wash.\n\nwe might learn the most by whatever sec filing is made, said david starks, a partner at mckinley irvin in seattle, in january. the documents companies file with regulators like the sec can discuss material changes in stock ownership.\n\nand indeed, that's part of the way it shook out: amazon disclosed in an sec filing that mackenzie would get about 4% of the company's outstanding stock under her divorce agreement.\n\nthe sec filing said the couple filed their divorce paperwork on thursday and a divorce decree was expected to be issued within 90 days. the filing did not specify which court where the couple filed their divorce petition.*\n\nif it was filed in washington, the state's rules on community property will govern. starks said that means typically all assets acquired during parties' marriage is community property subject to division by the court in a 'just and equitable' way.\n\nbut 'just and equitable' needn't mean 50/50, he pointed out. starks noted that in many cases — at least where billions weren't involved — the spouse making less money would be getting at least half to account for their smaller income, starks said.\n\namazon was founded in july 1994. jeff and mackenzie, now 48, tied the knot in 1993. jeff said last year that mackenzie did the accounting during amazon's first year, reuters noted.\n\nstarks wagered lawyers for both sides had already worked out a deal on the divorce, with the public announcement one of the final strokes.\n\nin washington, divorcing parties don't need to file property settlement agreements with court, he noted. we may never know how they organized everything.\n\n it's also unclear whether the bezoses have a prenuptial agreement. \n\nit's also unclear whether they have a prenuptial agreement. news reports said it appeared the pair didn't have such a deal.\n\nif they did, the deal's terms would govern the split with little leeway for challenge, according to raoul felder, a manhattan divorce lawyer with his share of high profile clients, like new york city mayor rudy giuliani and robin givens, mike tyson's ex.\n\nbut felder guessed they didn't because the pre-marriage pacts only started leaving its bad sort of discoloration about 25 years ago. the reason for the new public awareness? none other than donald trump's very public parting with ivana trump by 1992. that was the first one that was very visible, felder said of a split played out on new york city tabloid pages.\n\nfelder brushed off the feel-good language of the bezos' initial statement in january.\n\nit's all baloney, said felder, who hasn't met the couple.\n\nhigh-profile divorces mean intense media scrutiny\n\nthe one thing that incredibly rich don't have, that they can't really buy is privacy, walzer said.\n\nhe represented actress katie holmes when she allegedly surprised tom cruise by filing for divorce. walzer, a partner at walzer melcher, said they chose to file in new york, not california, to try keeping the case confidential. within five minutes of filing, it was in the press, he said.\n\nattorney eleanor alter knows the media attention divorces can attract. she's represented the likes of robert deniro, madonna and mia farrow and other high-net worth clients.\n\nbut they don't all go that way. she's handled big-name divorces that garnered no attention because everyone was very quiet and discreet. alter said it depended on the personalities of the spouses and lawyers who were involved, not to mention the friends and relatives.\n\nup until thursday, the details on mackenzie and jeff's split have been pretty hush-hush. but there's been plenty of ink spilled on bezos and his new girlfriend, lauren sanchez. the national enquirer got a hold of steamy texts between the tech magnate and sanchez. the wall street journal reported that sanchez's brother, michael, allegedly leaked the messages to the tabloid for $200,000. he's denied he did. bezos published a blog post saying the national enquirer was trying to play hard ball with threats of publishing raunchy images mixed up in bezos' banter with lauren sanchez.\n\non thursday, bezos said he was grateful for mackenzie's support and kindness.\n\na divorce the size of a corporate split\n\nat one point last fall, amazon was almost worth $1 trillion dollars.\n\nif there was no prenuptial agreement, felder said, the jeff-mackenzie divorce would be like two major corporations splitting apart.\n\nbut big money doesn't necessarily lead to bitter divorces, alter said, emphasizing she didn't know the specific financial stakes of the bezos divorce. though making for more complicated deals, divorces involving a lot of money can be easier to resolve than those with lesser amounts to go around, she said. according to alter, most of the time, when there are a lot of assets and money, if people aren't crazy it settles.\n\nhowever the specifics work out, the bezos' money seems ultimately destined for their family, philanthropy or a mix of the two. the couple has already been donating to various causes. their day one fund pledged $2 billion last fall to address homelessness and build new preschools.\n\namazon shares were down 0.2% thursday, but have gained 28.6% in the last 12 months, while the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% has gained 8.7% in that time and dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% has gained 13.1%.\n\nthis story was originally published on jan. 9, 2019 and updated april 4, 2019.
the latest installment of the bachelorette has come to a close. but before the show could tie up those loose ends and let angry members of #teampeter stew over her final choice, bachelorette rachel lindsay had to, once again, discuss the cross-examination of her suitors throughout the season.\n\nwhen she's not on a reality tv show searching for love, lindsay is a lawyer. her profession came up a number of times, perhaps most notably during an early incident when one of the bachelors, demario jackson, was confronted by a woman who claimed to be his girlfriend. she showed up on set with text messages and other evidence. he denied it.\n\narmed with this evidence, lindsay, 35, questioned jackson, looked at all sides of the case, and rendered her verdict.\n\nhe was promptly booted from the show.\n\nif there's one thing about the bachelorette that rings true, according to experts, it's this: people will use skills from their professions to help find the perfect partner.\n\nsome professions are pickier than others. eharmony\n\nwith american women reaching new heights in their careers — replacing male ceos at an increasing rate — and acquiring new skill — particularly in science, technology, engineering and math, or stem — men may find that the women they pursue are digging a little more deeply and asking for more than just a nice guy when searching for a mate.\n\n 'more women are using their business background to sort through mating opportunities and find the right man for them.'  — dr. helen fisher, chief scientific adviser at dating site match.com\n\nsome questions that might spook single men?

before winning the presidential election, donald trump had said he would strongly consider overturning the supreme court's decision to give same-sex couples the right to marry.\n\nwith a vacancy on the supreme court, trump has said he would like to appoint a supreme court judge ideologically aligned with late conservative judge antonin scalia, who died in february. three judges who voted to legalize same-sex marriage — ruth bader ginsburg, anthony kennedy and stephen breyer — are 83, 80 and 78, respectively. in his nine-page dissent on the june 2015 ruling by the supreme court on obergefell vs. hodges, scalia wrote, to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.\n\n donald trump had said he would strongly consider overturning the supreme court's june 2015 decision to give same-sex couples the right to marry. \n\nmarriage equality was widely regarded as the last frontier for gay-rights activists. in june 2014, the supreme court overturned the 1996 defense of marriage act, opening up federal benefits to same-sex married couples, but state-level benefits were still in limbo in the 13 states that ban same-sex marriage, including michigan, ohio, kentucky, florida and tennessee. overturning the supreme court decision would mean that spouses (and children) in same-sex families might not be eligible for federal health care or company health insurance provided by their spouse's plan, and same-sex married couples would have to pay federal inheritance tax if one spouse left money to the other.\n\ndon't miss: by winning the election, donald trump proved that he is a master of branding\n\ngay-rights activists say it would take a complex confluence of events to challenge the june 2015 ruling. if trump meets the first condition of changing the makeup of the court, there then would need to be a conflict on the issue of same-sex marriage that would compel the court to revisit the issue, chris johnson, chief political and white house correspondent for the washington blade, a d.c.-based lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender newspaper, wrote in that paper. one possibility is a state could decide to defy obergefell and pass a law barring or inhibiting marriage rights for gay couples. such a measure already failed just two months ago in tennessee. (in june 2015, the supreme court ruled 5 to 4 that the ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.)\n\n if trump meets the first condition of changing the makeup of the supreme court, there then would need to be a conflict on the issue of same-sex marriage that would compel the court to revisit the issue. \n\nthe gift tax is another area that was made easier for same-sex couples with the supreme court ruling last year. a married couple can give away $28,000 without incurring a federal gift tax penalty versus $14,000 for a single person. that's an advantage for couples where one partner is wealthy and wants to avoid federal estate taxes, experts say. with the supreme court ruling, spouses in same-sex couples are also eligible for social security benefits, and they will be covered under the survivor benefits rule for both defined contribution and defined benefits plans.\n\nif the law was overturned, same-sex couples would no longer be allowed to file federal tax returns using the married filing jointly or married filing separately options in order to receive state-level spousal tax breaks and benefits. in arkansas, michigan and mississippi, where same-sex marriage was previously not recognized at a state level before the june 2015 ruling, there was no conformity between federal and state taxes, so same-sex married couples have to file taxes as if they are single, says carol calhoun, an attorney at venable law firm in washington, d.c. and that does not account for the damage to the perceived legitimacy and social acceptance of same-sex relationships.\n\nlisten to our new podcast:money, markets & more (or subscribe on itunes): the latest episodes: is buying ivanka trump shoes a form of political endorsement? and talking to your kids about donald trump.\n\nnot everyone believes trump would attempt to undo the supreme court decision through his judicial appointments. at his core, i don't think donald trump cares about marriage equality. meaning, i don't think it bothers him, says crystal broyles, a program manager in bentonville, ark., who recently married her partner of eight years. however, he partnered up with a man who cares very deeply about lgbt discrimination. if it weren't for mike pence, i wouldn't be concerned about lgbt issues and the trump administration at all. the next four years are a mystery, but we are resilient, we are strong, and we will continue to fight for equality and freedom.\n\nthere will be additional issues related to marriage equality, such as businesses that want to discriminate against same-sex couples, says brett ward, a partner in law firm blank rome's matrimonial practice group in new york. there have been a slew of so-called religious freedom bills winding their way through the courts in various states. they could allow a baker or even a hotel or restaurant to refuse service to a same-sex couple on religious grounds. people will have less choice, he says. those issues are brewing now. they may or may not change the current status quo, but certainly the respect and dignity that everyone should be treated equally.

because he had his chance to say yay or nay and, tough luck buster, time's up, and he sold some of your stepfather's belongings, so if he can do that, you can have the house?\n\none car or watch, or whatever it was that he sold, does not mean you can walk away with the lot. that is sharp practice. this is not a game show where winner takes all.\n\nthis is a family home. it's time to consider sitting down with your brother, and a lawyer, and consider your own moral stance on this issue too.\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. by emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch.
the presidential inauguration of donald trump was notable for who did not perform and, crucially, it's the ticket- and album-buying public that appear to be calling the shots.\n\naside from the mormon tabernacle choir, there were few acts that were household names and even fewer that are a-listers or even c-listers performing on friday. the bruce springsteen tribute band, b street band, backed out of performing at the festivities, telling the associated press that this whole thing just got blown out of proportion.

(members of the lgbt community cited vice president mike pence's opposition to marriage equality, among other issues.)\n\nmarie osmond, who has played at several inaugurations, including ronald reagan's 1981 inauguration with her brother donny, told yahoo finance earlier this month: i think we should all support our president whether we're happy or sad. this is america. after a backlash to these comments on twitter, osmond clarified her remarks and said they were taken out of context. many of you have seen various stories saying that i volunteered or that i am performing at the inauguration, she tweeted. so let me be clear: i have no intention of performing at this inauguration, no matter who won!\n\ntrump's inauguration has become a flashpoint for this growing resistance economy, which has empowered consumers and bedeviled celebrities (and even some companies, including l.l. bean) on social media, experts say. it is due to the proliferation, speed, and reach of social media that we perceive the resistance economy as a growing phenomenon in 2017, said ryann reynolds-mcilnay, assistant professor of merchandising management at oregon state university college of business in corvallis.\n\nthe hashtag #grabyourwallet was used as a way to leverage support. this resistance to performing at the inauguration whether due to deeply held political beliefs or the deep pockets was satirized by andy borrowitz, a columnist for the new yorker, in an article headlined: karaoke machine backs out of performing at inauguration.\n\n 'it is due to the proliferation, speed, and reach of social media that we perceive the resistance economy as a growing phenomenon in 2017. but it may be easier to sway celebrities than companies.'  — —ryann reynolds-mcilnay, assistant professor at oregon state university.\n\nthese cases don't include the many country music legends, internationally famous opera singers, pop stars who have fans from both ends of the political spectrum who have decided not to perform at the inauguration due to a backlash (real or imagined) from fans on social media, and the very real risk that at least half those fans could keep a tight hold on their purse strings when they release their next album or hold their next concert.\n\ntrump, ahead of the inauguration, said, i want the people rather than so-called a-list celebrities. the mormon tabernacle choir performed in washington, d.c., although not all their members were required to attend (and there have been some abstentions), as did country music star toby keith, jackie evancho from the reality tv show america's got talent and rock band 3 doors down. (the trump campaign did not respond to request for comment.)\n\nsocial media gives everyday consumers great power but, unlike the montgomery bus boycotts, it doesn't always last. it's a game of cat and mouse, sinnreich says. the montgomery bus boycott lasted for 381 days and historians have given it credit as a significant milestone in ending segregation in the south. but in 2017 consumers have a short attention span. it's easy to make a mistake to boycott the wrong company for the wrong reasons, and it's difficult to sustain because a new meme will arrive and they have already moved onto the next action.\n\nindeed, the resistance economy has had mixed success in the past, reynolds-mcilnay says. it may be easier to sway celebrities than companies, she says. conversely, it may also be more difficult for consumers to resist products from brands if they're on discount and, as far as politics are concerned, you are what you wear doesn't always ring true. ralph lauren took a bipartisan approach by designing inaugural day outfits for both melania trump and hillary clinton.\n\nwhat's more, some 83% of millennial women are still positively disposed to ivanka trump, a percentage that likely cuts across party lines, and 51% were still likely to keep her products on their shopping lists, according to a recent survey from customer loyalty research consultancy brand keys. i don't focus much on the politics of my corporations, but i do try my best to make ethical purchases in the few ways i can, marketwatch reporter kari paul recently wrote.\n\n 'the lack of a-list performers reinforces the anti-establishment message of the trump campaign, which is absolutely brilliant and is going to play really well to his base.'  — —aram sinnreich, professor of communications at the american university.\n\ncase in point: in 2012, fast-food chain chick-fil-a's president and chief operating officer, dan cathy, made several public comments about his opposition to same-sex marriage—those who support it, he said in one interview, were inviting god's judgment. there was an uproar on social media, and the jim henson co. ended a licensing agreement for a children's chick-fil-a puppet meal. but two years later, cathy said it was probably a mistake to come out so publicly against marriage equality. and you learn from those mistakes, he said. if not, you're just a fool. i'm thankful that i lived through it and i learned a lot from it.\n\nothers have jumped (and tap-danced) at the chance to perform. chicago-born irish dancer michael flatley will introduce his lord of the dance troupe at the weekend's festivities. this is a very special night and it is a great honor to be invited to be part of it, he told the irish independent.\n\nhowever, riverdance, another dance troupe where flatley first came to international prominence in 1994, tweeted, just to clear up any confusion folks — #riverdance will not be performing at the #inauguration michael flatley's lord of the dance is. so far, the twittersphere has been imagining how the deal was done.\n\nin the meantime, americans who oppose or support trump might be better targeting their ire at lawmakers rather than companies. boycotts reinforce the power of the marketplace by making companies and celebrities the focus of political action rather than the legislator, sinnreich says.\n\nand the lack of star power at the inauguration has allowed trump to re-brand the festivities for the working man. the lack of a-list performers reinforces the anti-establishment message of the trump campaign, which is absolutely brilliant and is going to play really well to his base.
life is long – or at least it can be.\n\na fascinating chart from information is beautiful has highlighted the things that research shows can lengthen your life, and those that can shorten it — everything from eating less, exercising more and being optimistic (longer life) to obesity, alcoholism and sleeping too much (shorter life). they even point out that there's evidence that little-known factors like having more pets can lengthen your life, while living in the city can shorten it.\n\nthen (perhaps a bit tongue in cheek) they note that they've come up with the ultimate recipe for a longer life, and it's this: being a married, happy-go-lucky, outdoors-loving, sex-mad, hippie party girl in senior management with a cat.\n\nok, that may sound extreme, but in some ways they're onto something. many of those factors do indeed lengthen your life, according to studies that marketwatch examined. here's a look.\n\nmarried:numerous studies show that married people tend to live longer than unmarried people. one recent study even found that people who never married, compared with those who had been in a stable marriage as adults, were more than twice as likely to die early. just be sure to note that other studies have found that it's a happy marriage that really promotes longevity.\n\nhappy-go-lucky: optimists live longer than pessimists, research shows. indeed, a study by researchers at the university of pittsburgh, which examined the lives of more than 100,000 women ages 50 and up, revealed that those who expect good things to happen were 14% less likely to die from a cause than pessimists were.\n\noutdoors-loving: a meta-analysis published in 2018 found that spending time outdoors reduces your risk of a number of ailments, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, premature death, stress and high blood pressure. forest bathing is already really popular as a therapy in japan -- with participants spending time in the forest either sitting or lying down, or just walking around. our study shows that perhaps they have the right idea, the researchers wrote.\n\nsex-mad:one study that tracked men over roughly a decade found that those who had sex twice a week had half the death rate of those who only did it once a month.\n\nhippie party girl. while it's hard to define what exactly is meant by a hippie, certainly some hippies are those who love live music (some research shows that gig-going may extend life), health food (numerous studies show that this can extend life) and meditation (research supports its impact on longevity). and while you can't party too much (alcoholism shortens life extensively), people that engage frequently with friends live longer. and, of course, women, on average, live longer than men.\n\nsenior management. middle-class professionals live years longer than unskilled laborers. professional men lived to roughly 80, compared with just 72.7 for men in unskilled jobs; professional women to 85.1, versus 78.1.\n\ncat owner. a study published in the journal of vascular and interventional neurology found that owning a cat slashed people's risk of dying from heart disease -- which is one of the most common killers.\n\nof course, many of these studies can't prove cause and effect, some points (like marriage, healthy eating) have far more research behind them than others, and you may be all of these things and still die prematurely. still, the chart is worth a look.
dear moneyist,\n\ni am a married woman, age 69, and my husband is 79. i am his second wife and we have been married for 22 years. he is not in the best of health and requires my care.\n\nhe suffers with debilitating arthritic pain and is not able to do anything except his daily living needs, watching tv and directing me to what i need to do. i am now responsible of taking care of everything in and outside of the home.\n\nhe no longer drives because of his failing vision, so i am my husband's caretaker, driver, butler and the whipping post. i took a vow for better or worse, but i am sure wife no. 1 got the better deal.\n\nhe long ago promised his grandson, whom he raised, that he would inherit his house. my husband purchased this home four years before we were married and we recently paid the mortgage off. there is no written agreement regarding the house.\n\n i hope i don't sound like a greedy person. because of the pandemic, i am acutely aware that you need to be prepared for the future.  — wife no. 2\n\nwhen we were first married, my husband convinced me to put his name on my home, and he paid off the balance of $30,000 on it. i agreed to this as long as my name went on all of his assets, including the house in question.\n\nat the time of this arrangement, i was ok with it. after 22 years, i am not so agreeable. the home value has increased significantly since 1995 and i don't feel the grandson deserves the appreciation of the home should my husband die.\n\nwe live in a community-property state. i am his wife and i have the responsibility of caring for him, and feel i should receive what i am entitled to when he dies. his family, including his grandson, seldom come around or call except when something is needed.\n\ni hope i don't sound like a greedy person. because of the pandemic, i am acutely aware that you need to be prepared for the future. i am not getting any younger and i want to make sure i have the resources to live my life.\n\nmy husband refuses to get a living trust, and i feel that i am not prepared should he die. what do you think i should do?

let's talk about debt, baby.\n\nbefore 44-year-old theresa got married a few years back, she and her now ex-husband shared many details of their financial lives — even showing one another their respective credit reports soon after they were engaged. but there's one financial thing the life coach, who asked that we use an alias to protect her privacy, didn't tell her husband: how much foreign debt she had. and when her ex — whose government job required spousal background checks — learned of the $50,000 business loan his wife had taken out while living abroad, it didn't go well. he was furious and never recovered from it, she said. we divorced a year and half after marriage. he said that i misrepresented my finances.\n\nnowadays, theresa says that if she had to do it again, it would all be on the table.\n\n\n\nand financial experts agree, as money secrets like hidden debts can wreck a marriage. keeping financial secrets in a relationship, just like any other type of infidelity, is a sure-fire way to spark an argument, says comparecards.com chief industry analyst matt schulz — and arguments about money are the no. 1 predictor of whether you'll get divorced, research shows.\n\n\n\nstill, an estimated 15 million americans are actively keeping some kind of financial account a secret from their partners, data from creditcards.com shows. and millions of others may be keeping a secret without fully meaning to: nearly one in three married people didn't know how much non-mortgage debt their significant other had before they got engaged, according to a survey released in december by comparecards.com, and 60% of couples admit to rarely talking about debts with their significant other, according to a survey from merrill edge.\n\nit's best to tell the person about your debt pretty early on in the relationship, experts say. for jacksonville native j.r. duren — who had $111,000 in student loan and credit card debt when he met his now-wife in 2008 — that point was five dates in, when he thought the relationship could be going somewhere. i didn't want our relationship to be in doubt over my financial situation, so i figured i might as well eliminate that possibility and tell her before making our relationship official.\n\nso when exactly is the right time? erika martinez, a clinical psychologist in miami, says that while you should not mention your debt level after just a date or two (this is private information, she explains) once you see that the relationship is getting serious — and before you move in together or get engaged — it's time to talk. it's about trust and authenticity, which are pillars of solid relationships, she explains. if a relationship is getting serious, it would be important to continue deepening that trust by sharing who you really are with your partner in many facets, including financially.\n\nof course, it's not the most comfortable conversation to have. forty-year-old toronto resident max, who asked that we withhold his last name, admitted that it was a little embarrassing that he had a $35,000 car loan in his name, especially since she [his partner] did not have any debt. what's more, 40-year-old duren, who had $111,000 in debt including credit card debt, notes that you share that kind of thing and you worry that person is going to say 'that's crazy.\n\nit can also be challenging to figure out how to bring up the topic. ideally, the conversation would be had at a relevant time — you want to segue from an existing conversation regarding finance rather than bring it up out of the blue, explains nate masterson, the director of finance for maple holistics . that's how a handful of couples that marketwatch spoke to did it: when max told his partner about his $35,000 car loan, it came up when they were talking about buying a home. and when foster city, calif.-resident katie austin, 32, told her partner about the $22,000 she still owed on her student loans, she was going through her bills at the time and mentioned that she had these loans and was going to be paying them down more quickly.\n\nsometimes, of course, that opportunity doesn't present itself, so you'll have to force the conversation. as a general guideline, it's best to be straightforward and clear, says carrie schwab-pomerantz, the senior vice president of charles schwab & co. — who says that you must share all of the details including what you owe, to whom, and how you plan to pay it back. try to keep your emotions at bay. for example, if you're contemplating a joint expense — for example, a vacation — simply say 'you know, i have to budget x per month to repay my student loan, so i can only afford x for our trip.' she adds if you're having to reveal a spending problem as the cause of your debt, try to pick a time when you're both relaxed and focused, whether that's a prearranged date or an impromptu talk. share your information clearly, and present a solution.\n\nwhile few look forward to the dreaded debt conversation, it can be a boon for a relationship: duren, who says he did not mince my words when he told his partner about his $111,000 debt, adds that the conversation was a little awkward. but, he says, the dividends of transparency were far more valuable than any small moments of discomfort. the couple are now married.\n\nthis story was originally published in january 2018 and has been updated.

dear moneyist,\n\ntwenty years ago, i was married at age 60 to my second husband. he has four grown children; i have one. when we married, we lived in my condo, which we later sold to buy a new home. the majority of the purchase price was from my condo sale and my inheritance savings, but my husband did contribute several thousand dollars. we have mostly shared our living expenses and keep separate bank accounts.\n\nseveral years ago, we had our wills prepared and we agreed that upon our death or deaths, the home would be sold with half the sale being divided among his children, and half going to my child. my conscience sometimes tells me the home sale should be divided equally among our children. however, since it was mostly my money that purchased the home, i feel it is fair. please give me your thoughts.\n\nj.k.\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here\n\ndear j.k.,\n\ni have received several letters over the years about the division of a family home, and some have been more complicated than others. in this scenario, for example, a couple wondered how to divide their home among their three shared children, and the husband's three children from a previous marriage. i suggested they split the pie nine ways, and give their shared children two slices each. when i answered their letter, i thought that was the most meticulous — or, as i said, churlish — of the options facing them, but now i believe that word was too harsh, and that it was among the fairest options.\n\nyour predicament, as much as it could be regarded as one, is somewhat simpler. you not only chose the fairest option, you compromised upon what is actually known as the compromise price effect by retailers. you were faced with three options rather than two: the most generous for your own child (she gets the house, minus the initial investment and other costs), the middle option (the one you have settled upon) and the least generous option for your own child (you divide the house equally among your child and your husband's three children).\n\nthe moneyist: my son inherited money after his father was killed in an accident. a woman came forward with another legal heir. what now?\n\nthere's a hefty body of academic research — like this journal of marketing research study by professors of marketing at yale university and stanford university — showing the middle option as a compromise for consumers. when people are presented with three tip choices — 20%, 25% and 30%, for instance — they're more likely to choose the middle option even if it's more than the traditional 20%, according to an analysis of 13 million new york city taxi rides by the university of chicago's booth school of business published in the american economic journal.\n\nso i agree with your decision. it may be wiser to put your home in a trust, with instructions for distribution after you are both gone. if you predecease your husband, he could decide to change his will. but as far as your decision goes on how to divide your home, i agree with your joint decision. your husband's children are receiving a gift as much as an inheritance. your own child would have received a larger inheritance had you not remarried. this way, you acknowledge and dignify both contributions, and make sure no one is forgotten in the will.\n\nas kristen wiig's target lady says: approved!\n\nthe moneyist: my mother's husband died. her savings are dwindling, yet she pays my sister's bills. should i intervene?\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
it wasn't much of a surprise when the most closely-watched member of the high school class of 2016, announced she would be matriculating at harvard university, the school perhaps most synonymous with america's powerful and elite. but one detail of malia obama's college plans set her apart from previous generations of presidential children. she will be taking a year off before moving to cambridge, mass., in 2017.\n\ntaking time off between high school and college — or a gap year — has grown popular for a certain set of students, experts say. teens look for a quick off ramp from their heavily programmed lives and the growing cost of college increasingly necessitates that students have a clear sense of their priorities before they get there. interest will likely only skyrocket after obama's announcement and data indicates it already has — visits to gooverseas.com, a site that connects students with gap year and study abroad programs, were twice their typical levels on sunday, according to the company's chief executive mitch gordon.\n\nif this google trends chart is any indication, malia obama's announcement generated some interest in gap years. google trends\n\nbut taking time off before freshman year means different things to different types of students. on either end of the income spectrum there's opportunity and there's different motivations, said kevin fudge, the manager of consumer advocacy government relations at american student assistance, an organization that helps families find ways to pay for college and manage their student loan payments. he said that gap years can be beneficial for students from a variety of backgrounds as long as they go into the year with a detailed plan for how they plan to spend their time off and how they plan to return to school.\n\nit's important to do it purposefully, instead of by default, fudge said.\n\nmalia obama to attend harvard after 'gap year'\n\nfor relatively wealthy students, a gap year often means travelling abroad, studying and exploring new places and cultures. roughly 46% of alumni of gap year programs came from families earning $100,000 or more, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the american gap association, a collective of organizations offering gap year opportunities.\n\njust 9% came from families earning less than $50,000, the survey found. the bulk of students who responded to the survey spent their gap years in other countries and top destinations included ecuador, israel, india and australia. (though 14% did stay in the u.s. for their gap year).\n\nstudents of more modest means may opt for a more service-oriented program like americorps, which doesn't cost money and also provides members with grants that can help offset the cost of college.\n\nbut if poor students take a break between high school and college, it's typically to earn money to pay for school, experts say. and, unlike malia obama, they may not already be admitted to school. the people i know who take time off are not taking a 'gap year,' they're delaying college, said sara goldrick-rab, a professor at the university of wisconsin, who studies equity in higher education.\n\nin 2011, goldrick-rab decided to take a closer look at students taking time off between high school and college, in part to counter the narrative that these students are mostly wealthy world travelers. students who take a gap between high school and college are six times more likely to come from low-income families, she found. in some cases, they're delaying school because of marriage, children and other factors, the study found. these students also took more time off than their wealthier peers — 13 months on average compared to four and a half months. that's particularly troubling given that some research shows that students who delay entering college by more than one year are less likely complete their bachelor's degree.\n\nwill the gap year become a rite of passage?\n\ngoldrick-rab said she's not opposed to the idea of students starting college when they're a little bit older and more mature, but she'd like it to be more of a standard so that low-income teens who take time off to make money to pay for college end up on equal footing with their wealthier peers.\n\nsome groups are working to make that a reality. non-profit organization, service year alliance recently launched with that intent. our basic goal is to make a service year a common expectation and opportunity for all young americans, said aly bullock, the service year alliance's communications manager. the organization works to match interested students with service opportunities, like working as an elementary school tutor or a food access educator, that are paid and full-time. the structure and pay that comes with those opportunities can help to make them more accessible to students from a variety of backgrounds, bullock said.\n\nright now doing a gap year has the perception of being an expensive option that could potentially lead to students being off track, bullock said.\n\ngordon, of gooverseas.com, said he's hopeful that malia's decision will help push the gap year into the mainstream in the u.s. everybody has been pretty happy and excited about that announcement, gordon said in a phone interview from the american gap association's second annual conference in boston. though he acknowledged that accessibility and costs are definitely a big issue in the gap year industry, gordon argued that taking time off can be a good experience for students of all types.\n\npeople aren't ready always to go to college, he said. they definitely don't know what they want to do for the rest of their lives and so give people a year to experience the world a little bit.\n\nstudies of students at some elite colleges show that those who have taken a gap year do better academically than their peers (that may also be in part because they're wealthier on average and therefore more likely to be successful anyway). some elite schools, including harvard, even encourage admitted students to take time off before enrolling.\n\nstill others are skeptical. barmak nassirian, the director of federal relations and policy analysis at the american association of state colleges and universities, described a gap year as a lousy idea for most students because they may lose much of the knowledge they gained in high school in the intervening years. the exception: students who can find an experience that is actually better than what they might get during their first year of school, he said. but, he believes, that's rare.\n\nthe best, most structured, most expedited way to a degree is to transfer to college as soon as possible, he said. nassirian said he worries that the gap year could follow in the footsteps of the study abroad program — an experience that was once reserved for students interested in spending some time in another country to learn a foreign language, but is now ubiquitous. you know what they do? they go to europe typically to study in english with other american students, he said. i certainly don't want the gap years to become that.\n\nof course, special circumstances beyond those already listed likely factored into obama's decision to take time off before school. attending college while your father is still in the oval office seems not ideal (see the plotline of first daughter or chelsea clinton's paparazzi-filled first day at stanford university if you have any doubts about this).\n\nbut even for those who use the time between high school and college to work a retail job, the experience can be beneficial, fudge said. teens may find themselves working at a starbucks alongside one of those famed college-educated baristas who can provide some perspective on how to approach higher education. the gap year expands the definition of the college experience, he said. you're preparing the student for independence.
if you designate beneficiaries for your retirement accounts, that's usually a surefire way to pass those assets directly to your desired heirs without going through probate—but not always.\n\nbecause those beneficiary designations are so important, you should verify your choices every year in case there's a change due to, say, marriage, birth, divorce or death. especially marriage and divorce. which brings me to a crucial issue: when dealing with ira and 401(k) beneficiary designations, there's a key difference when it comes to your spouse.\n\nin general, a spouse who hasn't been named beneficiary of an ira isn't entitled to inherit it. unlike 401(k) plans, iras aren't governed by erisa—the employee retirement income security act—so these accounts don't have the same protections for spouses. you're free to name whoever you wish as your ira beneficiary, even if you're married, provided you don't live in a community property state. indeed, iras are excluded from erisa coverage, even if the funds originated in a 401(k).\n\nby contrast, under erisa, if the owner of a 401(k) account is married when he or she dies, his or her spouse is automatically entitled to receive money, regardless of what the beneficiary designation says. the exact percentage seems to be a matter of some disagreement—some lawyers say 50%, while others put it at 100%. if there's no beneficiary listed, the spouse is entitled to 100% of the account.\n\nthe spouse can sign a waiver, giving up his or her claim to the account, but only if the spouse is at least 35 years of age. it isn't enough just to name someone else on the beneficiary form that your employer gives you. the waiver must be filled out, with the spouse consenting to the participant's choice of beneficiary. if your spouse signs the waiver, which should be provided by the firm that administers your 401(k), a plan representative or a notary public must act as a witness. why all this bother? congress wanted to make sure surviving spouses weren't shortchanged.\n\nbeneficiary designations for 401(k)s become particularly tricky with divorces and remarriages. the right of the surviving spouse is triggered, regardless of when the assets were amassed or how long the couple has been married. that said, there's a potential exception: plans can include a one-year marriage rule, whereby a surviving spouse must have been married to the plan participant for at least a year before he or she has a right to 401(k) assets. but not all plans have adopted this provision.\n\nif your former spouse gave up any claim to retirement assets in a divorce, make sure your beneficiary designation form is modified to reflect that change. if not, after your death, the plan administrator will hand over the money to the designated beneficiary—which will be your ex.\n\noften, the 401(k) owner will change his or her beneficiary designation upon divorce and name the children as the beneficiaries. if the owner later remarries, part or all of the 401(k) assets (again, the exact percentage is a matter of disagreement) will still go to the new spouse, instead of the children, even if the new spouse is not added as a beneficiary—unless, that is, the new spouse signs a waiver.\n\nkeep in mind that a prenuptial agreement can't take the place of a waiver. instead, the law specifies that the spouse must sign the waiver. this can be tricky, because such a waiver can be signed only after a couple is married, at which point the spouse has already acquired the right to be a beneficiary of the 401(k).\n\nplanning to remarry? if you want someone else to benefit from your 401(k) assets, such as the children from an earlier marriage, it's prudent to roll over your 401(k) to an ira account before you remarry. that should be easy enough if you have a 401(k) at an old employer, but you likely won't have that option with your current employer's plan—unless you're age 59½ or older.\n\nthis column originally appeared on humble dollar. it has been republished with permission.\n\njames mcglynn, cfa, ricp, is chief executive of next quarter century llcin fort worth, texas, a firm focused on helping clients make smarter decisions about long-term-care insurance, social security and other retirement planning issues. he was a mutual-fund manager for 30 years. james is the author of retirement planning tips for baby boomers. his previous articles include the taxman cometh, back when and fatten that policy.
how about this new year's resolution for congress: find a better way to appoint supreme court justices.\n\nthe spectacle of justice brett kavanaugh's confirmation hearings — character assignation largely motivated by his fairly conservative approach to the constitution — illustrates that congress has made the process toxic. and it has lost sight of what the court does, what the congress is supposed to do and why.\n\nmost cases before the court are not great constitutional issues but rather tough disagreements about the interpretations of federal statutes and conflicts among the federal circuits and state courts on a wide range of civil, criminal and corporate issues.\n\nmost are beyond the competency of practicing attorneys, because they tend to specialize in areas like real estate, finance, patents and others.\n\nto deal with the broad range of issues, justices should be selected from among generalists that sit on the appellate courts and outstanding scholars with robust experience. individuals who demonstrate an unusual capacity for variety and the insight to craft durable, though not eternal, decisions.\n\nin recent decades, presidents have shifted remarkably well in that direction — brett kavanaugh and elena kagan offer examples from the conservative and liberal camps.\n\nwhen president dwight eisenhower appointed earl warren as chief justice, the court was genuinely political. he was governor of california with no judicial experience and joined three former senators and two justices who served as attorney general for the presidents who appointed them.\n\nthese days, the justices are outstanding legal scholars with a passion for fairness — but what is fair?\n\nthose ethical and moral judgments should be made by the political branches but since the establishment of the republic, members of congress and presidents have been at war among themselves about states' rights, race and civil rights. all reflecting deep divisions among americans drawn across regional, ethnic and class lines.\n\nthe court settles issues congress fails to resolve and conflicts among federal circuit decisions and state laws addressing these issues that impose unworkable contradictions on individuals and businesses.\n\ngenerally, it does this well but sometimes it fails badly. plessy v. ferguson (1896), upheld racial segregation, and dred scott (1857) limited federal latitude to prohibit slavery and protect the civil rights of free blacks in northern states and territories — ultimately the 13th and 15th amendments undid the latter.\n\nliberals who lean so heavily on stare decisis regarding roe (1973) and planned parenthood v. casey (1992) ought to remember under that doctrine brown v. board of education (1954) should not have happened and schools in the south would still be segregated.\n\ngreat issues like abortion, gay marriage and the latitude of regulatory agencies to implement vague statutes, where congress has abrogated responsibility, are why we fight over who gets on the court — not judicial competence.\n\nit was laughable when sen. mazie hirono said that dr. christine blasey ford's charges must be true effectively because kavanaugh embraces conservative legal views, and sen. kamala harris accepted that a mere accusation of sexual misconduct was enough to disqualify, because both are trained attorneys.\n\nthese days, presidents don't send up unqualified scholars, and supreme court confirmations are political campaigns — so anything goes including character assassination.\n\nthe democrats and especially strident liberals view losing elections as the papacy would church burnings. liberals are holy and conservatives' are evil — the latter's beliefs should be classified among the heresies of the vilest personalities.\n\nconsequently, democrats have behaved as if donald trump's election was illegitimate and his supreme court appointees as fair target for the most false and destructive attacks.\n\nrecognizing the inherently political role of the court and some politicians no longer feel bound in their conduct when their side loses elections, the best we can do is assign each political party an equal number of appointments. the president could alternate between consulting with the democratic and republican members of the judiciary committee much like the possession arrow in college basketball.\n\nwe simply can't expect decent men and women to accept nominations or our republic to survive if the cynical tactics we witnessed during the kavanaugh hearings are to keep occurring. the last time passions were this high, the civil war resulted.
mindfulness, the act of calmly being present in the moment, is popular for controlling anxiety — turns out, it may help you manage your money better, too.\n\nsometimes, to properly manage your finances you might need to slow down, and assess how you view and feel about the money itself. everyone has an emotional connection to money, explains leanne jacobs, author of the new book beautiful money: the 4-week total wealth makeover (published by tarcherperigee), and the fastest way to see your wealth progress might actually be to pause a moment. stress negatively impacts the way you handle your money.\n\nwhile most books offering money advice may focus on strategies like how to pare expenses, when to claim social security, or how to pick a low-cost mutual fund, this one takes an entirely different approach.\n\nmoney is really energy, jacobs said. how we handle money and how we behave around money shows up in all other areas.\n\nalso see:these young nba stars are rising because of meditation and mindfulness\n\njacobs herself went through a major transformation. she writes in her book that she changed her habits when she realized she was spending too much time chasing empty achievements and had focused too much on checking off the items on her to-do lists. she quit her job, her marriage ended, and she found the time do what she wanted, including traveling through europe, instructing yoga and becoming certified as a clinical nutritionist.\n\nthis new office trend lets you lie down at work\n\njacobs spoke to marketwatch about putting more zen into your finances:\n\nmarketwatch: your book talks a lot about gaining clarity with money and being in the moment. money is definitely emotional, but how can you relate it to mindfulness?\n\nleanne jacobs: my money always tells me a story of my awareness and my relationship with myself. when i am rushing and have a really busy day, and i am trying to squeeze a ton of things in, those are the days i neglect my money management. i'm prone to emotionally spending, and i'm not as grateful for the money flowing in.\n\nmarketwatch: i read in your book women should create a beautiful money mantra, which incorporates fear about money — what is it and how can others have their own?\n\njacobs: it is a nice reminder that gets you back on track in the flow of where you want to be instead of keeping you where you are. a mantra like i attract wealth with ease and flow would be for someone who finds you have to burn yourself to make money. another one is today is a beautiful money day. for me it reminds me of the whole philosophy around holistic wealth — it's not just about the money; when i think of the concept of beautiful money, my day is aligned with values.\n\nyou can use an affirmation to help you with your thought pattern. it is important to have it front and center. i had my mantra in my office on my computer screen for three years because every time an opportunity came in, it was a reminder of my new philosophy.\n\ndon't miss: most americans are one surprise medical bill away from financial disaster\n\nmarketwatch: fear seems to play a big part in money. what was your experience with it, and how can it affect your finances?\n\njacobs: i had a fear if i stopped the hustle that i wouldn't have security. i would lose my home, not be able to pay my bills, everything would fall apart. that fear is not rooted in reality but it kept me in a hustle for a long time — it is an illusion.\n\neveryone has fears around money. it is very challenging to let go of that feeling because for many of us we have carried it since we were kids. i asked myself, 'what if i let go and took better care of my health?' and money poured in in a way that it never did when i was hustling.\n\nmarketwatch: what do you mean by the hustle? what did you do and what changed?\n\njacobs: a lot of my time was spent on trivial things that weren't generating income, like spending way more time going back and forth on email or driving to meetings i could have done over the web. that's why i have a time tracker exercise in my book — by tracking your activities, you can recognize, 'wow i spent two hours on facebook.' fb, -1.64%\n\ni took a pause to get more clear on what i wanted. productivity is a trap we can fall into. i had to create space and get clear on what was important for me, so for me it was freedom and more travel, and more soul-filling exercises.\n\nmarketwatch: you mention yoga and breathing practices. are there any other non-financial tasks people can do to be better about their own money management?\n\njacobs:journaling. our thinking has gotten us where we are with our money and our mindset is what needs to shift. some of the tools are visualization, so instead of focusing on your debt and where you are right now, put more energy into thinking of where you want to be.\n\nmarketwatch: many people are constantly rushing — how can they slow down and take charge of their money when there's just so much to do every single day?\n\njacobs: eight weeks out in my calendar i block space where i don't book things. the reason i do that is because the old formula for me was to book things and what was left at the end of the month was zero time for myself, and i was an angry person. have part of your sunday about making time for yourself to plan your week out so it's not hectic, look at the local yoga studio's schedule to find when you'd like to go. you may want to use some of your sunday as well to do meal prep. when we wait for spaces, they're never there, so we have to plan holistically instead of plan hectically.\n\n(this interview was edited for clarity and space.)
dear moneyist,\n\nbefore i married my wife two years ago, she had huge amounts of debt to her name, including large amounts of student loans. after we married, we diligently almost paid everything off, helped by my salary being three times that of my wife.\n\nshe recently asked for a divorce, saying she was taking the house and my retirement. my question is: does the fact we paid off her debts she held before get spread evenly? had i not paid all of her debts our net worth would be near the same with a better outcome for me.\n\nread also:behold, the biggest financial secret to a happy marriage\n\nwe've only been married a few years, and frankly i can't help feeling taken advantage of. the only advice i can find discusses whose responsibility the student loans would be, but now it just seems that she got me to pay all of her debts, and got some new stuff, while i threw away years of my life.\n\nplease tell me there's hope.\n\nsqueezed in fort worth\n\ndear squeezed,\n\ni'm sorry you feel squeezed or played. but i can't argue with that. after two years, that's a tough break, especially given all the help you gave your wife with her student debt. that's a particularly unusual kind of debt, in that it's virtually impossible to discharge. so if your wife was planning to wipe out some debts with your help before she filed for divorce two years after your marriage, that was the one to wipe out first.\n\nthe good news: texas is a community property state so, where you have not co-mingled your assets, you take out of the marriage what you brought into it. unfortunately, that doesn't include the money you gave your wife to pay off her loans. but if you had a home before you married, for instance, you will walk away with that. document all your financial transactions with your wife. the court has discretion to divide community property in a way it deems fair and reasonable.\n\ndon't miss:my stepmother stole money owed to me — how do i find my late father's will?\n\ntypically, the court will divide retirement plans equally between the two soon-to-be former spouses. given the short length of your marriage and the help you gave your wife paying off her student loans, you certainly have a good chance of fighting this particular rule. you may not be entirely successful, but a good divorce attorney will advise you on how to approach this delicate matter. your wife is divorcing you, after all, and where there is flexibility in the law, there is opportunity.\n\ni posted your question in the moneyist facebook group and the members also cited the short period of marriage, the importance of choosing a good divorce lawyer, the perils of mediation (given that you have a relatively strong hand walking into divorce court) and a forensic accountant to examine your retirement accounts both before and during your marriage. all good advice.\n\nthe best thing you have going for you right now is your honest intentions going into this marriage and your (good) behavior throughout. having examined all the details, the judge may not be able to say the same thing about your wife.\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\nrecommended:after my father died, my brother has been pressuring me to lend him money\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
here's a gift of financial wisdom for all those new moms.\n\nlife insurance company massmutual asked mothers: what is the biggest financial mistake you made when becoming a first-time mom?\n\nthe no. 1 mistake: overspending on non-necessities like clothes, toys and gadgets (40%). approximately 16% of mothers said they continued to spend on non-necessities like restaurants, self-care and new clothes like they did before they had a child, and 15% said they should have saved more for a college fund, while 4% said paying for a full-time nanny and sending their child to day-care was a financial mistake. one quarter of moms said they didn't make any financial mistakes.\n\n overspending on non-necessities like clothes, toys and gadgets was the biggest financial mistake made by mothers with their first child. \n\nof those who did start saving in a college fund like a 529 plan, 56% of the mothers surveyed said they're investing between $50 and $250 each month. if a parent of a five-year-old child has no college savings, his or her parents will need to save $641 per month to cover the estimated cost of $174,000 to attend a public 4-year in-state college starting in 2032, according to massmutual's college savings calculator. (over 1,000 mothers were polled.)\n\nand surprise costs? some 29% of moms say disposable baby items were the most unexpected cost when they first had a child, while others were surprised by the cost of child care (16%) and medical costs (16%). the majority of moms (87%) changed their financial habits when they found out they were pregnant, including cutting back spending on non-necessities (63%) and increasing savings (39%). but 29% of respondents say they now have more debt.\n\ndon't miss:when wives earn more than their husbands, their marriage is less likely to last\n\nmothers are less open to talking about family finances than fathers, according to a separate massmutual survey of 10,000 u.s. adults released last year. some 69% of mothers said they talk about finances at least once a month with their spouse or partner compared to 78.5% of fathers. that may reflect a generational divide where men, particularly older men, are more likely to view themselves as the breadwinners, the researchers speculated.\n\nfewer mothers than fathers had emergency funds and paid down credit-card or student-loan debt. financial planners say couples should have an open and candid conversation about budgets and money goals before getting married and, especially, before having a child. it's also wise to discuss expectations about their lifestyle post-marriage. (for instance, the majority of mothers in the latest massmutual survey said extra-curricular activities for their kids are worth the cost.)\n\nthose results are backed up by data released last year by ubs wealth management usa ubs, +0.71% that survey of 1,474 people over the age of 18 found that 56% of married women leave investment and financial decisions to their husbands and 85% said they believed that their husbands know more about financial matters and investment topics. (more than half of divorcees and widows discover financial surprises like outdated wills and debts, ubs said.)\n\ndon't miss:my new wife wanted to live with me for free, even though she had $800,000 in the bank—so i asked her to move out
dear moneyologist,\n\ni have been married since 2012. our relationship was never really great from the beginning (we met in 2005) and marriage did not improve it. as soon as he moved into my house in 2011 he began treating me like a roommate with benefits — he could not show me any love or affection and didn't seem interested in being a life partner. i opted for counseling in 2015 and we attended that for five months, with no improvement in our relationship. we ended up taking separate vacations at the end of 2015.\n\nby the end of last year the periodic sex had stopped completely and it never resumed. now he has his own room. so we are nothing but roommates at this point and i have no life with him whatsoever — we just live in the same house (which i bought for myself in 2003). we are both 58. i am still an attractive woman and don't want to waste any more years on a man who cannot love me, so i finally decided to file for divorce, which he was agreeable to — at first.\n\nbut some financial complications have developed, putting a wrench in my future.\n\nhe and i never opened joint accounts or merged any finances at all, mostly because he literally has nothing accumulated for all the years he has worked, and i knew that — no retirement, no savings, no property. so from day one in my house he paid his bills (including child support) and i paid mine, and he wrote me a check for $500 a month, sort of like rent from a roommate. i kept the house in good repair and all the utilities paid.\n\n i am still an attractive woman and don't want to waste any more years on a man who cannot love me, so i finally decided to file for divorce, which he was agreeable to — at first. \n\nwe were each earning about the same money until i took a really good job at the end of 2013, which made me the higher earner by about $30,000 a year. however, in 2015 i had to take on responsibility for my older, disabled brother's living expenses every month.\n\nread:5 apps for spying on your spouse\n\nthis past july my husband informed me that he was now so deeply in debt that he could no longer write me the $500 check every month at all. so i took him to credit counseling, and his financial picture was so bad that a bankruptcy filing looked necessary. so i took him to a bankruptcy attorney, too.\n\nsince our marriage was already on life support, and i did not want to be dragged into any sort of debt payment plan on his behalf, i went ahead and had a lawyer draft a standard, no-fault divorce petition so i could move on with my life and he could get a chapter 7 filing and a clean slate. in this divorce petition is a reasonable deadline for my husband to move out of my house — it would give him several months to find somewhere else to live if he started looking now.\n\nunfortunately, my husband is not looking to relocate. he is also now saying that he doesn't want to file for bankruptcy, and that his finances will turn around in 18 months or so. he seems to be expecting me to carry him financially for at least that long. he has a problem with being expected to relocate just because our marriage is ending, but when i told him he would have to sign a lease and pay rent after the final divorce if he wanted to stay here, he would not agree to that either. so he appears to be expecting me to let him live in my house at my expense until he is good and ready to move, with no timeline as to when that might actually occur.\n\nso now i am really stuck, because i am the only one with anything to lose. if i let him push me into filing a traditional divorce complaint just to get him out of my house, i am quite sure he will get an attorney of his own and will come back with demands for alimony and part of the equity in my house, and part of my retirement account (which i opened at the new job in 2013).\n\ni have three questions: do i need to accept that he has the upper hand and that i will have to keep living my sterile, loveless existence until i am ready for retirement or longer? do i have to accept that if i want a divorce i will also have to agree to let him live here at my expense indefinitely? should i try filing for legal separation instead and then see if he will sign some sort of agreement to pay some meager amount of rent to live in my house?\n\nkaren in atlanta\n\ndear karen,\n\nno. no. no. you don't have to do any of those things.\n\ngeorgia is an equitable distribution state, so you and your husband will only divide marital property acquired during your marriage. the divorce court will not transfer the title of your home to your husband if it's in your name. but you need to show your lawyer a full inventory of your assets and separate bank accounts. a judge may decide that any additional equity is deemed marital property, as the mortgage was paid off during your marriage.\n\nyou will also have to discuss the marital debt your husband accrued during your marriage, and it may be worth both your while if he pursued personal bankruptcy before your divorce. however, if you can show that your husband racked up these debts by himself, while you were financially responsible, it's also likely that the judge would assign the debt to your husband. it could go either way and an attorney will best advise based on your circumstances.\n\ndon't miss:the best (and worst) time to get divorced\n\nyou don't want to be a prisoner of your husband's debt or financial dependence. it may take a lifetime decades for him to finally stand on his own two feet. here's the good news (sit down and pop yourself a bottle of sparkling wine): you only got married in 2012, so the sooner you get out of this marriage, the fewer financial obligations you will have to this man. if you wait another four years for him to drag his feet, the likelihood of a judge awarding him more money will increase.\n\nbut don't take it from me. take it from randy kessler, an atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, divorce: protect yourself, your kids, and your future. as a divorce lawyer for nearly 30 years, i have come to believe that divorce is not about money, it is about happiness. will you go to bed happier and wake up happier if you divorce him? if so, you may have your answer. i just do not think the choice to divorce can or should be made solely based on finances.\n\nyou can't afford to do nothing — for your future finances or romances.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

marketwatch is revisiting some favorite moneyologist dilemmas for mother's day on may 14.\n\ndear moneyologist,\n\nmy family has been fragmented for at least the last three generations, creating an elaborate blend of step-everything and relationships that were seldom defined by blood. my deceased grandfather — whom i loved dearly — is not my relative by blood, nor is the so-called father whose name i carry. suffice it to say our family traditions are fragmented or non-existent.\n\nwhen my mother divorced and remarried, she and my step-father changed my name and my younger brother's to match his, creating this collection of five kids where the oldest two had one last name and the younger three had another (my parents had the youngest son together). over the years, the older two and one of my younger brothers were excluded from our family by my parents — they were literally thrown away.\n\ni dropped out of high school and joined the army at 17, where i remained for the next 25 years. my wife and i have been married 38 years and have done pretty well for ourselves and four kids, residing in a home larger than any in the history of our extended families. i genuinely wanted to help bring things together among my fragmented family and came up with the idea several years ago to invite everyone to our house for christmas — my parents, my younger (step) brother, his third wife, their children, and another lovely girl from his first marriage.\n\ni envisioned board games, talking in the kitchen, and touch football in the yard. instead we got isolation, indifference to our home, and an absolute reluctance to follow any team-building suggestions i promoted. my wife watched me try to play the encouraging, happy host to our indifferent guests and became visibly livid. everyone left a day early, and the period of cold shoulders began — no birthday cards, no calls. i continued to telephone after some six months and, over time, a regular pattern of communication resumed. i thought we had navigated the storm.\n\ndon't miss:my roommate is the most entitled millennial in america\n\nthree years pass, and i was at my step-father's bedside as he slipped away. it was traumatic, but the next day it took another turn: my mother informed me that, in their will some two years prior, they had decided to leave my brother the house and that he and i could split whatever other inheritance was left over. she added, that's ok, right? your wife said she would never live here, she insisted. my youngest (step) brother, their natural son would inherit their estate for his family.\n\nafter 48 years pretending i was a son as well the truth was clear: i was not a son, and neither i, my wife, nor my children would enjoy a peaceful legacy or inheritance with this family.\n\nlisten:frances stroh — memoir of a brewery heiress (and subscribe to the money, markets and more podcast on itunes)\n\ni know from reading your column that there is nothing i can do about people's decisions with their money and, honestly, could not accept a dime if it were offered. but the notion that they took a little boy of 12 and tattooed some stranger's name on his forehead — watching him pass that name on to his children (even naming his firstborn after the stepfather) — and later tossing him out with his other siblings makes me sad and furious.\n\non the flip side of all this drama, i'm not walking away empty-handed. i now have an oddly humorous story about how i once crafted a family reunion in hopes of establishing a christmas tradition, and got disinherited for my trouble and a powerful illustration for my kids on what not to do. i now insist that they will each receive their legacy regardless of what choices they make in this life.\n\nand it makes me question: can i contest the will and possibly sue the estate for the legal fees associated with changing my name and the names of my children and grandchildren back to my original name — a dramatic reset of sorts? do you think this is possible? i suppose this is tremendously difficult, but i'm just about angry enough to do it. writing this alone was helpful, though i apologize for the length.\n\nforrest\n\ndear forrest,\n\ni'm sorry to hear that you tried and failed to bring your family together. it sounds like your parents have had tumultuous relationships with their children and, even though you have organized christmas and remembered people's birthdays and been present for your parents, you have not been able to break that pattern. your mother based her decision on something your wife said or something your mother thinks she said. she may be a very sensitive person, or perhaps someone who finds trouble where there is none. you could always say, you misunderstood, or, that's not what happened. but, ultimately, you must abide by her decision.\n\n you have built your own family without continuing these deep divisions. changing your name won't change who you are. but taking a frivolous court case would. \n\nlife is unfair. as i said to a reader who was unhappy with the size of his inheritance ($10,000, to be exact), try not to define your entire relationship with your parents by the amount that is left to you in their will. as hard as it is to hear, this may not be about you. it may be that your parents have a limited capacity to give and receive love, and they may think that your youngest brother needs a house most of all. i don't know the details of your respective financial situations, but you say you live comfortably. the heavy lifting has already been done: you have built your own family without continuing these deep divisions.\n\ndon't miss: will my mother's timeshare nightmare be passed to me?\n\nthe legal system is harsh when it comes to inheritance. if you weren't formally adopted by your stepfather, you likely have no standing to contest any aspect of your stepfather's will or its terms, says blake harris, an attorney at mile high estate planning in denver. but you would still have little recourse, even if he did adopt you. why? parents can leave whatever they want to who they want. what's more, if you were not mentioned in the will, you were technically not disinherited, harris says. to successfully contest a will, it must be based on a claim that the will failed to fulfill legal requirements for its proper execution or that your stepfather lacked testamentary capacity, he adds.\n\nyou inherited your last name from your stepfather and, because you will not inherit the family home, you want to retaliate by changing your family's last name. suing them in court would be costly and a fruitless task, given that your mother used a court order to give you your stepfather's last name. (this is often done by parents in a blended family, especially when the child's biological father is no longer around, so it's not that unusual and you would have little grounds for being treated unfairly.) it would cost thousands of dollars to take this case and only a few hundred dollars to change your name, says mathew tully, founding partner of tully rinckey law firm in new york.\n\nwe are a sum of our actions and this tit-for-tat goes against everything you stand for: the importance of family. changing your name won't change who you are. but taking a frivolous court case would.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.\n\n(this story was republished.)
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nmany new couples inquire about a potential mate's age or how many previous partners they've had. others are more interested in another number.\n\napproximately 42% of adults say knowing someone's credit score would affect their willingness to date that person, according to a recent survey of 1,000 adults by personal finance website bankrate.com. that's up from nearly 40% last year. women were nearly three times as likely to consider credit score a major influence on a potential partner compared to men (20% versus 7%). younger daters are not as concerned about these three digits: 45% of older millennials, defined here as those aged 27 to 36, said they care about these three digits.\n\n credit scores reveal an individual's relationship skill and level of commitment, and trustworthiness. \n\nthis can be useful for people using dating sites like tinder, bumble, okcupid iac, -2.64% and match.com. a high credit score can help predict whether someone is trustworthy. similar credit scores are highly predictive of whether couples stay together, according to another 2015 paper by researchers at ucla, the brookings institution and federal reserve board, washington, d.c. initial credit scores and match quality predict subsequent credit usage and financial distress, which in turn are correlated with relationship dissolution, they wrote. credit scores reveal an individual's relationship skill and level of commitment.\n\nalso see:women don't see men who drive flashy cars as husband material\n\nprevious studies have documented the various traits by which individuals sort themselves into committed relationships, including race, educational attainment, and earning capacity, parental wealth, social caste and physical appearance, they wrote. credit scores are arguably the most prominent individual-level characteristic lenders use to underwrite credit. these three digits, therefore, help give single people a bird's eye view into a person's ability to meet future financial (and familial) obligations.\n\nby showing an interest in these three digits, people are probably being smart rather than shallow, says jeffrey hall, associate professor of communications at the university of kansas. finances, education, and job prospects all factor into the value of a potential mate, he says. assuming that people can actually interpret a credit score meaningfully, it makes sense they would think a credit score is useful in evaluating mate value.\n\n low credit scores can deny one access to a mortgage and increase the costs of loans by thousands of dollars. \n\nwhat people do and say in the early days of dating might have an impact later on. people are combining their finances when they marry, after all, and that can impact their future happiness. in fact, the higher your credit score, the less likely you'll separate from your partner — and a lower score often means you'll be less lucky in love. more than half of americans (58%) said they wouldn't marry someone with significant debt, according to a study released in march 2017 of more than 2,300 adults from legal industry site avvo.\n\nwhile knowing someone's credit score doesn't necessarily reveal whether that person has a medical or student debt or even their annual income, it does indicate whether they are eligible for a loan. a bank will look at each person's middle scores— from the three major credit bureaus, experian, equifax, and transunion — and then take a couple's average score to determine their overall credit worthiness. and a low credit score doesn't necessarily mean that you are irresponsible with money or even have no money. credit scoring models look at the amount a consumer owes versus the total amount of credit available, known as the credit utilization ratio.\n\nalso see: americans will talk about sex and infidelity before they talk about this…\n\nlow credit scores can deny one access to a mortgage or increase the costs of credit by thousands of dollars, says stephen brobeck, executive director of the consumer federation of america, a consumer advocacy group. credit scores are likely to increase the finance charges on a $20,000, 60-month car loan by more than $5,000.\n\nfor those who are interested in talking about this during a candle-lit dinner, they should know what it means. a score between 661 and 780 is considered good credit and between 781 and 850 is regarded as excellent credit, according to financial website credit.com. the site rates fair credit as between 601 and 660, poor credit between 501 and 600 and bad credit as anything below 500.\n\n previous research suggests women are more concerned about their potential partner's earning power than men. \n\nbut different lenders may have different criteria when it comes to loaning money, and may approve borrowers with a credit score of below 700. a high score effectively means that their prospective date has been paying their bills off on time, or only uses a small percentage of their available credit on credit cards.\n\ndon't miss: the larger the rock, the rockier the marriage\n\nstill, those millennials in bankrate's study might be too quick to judge. that age group also has the lowest credit scores of any generation of americans, a separate report released by credit bureau experian concluded. the report, based on anonymous data from experian's consumer credit database, found that millennials have an average credit score of 625 on an average debt of $52,120.\n\nby comparison, generation x (aged 35 to 49) have a credit score of 650 on average debt of $125,000, while both baby boomers and the greatest generation (with a combined age of between 50 and 87) have credit scores of 709 on average debt of $87,438. credit scores, experts say, are built on experience, and millennials have plenty of time to improve their digits.\n\nprevious research also supports the proposition that women are more concerned about their potential partner's earning power than men. too many women are still overly-focused on their romantic partner's holdings. in their minds, money equals power, and women want powerful men, says fran walfish, a beverly hills, calif.-based psychotherapist. money comes and goes, and you are always faced with each other.\n\nwalfish says the rich, famous and privileged flock into her office with the same ailments and issues as regular people, namely communication, sexual issues, parenting, and, most importantly, conflict resolution skills. financial responsibility runs through most of these issues, and can be a test for how willing people are to work together as a team to build a future. the goal for every person is to evolve as a complete, whole and self-reliant individual, she says.\n\n(this story was updated on feb. 14, 2019.)
as we enter the new year it's a good time to reflect on major life changes that may have occurred for you and your family during the past year.\n\nchanges like; a marriage, birth of a child, death of a family member, a change in health status, divorce, change of jobs, caring for a special needs child, entering retirement, charitable giving decisions, selling of a primary residence or investment property. any one of these events could trigger the need to revise your estate plan by making adjustments to your will or creating an amendment to your trust or reassigning beneficiary(s); both primary and contingent.
it is common these days to suggest that millennials have dramatically different preferences than other generations.\n\nwhether it is the food they buy or the investments they make, the common consensus is that millennials are fundamentally disrupting a variety of industries due to their divergent preferences. however, such claims have not been explored rigorously and limited data have been used to support those hypotheses.\n\nrecently, here at the sloan school at mit, my colleague elizabeth murphy and i set out to study the car preferences of those between ages 18 and 37 in a rigorous way, and found that millennials may not be expressing a lack of preference or enthusiasm for vehicles, per se. instead, their car choices may be dominated more by situational forces — such as the economic problems this generation encountered due to the great recession or the likelihood that they live in a city as opposed to a suburb.\n\nunderstanding the true preferences of the millennial generation can provide insight into the future landscape of mobility, and thus provide both industry and policy makers with more information about what business practices and policies to implement. this is particularly true when it comes to our policies related to global warming.\n\nread:behavioral finance experts say these things can make you richer in old age\n\ncar ownership\n\nthe low vehicle ownership statistics that have been attributed to millennials — the ones we've been quietly hoping will solve climate change — are likely just an artifact of the economic conditions and general life cycles they've faced. unfortunately, they do not represent some fundamental difference in their demand for cars and this fact will reverberate long and hard in our battle against climate change. let's look at the research and let me explain.\n\nour study focused on two main facets of personal mobility: vehicle ownership, measured by how many vehicles a given household owns, and vehicle usage, measured by annual vehicle miles traveled (vmt). each of those provides different insights; vehicle ownership gives a better understanding of the market for personal vehicles, while vehicle miles traveled provides insight on vehicle fleet usage as well as environmental footprints.\n\nwe found that although a simple comparison of average ownership and use would suggest a difference. but that is comparing apples to oranges, because those simple comparisons do not account for differences in age, income and other factors that may drive the demand for mobility.\n\ntwo analyses\n\nour paper contains two sets of analyses. first, using data from various national household transportation surveys (nhts), we estimate vehicle ownership rates and annual miles traveled controlling for confounding variables such as income, household size, urbanity and education. we find there is no evidence of a difference in vehicle ownership. in contrast to conventional wisdom, millennials actually drive more miles per year. the most recent nhts survey took place in 2017, implying the oldest millennial in the data was 37 years old.\n\nof course, a skeptic would respond to this first set of analyses believing them to be wrong because some of those confounding factors are actually life choices, and millennials are choosing to alter those life choices. to account for this, we also estimate to what degree millennials are altering those life choices, and here's the important part: by how much those alterations affect vehicle ownership.\n\ndon't miss:here are all the things millennials have been accused of killing — from dinner dates to golf\n\nto do this, we use census data and estimate how millennials are changing their marriage rates, urbanity, number of children and income levels. we then estimate how those changes affect vehicle ownership. while we find that millennials are altering life choices that affect vehicle ownership, the net effect of those endogenous choices is to reduce vehicle ownership by less than 1%. we can statistically rule out effects larger than 2%.\n\nmany millennials report they prioritize environmentally friendly products, but our study shows that the so-called green generation does not exhibit significantly different preferences when it comes to transport. this does not inherently mean millennials do not consider the environment in their car-buying decisions, but for many millennials having a vehicle may not be a choice.\n\nso, what's the upshot? while there are plenty of interesting ramifications to this for the auto industry, perhaps the most important take-away is for policy makers. let's be clear: the u.s. cannot rely on millennials' preferences alone to reduce carbon emissions. they operate under many of the same constraints as previous generations, and they still have strong preferences for personal vehicles.\n\nchristopher knittel is the george p. shultz professor of applied economics at the mit sloan school of management.
passionate about music from an early age, ellis marsalis devoted much of his life to what many claim is the most american of art forms: jazz. over the second half of the 20th century, few did more to nurture and elevate the genre than marsalis, the patriarch of one of america's most decorated musical families, one that has often been referred to as america's royal family of jazz.\n\na gifted pianist and composer, marsalis devoted much of his life to education and in the process influenced countless students and disciples, including four of his sons, the musicians branford, wynton, delfeayo, and jason.\n\n he poured everything he had into making us the best of what we could be,  — branford marsalis, son of ellis marsalis\n\none only needs to read through the outpouring of tributes to marsalis, who died on april 1 at the age of 85 in his hometown of new orleans, to understand the incredible influence he had over the jazz world.\n\nmy dad was a giant of a musician and teacher, but an even greater father. he poured everything he had into making us the best of what we could be, said branford marsalis in a statement announcing his father's death as a result of complications from covid-19. prior to his death, marsalis had been hospitalized with pneumonia and other symptoms.\n\nellis marsalis was a legend, said new orleans mayor latoya cantrell. he was the prototype of what we mean when we talk about new orleans jazz. he was a teacher, a father, and an icon—and words aren't sufficient to describe the art, the joy, and the wonder he showed the world. this loss cuts us deeply.\n\nellis louis marsalis jr. was born in new orleans on nov. 14, 1934. his father, ellis marsalis sr., owned and operated the marsalis motel on the banks of the mississippi river. the motel, which catered to african-americans during the jim crow era, welcomed the likes of cab calloway, etta james, and ray charles, as well as civil rights leaders including the rev. dr. martin luther king jr., rep. adam clayton powell jr., and thurgood marshall. his mother, florence (robertson) marsalis, was a homemaker.\n\nmarsalis started out focusing on the saxophone before transitioning to the piano in high school. as both his parents discouraged him from pursuing a straightforward career in music, he enrolled in new orleans's dillard university, earning a degree in music education in 1955. after serving as the band director at xavier university preparatory high school, he enlisted in the marine corps in the late 1950s and became a member of the corps four, a jazz quartet that performed on television and radio to aid in recruitment.\n\nin 1956, marsalis met his future wife, dolores ferdinand, at the city's lincoln beach amusement park, where the two were attending a dinah washington concert. in 1959, they married, and would end up celebrating 58 years of marriage before her death in 2017.\n\nmarsalis spent the 1960s raising children with his wife while working at his father's motel. at night, he would slip out to play with some of the city's most popular jazz acts, including the house band at the french quarter's notorious playboy club, plus groups led by revered musicians such as the trumpeter al hirt and drummer bob french.\n\nthroughout that era, marsalis recorded with both modern and progressive jazz musicians, including the drummer ed blackwell and the horn-playing brothers cannonball and nat adderley.\n\nin 1974, marsalis enrolled in a master's degree program at loyola university on the gi bill, and was recruited to teach music, with an emphasis on jazz, at the new orleans center for creative arts (nocca), a new magnet school where he went on to shape teen prodigies including terence blanchard and harry connick, jr., as well as his own children.\n\nalso see: cameroonian musician manu dibango was an international symbol of african music\n\namong the countless lessons ellis taught me, the most important was the process of discovery. he already knew everything i was trying to learn, but he always made me figure things out for myself, said connick, jr., in a facebook post. he was a grand master educator, an inimitable pianist, a caring mentor, and a dear friend. i wouldn't be who i am without him.\n\nafter receiving his master's degree in music education in 1986, marsalis continued to keep one foot rooted in the academic world, first at virginia commonwealth university, where he created a jazz curriculum for the school of the arts, and then the university of new orleans, where he served for 12 years as the founding director of its jazz studies department before retiring in 2001. a steadfast champion of the genre, he took every opportunity to remind his students of jazz's ability to articulate the underlying values of american culture.\n\nfrom the early stages of his career, marsalis stood out by devoting himself to modern jazz rather than the traditional jazz and r&b that the majority of his peers focused on. throughout his life, he never strayed far from music education, and went on to become among the country's foremost advocates for the inclusion of jazz education in formal academic settings. many students of jazz point to marsalis as one of the foremost guardians of the genre, having done more than most to establish its place in the musical landscape. his influence was ever-present on the jazz album charts of the 1980s and 1990s, which were often populated by his former students as well as his progeny.\n\nas two of those sons, wynton and branford rose to international prominence, marsalis began to receive more attention for his recordings, and he released a series of albums for blue note and columbia. in 2011, the national endowment for the arts named marsalis and his musician sons jazz masters, the highest honor for an american jazz musician.\n\nmarsalis, who released more than 15 albums of his own and was featured in numerous collaborations with his sons, remained active into his final years, having played a weekly gig for three decades at one of new orleans's top jazz clubs, snug harbor, before stepping away in january.\n\nmarsalis was proud of his sons' accomplishments. wynton, a trumpeter, is artistic director of jazz at new york's lincoln center; branford, a grammy-winning saxophonist, was the bandleader of the tonight show with jay leno; delfeayo, a trombonist, is a prominent recording producer; and jason, a percussionist, has earned acclaim with his own band and as an accompanist. all are accomplished performers and bandleaders who have toured the world.\n\nread more stories of the lives lost to covid-19\n\nhis legacy will live on in myriad ways, most notably via the ellis marsalis center for music, a 17,000-square-foot facility that serves as a performance, education, and community venue in new orleans' ninth ward. a key part of the musicians' village that was conceived by branford marsalis and harry connick, jr., in the aftermath of hurricane katrina, the marsalis center, which opened in 2011, extends opportunities for underserved children, students, and musicians.\n\nwhat can one possibly say about loss in a time when there are many people losing folks that mean so much to them? said wynton marsalis in a statement posted on facebook. my daddy was a humble man with a lyrical sound that

dear moneyist,\n\ni read the letter to your column from the wife whose husband refused to hand over her $1,200 stimulus check. if he is the only one who's working and has to pay all the bills in the house, why should he give her half of the stimulus money? he's the one who needs help — not her!\n\ni can't believe the sick selfishness of you people where men are concerned.\n\ni'm in the same situation. of course, i'm a generous man. she'll get a couple of hundred bucks to go shopping — and that's it. as i pay 100% of everything in the household, i will never give my wife $1,200 to blow her stimulus check in the store, while i'm struggling to make ends meet.\n\nwhy am i wrong to keep most of the money?\n\nsick & tired\n\ndear sick & tired,\n\nbecause it doesn't have your name on it, even if it's deposited into a joint bank account. because it's a tax credit based on your 2020 tax returns. because if you file a joint tax return, the $2,400 check should be split. because if your wife files her own $1,200 tax return, it belongs to her.\n\nbecause controlling how much money you give to your wife from her stimulus infantilizes her. because she's not a child, she's an adult and your wife. because you vowed to love and honor each other. because dishing out a few hundred dollars from her check is demeaning and patronizing.\n\ni received my ex-husband's $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. should i give him the money or return it to the irs?\n\nbecause your decision to withhold her stimulus check says more about you than it does about her. because maintaining such control over the purse strings can't make either of you happy. because sitting down together and coming up with a family budget might lead to a healthier and happier life.\n\nbecause it's always better to treat others as you would like to be treated. because if it's hysterical it's historical. because a marriage should be a partnership of equals, not an opportunity to live out some childhood grievances by controlling others. because this is an opportunity to look at yourself.\n\ndispatches from a pandemic: letter from new york: 'new yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags'\n\nbecause love is not a four-letter word — love is an action. because love is not transactional. because you don't show your wife respect by making these decisions for her. because many women choose to be homemakers and raise children, and put family before career, and it's a full-time job.\n\nbecause we should always endeavor to imagine ourselves at 80 or 90 or beyond, and think, 'what would have been the most honorable thing to do?' and do that. because it's never too late to use a public-health emergency to reevaluate our relationship with the world, ourselves and each other.\n\n'we will not have a vaccine by next winter.' like the 1918 spanish flu, cdc says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. so what happens now?\n\nbecause whether you like it or not she has made sacrifices too. because your wife, like everyone else, probably has her struggles too. because her struggles may also be related to choices she made, including her choice to marry you over, say, the other guy who would have worshipped her.\n\nbecause she may wonder, in the quiet of night, what happened to the man she married. because you may wonder what happened to the woman you married. because it's mature to take 50/50 responsibility for your life, your relationship, and your finances, even if there's one earner.\n\n'i owe child support from my first marriage and did not receive a stimulus check. does trump not realize i have another family to take care of?'\n\nbecause we often believe this, that or the other is somebody's else's fault. because we are all responsible for our own choices, including you. because what would your life be like without your wife? because this need to keep it likely has nothing to do with her, and everything to do with you.\n\nbecause this is an opportunity for you both to learn about give and take, and work together as a team rather than as two people living under the same roof. because she won't forget how it feels to have her check withheld. because, even if it goes against your instincts, it's the honorable thing to do.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.

if you're remarried or living with a significant other at midlife, managing your money together might look different than when you were younger.\n\nwhen you're married for the first time and starting out in adult life, the two of you typically grow, and develop, money habits, building wealth through the years. this go-round, however, you're more likely to be two well-established financial beings merging your moola.\n\nhow can you best accomplish your goals and avoid both financial infidelity and fights over money? here are five mistakes to avoid:\n\nmistake no. 1: not sharing your money history with each other\n\nif we look at midlife individuals, they typically have a long history with their own finances at this point, says jamie hopkins, director of retirement research at carson group, a financial services firm based in omaha, neb.\n\nso, you each need to know what the other's financial experience has been. that is important because if you're moving forward with a new relationship, you have to understand how you operated previously. those experiences will color your future experiences, says hopkins.\n\nhave a casual conversation where you both share your financial backstory. you might say things like: this is how i've been saving —or not saving. it's prudent, too, to discuss how your family handled money when you were a child.\n\nafter this conversation, talk about your financial expectations. explain whether you like or dislike managing the day-to-day bills, investing and insurance. discuss how you view working with financial advisers and handling estate planning matters.\n\nthen, divvy up the financial chores accordingly or tackle them together, if that makes sense.\n\nmistake no. 2: keeping financial secrets\n\nin a february 2020 creditcards.com survey of 2,501 adults in relationships, 44% of respondents said they are hiding a checking, savings or credit card account from their partner; have secret debt or are spending more than their partner would think is ok. broken down by generations, 37% of boomers, 45% of gen xers and 57% of millennials have deceived their partners financially, the survey found.\n\nyou might like: the latest from the love & money column on marketwatch\n\nonce exposed, financial infidelity, says hopkins, is fodder for fighting and eventual relationship ruin. it can be harmful to relationships when you find someone had debt they never told you about, he says.\n\nmake a no-secrets financial pact and stick to it. this doesn't mean you need to have access to the other's person's accounts. only that you know what accounts and debts he or she has, and a general understanding of where you both are moneywise.\n\na 2015 td bank love & money study polled 1,339 americans and found that couples who talk about money openly and regularly are happier together.\n\nmistake no. 3: skipping a joint emergency fund\n\ncreating a shared emergency fund for household and joint crises is beneficial and extremely important. when bringing two families together, start this process immediately, says david hryck, a new york city-based personal finance expert and partner at reed smith, an international law firm.\n\nhryck recommends setting up automatic distributions from each partner's paycheck to help build an emergency fund. it's an easy way to protect your future.\n\na working paper by three university professors (at ucla, notre dame and university college london) found that long-term committed couples who pooled their money into joint bank accounts were happier in their relationships than those who didn't.\n\nmistake no. 4: not drawing up a pre-nup or cohabitation agreement\n\nwhen you marry in midlife, you likely bring more assets into the marriage than when you wed in your 20s or 30s. so, if you're in a new, midlife marriage, you and your love will want to protect what you own.\n\ncome prepared by having a clearly stated agreement that identifies what your assets are, what your liabilities are and what terms are agreed upon regarding these assets and liabilities, says dannell stuart, cfp, the santa barbara, calif. director of business development at mission wealth, a financial management firm.\n\nrelated: flip the prenup into a financial planning tool\n\nhaving a verbal agreement is not enough.\n\nwork with a lawyer to create a document that respectfully identifies both partners' financial condition and how future marital assets will be treated. if you're not married, you can enter into a contract that hammers out who owns what percent of the home in the event of a split or death.\n\nmistake no. 5: neglecting joint financial goals\n\njust because each of you has personal savings, retirement and financial goals, doesn't mean you should neglect your mutual objectives.\n\nestablishing financial goals together should be a priority, says hryck. you and your new partner should develop a plan regarding retirement living, vacation expenses, estate planning and other large shared goals.\n\ndon't miss: this couple never talks about money — and they never fight about it either\n\ntake the time to review life insurance, investments and estate planning together. hopkins says that once you're in a new relationship, the two of you may want a trust (a fiduciary arrangement that lets a trustee hold assets on behalf of beneficiaries); a will to catch things that fall outside the trust, like personal items and jewelry, and updated beneficiary designations.\n\navoid these five mistakes and you'll likely help yourselves get on the road to financial bliss.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy only daughter was asked by her father to co-sign a mortgage of $300,000 for 30 years on his home so he has enough to live on. the house is worth over $2 million, but it's in a state of disrepair. it still carries a $66,000 mortgage. her father remarried a few years back and has other debts of unknown amounts.\n\nhe is 68 years old and has received social security and has health issues. he told my daughter that he has a living trust set up to leave the house to her. this is too big a loan amount for anyone to co-sign even though my daughter is making a six-figure income. she's not married yet and would like to buy her own home soon.\n\ndon't miss: my sister took care of our mother for 10 years — shouldn't she be entitled to her house?\n\nhow much responsibility does a child have to a parent who has spending problem? regardless of when the living trust was created, how can my daughter be sure that the living trust won't get modified during his second marriage? my daughter's stepmom is relying on him.\n\na reverse mortgage is one option that came to mind, but my daughter probably won't get the house in the end as california is a community property state. i have a feeling her father may come back to his daughter with other urgent medical or debt requirements later on. what advice can you provide to situation like this?\n\na concerned mother\n\ndear concerned,\n\nlet's start with the obvious: $300,000 is a big mortgage to co-sign on, even on a six-figure salary, and especially at the request of a 68-year-old man. throw in a new wife and the emotional ties of this father-daughter relationship, the tricky family history that can force good people to do bad things and smart people to do dumb things, some good old-fashioned guilt about never being able to do enough and, perhaps, other debts incurred by your daughter's father, you've got a recipe for disaster.\n\ni would like to play devil's advocate first. is this offer contingent on her inheriting this home when her father dies? if so, it might (just might...) be worth considering.\n\nno doubt about it: it's a big ask. but family will always make those big asks. sometimes it's too much. and sometimes, it's not. there's also a big potential asset here too. your daughter should not enter into such an arrangement lightly, but nor — i would gently suggest — should she dismiss it out of hand. if she considers it, she should (of course) do her due diligence and make sure every aspect of this agreement is in writing, including her name on the title deed with her father or solo and/or put the house in an irrevocable trust in her name.\n\nalso see: my sister has devoted 15 years to helping our parents — how can i ever repay her?\n\ni understand that the initial reaction to a request like this would be to say, no. or, no, thank you. or as i like to say to soften the blow, alas, no. but it really all depends on the closeness of the relationship of this father-daughter, your daughter's financial health and the terms of the deal or, to put it more politely, written agreement. whatever she decides, such a decision should be made based on whether it's financially feasible. emotions should have nothing to do with it. if the house is worth $2 million, and it's valued at such a price, this could be both an opportunity for your daughter to do a good deed and strike a good deal.\n\nso let me answer your question with several more questions: would your daughter be expected to pay the entire monthly mortgage repayment? can she afford that? this is critical, as any late payments or, worse, default would not only put the house at risk of repossession, it would also impact her credit score, possibly for years to come. will her father and his wife pay for a portion of the property taxes and other maintenance costs? why doesn't he want to downsize? at first glance, that would make the most financial and practical sense.\n\nwould she, and she alone, be placed on the deeds of the house? would his second wife be given the right to live there for the rest of her life, should her father predecease is wife? would your daughter agree to that? what if, heaven forbid, your daughter pre-deceased her father? would your daughter's share of this house — whether it was 50% or 100% — go to you? if her father has a history of unpaid debts, your daughter would have to take this $300,000 loan as one she would be responsible for alone, assuming she eventually inherits the home.\n\ndon't miss:i built a nest egg of $1 million and i'm only 46 — how do make sure my kids benefit?\n\nyou ask a bigger question too. what do we owe our parents? do we owe them anything? there is no one answer that fits all. it varies from family to family. some lawmakers disagree on when adult children become untethered financially from their parents. some two dozen u.s. states have filial responsibility or piety laws, which can be traced back to colonial times. they were designed to prevent aging parents from drawing on public resources and, instead, impose a duty on adult children to support their impoverished parents.\n\ncalifornia is among them, although they are rarely enforced. they have, however, been used to some effect by nursing homes. some legal experts say they've rightly taken some children to task, while others say nursing homes have aggressively pursued adult children. pennsylvania did use filial responsibility to force an adult child to pay his mother's bill. case in point: in 2012, a pennsylvania court ruled that john pittas must pay his mother's $93,000 nursing home bill after she moved to greece.\n\nrecommended:i paid my boyfriend's rent and bills to improve his credit score — then he bought a house without telling me\n\nthere has been renewed interest in these laws and some lawyers have said they should even be expanded, arguing that adult children should not be allowed to turn their backs on their parents, especially when they are unable to care for themselves. texas should join the other 28 states that already have a filial responsibility statute, according to this opinion piece by katherine pearson, a professor of law at penn state. with the number of indigent elderly quickly rising, long-term care costs are likely affecting many families.\n\nwriting in the estate planning & community property law journal, she added, placing the duty of support on able family members first is a centuries-old obligation that has managed to survive into the present day despite opposition. while filial responsibility may seem harsh, it is simply making families care for each other. this could be helpful for parents who are helpless and out of alternatives. that said, it seems like your daughter's father has plenty of other options, given that her father is living in a $2 million home.\n\nread also:how to give your home to your children tax-free\n\ni haven't given an outright no, as every circumstance is different, but a co-signing arrangement is generally frowned upon. it's intended to shift the risk to the other person in the event that one of them fails to make the payment, says mark hamrick, washington, d.c. bureau chief at bankrate.com. in that case, the chances are that both or either of them will fail. so a yes would have to depend on (a) your daughter inheriting this home, or a substantial share of it, and (b) her ultimate ability to pay the full monthly repayment.\n\na child's financial responsibility does not extend to taking out a $300,000 loan on a parent's behalf. if the terms are not to her liking, or if helping her father maintain this property is too onerous, or if she simply doesn't want to, then she can say no. but he is her father, so let's not demonize him for asking. she could advise him on downsizing to a smaller home. a reverse mortgage, like marriage, should not be entered into lightly, but they can make sense in some scenarios. he may have two decades of life ahead of him. his second wife may have more.\n\nunderstandably, you want to protect your daughter. there are many ways to give help and co-signing on a $300,00 mortgage is just one of them.\n\nteenagers, just like their parents, want iphones more than ever\n\nrecommended:after my father died, my brother has been pressuring me to lend him money\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

box inc. and dropbox inc. have been grouped together for nearly their entire existence for reasons that go beyond their names.\n\nboth silicon valley companies were started with the idea of allowing anyone to store and access content they owned remotely, with young founders who found many willing venture investors. box box, -4.18% was incorporated just two years before dropbox dbx, -6.13% , which priced its initial public offering thursday, three years after box entered the public market.\n\nbox chief executive aaron levie says the similarities between his company and dropbox ceo drew houston's mostly end at the surface, though. box has aimed its service at large companies seeking to allow secure sharing among employees, while dropbox has chased consumer subscriptions and offered a freemium model to businesses with less emphasis on direct sales.\n\npreviously: aaron levie on artificial intelligence and the future of box\n\nin a recent visit to the marketwatch offices, levie compared box with salesforce.com inc. crm, -1.71% and workday inc. wday, -4.44% , while dropbox received comparisons to netflix inc. nflx, -3.75% and spotify inc. spot, -4.10% he described dropbox as a marriage of apple inc.'s aapl, -3.39% icloud service and an enterprise-software company that thrives in smaller companies and groups of employees, like zendesk inc. zen, -5.87%\n\nit's really a tale of two business that have one umbrella structure—it's a great business, [but] even with that, its just not like an enterprise software company in the terms of their economics, he said of dropbox.\n\nlevie has led box from an ipo valuation of about $1.7 billion to a market cap of more than $3.1 billion as of wednesday's close, with shares pushing higher by more than 41% in the past year as the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% has grown 15.7%. dropbox priced its ipo at $21 late thursday, up from the previously expected range of between $18 and $20 a share, according to securities and exchange commission documents. the company had previously expected $16 to $18 a share. at $21 a share, investors will give it an initial market valuation of $8.24 billion, and the company will raise more than $750 million. shares will start trading friday on the nasdaq, under the ticker symbol dbx.\n\ndropbox ipo: five things to know about the cloud-storage company\n\nhere is what levie had to say about dropbox earlier this month. the interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nyou just passed the third anniversary of your ipo - how does that process change a business like yours, and what becomes more difficult?\n\nit has really advanced and evolved the operational rigor and discipline that goes into the company, and i think this is the case for any company that goes public, its just really different running a business where you have a few investors who have been with you a very long time around the table of your board and tens of thousands of investors who everyday get to make a decision about how you're performing and where you're going as a company. it changes how you think about running the organization, changes the operations, changes how you communicate, and all those things have been very good.\n\nobviously, there's always this challenge that there's a mismatch between what the market thinks about your company and what you're seeing internally or what you believe, the path and the vision you have. you're always trying to reduce that disconnect and have as little disparity as possible.\n\nshould antitrust laws be enforced against the tech giants' monopolies?\n\nwhat did you take away from dropbox's ipo filing? where did you see similarities and differences from box?\n\nit's very efficient, generates really solid cash flow—those two things are correlated, so the more efficient you can be in serving your customers, the more cash you're gonna generate, assuming you have a differentiated product that commands premium pricing. when we looked at the numbers, i thought it was a really attractive business—very strong economics, good retention rates for the market they serve, very healthy in terms of cash generation. all those things are positive.\n\nsome points of distinction or difference between our business: dropbox is fundamentally a consumer business that has a subset of revenue coming from small businesses or teams within companies. [the majority of dropbox revenue] looks more like spotify's revenue or netflix's revenue because it is just you or i paying for an online service that has similar retention rates and gross margins to an online service that we would use. it's really a tale of two businesses that have one umbrella structure—it's a great business, even with that, its just not like an enterprise software company in the terms of their economics. the amount that companies pay them is substantially less, the retention rates that they experience from companies is substantially less than you would see in a typical enterprise software business, but that's because they're being diluted down by a consumer revenue stream.\n\nto truly compete and grow in enterprise sales, will dropbox have to build up a sales force and potentially hurt the efficiency that makes it attractive?\n\ni don't really know, but i would say they've been trying to do that for five years. the past five or even eight years, they've always had the general positioning of, we're moving upmarket, but largely we still don't see them upmarket. that's just because when you don't have 100% of your focus on the enterprise, its really, really hard to serve the types of businesses and organizations we serve. the met police in london, or general electric ge, -2.65% or eli lilly lly, -1.50% aren't just going to choose a consumer tool because it's a little bit easier to use than your traditional enterprise software. they're going to go with the platform that has all the security, all the compliance, all the regulatory controls, that has the team that can help partner with them and has a great user experience.\n\ndoes seeing dropbox's numbers make you want to get into the consumer business at all?\n\ngod, no. 60% to 70% retention rates, the dynamics of their business—i haven't done any of the math on this, but every year you have to go reacquire hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to make up for the hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue that churned. you're kind of on this hamster wheel from a customer standpoint. also, it's a wildly competitive market—you've got icloud, google googl, -2.92% goog, -2.62% drive, onedrive. you have adjacent competitors, like we all probably put our photos on facebook fb, -1.90% or instagram, so you have to be thinking about different adjacencies where the data that could have been in dropbox is now in a photo-sharing tool or different platform. it's not an attractive market. dropbox has made it work, so i give them huge kudos for how they've made that business work, but i would not be able to stomach that.\n\nare you worried about losing investors to dropbox?\n\ni don't think anyone is going to see us as zero-sum investments. there's some argument that maybe we'll finally start to look like a sector, because now there's a couple of companies and it's a frigging gigantic market. dropbox and box can grow for a very, very long time given the size of the addressable market where i don't think there's any sort of zero-sum investing behavior that would have to happen. but i also think we're going to attract different investors, just as netflix attracts different investors from workday, i think they're going to attract a certain kind of profile and we will attract a different profile (of investor).\n\ndrew houston shoots you full of sodium pentathol and says give me the one thing that i need to know before going public, what is it?\n\n(after confirming what sodium pentathol is) my truth serum advice would be, be as communicative as possible with wall street—what's your strategy, what's your long-term plan, how you're gonna get there, what the numbers look like. we've always benefited from more communication, not necessarily more types of communication, just more frequent, consistent communication about what we're doing and where we're going.\n\nmarketwatch staff writers max a. cherney and therese poletti sat in on the interview and asked questions.
warren buffett, sumner redstone and rupert murdoch possess a combined age of 269 years, and even their fiercest critics would have to salute their longevity as modern-day business moguls.\n\nin hbo's new drama series succession, logan roy is the fictional media magnate protagonist played by brian cox, and the character recalls all three of the aforementioned, real-life figures (marketwatch is a division of dow jones media group, which is owned by rupert murdoch's news corp nws, +1.12% ).\n\nsuccession is created by jesse armstrong, who co-wrote the political satire in the loop and worked on hbo's veep. the first episode of the new ten-episode series is produced and directed by adam mckay, who made the oscar-winning 2015 movie version of michael lewis's the big short.\n\nsuccession chronicles the financial and personal fallout suffered by roy's four children when logan reverses a decision to retire as head of his media and entertainment conglomerate waystar royco. the squabbling among his three sons and daughter intensifies when he is hospitalized after suffering a stroke shortly after his 80th birthday.\n\nwhat adam mckay did with illuminating the financial crisis in 'the big short,' he's now doing with the media in 'succession,' said jeremy strong, who plays logan's most ambitious son, kendall roy.\n\nthe first season of succession, which premiered yesterday on hbo (owned by time warner inc. us:twx, was supposed to end with the media tycoon meeting his maker, cox revealed to marketwatch. originally, i was supposed to be dead at the end of the first series, cox said. when i had the initial conversation with adam mckay and jessie, they quickly decided, 'oh yeah, i think we've got to have you a little longer than just the one series.' i think they realized, rightly, that it's too interesting a character to kill off. i might be dead at the end of the second series, i don't know, but they've signed me up for a few.\n\nhbo has just announced succession has been renewed for a second season and cox's character, as with damian lewis, his co-star in 2008 indie movie the escapist, in showtime's homeland, is too popular to kill off after the first season. he will be returning.\n\ncox, a veteran 71-year-old scottish actor who has played hannibal lecter in manhunter and william stryker in the x-men franchise, said succession was reminiscent of both shakespearean dramas he has performed on stage, and filmed tv plays for the bbc in the 1960s and 70s.\n\nthe long form more and more interests me as an actor, he said. movies are so disappointing these days because people don't get access to them in the same way. out of five movie theaters, four are showing marvel or dc [comic book] films and one theater is competing for everything else so it's hard to get that one film into the loop because the corporate world doesn't allow it to happen, he said.\n\ni go back to the great days of british television which is when i loved it, he added. the reason i came here was because british television went through a very bad time in the mid-1990s. it has resuscitated now and is fantastic with shows like 'broadchurch' and 'the crown.' i moved to new york because my reasoning was if i'm going to do crap, i'd rather do crap here and earn more money!\n\nwhile the power struggles and family warfare in succession bring to mind hbo's fantasy phenomenon, game of thrones, in a media setting, the show has plenty of humor. at one point, logan roy is dubbed kim jong-pop by his son roman (kieran culkin), when he half-jokingly queries why his company can't provide all the news.\n\nin addition to dynastic and power struggles, money battles recur in the first season of succession. waystar's stock plunges and the company is engaged in a protracted battle to buy a digital media company.\n\ni think if there's any moral to 'succession,' it's that money won't fix you, however f----d up you are, said alan ruck, best known for his role as cameron in ferris bueller's day off, who plays connor roy, logan's son from his first marriage who is not interested in being the heir apparent. whether it's stories about kings or millionaires, people love to know the dirty details. they don't want to believe that people can have that much wealth and be happy and be whole, he said.\n\nas well as loosely basing his character on present-day moguls, cox also sought inspiration in legendary 19th century industrialists. carnegie was an influence because he's the father of american capitalism, but he also realized it didn't work, he said. at the end of his life, it made him very unhappy but he needed the money in order to be a philanthropist. the big mystery is does capitalism work? it certainly does for a few people but it doesn't work for the populace.\n\nhe added: there's a longevity with people like george soros and warren buffett and it's to do with being at the sharp end...these guys deal with a lot of horrible truths that kind of sustain them. they have no illusions. they live in harsh realities and they make the world in their own image. they do that for reasons of survival. logan says in the show it's a game, which you can't get emotionally involved with, and the kids don't understand.\n\nas driven as kendall roy is to succeed his father as a media tycoon, strong says his character is ill-suited to the task. for all his extensive research into the role, he says the most important guidance for his character was psychiatrist carl jung's axiom that where love is absent, power fills the vacuum.\n\nfollowing on from his portrayal of financial analyst vinny daniel in the big short, strong seems to be cornering the market in playing driven businessmen. i'm a scrappy outsider from boston so didn't have a privileged background at all like many in business, he said. but i am ambitious as an actor and when you are one of the leaders on an hbo show, you inevitably think more about responsibility and authority.\n\nall four ray offspring are decidedly different. shiv (sarah snook) is more interested in politics than business, while roman (kieran culkin) is way too outspoken and quirky to take over the reins from his father.\n\nkieran culkin hbo\n\nculkin is the younger brother of home alone star maculay culkin. did the roys' public exploits remind him of his own family's notoriety in the 1990s? no. the difference is that with the roy family, they are running their own media and can control what is being said about them to a certain degree.\n\nplus the roy family willingly have put themselves out in the forefront, whereas my brother became very famous as a kid which you can't even really say he chose to do because it's making a life decision when you're nine years old. that was sort of put upon him and the rest of the family. i think the family has been trying to do everything they can to avoid any kind of limelight whereas the roys bask in it to a certain degree, culkin said.\n\nshould succession succeed in the ratings stakes, according to insiders, the show will begin filming a second series early next year.\n\nmeanwhile, for all its emphasis on veracity, considerable artistic license was taken by hbo when it came to the casting of the roy family. i'm ten years younger than brian cox and he's playing my dad, alan ruck observed. they're pretending that he's ten years older and i'm ten years younger. that's hollywood, baby.
after years of long work hours, responsibilities at home with the kids and busy schedules, retirement can be a great time to reconnect with a spouse — so long as they're aware of each other's goals for this next chapter.\n\nretirement tip of the week: before you even think about leaving the workforce, talk to your husband or wife about your ideas for the future, and ask to hear about theirs. get on the same page, even if you have different desires.\n\ncouples might want the same exact things when they retire, such as lounging on a beach, moving closer to the grandkids or driving cross-country for the summer. they also might not — one spouse may want to live in another country, while the other wants to start a small business pursuing a lifelong passion.\n\nhaving different ideas about retirement isn't inherently bad. what would be better, however, is talking about these goals, finding compromises where necessary and helping each other meet their needs.\n\nwhen our actions are out of alignment with our values, there could be a sense of loss, said michelle buonincontri, a financial coach at new direction financial strategies. retirement is no different.\n\navoiding this type of planning can be detrimental to relationships. the number of people who divorce in their 50s and later has grown substantially in recent decades, partially because people are living longer and want to have a robust life. nurturing a marriage is always vital, no matter what age, but neglecting one in the midst of other life transitions can become a disaster. divorces take an emotional, but also a financial, toll.\n\nthis discussion, or series of discussions, should start years before retirement, especially if it involves a big move or an expensive purchase. it also doesn't have to be stressful or boring.\n\nsit down with a favorite beverage and a computer to pull up some ideas, like a month-long cruise or a new neighborhood to consider home. or take a week off and pretend to be retired, mimicking what you anticipate the day-to-day to be. fritz gilbert and his wife, jackie, created an activity jar, where they each contributed what they'd like to do in the foreseeable future. for example, a trip to the museum or a day of volunteering. gilbert, who blogs at the retirement manifesto, and his wife became financially independent at the age of 55.\n\ncommunication, as in most instances, will be key. couples may also consider bringing in a third-party professional to assist in the planning, such as a financial adviser, who can talk to the financial aspects of these goals and life plans and help find compromises in some cases.\n\nsparking these discussions, even if only one spouse has set goals in mind, can build a structure for the next phases of your life together.\n\nthe conversations can be moments of reflection, buonincontri said. ask open-ended questions, listen carefully to the other person, build on what they said, be mindful of body language and eye contact and let them feel heard, she said. the hardest is being comfortable with silence, she said. if the other person doesn't answer right away, it's ok. we want to jump in and add, but that can interrupt the other person's thought process.\n\nnot sure where to start? here are a few questions to start the conversations, courtesy of principal financial.\n\nwhen do you want to retire? how should we spend our money in retirement? how and what to do you want to do with family and friends? should we get involved in our community? should either of us work part time? will we support anyone else in retirement?\n\nanother task? think carefully about what type of retiree you'll be. there are six types, according to nancy schlossberg, an author and former counseling professor: the adventurer, the continuer, the easy glider, the involved spectator, the searcher and the retreater. each approaches retirement differently, and knowing which you and your spouse are can help navigate the planning process.\n\nabove all, when making these plans, be prepared for the unexpected and remain considerate. be sensitive to the outcome you may not expect, buonincontri said. come with no expectations and be open with what unfolds.
what could be more complicated than love? money, hands down.\n\nthe strange, beautiful chemistry that binds two people together can make us blind to many faults. that's good, because we certainly have faults of our own.\n\nwhere things can turn sour, of course, is when we have to talk to our partners about spending, saving and investing.\n\ni find with my clients that one half of a couple usually takes the lead. the other person takes the back seat, content not to think about money at all.\n\nthus it goes, sometimes for decades. under what appears to be still waters, however, can be unspoken turmoil.\n\nin one common scenario, he's an investment gambler. she's a steady, look-before-you-leap type. (the he-she here could be reversed, of course.)\n\nif things go well with the investments, the conflict lies dormant. but then the stock market takes a spill, a job is lost, a medical expense empties the bank account — and suddenly money is front and center.\n\nthere's a reason the traditional marriage vow includes for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health. relationships end over money, all the time.\n\nit's good, then, to find a way to have the money talk regularly. that could be biweekly, after payday. maybe it's quarterly. whatever feels right.\n\none of the most important services we provide at my firm is to help our couple-clients learn to talk about money.\n\nlike a couples therapist, a good financial adviser should be comfortable helping couples handle conflicts, sort through the issues, forge compromises, and find a path forward. an adviser who can take the money stress out of a marriage is worth every penny.\n\nhere's an easy template for that conversation, a checklist of topics to hit and agree upon, each time you talk.\n\naccounts now\n\nhow is your immediate income and spending going? are you falling short each month? are debts creeping up in the background?\n\nit's much better to talk about a small spending misfire than to clean up a mess of red ink that's been quietly spilling for a year. rather than point fingers, own the problem and suggest spending cutbacks that affect both of you to get back the track.\n\nsaving targets\n\nnothing takes the pressure out of a relationship like feathering your nest together. a solid savings account balance can make up for a lot of small money mistakes, regardless of who made them.\n\nrather than setting a dollar goal, put aside a percentage of each paycheck, if you both earn an income. in order to be fair, let the high earner carry the heavier load.\n\ninvestment ideas\n\nsome people view investing as a kind of game, where bigger wins are more important than incremental progress. others prefer to see steady, reliable growth.\n\nif you don't agree with your spouse or partner on a single investment philosophy, break the investment process into two accounts: our future money and now money.\n\nyou should invest future money prudently for growth. now money is for stock picking or whatever is in fashion.\n\nmake sure the now pot is small as a percentage of your income. challenge your risk-taking partner to reinvest gains into the our future pot. over time, he or she will see how the future money dwarfs the speculative account.\n\ntiming\n\nno, you should not propose this conversation as your concept of a romantic dinner date. absolutely not!\n\nhowever, while you're out enjoying a nice meal and talking about how great your lives are together, there's probably no better time to pop the question: so, let's talk about money, later this month, because i care about you.\n\nit will go better than you think, and will very likely relieve stress you might not realize has been building in the background.\n\neveryone wants to be taken care of, and they want a partner who cares about a life together.\n\nfor richer or poorer, remember? with a bit of money honesty, that should mean richer together.
i read the latest summary sheet of our law firm's disputed probate, estate and trust cases and came across an insight that should have been obvious (but wasn't): about 50% of our active disputed-estate cases involve litigated differences between stepmothers and their stepchildren.\n\nin all different cases — will contests, trust contests, life-estate challenges, probate objections, elder financial abuse, deed revocations or joint-tenancy quarrels — the interests and paths of stepmothers and stepchildren often collide.\n\nnot an 'evil stepmother' stereotype\n\ni'm not implying any evil stepmother stereotype so familiar from fairy tales is related to probate litigation. rather, my observations are merely indicative of the frequent conflicts in estate matters between stepmothers and stepchildren that i've come across. i've represented both sides, and i've seen how tensions in blended families can carry over into disputes over an inheritance, beneficiary rights to a trust or estate property.\n\ni suppose that such conflicts are ancient in origin and grounded in the personal motives of each to resist emotional, physical and financial encroachment by the other. (to be fair, stepfathers are not immune to estate and probate disputes; it's just that the frequency of stepfather disputes is a fraction of stepmother disputes.)\n\nlife expectancy and widowhood\n\nto explain the stepmother phenomenon in estate disputes, let's begin by noting there is a life expectancy gap in the u.s. between men and women. a man reaching 65 today can expect to live, on average, until 84. a woman turning the same age today can expect to live, on average, until 86.\n\nwidowed females also far outnumber widowed males, 11.2 million to 2.9 million. to the extent that these widowed females and males have stepchildren, it is obvious that the number of surviving stepmothers heavily outweighs the number of surviving stepfathers.\n\nanyone living in the real world wouldn't be surprised by research showing that only about 20% of adult stepchildren feel close to their stepmoms. moreover, studies show abundant evidence that stepmothers and their stepchildren do not grow closer over time.\n\nwhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nestrangement and estate problems\n\nwhether the reasons for estrangement are simple or complex, stepmothers' relationships with their stepchildren are often problematic. even when stepmothers and stepchildren try to develop a positive relationship, a successful outcome may prove elusive.\n\noften, stepmothers and stepchildren in contested estates neither see the same facts nor reach the same conclusions in interpreting the facts.\n\nan inevitable percentage of estates managed by a widowed stepmother with stepchildren heirs will end up as a battleground of hard-fought litigation over inheritance rights. in my experience, the more heavily lopsided the estate distribution, the more likely there will be an inheritance battle.\n\nthe trust and estate fights between stepchildren and their stepmothers may seem chaotic, but the facts giving rise to the disputes fit a few likely patterns.\n\nshort marriage term\n\nshort-term marriages present a perfect, brief incubation period for brewing a hot estate dispute. while the decedent's marriage may have been cut short by his death, his long-term estate plan may have been short-circuited by undue influence in the period before his passing.\n\nwills, estate plans, transfers of property, and trusts that are hastily drawn up — with beneficiaries changed during a husband's last days — practically guarantee estate litigation.\n\nalthough long-term marriages don't necessarily provide a safe harbor against an estate challenge, such unions are more likely to have produced estate plans that balance the welfare of a father's children with the welfare of his later spouse.\n\nfavored children\n\nfavored children of the stepmother can be particularly problematic.\n\ncontinual behind-the-scenes efforts by a stepmother to advance the interests of her child over those of her husband's biological child won't escape the notice of other family members. financial favors can include loans, free rent, cars and vacations. family members will discover these favors after the father's death: not through open disclosure by a stepmother but more likely through records uncovered by stepchildren.\n\ndisputes immediately after a death\n\nstepmother disputes will frequently break out immediately upon a father's death. many times, my firm has seen conflicts over where the deceased's body will end up.\n\nwhere the father was first widowed and then remarried, issues like burial with his first wife will arise. some stepmothers ignore the children's requests and control the burial or cremation of the decedent. terrible things can occur here, among them the refusal to release cremains to children, or the refusal to provide a headstone or let anyone else provide a headstone for the decedent.\n\nat times, stepmothers hide all information about the burial, so family members have no idea where the remains of their loved one are located. such disputes are neither uncommon nor easily resolved.\n\nthe hide-and-seek problem\n\nhide-and-seek may have been a fun game during our childhood, but it's not so fun when we are grown-ups.\n\nhide-and-seek in the stepmother-stepchildren relationship often begins with a married father's initial affair with a woman destined to later be his wife — more important, his children's stepmother. the natural strains between a stepmother and her stepchildren come under even more strain from the stepchildren's feelings of family betrayal, and the stepmother is an easy mark as the source of betrayal. a lack of information about the location of a funeral, urn, or burial is par for the course in postmortem hide-and-seek games.\n\ndementia\n\nmy experience in estate litigation leads me to conclude that most undue influence activities later challenged in court occur when the elder is at stage 2 or 3 on the clinical dementia rating (cdr) scale.\n\ncdr stage 2 is when the elder is becoming more disoriented as to time and space. the elder gets lost easily and struggles with time relationships. short-term memory is substantially impaired. other confusion may exist as to his relationships; he may think that his sister is his daughter or his spouse is his sister. cdr stage 3 is the final and most severe phase of dementia. now, the elder functions only with assistance from a caregiver. the elder has extreme memory loss. there is little or no understanding of orientation in time or geography.\n\nbad actors can try to exploit the vulnerabilities of an elder with dementia, a scheme called the dementia gambit — an effort to unduly influence the elder to engage in an act that might on its face appear to be brazen, but which is meant to take control of a family fortune. such gambits are common in heated stepmother-stepchildren disputes.\n\nthe property-transfer gambit is an effort to have the individual with dementia sign over deeds, powers of attorney, bank deposits or other assets to a person exercising undue influence.\n\nsubtle hints of wrongdoing\n\nsometimes hints of wrongdoing are subtle. questions as to the existence or nonexistence of estate planning documents are shunted aside. often, personal property disappears or is signed over into the wrong hands. precious family heirlooms might be found in the garbage at the decedent's house — sometimes as early as the date of death. the family home is locked up, the locks are changed, and no one save the controlling party is allowed access.\n\nresolving matters early — or not\n\nwhen people call me about stepmother-stepchildren disputes, one of the first things i usually tell them is that cooler heads, willing to resolve matters early, will often save estate money and

dear moneyologist,\n\ni have read and enjoyed your column for several years, but never imagined that i would find myself in a position to be writing you for advice. however, recent events leave me seeking your help.\n\nin early november, i learned that my 63-year-old ex-husband died. it had been 17 years since we parted ways and at least five or six since i had seen him, but i felt the loss. you couldn't know larry and not feel the world was a little poorer without his expansive personality.\n\nthree weeks after his death, i received another shock — a notice that i was the beneficiary of a $150,000 pension from his employment with the state of wisconsin. i wasn't sure what to make of it, but initially it didn't seem a stretch that he had intentionally left me this money. he never remarried, we were quite close for a few years following our divorce, and i found it possible that he was belatedly recognizing the significant financial sacrifices i made during our seven-year relationship.\n\nit also made sense as i knew larry's brother mark couldn't inherit the money. he resides in a senior community that provides care for life in exchange for receiving the majority of your personal savings and income. larry also has a sister, 76, to whom he wasn't close during the time i was with him. given her personality and the fact she lives in arizona, i would be willing to bet they never grew closer.\n\n my ex-husband's sister molly subsequently contacted me saying she believes my inheritance was an oversight her brother never bothered to correct. she then asked me to share the pension directly with her and she would make sure to get some of it to mark and the girls.  — mary in wisconsin\n\nmy only question about the inheritance related to a special friend, that larry had been with for about 8 years. su and larry never lived in the same city, much less the same house. instead, they talked on the phone, exchanged emails and saw each other several times a year. given that this was the cordial relationship pattern that larry and i fell into for about three years after our formal split, i am confident this arrangement would have been perfect for larry, who had asperger's syndrome and wasn't comfortable with close, prolonged contact with people.\n\nlarry's sister molly has subsequently contacted me saying she believes my inheritance was an oversight her brother never bothered to correct, even after being diagnosed several months ago with metastatic lung cancer. he didn't leave a will and failed to name a beneficiary on his life insurance policy, so i think oversight is a fair claim here. she made a compelling case that mark, his daughters and she could really use the money. she then asked me to share the pension directly with her and she would make sure to get some of it to mark and the girls. to be honest, i'm not confident the money would get past molly's bank account, so this is not an option for me.\n\nalso see:my father died and my sister emptied the $100,000 in his bank account\n\ni checked in with larry's brother, mark, to determine his thoughts. he didn't share molly's concerns about sharing the money i inherited. an ira that would have gone to mark was split between his daughters and he received half of larry's life insurance, which apparently he can have since it isn't taxed. molly received the other half of the life insurance, so she inherited at least $25,000. i didn't ask what the policy was worth, but know that it was at least one year of my ex-husband's salary as he was a state employee so $25,000 is a safe base estimate.\n\ni do believe i have a case for feeling justified in keeping a good chunk of the money. when larry and i were married, we lived in a very small town where he worked as an attorney and i was a newspaper reporter earning about $20,000 a year. we shared our household expenses, which left me very little to put toward retirement. when he realized he needed to quit law, i supported both of us for a year while he transitioned to a new career. he actually out-earned me that year through some consulting work he did, but i didn't realize that until after we filed our taxes — and he didn't put any of it toward our living costs. when we divorced, i was too young and proud to be smart about the process. i left with what was mine — an older car, a few pieces of furniture and my $3,000 retirement fund — and left him with at least $50,000 in retirement funds (i didn't know the full extent of his retirement savings), a few thousand dollars in a personal savings account and a new car.\n\ndon't miss: can i leave my stepchildren nothing if my husband dies?\n\nafter taxes, i'm likely to inherit about $95,000. legally, i know i can keep it all. my question is, how much of it should i keep? and who do i give some to? my friends and family think i should keep all of it. my current husband says he trusts me to do what i think is best. i'll admit i'm feeling greedy, so i'm interested in your reaction to my thoughts about options:\n\n1.name mark's daughters and grandchildren as heirs in our will. my husband and i have no children, so this is an easy way to express my gratitude to larry for the money — albeit delayed gratitude, given that we are healthy and 52 and 46 respectively. our net worth is currently about $550,000, and i expect that to grow in coming years, as we will have no debt after paying off our $50,000 mortgage and will be saving about 25 percent of our income for retirement.\n\n2.create college funds for the two grandchildren, putting $2,500 in for each in 2017, and contributing $600 annually to each until they are through college. the kids are four and six years of age. my only concern is that they won't attend post-secondary schooling (their mothers didn't finish college) and that gift ends up being of little use. i also thought of creating a similar fund to help with things like braces, dance lessons or sports, but i think that could ultimately be fraught with complications.\n\n3.give su, larry's special friend, some of the money. i know through mutual friends that she is not rich. in fact, her house burned down a couple of years ago and she lost everything in it. she's 63, so she won't be earning much income in future years. for her, i was thinking of: #1 $5,000, the amount i was going to donate in larry's name to a couple of his favorite causes before learning i was quite possibly not his intended heir. #2 $10,000, which actually feels much fairer, but which i am fighting because i am human and greedy.\n\nif you have time and this situation interests you, i would appreciate any thoughts you have on these options or others you might think of. money really makes you face who you are and challenges your assumptions about yourself — at least that's what i'm experiencing right now. please help me be the person i want to be — fair, kind and just. thank you.\n\nmary\n\ndear mary,\n\nyour letter is both compassionate and self-aware. you are human and you should consider keeping all of it. whether we would like to admit it, we all would have the same thought.\n\npresumably, the rest of his estate went to his children and your status as his ex-wife (after seven years of marriage) is recognized here. they are years you could have spent building your own future or one with someone else. what's more, no-one has the right to tell you what to do or judge your relationship. some might say it was an oversight. others could argue that larry decided to leave things as they were. you might even say that the universe was looking out for you. whatever you decide, if you decided to keep the full amount you could do so with a full and clear conscience.\n\n you are smart enough and strong enough to withstand the pernicious and self-serving phone call by his estranged sister, and yet fair enough to not use that as an excuse to blind you to the possible generosity others might appreciate.  — the moneyologist\n\nyou are smart enough and strong enough to withstand the pernicious and self-serving phone call by his estranged sister, and yet fair enough to not use that as an excuse to blind you to the possible generosity others might appreciate. i like no. 1 and 2. create those college funds (they can use them as deposits for a house and/or you can adjust these gifts accordingly if they decide to forego further education) and leave them a token amount in your will to account for this windfall. for no. 3, you say option #2 would be fairer; both options are good, but go with your gut and choose the larger sum.\n\nall of this will help you to enjoy this inheritance. you had a lot of respect for your ex-husband and, i have no doubt, the feeling was mutual. your thoughtful letter is proof of that.\n\n*names of relatives have been changed.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

dear moneyist,\n\ni am one of very few women in this country dreading the most recent stimulus check. as soon as i heard the stimulus bill passed, i got a sick sense of dread in my stomach.\n\nwhy? because my husband controls all of the money in our marriage and he is extremely stubborn. let me begin by saying we actually have a generally happy, loving, satisfying marriage. we get along great and truly can't imagine life apart, and we'll have been married 12 years this august.\n\nbut he is very controlling of the money. he truly sees it as his money, regarding just about everything, except my small paychecks. he does pay all of the household bills. but he makes over $100,000 a year, and i earn about $24,000 a year because i am a part-time nurse and also home-school our daughter.\n\n my husband said, 'the stimulus check will be going to aluminum siding for the house, that's the plan.' \n\ni pay my own personal bills, and buy 95% of the groceries, which is always a stretch for me. on the other hand, he has $20,000 in the savings account — which, believe me, is seen as his, not mine. he gets bonuses from work almost annually, but i never ever get a large sum of money for myself to just do whatever with.\n\nwhen we received our stimulus check, we got in a huge fight because he wanted to give me $400. and trust me, he thought he was being generous, but this was right after christmas and i had been sick and off work for over a week. i don't have sick pay or paid time off because i'm part time. so i truly, desperately needed the half of the stimulus just to buy groceries and pay my bills!\n\nso after we found out about the $1,400-per-person stimulus tonight in the car, my husband said, the stimulus check will be going to aluminum siding for the house, that's the plan. i wanted to scream! the plan? when the hell did you ask me?\n\ni just know that it's going to be another huge fight, and he'll probably try and throw me a couple hundred dollars again and think he's great. i can't take this anymore, but i do really love him and i don't want a divorce.\n\ni just want him to stop being so controlling with money and so your money/my money. also, he would never go to counseling. what should i do? sorry my letter is so long.\n\nat my wit's end\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear wits,\n\ndon't apologize to me, and don't apologize to your husband. you have found your voice. now you need to use it. there's a big difference between putting your needs first and putting yourself first. telling people what you need and having those needs met is a basic entry point into a relationship. they either listen to your needs or they disregard them.\n\n love is an action. \n\nnow, i'm sorry. i'm sorry your needs are not being met, and i'm sorry to say that if people do not listen to your needs, they are not showing you respect. love is an action. without respect or trust in that process, there is no growth.\n\nso what you can do? tell you husband what you told me. no more silent scream. that fury can be addictive. you get to feel energized and righteous and wronged. and johnny rotten was right, anger is an energy, but it should push you toward action. inaction leads to unhappiness and depression.\n\nbreathe. don't allow your message to be obscured by emotion. that's noise. it will become the issue rather than the issue. and the issue is twofold: the $1,400 stimulus check and having control over your own finances. i will give you a version of what you could say, as a suggestion (not a direction):\n\nthe big picture:\n\nwe don't earn the same amount of money from our jobs, but they are both equally important jobs. we are a partnership, and we both put the same amount of work into our family and our life together. i need to be an equal partner in our life and finances. i need control over my finances.\n\nthat stimulus check:\n\ni earn $24,000 a year and, for that reason, i qualify for a stimulus check. it's important to me that i make the decision on how to spend my check, and i need you to understand why. yes, i have bills to personally pay, but making these decisions is critical to my feeling respected and valued.\n\nit's important to realize that telling you how to spend your money and how to spend your check is a form of coercive control. this is not a transactional relationship. it's a marriage. you homeschool your child not to make up for the shortfall in incomes, but because you believe you are equals.\n\n you are equals. \n\nnursing, teaching and caregiving are among the most important jobs in the world, and like many service professions, they are grossly underpaid. they also count among the professions that have put their health and lives at risk during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nif your husband insists on spending your check on aluminum siding, that may well lead to a larger conversation. one person cannot be more equal than the other in a marriage or in life. george orwell has written extensively about that concept. it did not turn out well.\n\nthe moneyist:my wife has homeschooled our son and our best friends' son since september due to covid-19. is it too late to bring up money?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch. by submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
missed the oscars on sunday? (you're not alone; the abc telecast saw its lowest ratings for the academy awards ever.)\n\nfear not: from parasite winning the night and jeff bezos getting roasted (not to mention joaquin phoenix possibly killing your taste for cow's milk forever), these are some of the most viral moments and memes from the 92nd academy awards.\n\njanelle monae celebrated the snubs. the #oscarssowhite and #oscarssomale hashtags were floating around again for this year's awards, as there was only a single nominee of color in the acting categories (cynthia erivo for harriet), and women were completely shut out of the best directors field. so singer monae opened the oscars broadcast with a jazzy number featuring dancers dressed as characters from the black actor–led films that were snubbed by the academy, including queen & slim, us and dolemite is my name. what's more, she sang, it's time to come alive, because the oscars is so white.\n\nrelated:ricky gervais isn't hosting the oscars, but that doesn't stop him from slamming the 'disgusting, narcissistic plague' anyway\n\nshe also gave a shout-out to all the women who directed phenomenal films, adding, i'm so proud to stand here as a black, queer artist, telling stories. happy black history month!\n\nsteve martin and chris rock roasted jeff bezos. while the oscars went hostless this year, former academy awards emcees turned presenters martin and rock gave what sure sounded like an opening monologue, complete with poking fun at amazon amzn, +0.33% founder and ceo bezos.\n\nhe's got cash, rock said of the ceo worth $129.2 billion, according to forbes. when he writes a check, the bank bounces. and he didn't stop there: jeff is so rich, he got divorced and he's still the richest man in the world. he saw 'marriage story' and thought it was a comedy.\n\nbut martin wasn't biting. when rock asked, steve, do you have anything you want to add about mr. bezos? martin said, no, i like getting my packages on time.\n\nbrad pitt got political. while picking up his first-ever acting oscar for once upon a time in hollywood, pitt called out the senate republicans who acquitted president trump of impeachment last week. they told me i only have 45 seconds to give this speech, which is 45 seconds more than the senate gave john bolton this week, he said, adding that, i'm thinking maybe quentin [tarantino] does a movie about it, and in the end, the adults do the right thing.\n\nbillie eilish became a meme. as comedians kristen wiig and maya rudolph performed a comedic singing bit while presenting the production and costume design categories, the camera panned to the 18-year-old grammy-winning singer, whose confused expression was priceless.\n\nthe in memoriam segment left out luke perry. while eilish performed the beatles' yesterday, the academy awards followed a longstanding tradition of paying tribute to the showbiz icons that we lost over the past year — and, leaving some out. it led the segment with a tribute to kobe bryant, and highlighted legends like doris day and kirk douglas. but viewers noticed that beverly hills, 90210 star luke perry was overlooked, even though he had a cameo in once upon a time in hollywood, which won two oscars that night. disney channel star cameron boyce was also overlooked.\n\neminem gave a surprise performance of lose yourself. many viewers almost immediately turned around and used that confused billie eilish meme to express their puzzlement at rapper eminem (aka marshall mathers) rapping his oscar-winning single from 2002's 8 mile. while he got a standing ovation at the end, audience members such as martin scorsese were caught on camera looking puzzled by the performance.\n\neminem skipped the oscars in 2003, when his song won, and he explained on twitter twtr, -1.47% that, look, if you had another shot, another opportunity... thanks for having me, adding, sorry it took me 18 years to get here.\n\njoaquin phoenix and renee zelleweger gave some crazy acceptance speeches. the winners for best actor and actress embraced their moment on stage. phoenix, who won for joker, managed to pay tribute to his late brother river phoenix, call for equality ... and make people feel really weird about drinking milk.\n\nin calling out mankind for its plunder of the natural world, he went off on a tangent about cow's milk. we feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow, and when she gives birth, we steal her baby, he said. and then we take her milk that's intended for her calf, and put it in our coffee and our cereal.\n\nread more: 'we feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby.' is joaquin phoenix tapping into a larger movement?\n\nwhen it was zelleweger's turn to accept the honor for her role in judy, she gave lengthy thanks to the u.s. military, judy garland, her parents, and heroes such as teachers, first responders and firefighters. they unite us, she said. when we look to our heroes, we agree, and that matters.\n\nolivia coleman revealed that winning an oscar is an aphrodisiac. last year's best actress winner for the favourite got royally risque while presenting the best actor award this year. last year was the best night of my husband's life. he actually says that. and i've given birth three times, she joked about her post-oscar win sex life, while the audience roared. so i hope you're all having as good a time as he did, and as i did.\n\nparasite director bong joon ho won the night. he took home four oscars on sunday, for best original screenplay, best international feature film, best director and best picture, which matched walt disney's dis, -1.28% record for most oscars won by a one person in a single night, which was set in 1954. besides making history for this and for his movie becoming the first non-english-language film to win best picture, joon ho won hearts with his modest and overjoyed acceptance speeches, as well as his promise to drink until next morning in celebration. [meanwhile, the broadcast got booed for cutting off the lights on stage while the parasite cast and crew were accepting the night's biggest award.]\n\nhe also paid tribute to his fellow best director nominees, including scorsese and quentin taratino. when i was young and starting in cinema, there was a saying that i carved deep into my heart, which is, 'the most personal is the most creative.' that quote was from our great martin scorsese … when people in the u.s. were not familiar with my films, quentin always put my films on his lists ... and todd [phillips] and sam [mendes], great directors that i admire, he said. if the academy allows, i would like to get a texas chainsaw and split the oscar trophy into five and share it with all of you.\n\nrelated:conservative blazetv host: 'parasite' team is 'the destruction of america'
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how money issues impact our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nit could be a race to the finish, in more ways than one. when wives earn more than their husbands, some men just can't handle it.\n\nmy wife has always earned more money than me, and for a while it absolutely killed our sex life. dead. i'm a trial lawyer now, but from 2006 to 2016 i didn't make a dime. i went back to school to get my master's and ph.d. and try to break into academia. dave peters was one of several men who told mel magazine what it was like when their wives earned more money than they did. sometimes, it worked out ok. and other times, it caused problems.\n\nbut peters said his relationship ran into difficulty because of how his wife handled their disparity in income. his wife made $180,000 a year and, he said, she was the one who always had the final word when it came to vacations, where they ate dinner and other household bills. the kids would ask her for money, and when she said no, they'd respond, 'fine, i'll ask dad then,' he added. and she would snort, 'yeah, sure.' he got a higher paying job and, happily, things improved.\n\n some academic research suggests that heterosexual couples are more likely to split up and less likely to marry when the husband earns less. \n\nhis wife did most of the planning and had the last word on managing their lives, peters said. he only felt they could get back on an equal footing when he earned as much, if not more, than his wife. complementary work hours and two higher-earning spouses may help couples juggle parental responsibilities, but will a husband feel emasculated at home if his wife climbs up the corporate ladder at work, and earns more than he does?\n\nit's increasingly common for wives to make more than their husbands: approximately 38% of wives earn more than their husbands, according to the bureau of labor statistics. and, according to the u.s. census bureau, that does make some couples uncomfortable. when a wife makes more than her husband, the income the couple reports for the wife is 1.5 percentage points lower on average than her actual income, but 2.9 percentage points higher for her husband.\n\nthe financial gender balance within marriage seems to be changing at a faster pace than society's attitudes about successful women. men and women who put love ahead of money may be part of a new generation that is breaking away from old-fashioned tropes about who should be the breadwinner. however, studies indicate that they're pushing against larger social and cultural forces, which put a higher value on husbands who earn more than their wives.\n\ntheories on what helps a couple stay together vary. some research suggests that couples are at higher risk of splitting up and less likely to marry when the male partner earns less than the female partner. other experts say couples are more likely to stay together, even if a wife earns more than her husband: maybe they can't afford to move out into separate places or, perhaps, one person is freelance and the other has a full-time job with health insurance.\n\n couples who put love ahead of money may be part of a new generation that is breaking from the status-conscious marriage habits of the past. \n\neven in 2019, old-fashioned views on marriage prevail. american men are still more comfortable in relationships when they are the breadwinners. in fact, the risk of divorce is nearly 33% higher when a husband isn't working full-time, according to money, work, and marital stability: assessing change in the gendered determinants of divorce, a 2016 study of more than 6,300 couples by alexandra killewald, professor of sociology at harvard university.\n\nfor marriages formed after 1975, husbands' lack of full-time employment is associated with higher risk of divorce, she found. expectations of wives' homemaking may have eroded, but the husband/breadwinner norm persists. that apparent disconnect may be due to peer pressure, or attitudes passed down from parents. another theory: a persistent glass ceiling for women at work may encourage men to believe they should also be the highest earners at home.\n\namericans see men as the financial providers, even as women's contributions grow, a separate report published in 2017 by the pew research center found. women bring at least half or more of the earnings in almost one-third of cohabiting couples in the u.s., up from just 13% in 1981. but in most couples, men contribute more of the income, and this aligns with the fact that americans place a higher value on a man's role as financial provider, the authors said.\n\nattitudes appear to be changing at a slower rate than women's salaries. breadwinning is still more often seen as a father's role than a mother's, pew said. about 40% americans believe it's extremely important for a father to provide income for his children, but just 25% said the same of mothers. roughly 75% of respondents in the pew survey said that having more women in the workplace has made it more difficult for parents to raise children.\n\nmarried men earn more than single men or married women\n\nmarried men still sit on the top of the wage ladder. the wages of married men far surpass those of all other groups: married women, single men and single women. the wages of married men exceed $80,000 per year on average by their peak earning years, while all the other groups barely graze $50,000 per year on average, according to recent data from the university of minnesota and ipums-usa, a database of individual responses from the u.s. census bureau.\n\n people's attitude to finance and romance also change from wedding no. 1, no. 2 and no. 3. the older people get, the more likely they'll marry for financial security. \n\nthere are other reasons why more husbands earn more than their wives that have less to do with structural issues like the gender wage gap. men often marry later than women, so there are relatively few married men in their 20s, wrote guillaume vandenbroucke, a research officer with the federal reserve bank of st. louis. the average male worker in his 20s is more likely to be single than married. today, both men and women are closing in on 30 by the time they tie the knot.\n\npeople's attitude to finance and romance also change from wedding no. 1, no. 2 and no. 3, said randy kessler, who wrote the book, divorce: protect yourself, your kids, and your future, and also practices family law in atlanta, ga. people marry more for romance than for finance. however, for a second or third marriage, people may be looking for financial security, he said. despite being a divorce lawyer, he describes himself as a romantic.\n\nof course, some men are stay-at-home husbands of leisure rather than hard-working stay-at-home dads. here are just a few headlines gleaned from letters this writer has received from women with deadbeat husbands: my husband works part-time, has no credit and doesn't pay any bills, my husband can't get a loan — his bad credit rating is ruining our marriage, and my husband grew up dirt poor and doesn't believe in insurance or banks, yet he racked up $7,000 on my credit card.\n\nwomen increasingly earn more than their husbands, but they find another glass ceiling at home. columbia pictures/courtesy everett collection\n\nmen's egos may not fare so well when their wives earn more\n\nat the other end of the spectrum, it may not behoove men to brag about their earning power before marriage. men who lead a flashy lifestyle are regarded as being more interested in short-term hook-ups or affairs than marriage, according to a 2018 study by daniel kruger, a faculty associate at the university of michigan and jessica kruger, a clinical assistant professor at the university at buffalo in new york, and published in the academic journal evolutionary psychological science.\n\nin the study, two groups of undergraduate students rated two fictional men on their perceived dating and parenting skills, interest in relationships and attractiveness to others. both men had the same budget, but frugal dan said spent his $20,000 on a car for reliability, while flashy dave said he spent $15,000 on his car and used $5,000 to pimp his ride with larger wheels, a paint job and a sound system. men have a greater tendency to conspicuously display their wealth, the researchers wrote.\n\nwriter julia baird has another, less flattering, theory about men's attitudes to money and marriage. she wrote in glamour magazine: oh, how fragile is the ego of a man. we must never let him feel like a bonsai in a grove of california redwoods — no, he must always see himself as a towering tree, magnificent in comparison with his female partner. when she was writing a biography of queen victoria, baird discovered that even victoria was afraid her beloved albert would feel emasculated.\n\ntimes may be changing from the 1800s, albeit at a slower rate than some married couples would like. one recent study in the journal demography by patrick ishizuka, a postdoctoral fellow at cornell university's cornell population center, found that couples are more likely to set up a life together when they earn similar incomes. and when each partner in a cohabiting couple or marriage earn similar amounts of money, they're actually less likely to get separated.\n\n couples are more likely to set up a life together when they earn similar incomes. that suggests that younger couples place a value on equal status. \n\nhe analyzed the census bureau's survey of income and program participation from 1996 to 2013 to test alternative theories of how money and work affect whether cohabiting couples marry or separate. the economic foundations of a happy union do not just lie in a man's ability to be a good provider, he found.\n\nwhat's more, couples with higher and more equal earnings are significantly less likely to separate. ishizuka's study supports the marriage bar theory, which contends that the closer a couple is to reaching the economic standards associated with marriage — like saving enough to buy a house and maintain a lifestyle to which they have become accustomed (or to which they would like to become accustomed) — the more likely they are to get married.\n\ngender politics takes a back seat to an uncertain economy\n\nuncertain economic times and age bring a dose of realism to gender politics at home. more than half of americans say they want a partner who provides financial security more than head over heels love, according to a recent survey by merrill edge, an online discount brokerage and division of bank of america merrill lynch bac, -0.29% . contrary to research by pew and others, this sentiment is held in almost equal measure by men and women (54% and 57%).\n\n uncertain times may impact people's priorities. some 54% of men and 57% of women say they want a partner who provides financial security over love. \n\nage played a factor too: generation z (born between 1996 and 2010) is the only cohort to choose love (54%). merrill edge polled more than 1,000 people aged 18 to 40 with investable assets between $20,000 and $250,000. for this purpose, investable assets was defined as the value of all cash, savings, mutual funds, cds, iras, stocks, bonds and all other types of investments such as a 401(k), 403(b), and roth ira, but excluding a primary home and other real-estate investments.\n\nas men and women hit 50 and their salary levels off, that may bring more perspective and humility to the role money plays in their marriage. men and women acquire more experience the longer they work and, therefore, become more valuable and productive. after 50, however, they either slow down and learn fewer new skills, economists say, or they are competing with younger, less expensive but equally skilled, employees for the same jobs.\n\nsome men are more concerned with their financial future than their egos. this 41-year-old california man, who said he's worth $1.8 million, wrote to marketwatch to ask advice about marrying a woman who is far less wealthy than he is. if our marriage does not work out, does she get half of what we have made in the time together? he asked. i have never actually mentioned details of my finances to her, but it feels like a conversation we should have.\n\nhe, for one, would be much happier if his girlfriend had a higher salary and owned more real estate and other investments. how do i explain to someone that i care about the money that i've sweated so hard over for almost two decades? he wrote. i know this may sounds selfish, and maybe i am being selfish, but i have come from absolutely nothing and i just want to keep working towards my financial goals. and now? he's bracing himself to ask his prospective wife for a prenup.
the bottle:ayate tequila, $95 (añejo), $65 (reposado)\n\nthe back story: with bacardi's acquisition of the high-end patron brand of tequila this past week, the mexican spirit has been very much in the news. but when it comes to pricey tequila, our attention of late has been focused on ayate, a brand that bowed in the u.s. last may.\n\ncall this a marriage of tequila and wine: ayate was developed by napa valley winemaker dave phinney, who hit upon the idea of aging his tequila in barrels that previously held california chardonnay. we wanted to bring something different to the style of our tequila to truly set it apart, he says. it was an experiment and there was no guarantee.\n\nto some extent, there is a precedent for phinney's idea. patron, for example, offers gran patron burdeos, a tequila aged in bordeaux barrels. but in any case, the winemaker was satisfied with the results, saying the chardonnay element softened and rounded out the tequila while adding a plush, lush mouthfeel.\n\nwhat we think about it: in a word, this is a lovely tequila. it retains the signature vegetal quality of the spirit (tequila is made from the agave plant, after all), but adds a pleasing buttery taste and texture (that's the chardonnay talking, we suspect).\n\nhow to enjoy it: the añejo is best served neat – it's a true sipping tequila. but phinney suggests trying the reposado over ice with lime. he also says both expressions lend themselves to cocktails.
vast technical disconnects. structurally high debt loads. a huge sentiment shift. valuations bursting well above the mean. perhaps that's all a bit wonky, but you don't need to be a market technician to get the sense sven henrich is feeling bearish about things.\n\nhe's been hesitant about this market's staying power for a while now, and he went on cnbc a few days ago to offer some sobering thoughts during what turned out to be the worst week for stocks since the presidential election.\n\nhenrich doubled down over the weekend, explaining on his northman trader blog his full reasoning behind what he says is the final wave of this bull market.\n\nfrom our perspective, these markets remain completely uncorrected in any historic sense since the 2009 lows and, whether one wants to acknowledge this or not, a recession is coming, he writes. indeed a reversion to any mean, be it technical, price or sentiment or altogether may accelerate the timing of a coming recession.\n\nread his whole, chart-heavy post from saturday. but bottom line, henrich says we're moving from a buy the dip to a sell the rip environment.\n\nhe did, however, point to a strong flow of cash into etfs as potentially delivering some upside risk to his bearish final wave thesis (see our chart of the day below for more on that). this metric, of course, could cut either way.\n\nkey market gauges\n\nthat final wave might have already receded if today's early action is any indication. the dow us:ymm7 is down triple-digits and heading toward an eighth-straight losing session. the s&p us:esm7 is also down quite a bit. gold us:gcm7 and silver are catching a lift on the uncertainty. crude us:clm7 has now given way to red ink. asia adow, +1.15% , for the most part, was stuck in the red, while europe sxxp, +0.40% is losing ground to start its trading week.\n\nthe chart\n\nthe crowd is pouring into exchange-traded funds these days, clearly placing bets that the market isn't getting too toppy to deliver more profits. while it could mean there's some upside support, chris kimble of the kimble charting solutions blog posted this chart to serve as a warning:\n\nnearly three months into this year, fund flows have surpassed money invested in the past few years by a large margin, kimble wrote. could that be a good sign for stocks?

looking ahead to the next phase of life can seem pretty dreadful if you can't stand the person who you'll be spending it with.\n\nthat may be what some boomers are facing. among u.s. adults ages 50 and older, the divorce rate has roughly doubled since the 1990s, according to a pew research center report.\n\nstatistically speaking we're healthier and probably going to be living a lot longer — possibly 30 years longer — than average retirees once did. the surge in late-in-life — or gray — divorce is one possibly unintended consequence of this so-called longevity bonus.\n\nread: why your retirement may not be so horrible after all\n\nwhat's pushing gray divorce is people are living longer and they feel more entitled to living fully. they've contributed to raising children, they want an emotional journey, it's their time now, says lili vasileff, a certified financial planner and president of divorce and money matters, which specializes in divorce financial planning. they may have (decades) ahead and don't want to be unhappy anymore.\n\nthis is combined with a reduced stigma of divorce, both in terms of religion and society's attitudes. people also feel more financially stable — especially if both partners have careers. but there are some serious downsides to divorce at this stage of life.\n\ngray divorcees tend to be less financially secure than married and widowed adults, particularly among women, pew says. and living alone at older ages can be detrimental to one's financial comfort and, for men, their satisfaction with their social lives.\n\nsplitting up on the brink of retirement can be catastrophic for your finances. even if both partners have worked there tend to be uneven levels of wealth among them. women in particular may have taken time off work for family reasons and that eats into lifetime earnings.\n\nhow to invest and do good\n\ndata about retirement savings and predictions about quality of life for senior citizens in the coming decades are mostly bleak. between bumpy stock and housing markets, college tuition and scant social security, the financial picture of a typical near-retiree can be worrisome.\n\nread: it's worse than you thought: americans are drastically undersaved for retirement\n\ndespite the upbeat headline numbers for the jobs report, older people at work may feel marginalized and worry that if they lose their job, finding another high-level, well-paying job will be difficult. and it's worse if they're forced to re-enter the labor market because of the divorce.\n\nthe couple may be at that age where they just put kids through college and that has sucked up a lot of family assets and now one of those spouses who hasn't been the primary breadwinner has to go out and build a career and they are standing behind the 8 ball, says douglas lyons, president of douglas j. lyons financial group, a certified financial planner and a certified divorce financial analyst.\n\nof course, when they were younger, the rate of divorce among the baby boomer demographic was also quite high — unprecedented, pew says — and that may be making things worse now. their marital instability earlier in life is contributing to the rising divorce rate among adults ages 50 and older today, since remarriages tend to be less stable than first marriages.\n\nand that tends to make finances even more complex when splitting up a household the second (or third) time around. there may be more than one set of kids competing for financial resources, or if the most recent marriage doesn't last very long, the spouse may not be entitled to much social security.\n\nread: divorcing after being married for decades? here's what to do\n\nwhen people get divorced they don't really understand how hard it'll be financially, lyons says. it's not 50% of 100%. there all those things you've been sharing — like utilities. it's not split down the middle.\n\nthe divorce rate for adults ages 50 and older in remarriages is double the rate of those who have only been married once, pew says. among all adults 50 and older who divorced in 2015, 48% had been in their second or higher marriage.\n\nit is vitally important that a newly divorced spouse create a financial plan to understand how their retirement plan has to change, says david haas, owner of cereus financial advisors, an investment and advisory firm in franklin lakes, n.j. lifestyles have to change and the right time to do that is immediately instead of when the money runs out.\n\nyou're invited: marketwatch is hosting a free panel discussion on the future of robot — and human — financial advice on april 5 in downtown boston. rsvp required, continuing education credit available. learn more.
for decades, beth kobliner's get a financial life has been required reading (or at least a required gift) to young adults when they have graduated from college.\n\nthe best-selling book outlines how to do adult things with money, from making a budget and renting an apartment, to starting a retirement account and learning to invest in the stock market. now a parent herself to two kids in college one in high school, kobliner is trying to reach (very) young people before they leave the nest with her latest book, released this month, make your kid a money genius — even if you're not.\n\nkobliner gives parents tools and tips to make kids — even as young as preschoolers — comfortable with money and ways to make them savvy spenders and savers. most important, she says, is being able to comfortably talk about money.\n\nauthor beth kobliner ben baker\n\nmarketwatch: you are famous in the personal finance world for teaching young adults about money. why did you see a need for this book?\n\nbeth kobliner: i wrote get a financial life 20 years ago, because when i was in my 20s and 30s friends were asking me this advice. now i've been a parent three times over and more often i'm hearing from people at all economic and education levels that they have a hard time talking to their kids about money. you know how to talk about sex, death, substance abuse, but money seems to be a taboo topic. parents are hesitant because they don't feel confident about their own abilities.\n\nwhen my father was a kid in school, personal finance lessons were part of math class, in the '60s it was part of home economics. now, most states don't require personal finance lessons, and only 20% of teachers feel comfortable talking about it.\n\ndon't miss: only five states require high-school students to take a class about money\n\n[kobliner was on president obama's advisory council on financial capability and helped create the website money as you grow, which gives parents and caregivers resources for teaching personal finance lessons to kids. the site was later adopted by the consumer financial protection bureau.]\n\nkobliner: the popularity of the money as you grow website made me realize this is a topic parents were hungry to learn about. it encompasses so many areas: behavioral economics, personal finance advice and social psychology.\n\nmarketwatch: why is it so important to reach young children? is college graduation age too late?\n\nkobliner: this isn't a parenting trend or something you can be too late for, or too early. when i was working on the president's council the most popular age group people were interested in was 3 to 5. this is something parents want to handle in a big way. through good and bad economic times, it's important for parents to equip their kids with financial literacy.\n\nmarketwatch: parents want to teach their kids about money, but they struggle to do so. why is it so hard?\n\nkobliner: parents sometimes feel guilty about not giving kids what their friends might have. that's nothing to feel guilty about. by teaching them about the value of money and hard work and what things cost, they listen and absorb it, and it becomes part of who they are.\n\nsending a kid out into the world without this knowledge is like giving a kid a car without driver's ed.\n\nmarketwatch: is this the kind of training they need instilled in them at a younger age? say please and thank you, share your toys and tuck away a portion of your allowance?\n\nkobliner: exactly. it is funny that we have these golden rules, they help to make good behavior a habit and keep expectations consistent.\n\nalso see: this simple, but surprising, thing will improve your kid's grades\n\nmarketwatch: speaking of allowance, it's a very hot topic these days. should you give your child an allowance?\n\nkobliner: the allowance question plagues parents. having basic household chores is important, certain things should be expected. but whether you pay them just for those jobs or just one-off jobs is up to the parent. just be consistent.\n\nread: 5 mistakes parents make when giving kids an allowance\n\nmarketwatch: what are the most important things parents can teach their kids about money?\n\nkobliner: don't spend money you don't have. if they want something that's off the grid but they really want it, you can talk about what it costs and how much of their money they need to save for it and show them how to do that, with allowance or taking on extra jobs. as adults they need to be able to live a lifestyle they can afford.\n\nhard work is the key to success.\n\nsave. saving is the holy grail of being a money genius.\n\ngiving back makes you happier. give a part of your allowance to charity. it plays into a young child's values, it starts a lot of helpful conversations and it's a good thing to do.\n\nmarketwatch: are there any hard-and-fast rules for parents about money?\n\nkobliner: don't lie to your kids about money. but don't tell them everything — and keep it age appropriate. parents should keep a unified front and avoid fights about money in front of kids. even if you and your partner feel differently, don't talk about those differences in front of your kids. money fights are a big reason for marriage breakups.\n\nstock market moderation. if older kids are interested in the stock market, that's great, but also get into a discussion about index funds and etfs. investment vehicles that focus on reducing taxes and fees are really the smartest bets.\n\ndon't bribe kids. nearly half of all parents bribe their kids to be better in school. studies show cash payments don't improve scores. you don't get the benefit of the hard work. they should be doing it anyway. as a parent you have to ask yourself: how much are you willing to let them go and suffer the consequences without intervening?

my wife and i both work, and we're trying to figure out when each of us will retire. what are the advantages and disadvantages of retiring together or at different times? how do you manage retirement when one spouse is still working?\n\nthere is, of course, no single correct answer when it comes to timing retirement. but here are several points to consider:\n\n• retiring at the same time tends to work better. most couples, by definition, navigate big changes in their lives together: relocating, starting a family, choosing (and changing) career paths. retirement, of course, is a very big change. if one spouse suddenly is staying home, it can throw a marriage out of whack.\n\ntake something as simple as housework. when one spouse continues to work while the other retires, the working spouse may expect the latter to take on more responsibility for cleaning, running errands and cooking. but the retired spouse may balk at suddenly becoming a full-time homemaker. retiring together can help minimize such complications.\n\n• except when it doesn't. yes, some spouses who retire at the same time struggle with new routines and setting new boundaries. but that's usually because they failed to take time before retiring to address several fundamental questions. among them: what's our vision of later life? how do we plan to fill our days? what activities and interests will we pursue as a couple and individually?\n\nthere is also one specific instance in which retiring at the same time can cause problems. it stems from the fact that men and women often view decisions about retirement through different lenses, says deborah b. smith, a professor of sociology at the university of missouri-kansas city.\n\nto be specific, when a husband retires, it is frequently an individual decision: his career has run its course, or he has reached a particular age or goal. yes, he might discuss the decision with his wife, but such chats are more likely to occur after he has made up his mind, or all but made up his mind.\n\nwhen a woman retires, by contrast, it's more likely to be a family decision, smith says. a husband expects the wife to leave work because he is doing so, or a family member (usually an aging parent) requires care.\n\nin short, if a wife is pulled from her job or career before she might be ready to leave, strains are all but inevitable.\n\n• negotiating how a single retirement might work. of course, many spouses can't, or don't want to, retire at the same time. layoffs, health problems, working longer to qualify for a full pension or to beef up a nest egg, a spouse who simply loves her/his job—any number of issues can translate into differing retirement dates.\n\nif that's the case, the best way to manage retirement when one spouse is still working, again, is to talk about this transition—what it might look like and how it might work—before it takes place. what does each spouse expect from the new arrangement? how will roles and responsibilities shift? how will spending patterns and the household budget change? (that's a big one.) does the retired spouse want to travel alone?\n\nideally, a situation where one spouse continues to work will yield some benefits: a steady paycheck; medical care (if health insurance remains in effect); increased social security payments (at some point in the future); and lessons from the retired spouse about how to navigate the transition from work to life after the office.\n\nsocial security spousal benefits\n\ni'm 72 and filed for social security at age 62. my wife, who is still working, will soon turn 66. can she take a 50% spousal benefit and continue to work without any penalties? would her payout be based on my full-age benefit or the reduced benefit i get for early retirement? and will her benefit continue to increase until she reaches 70?\n\ngiven that your wife was born before jan. 2, 1954, she is able to file a restricted application at age 66. that means she can apply for just a spousal benefit now and switch to her benefit (based on her earnings history) at some point in the future. (note: this particular claiming strategy has been eliminated for people born on or after the above date.)\n\nher spousal benefit will be equal to half the benefit you would have received at your full retirement age. meanwhile, her benefit — again, the one based on her earnings history — will continue to grow until she reaches age 70. and, if she continues to work, she won't be penalized. social security's earnings test, in which benefits can be reduced if a person is collecting a salary and social security at the same time, no longer applies when a person reaches her/his full retirement age.\n\nand finally…a follow-up to volunteer vacations…\n\nin a recent column we invited readers to tell us about some of their favorite experiences that combine travel and volunteer work. among the recommendations:\n\n• habitat for humanity. a number of readers told us they worked with this venerable organization, building homes in the u.s. as well as overseas.\n\n• african impact. offers opportunities to work in african communities (education, construction, health care) and help conserve the continent's wildlife.\n\n• great shape inc. organizes humanitarian projects in the caribbean, with a focus on education and health care.\n\n• wilderness volunteers. leads about 50 weeklong service trips a year throughout the u.s. projects include backcountry trail construction, archaeological surveys, invasive-species eradication and habitat restoration.

same-sex couples have been on a wedding bonanza.\n\nas of june 2017, over 1 million lgbt people in the u.s. are married to someone of the same sex, meaning there have been 547,000 same-sex marriages in the u.s. to date, up from around 491,000 a year ago, according to the williams institute for sexual orientation law and public policy at the university of california.\n\nnew data from the gallup daily tracking survey — a nationally-representative poll that includes a measure of lgbt identity — indicate that 4.3% of adults in the u.s. identify as lgbt. that translates to around 10.7 million adults overall (taking into account the u.s. census bureau calculation that there are 249 million adults in the u.s.).\n\nwedding bells have been ringing since the supreme court ruled in favor of same-sex marriages in june 2015, and same-sex couples have spent over $1.3 billion on their weddings, according to a report by gary gates, the recently retired distinguished scholar at the williams institute at ucla. couples who plan their weddings with the help of online services tend to spend double that, it added.\n\ngates analyzed a survey of 11,600 same-sex couples carried out by the gallup polling firm and a survey of spending released last year of over 1,400 same-sex couples by weddingwire, an online marketplace connecting couples and merchants. the average same-sex couple spends $11,000 on their wedding versus $15,000 for couples of the opposite sex.\n\ndon't miss: why house prices in gay neighborhoods are soaring\n\nthere's been a surge in same-sex weddings over the last two years. in june 2015, the u.s. supreme court struck down state-level bans on same-sex marriage by a 5-4 majority as unconstitutional and said those states don't have the right to refuse to recognize couples who have already gotten married in other states.\n\nroughly half of cohabiting same-sex couples are now married, up from 38% before same-sex marriage was legalized in all u.s. states, a separate gallup survey released last year found. the increase in same-sex couples getting married has been slightly greater (13 percentage points versus 10 points) in the 13 states that had prohibited same-sex marriage before june 2015.\n\nalso see: what supreme court's historic ruling means for same-sex couples\n\nas the backlog of couples who would have married long ago diminishes, same-sex couple weddings will probably become more similar to different-sex couple weddings in terms of size and spending and, perhaps, in their more traditional look and feel, gates says. regarding traditions, exchanges of engagement rings are on the rise among same-sex couples, he adds.\n\nthe gallup data also show a leveling off in the rate of increase for weddings of same-sex couples, gates says. again, as the backlog diminishes, the evidence suggests that it's likely that same-sex couples will marry at rates more similar to their different-sex counterparts.\n\nsince the federal defense of marriage act (doma) was repealed in a supreme court case in 2013, the number of married same-sex couples in the u.s. has doubled, the williams institute found. u.s. vs. windsor, which overturned doma, dealt with new york residents edith windsor and thea spyer, who married in canada in 2007 after 40 years together.\n\nspyer died in 2009 and windsor was required to pay $363,000 in federal estate taxes on her wife's estate. in 2013, the year that the windsor ruling was issued, gallup found 230,000 same-sex couples were married, or 21% of all same-sex couples. it has been dubbed by some commentators as the gay-marriage stimulus package.
dear moneyist,\n\ni would like to share a story from a woman's perspective. i have had three marriages and one ex-boyfriend.\n\nhusband no. 1: he somehow lost job after job. i was supporting us with everything. he got another job, then he lost that. we needed a home, so i helped us get a small farm away from all the chaos.\n\nthen he began chasing women, and finally followed one to texas. the children and i felt better with him gone. so i filed for divorce. i had to hunt him down to serve him. in court, he wanted alimony. the judge laughed him out of court. i kept everything\n\nhusband no. 2: we argued over bills.\n\n 'he began chasing women, and finally followed one to texas.' \n\nhusband no. 3: he wanted the house as he felt that me having a house unfair. he said that i should sign over everything if he was to pay any of the bills.\n\nthe boyfriend: we starting dating long-distance, we had known each other before. he had an excellent job, talked me into letting him move from seattle in 2014, so we could build a life together. i agreed. he transferred his job.\n\nrecommended: my husband grew up dirt poor and doesn't believe in insurance or banks, yet he racked up $7,000 on my credit card\n\neverything was fine for a while, but then things began to change. he complained about the bills. he was always on the computer, playing games and surfing the web. i got edgy and he noticed, so he asked me to get married, and i agreed. we opened up a joint account for property-tax savings. i deposited my paychecks, and he contributed $1,000. the balance was $6,000.\n\n 'after new year, i went to the bank and he had emptied our joint account.' \n\nin 2015, i ended up in the hospital for over a month. when i got home, one day before christmas, something was strange. he started yelling at me, and the day after christmas he walked out. after new year's, i went to the bank and he had emptied our joint account, save for $1,000. i asked why, and he said i owed him that for my half of the bills.\n\ni took him to court, he told the court that he was just renting space and owed me nothing, as he said he had come here to find a place to live. he said i owed him money for supporting us. later on, i found his new residence had been rented since december 2014. it was a quarter of a mile from our residence and he moved there with a girlfriend from seattle.\n\ndon't miss: i'm torn between helping my parents and pursuing long-term business goals to support my husband and child\n\ni have been fighting the debts he left, as he said to the courts he didn't owe anything since he was a renter with benefits, and there was no proof we were going to get married. how do you trust someone after all of this?\n\njules\n\ndear jules,\n\nthis man says he's dated one money monster. you've had four.\n\noh, boy. talk about fourth time unlucky. thank you for your letter and for sharing your story. i'm sorry you had to go through this. sometimes, the hardest thing to do is walk away from a relationship and all of the disney dreams that you imagined in those early days. love and fantasy are closely intertwined. hollywood has a lot to answer for. loving someone is a leap of faith. moving in together is a big step. marrying should never be taken lightly. and sharing your finances with your life partner is probably the biggest step of all. not everyone does and that can work out pretty swell for them. other times, there are warning signs that are worth addressing, as this man did with his girlfriend.\n\n 'marrying should never be taken lightly. and sharing your finances is probably the biggest step of all.' \n\nwere there any red flags with these men? the best thing we can hope to do when a relationship turns sour is to take the lessons from that experience and to apply it to the next one. it's useful to know what we don't want in a life partner, as much as know what we do want. perhaps you would like someone who is financially solvent, has a career that makes him happy, his own home and/or savings. make a list of what you don't want in your next partner, and a list of what you do want. be prepared to compromise on some, but not all. usually, this column recommends talking to a lawyer. in this case, a therapist may help you deconstruct your decision-making process.\n\nalso see:my dying friend wants to marry me so i can have his social security — should i do it?\n\nfew people like to talk about money. that's one plot point that's often left out of the movies about falling in love (though i do recommend gloria bell). we search for romance, but you can't build a life on that alone. how we manage our finances gives us a bird's eye view into how we manage our relationships. are they capable of long-term financial commitment? do they have an inability keep a healthy credit score? if not, why not? not everyone has the same privilege or start in life, so a high credit score is hardly the only way of measuring someone's reliability. but it may, in some circumstances, give you an indication of how responsible your prospective partner is.\n\n few people like to talk about money. that's one plot point that's often left out of the movies about falling in love. \n\nresearch suggests that a high credit score can help predict whether someone is trustworthy. similar credit scores are highly predictive of whether couples stay together, according to a 2015 paper by researchers at ucla, the brookings institution and federal reserve board, washington, d.c. initial credit scores and match quality predict subsequent credit usage and financial distress, which in turn are correlated with relationship dissolution, they wrote. credit scores reveal an individual's relationship skill and level of commitment. some folks look at finance, career and education when choosing a partner. some might regard that as shallow. others may say it's smart.\n\ndon't miss: before i give my fiancée a $7,000 diamond engagement ring, i want her to promise to bequeath it to my daughter\n\nequifax efx, -0.62% , experian expgy, +2.61% and transunion tru, -0.41% are not the only ways to judge a person's finances. it would be a shame to let three husbands and one boyfriend reduce your search for love to three digits. some other questions i would ask a prospective partner: what do you care about? that speaks to a person's career and hobbies and volunteer work. what are your friends like and how far back do they go? that helps to reveal their values and ability to sustain lifelong relationships. grifters are unlikely to have many of the latter. how do they get along with their family? also, revealing, but not everyone can choose their family.\n\n choosing a partner is one of the most important financial and emotional decisions of our lives. \n\npeople will spend months looking at real estate before they find the right home. they will spend hours scouring the web looking for the best credit card. but sometimes they will move in with someone or say yes to a proposal of marriage because they want to be loved and/or don't want to be alone. choosing a partner should be a leap of faith and be based on gut instinct, but it's also one of the most important financial and emotional decisions of our lives, especially if you are going to set up home together and have children. one financial adviser says, divorce is like going through a terrible recession. you know that more than most. hence, the unromantic checklist.\n\nrecommended: my husband asked me to file a joint tax return without telling me he owes back taxes\n\nhere's a curious statistic, which you can take with or without salt. two-thirds of all divorces are initiated by women, according to the national marriage project, a non-partisan initiative based at the university of virginia. one theory: child-custody laws tend to be more favorable to women. another, less generous theory: men may be more likely to cheat (although some studies suggest wives cheat on their husbands just as often as men cheat on their wives). it may be that women and men have different emotional needs in a relationship. or older women who married when the gender balance in society was less egalitarian may seek more economic independence.\n\nalso see:should two people with $1 million in debt even consider getting married?\n\nromance and finance go hand-in-hand. more than half (56%) of americans say they want a partner who provides financial security more than head over heels love (44%). that's according to a recent survey released by merrill edge bac, -0.29% . this sentiment is held in almost equal measure by both men and women (54% and 57%). generation z (born between 1996 and 2010) is the only cohort to choose love (54%) over money. interestingly, the more often people are married, the more practical they become about their partner's financial state. (jacqueline kennedy onassis reportedly said, the first time you marry for love, the second for money and the third for companionship.)\n\n here's the bottom line: if you choose the same kind of person next time, don't expect a different result. \n\ndon't allow your four previous relationships to prevent you from seeking a fifth, long-term, happy, trustworthy and reliable partner. you deserve a happy relationship. here's the good news: you have all the information you will need, if you look for it. i've outlined some possible red flags, but what are red flags for you? and, yes, there are always white flags too. perhaps it's a man with a passion and purpose beyond making (or losing) money. or, to use a job interview analogy, look for those character references that can be delivered over dinner or on a visit to his family home. here's the bad news: if you choose the same kind of person next time, don't expect a different result.\n\nif and when you find a happy relationship, we'll still be here. please tell us all about it.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
prenuptial agreements may get a bad rap in the good times, but they can soothe the complexities and hard feelings that come during a divorce.\n\nhollywood power couple brad pitt and angelina jolie confirmed they will divorce, after more than two years of marriage and 11 years together. they have six children and are worth more than $400 million as a pair, according to various news outlets.\n\nwhether they have a prenup is up for debate. a 2014 radaronline article, which was published a month after the two were married, says jolie and pitt have a prenuptial agreement that claims each will leave the marriage with what they originally entered, and that any money made during their marriage will go in a trust to be split among their children. other sources, such as hollywood life are now saying they do not. marketwatch called jolie's lawyer, but was sent to a pre-recorded message about not accepting unsolicited calls from the media.\n\nif the rumors are true that brangelina does not have a prenup, they're not alone. research from legal site avvo shows only 2% of married americans have a prenup, which dictates who gets what if a couple divorces. some boldfaced couples who forewent the prenup include russell brand and katy perry, kelsey and camille grammer, and paul mccartney and heather mills.\n\npeople are more inclined to worry about the stigma of what a prenup might mean, said nika kabiri, director of strategic insights at avvo. they prioritize that over their financial well-being.\n\nnobody walks down the aisle thinking they'll get a divorce, but creating a document that states what might happen in the event of one can do good for the two getting married, she said.\n\nyou want to prepare for the worst-case scenario, kabiri said. you want to make sure they're okay as much as if you're okay.\n\nnot everyone sees the prenup that way. they can stir up feelings of distrust or shut a spouse out of an estate. comedienne roseanne barr reportedly fired her lawyer for suggesting a prenup when she was marrying her then-husband and fellow actor tom arnold. they divorced four years later, and media reports say he walked away with a $50 million settlement.\n\nwendy o'connor, a los angeles-based marriage and family therapist, said her athlete clients often stay away from prenups. they blame superstition, saying a prenup will mean a divorce.\n\na lot of couples don't talk about prenups until after they get married, she said. it can create what you don't want to happen, which is to break up a couple.\n\ncouples and money: creating successful financial relationships\n\nthe key is to communicate and talk through finances before the big day, experts say. it is better to discuss as a pair how to best plan to live your lives financially - a prenup may be one way to do that.\n\nthe biggest myth is that there is a 'standard' prenup, dylan miles, a lawyer at miles family law and mediation in san francisco, and co-founder of financial workshop prenups with heart, said in an email. a prenup is a financial roadmap that is often very individualized.\n\nprovisions, especially those around children, can be added to the document, but a judge will determine if it holds in court, or if it will be thrown out, said joslin davis, president of the american academy of matrimonial lawyers. in other words, it is not binding.\n\nit involves a lot of thoughtful, meaningful contact - what you value and what your partner values, kabiri said. it is a lot of compromise and negotiation. i can't imagine going through that process and not learning a lot about the person you're going to marry.
if you buy into media stereotypes about millennials, you probably believe the following about the infamous generation me. they're under-employed. bummed out about work prospects. and, as a result, holed up in their parents' basements.\n\nbut thanks to an impressive surge in jobs in the past two years (which you may have missed because of the barrage of stereotypes), many millennials are actually hitting their stride in life.\n\nnow, as they enter their prime spending years, the implications could be big for the economy. in short, millennials may help the economy grow faster than many analysts think, says james paulsen, economist and market strategist at wells capital management.\n\ntheir newfound employment strength will also help companies that cater to their needs and lifestyles — such as tv-streaming company netflix inc. nflx, -1.96% , coffee chain starbucks inc. sbux, -1.49% , a small cosmetics company called e.l.f. beauty inc. elf, +0.04% and seven others i mention below. home builders may finally get a burst of growth from millennials, though that remains to be seen.\n\nfirst, the facts, as stereotypes die hard.\n\nsince january 2014, employment among millennials (25- to 34-year-olds) grew 7%, to 33.9 million. that was far more than the overall 4.6% growth in the number of workers in the economy, to 151.9 million. here's another way to put it: millennials got 33% of the 6.74 million new jobs added, even though they account for only 22.4% of the number of people working. in contrast, employment among 35- to 54-year-olds was flat. boomers, ages 55 and up, saw 9% job growth.\n\nprobably as a result of the jobs gains, consumer confidence among millennials continued to surge in the past year, even as it flagged among boomers. this bodes well for our economy, which is two-thirds driven by consumer spending.\n\nboth of those trends are definitely a plus for the economy, says chris christopher, director of consumer economics at ihs global insight, an economics research and forecasting firm. especially as the millennials start getting married, they are going to have children and that will add even more spanning, he says.\n\none qualifier here is that millennials have a lot of student debt. but this headwind will probably diminish with time, as people tend to pay off most of their student debt in about 10 years, and as their employment situations continue improve, says samuel sturgeon, of demographic intelligence. student debt becomes less oppressive over time because people pay it down, and because they get more established in their careers.\n\nhere are 10 companies that should benefit from robust job growth among millennials, generally defined as people born between 1982 and 1994. (fun fact: this means they were the first to graduate high school in the new millennium, hence their nickname.)\n\nretailers\n\ndo millennials like to shop? of course. the idea that millennials are not materialistic, i don't know where that comes from because all the data contradict it, says psychologist jean twenge, author of generation me: why today's young americans are more confident, assertive, entitled — and more miserable than ever before.\n\none problem here for investors is that millennials aren't very loyal to brands. they make a lot of purchase decisions based on research conducted online. their favorite brand is what their smartphone tells them is the best product at the moment, says scott galloway, a marketing professor at new york university's stern school of business.\n\na way around this is to own amazon.com inc. amzn, -1.59% and its de facto partner, fedex corp. fdx, +0.25% , says trip miller, managing partner of memphis-based gullane capital partners. these companies also play into the millennial desire for instant gratification.\n\nbut millennials do favor certain brands, maintains veteran retail analyst howard davidowitz of davidowitz & associates, a retail consulting and investment banking firm in new york. he cites nike inc. nke, -0.19% and under armour inc. ua, +0.62% .\n\n'non linear' companies\n\nmillennials are a non linear generation, says galloway. they want what they want, when they want it. especially media, he says. they want to consume media on their own terms. they hate the idea of letting networks or cable companies decide when a movie or sitcom is available. the investment play here? netflix is the brand that embodies this trend, says galloway.\n\nstarbucks\n\na recent look at millennial spending by toronto-dominion bank found that they buy coffee way more than other age groups. our grandparents liked scotch. our parents liked marijuana. and millennials are addicted to coffee, quips galloway.\n\nthis probably helps explain the success of starbucks. that success should continue because of millennial job strength, which gives them more disposable income to spend on $4 cups of coffee. starbucks also plays into the millennial desire for personalized service, says twenge, given the enormous variety of coffee available, and the attention to service inside starbucks shops.\n\nhome builders\n\njob gains for millennials could soon translate into noticeably stronger housing activity, says paulsen, at wells capital management.\n\nsturgeon, an expert in marriage and fertility trends at demographic intelligence, agrees, because a big chunk of millennials are moving into the peak years for marriage and home buying. thus, he forecasts an increase in millennial home ownership ahead. you can't delay having a family forever, he says.\n\ntwenge, author of generation me, says credible survey research (there's a lot of garbage research on millennials) supports the case for a millennial boost for the housing market. millennials really do want to own their own homes. they state this in survey research more so than boomers did at the same age, she says.\n\nif this thesis is right, it could help home builders like beazer homes usa inc. bzh, -3.86% , which i have recently suggested in my stock newsletter, brush up on stocks. i like this company, in part, because of robust insider buying.\n\nnot all analysts agree. i don't buy it, says galloway, the marketing professor at nyu stern. he cites a preference among millennials for renting over owning, and a desire to avoid being tied down. a lot of these kids saw their parents' dream of home ownership turn into the american nightmare, he says, a reference to the housing and credit meltdown that started in 2008. they have basically called bullsh-- on the american dream.\n\nif you go with galloway on this one, then consider penske automotive group inc. pag, -2.88% , which offers moving-truck rentals, and amerco uhal, +0.42% , which offers u-haul truck rentals and storage facilities, says miller, at gullane capital partners. this generation is more mobile than any generation before. they switch jobs. they switch careers. they want to see the world.\n\na 'have it your way' company\n\na 2014 survey by elite daily found that millennials like to engage with brands on social networks, and they like to co-create products with companies.\n\nthat comes back to individualism, agrees twenge, author of generation me. this gets to the psychology of the generation, she says. i don't want you to tell me what to do or buy. i want a role in the process. i am important. listen to me are all key themes for millennials, she says.\n\na tiny cosmetics company i recently wrote about is all over this one. it's called e.l.f. beauty. it launches successful cosmetics products by culling ideas from millennials on social media. this tactic helps explain the company's phenomenal 32% sales growth last year. cleverly, the company saves on marketing and product development costs in the process. you can read more about this millennial cosmetics play here.\n\nat the time of publication, michael brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. brush has suggested nflx, sbux and bzh in his stock newsletter, brush up on stocks. brush is a manhattan-based financial writer who has covered business for the new york times and the economist group, and he attended columbia business school in the knight-bagehot program.
it's time to blow off some steam and watch something stupid.\n\nmarch marks a full year since we've all been cooped up due to the pandemic, leaving many of us tethered to our tvs to an unhealthy degree. so after such a stressful year, consumers deserve to splurge a bit, and treat themselves to some brain sorbets.\n\nmarch is bringing a lot of programming that may not be thought-provoking or even particularly good, but should at least be dumb fun (cough cough godzilla vs. kong). because sometimes you just don't want to think too hard.\n\nas we've previously mentioned, consumers can take full advantage of cord-cutting by churning — that's the strategy of adding and dropping streaming services each month — and all it takes is good planning. keep in mind that a billing cycle starts when you sign up, not necessarily at the beginning of a month.\n\nand heads up: disney+ will raise its price by $1, to $7.99 a month, starting in march; meanwhile, netflix raised the price on its most popular plan by $1 as well, to $13.99, in february. but consumers who dig around can take advantage of free trials and cost-saving bundles, though those deals won't last forever.\n\nfree and bundled possibilities aside, when it's time to decide where your subscription dollars should go, what's worth streaming is here to help. we rate each major streaming service every month as a play, pause or stop, similar to investment analysts' ratings of buy, hold and sell, and pick the best content to help you make your monthly decisions.\n\nhere's a look at what's coming to the various streaming services in march 2021, and what's really worth the monthly subscription fee.\n\ndisney+ ($7.99 a month)\n\nwandavision may be wrapping up (the finale is march 5), but disney+ has another surefire marvel hit in the works, with the falcon and the winter soldier (march 19). for those complaining wandavision was too slow and introspective, though you could try to appreciate a slow burn, the six-episode falcon looks to be a much more straightforward buddy comedy/action series. anthony mackie and sebastian stan star as the title characters, with the action picking up after the events of avengers: endgame. what it's actually about is tightly under wraps, but safe to say, the two heroes will be trying to find their footing and carry on captain america's shield in a post-steve rogers world.\n\nalso: here's everything coming to disney+ in march 2021\n\ndisney dis, +0.51% is also streaming one of its big movies of 2021, raya and the last dragon (march 5), starting the same day it hits theaters, for an additional $30 fee (just as they did with mulan last fall). the film, about a girl determined to track down the last living dragon in order to save her kingdom from monsters, looks spectacular. if you have kids, it might be worth a splurge ($30 is probably cheaper than movie tickets and snacks for a family), but keep in mind it'll almost certainly be available on regular disney+ for no extra fee within a few months. so if you're patient you can save that money.\n\nwho's disney+ for? families with kids, and hardcore star wars and marvel fans. for those not in those groups, its library can be lacking. remember, the monthly price will rise to $7.99 in march.\n\nplay, pause or stop? play. the end of wandavision and the beginning of the falcon and the winter soldier alone are worth the price. plus the muppet show, old episodes of the simpsons, and much more? yeah, worth it.\n\nhbo max ($14.99 a month)\n\nhbo max has two movies that will absolutely overshadow everything else it has in march: zack snyder's justice league (march 18) and godzilla vs. kong (march 31).\n\nthe long-rumored recut of 2017's justice league has fanboys drooling. (tldr: snyder, the film's original director, dropped out following his daughter's death; joss whedon took over production and the movie flopped. read more about it here.) after an online campaign, hbo max gave the go-ahead for snyder to recreate his original dark and gritty vision, reportedly adding about $70 million in new special effects and doubling the length of the film, to four hours. rarely in hollywood history has such an ambitious project been pulled off. snyder has his hardcore fans, as well his share of critical detractors, but whether or not the movie will be any good is almost beside the point: justice league will be an unabashed spectacle and a victory for creative control that will at the very least make it worth a look.\n\nspeaking of bashing and spectacles, two of cinema's most iconic oversized creatures face off once again in godzilla vs. kong, streaming on max the same day it hits theaters. who's starring in it? cgi monsters and who cares who else. it looks ridiculous and overblown and completely stupid and completely awesome. not every movie needs to be important. as long as it causes grown adults to giggle like 8-year-olds, it will have served its purpose.\n\ndon't forget, first-run warner bros. movies are only available to stream for a month, so judas and the black messiah will be leaving march 14 and tom & jerry departs march 28, while godzilla will be gone at the end of april.\n\nat&t's t, +0.53% hbo max doesn't have a ton of other new stuff in march, with highlights being the sexually-fluid teen dramedy genera+ion (march 11); tina (march 27), a documentary about the legendary singer tina turner, featuring interviews and little-seen archive footage; and another doc, persona: the dark truth behind personality tests (march 4), about the history behind the famous mbti tests.\n\nfor more: here's what's coming to hbo max in march 2021, and what's leaving\n\nbut the single best new thing to watch on max could be the knick, the brilliant two-season series about a drug-addicted doctor in 1900s new york city, starring clive owen and directed by steven soderberg. it joined max in february, along with fellow cinemax alum banshee (a brilliant celebration of gratuitous violence in its own right). they're both bloody, cringe-inducing fun, in very different ways.\n\nwho's hbo max for? hbo fans and movie lovers.\n\nplay, pause or stop? play. treat yourself to some seriously over-the-top entertainment. and if explosions, superpowers and blood-and-guts aren't your speed, there's still hbo's deep library of excellent shows. among newcomers, try the addictive swedish drama beartown, the critically praised aids drama it's a sin or the whimsical dark comedy pushing daisies, which were all recently added to max.\n\nnetflix ($7.99 a month for basic, $13.99 standard or $17.99 premium)\n\nmake no mistake, a year of pandemic-related production delays are finally catching up with netflix nflx, +0.08% . but with a dearth of original scripted series ready to go in its pipeline, the streaming giant is filling in the gaps with docuseries and foreign-language series. that's not necessarily a bad thing (see: january's surprise french hit, lupin).\n\nmarch's lineup has a plethora of docuseries on tap, including biggie: i got a story to tell (march 1), which examines the career of the late rapper the notorious b.i.g.; murder among the mormons (march 3), about a string of salt lake city bombings in the 1980s; and operation varsity blues: the college admissions scandal (march 17), featuring dialogue from fbi wiretaps and sure-to-be-cheesy reenactments of the celebrity-laden scandal.\n\non the less salacious side, there's last chance u: basketball (march 10), which delves into players battling adversity at east los angeles college, as the emmy-winning series shifts its focus from high-stakes junior-college football to basketball.\n\nthere's also moxie (march 3), an appealing-looking movie directed by amy poehler about a teenage girl who's inspired by her mom's riot grrrl past to publish a 'zine exposing sexism at her school; yes day (march 12), a family comedy where the kids get to make the rules for a day, starring jennifer garner; waffles + mochi (march 16), a kids cooking show from michelle obama; and marriage or mortgage (march 10), a reality series that sounds like a tlc/hgtv mashup, where couples choose between splurging on a fairy-tale wedding or a dream home.\n\nread more: here's everything coming to netflix in march 2021 — and what's leaving\n\namong foreign-language series and movies, there's bombay begums (march 8), a soapy drama about a diverse group of ambitious women in india; sky rojo (march 19), a drama about a trio of women on the run in spain, from the creators of money heist; cabras de peste (march 18), a brazilian action/comedy about two mismatched cops who join forces to fight a gang; and caught by a wave (march 25), an italian teen romance.\n\non the sillier side, there's also bad trip (march 26), a gross-out prank movie from eric andre; the supernatural mystery series the irregulars (march 26), about sherlock holmes' young proteges; and nailed it! double trouble (march 26), as the baking-disaster show highlights teams of hapless bakers.\n\nalso getting a lot of recent buzz is the bonkers erotic thriller behind her eyes, which dropped in february. it's…well, let's just say the ending will leave you asking wtf, for better or worse.\n\nwho's netflix for? fans of buzz-worthy original shows and movies.\n\nplay, pause or stop? play. while netflix suddenly doesn't seem so essential, it still has a vast supply of shows that are juuust good enough. in a volume game, netflix is gonna win every time.\n\nhulu ($5.99 a month or $11.99 with no ads)\n\nonce again, hulu's best selling point is its deep library of shows, old and new. there's not much on tap in march in terms of originals, but most of what there is sounds decent enough.\n\nthe very adult animated comedy solar opposites (march 26), from two of the creators of rick and morty, returns for a second season as a family of aliens remains stranded on earth. it's first season was a pleasant — if sick and twisted — surprise last year, so it's a welcome addition.\n\nmore iffy is the action movie boss level (march 5), a violent, satirical shoot-em-up about a secret agent reliving the same day over and over (and dying every time) that sounds like a groundhog day/john wick/edge of tomorrow mashup. it looks like dumb fun and it's got a good cast, but the biggest name — mel gibson as the bad guy — is the most problematic. with gibson's extensive history of repulsive anti-semitic, misogynistic and racist comments, i'm not sure he's who anyone wants to see on their screen these days.\n\nmore: here's what's coming to hulu in march 2021, and what's leaving\n\nhulu is also adding kid 90 (march 12), a documentary about child stars in the '90s, from '90s child star soleil moon frye, as well as season 3 of the sons of anarchy spinoff mayans m.c. (streaming a day after episodes air on fx, starting march 17), and genuis: aretha (march 22), the latest installment of the natgeo series, which aretha franklin's family has disavowed and urged fans to boycott.\n\nwho's hulu for? tv lovers. there's a deep library for those who want older tv series, and next-day streaming for many current network and cable shows.\n\nplay, pause or stop? pause and think it over. with no marquee releases, you might be better off diving into hulu's library, featuring everything from classics (cheers, golden girls) to current hits (superstore, modern family) to golden globe nominees such as nomadland, the great, palm springs and normal people.\n\namazon prime video ($12.99 a month)\n\nit's a light month for amazon prime video, with eddie murphy's sequel coming 2 america (march 5) the biggest-name debut, by far.\n\nmurphy and arsenio hall will reprise their roles — as well as a multitude of other roles, in heavy makeup — as prince (now king) akeem and his loyal sidekick, semmi, from the 1988 comedy coming to america. this time around akeem returns to queens to track down his long-lost son — and surprise crown prince of the fictional african kingdom of zamunda. the original is a comedy classic. do we really need a sequel 30-plus years later? probably not. will it be good? maybe not, but it should at least be fun to see those characters again.\n\nfor more: here's what's coming to amazon prime video in march 2021\n\namazon amzn, +1.42% also has a new animated series, invincible (march 26), based on the robert kirkman comic about the teenage son of a superhero trying to figure out his superpowers and live up to his father's legacy. steven yeun and j.k. simmons provide the voices. be warned, it's ultra-violent and not for kids. think the boys meets teen titans.\n\nwho's amazon prime video for? movie lovers, tv-series fans who value quality over quantity.\n\nplay, pause or stop? pause. coming 2 america might be worth it, fingers crossed. if not, there still amazon's deep library to fall back on. catch up on the small axe movies, or the expanse, or one mississippi.\n\napple tv+ ($4.99 a month)\n\napple tv+ doesn't have much new in march, though its one current series — season 2 of for all mankind, which debuted in february and drops new episodes every friday — is excellent. as mentioned last month, the alt-history space drama has improved in its second season, and is one of the best shows currently airing, anywhere.\n\nthe only true march debut is cherry (march 12), a movie starring tom holland (marvel's current spider-man) as an army veteran traumatized by ptsd and hooked on drugs. it sounds like oscar-bait, but the reviews are terrible, so it's probably safe to skip.\n\nwho's apple tv+ for? it offers a little something for everyone, but not necessarily enough for anyone.\n\nplay, pause or stop? stop. it's tempting to say for all mankind alone is worth a subscription, but to get your money's worth, you'd be better off waiting until it ends and binging the series all at once with a one-month subscription. but if you've bought an apple aapl, -0.65% device in the past year, take advantage and watch for free. there's enough there to explore.\n\npeacock (free basic level, premium for $4.99 a month with ads, or $9.99 a month with no ads)\n\nnot a lot coming to comcast's cmcsa, -0.93% peacock either, though season 3 of the stephen king crime drama mr. mercedes, starring brendan gleeson, will drop march 4, after originally airing on the audience network in 2019.\n\nother new additions include syfy's extraterrestrial dramedy resident alien (march 12), the true-crime doc john wayne gacy: devil in disguise (march 25) and new episodes of the amber ruffin show every friday. and wrestling fans will be happy that wwe network will start airing on peacock starting march 21.\n\npeacock also quietly added briarpatch in february, and it's well worth a look. rosario dawson stars in the pulpy, noir-ish mystery set in a sweltering texas border town.\n\nsam esmail (mr robot, homecoming) executive-produced briarpatch, and it has all the esmail hallmarks — a slick, cinematic look, where things the casual viewer doesn't usually notice, like lighting, sound and cinematography, are so perfect that they leap to the forefront. briarpatch was canceled after just one season on usa, but it wraps everything up nicely, with no loose ends — it's a fun watch.\n\nwho's peacock for? if you like network and basic-cable tv and don't mind ads, the free version of peacock is great. if you're eligible for premium through a comcast or cox cable subscription, it's also a perfectly fine free addition.\n\nplay, pause or stop? stop. by all means check out the free version, but the paid tier will be unnecessary for most people (with the exception of soccer fans, since peacock premium is the exclusive streaming home of the english premier league).\n\nparamount+ ($5.99 a month with ads, $9.99 no ads)\n\nupdated to reflect two tiers of pricing.\n\ncbs all access officially becomes paramount+ on march 4, with a legitimately impressive lineup of 30,000 episodes and 2,500 movies. it's aiming to debut 36 original series this year, including revivals of frasier, criminal minds and reno 911!, as well as series adaptations of movies ranging from flashdance to love story to fatal attraction and a grease prequel. there are also more star trek spinoffs in the works, rupaul's drag race all stars, a beavis and butt-head movie and revivals of everything from the animated rugrats to mtv standbys such as road rules and behind the music. there's also live sports, news and movies — such as top gun: maverick and mission: impossible 7 — coming 35-45 days after they first hit theaters. basically, if you're a gen-xer with any hint of nostalgia, paramount+ will have a show for you.\n\nkeep in mind, a $4.99-a-month tier will launch in june, with ads and lacking the live-tv features of the pricier tier.\n\nhowever, none of those will be ready for the launch. the best you're gonna get march 4 is the spongebob movie: sponge on the run; a spongebob spinoff, kamp koral: spongebob's under years; and the real world: homecoming, a multi-episode reunion featuring the cast of the real world season 1 in new york.\n\nwho's paramount+ for? gen-x cord cutters who miss live sports (especially march madness and uefa champions league soccer) and familiar broadcast and cable shows.\n\nplay, pause or stop? stop. there's a ton of programming, but nothing terribly compelling. at this point, it's just a pricier peacock. also keep in mind viacomcbs viac, -4.05% is still licensing its shows to other streamers, so you can still watch things like criminal minds on netflix and survivor on hulu.\n\ndiscovery+ ($4.99 a month, $6.99 ad-free)\n\ndiscovery+ continues to vex me. its selection of pleasant, easy-on-the-brain background shows is fantastic. but is it worth paying for shows that are basically just there to keep you company at night while you fold laundry or scroll through your phone?\n\nthe service does have a ton of new shows in march, including a massive slate of true-crime docuseries, for those who are into that.\n\nfor non-murderinos, the best bets look to be cocktails and tall tales with ina garten and melissa mccarthy (march 26), a special that sounds special in every possible way (seriously, all four of those things sound delightful); pig royalty (march 16), a docuseries about prize pigs in texas; and season 2 of race across the world (march 2), an adventure series where competitors have to get to a certain spot on the globe without using a phone or flying.\n\nwho's discovery+ for? cord cutters who miss their unscripted tv or who are really, really into 90-day fiance.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy 93-year-old father has dementia. he married his second wife, who is 91, four years ago. he did not make a last will and testament, and cannot legally make one now because of his dementia. he is not expected to live much longer because of heart problems. my sister and i are concerned about what will happen to his estate after he dies.\n\nalso see:'i'm sick to death of him.' my 70-year-old boyfriend sits in front of the tv and has no savings — is it too late to tell him to leave?\n\nif he passes away, how much of a right does she have over his property and money, given that they have only been married four years? she says she is in charge of everything and we have no rights to anything. is this true? she has included her friends, not us, in helping her with decisions made about dad. i'm lost and don't know what to do.\n\nmarcia m. in south carolina\n\ndear marcia,\n\nif you believe your stepmother is not acting in your father's best interests, you should seek legal advice. it does not appear that there is any financial or elder abuse happening here — at least from what you say in your letter — so you may wish to wait until your father passes away to take action. in that case, you could contest your stepmother as the administrator of your father's estate.\n\nthe probate court appoints an administrator, usually the deceased's spouse or his/her children. you could petition the court to appoint you or your sister, or an independent third party. in most states, you have a limited amount of time to act — typically, 30 days — and it must be done in writing. you would need to provide just cause: dishonesty, incapacity. personality clashes don't count.\n\nalso see: my wife and i bailed out our son with his mortgage and car payments, and set up 529s for his kids — yet we have the daughter-in-law from hell\n\nin south carolina, the estate is divided between the spouse and surviving children if there is no will. nosal & jeter, a law firm in fort mill, s.c., says intestate laws don't apply to life-insurance proceeds; funds in an ira, 401(k) or any other retirement account; or property they own together or property to which your stepmother has the right of survivorship.\n\nultimately, your stepmother may be left with fewer assets than she anticipates. i hope you can resolve this situation and ensure that your father is comfortable during the time he has left.\n\nalso see: 'nothing is ever his fault, everyone is out to get him.' our brother inherited our late mother's home and it was repossessed. he's now in prison — do i send him money?\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
dear moneyologist,\n\none financial accomplishment my spouse and i are proud of is helping both of our two kids to finish college without any loans. they both worked hard to get substantial scholarships and worked while attending school. fast forward 10- years, and in having the family talk about finances as we age — we are retired and in our mid-60s — we let them know that we have plenty of money and will never spend it all. we're absolutely sure.\n\nneither kid has ever asked for a dime, but they have been given generous gifts over the years. we have asked them if there is anything that would help them at this time instead of waiting for an inheritance. turns out, one of our children has substantial loans not related to student debt and an iffy profession — not always working, and not always paid well despite his best efforts at loan repayment. he would like our help. our other kid, not in need of funds, is fine with this.\n\ndon't miss:i bought my 50-year-old son a trailer — but his girlfriend moved her family in\n\nwe agreed to begin paying off the loans, and have now paid off two smaller ones, totaling $25,000. now my spouse is backing off, regretting telling them about our financial situation and offering to pay loans. despite several reasoned discussions, nothing has changed. one more thing — my health is compromised and this is something i'd like to do before i am too ill. i could simply take my own funds and pay off the loans of around $50,000, but i wondered if you had other thoughts.\n\nconflicted father\n\ndear father,\n\ni don't know how much money you have in your bank account, but i take you at your word that you are comfortable. for now. one of the reasons people leave their children money in their will (rather than to a charity that will take care of your pets) is because they want the peace of mind that their kids will be all right after they're gone. these are all noble intentions. they also want them to have a better life than they had and, perhaps, reach a place of comfort earlier in life. that said, different children will have different weaknesses and strengths and will have made different mistakes.\n\namericans have reason to be concerned about whether their wealth will last. the middle class made up just 26% of incomes in 2014, down from 46% in 1979, the urban institute, a nonprofit and nonpartisan policy group, concluded. the upper middle class controlled 63% of all income in 2014, up from 30% in 1979. wealthy americans saw their incomes and net worth grow at a faster than usual rate, while others stayed the same: 81% of u.s. households had flat or falling incomes between 2005 and 2014, the mckinsey global institute, a global management company, found.\n\nalso see:my husband is a mooch — should i spend my money before we divorce?\n\nhow does this all of this affect you? you don't know what will happen tomorrow. if your son is getting himself into financial fixes and can't get out, i commend you for helping him. but you should know that this may not change him. he may make these mistakes again. and by helping him so generously now, it could even enable his future financial folly. (apologies for the unintentional alliteration.) what's more, you don't know what illness or caregiving needs you may have in the future that could cost tens of thousands of dollars for one year alone.\n\nit's always good to act as a team. i posted your question on tuesday evening in the new moneyologist facebook group and one of our readers raised an interesting question: does your wife know something you don't? it's worth considering. and even if she does not, she is trusting her instincts and believes you have gone far enough helping this one son. i assume you will deduct the money you have given him (with interest) from his final inheritance, but if this is causing discord in your marriage, or even threatens to, you already have your answer.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
ten years ago, investment bank bear stearns collapsed in a spectacular way, thanks, in part, to risky investments that tanked. it was sold, essentially for parts, at $2 per share. a mere 15 months earlier, the firm had posted record earnings and shares hit $171. translation: bear lost 99% of its value in a little more than a year.\n\nthis should have been the canary in the coal mine for the housing market collapse and 2007-09 recession. instead, an arranged marriage with j.p. morgan chase jpm, +1.65% (temporarily) satiated wall street, and the s&p 500-stock index spx, -1.48% would test all-time highs again within weeks. the real market collapse—in which major stock indexes would eventually shed 50%—was postponed until fall.\n\nstill, the 10-year anniversary of bear stearns' collapse is a good time to revisit what happened next, and the lessons we should have learned. but did we?\n\nlesson 1: if you don't understand it, don't invest in it\n\nyou might've heard that the subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent devaluation of mortgage-backed securities were big causes of the recession. but most people don't understand what that means—and that was part of the problem.\n\nbasically, a lot of people were qualifying for mortgages they couldn't afford, and some investment banks started selling risky, but high-return, bonds that were backed by those mortgages. firms like lehman brothers bet big on those bonds—even borrowing money to do so—and some investors did, too, without really understanding them or the risks involved. when homeowners began defaulting on those mortgages, the investors and banks holding the bonds lost out, too.\n\nthe lesson? if you don't understand it—or it sounds too good to be true—don't invest in it. unfortunately, that hasn't sunk in yet with all investors. take those who invested $15 million last year into an initial coin offering of plexcoins (lured, the sec says, by the promise of a 13-fold profit in less than a month) and a reported $600 million into arisecoins—both of which were later halted and called out as scams by u.s. regulators.\n\nwhat to do in your 50s to build wealth for your retirement\n\nlesson 2: don't buy just because you can\n\none reason people found themselves carrying unaffordable mortgages was because banks were aggressively pushing large loans. (the bigger the loan, the more they make in interest and fees.) while that practice has declined somewhat, banks may still approve you for a mortgage amount that's more than you budgeted. don't bite. (a good rule of thumb: keep total mortgage payments to 35% or less of your monthly gross income.)\n\non this score, too, it looks like we have more learning to do. the average size of a home loan reached an all-time high last year, surpassing the hefty loans of the housing bubble. and first-time home buyers put down an average of just 6%. most financial planners recommend aiming for a down payment of at least 10%. that's particularly important in the event that the value of your home falls (as many home buyers learned the hard way during the 2007-09 recession).\n\nlesson 3: stick with it\n\nlong-term investing is the key to building wealth over time, so it pays to stick with it—but it can be a bumpy ride, as it was throughout the 2007-09 recession. for example, if you had $142,000 invested in an s&p 500-stock index fund in mid-may 2008, it was worth just $75,000 that november. ouch. it took some time, but if you'd held tight until september 2012, you'd recouped those losses. and if you let it ride until today? you'd have more than $260,000.\n\nit seems like many investors have embraced this lesson. a bankrate survey found that just 6% of americans sold investments because of february's market correction—and 15% considered it an opportunity to buy stocks while they were cheaper.\n\nlesson 4: diversify\n\nbefore the 2007-09 recession, so much money was being made on wall street and in banking that investments in the financial sector seemed like a sure bet. except there's no such thing—which is why diversification is so important. spreading your money across a mix of stocks lowers the risk of your portfolio tanking when one company or sector struggles.\n\ninvestors seem to have learned this lesson, too. exchange-traded funds—low-cost investments that provide broad exposure to hundreds of stocks and thus broad diversification—have become so popular that in 2016, only one of the 15 top-traded stocks on wall street was actually a company stock—the other 14 were etfs.
dear moneyist,\n\ni have been working since my now-husband and i have been together. he has bounced from job to job and finally landed on the couch. i've pushed him to go to school, take online courses for an information technology (it) certificate, etc. we're entering year two of our marriage, and i'm completely drained. what money i received from my inheritance is all but gone.\n\ndispatches from a pandemic:i went to the grocery store in a balaclava — turns out, de blasio now says all new yorkers should wear homemade masks\n\ncoronavirus has ruined everything. my ira is a shambles due to the pandemic, and now i'm working from home. i see him every day relaxing and taking it easy while i work. i've suggested jobs with car services and food-delivery services, but to no avail. he simply refuses to work, and now he has good reason not to. what are my options? bills need to be paid. i need him to start working soon.\n\nam i asking too much now that the threat of covid-19 has shut down a lot of businesses?\n\nsincerely,\n\nfrustrated\n\ndear frustrated,\n\nyou can blame coronavirus for a lot of things.\n\nyou can blame it for social distancing, long lines outside the store, and the lack of toilet paper and hand sanitizer. you can blame it for the deaths of 8,503 people in the u.s., 65,711 deaths worldwide, and a 3,000% jump in jobless claims. we could debate how much blame lies with covid-19, plus how the lack of ventilators and available testing in the u.s., and action or lack thereof by governments around the world, have contributed. but let's not do that.\n\nyour husband was a job hopper and a couch surfer before the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed global economies, closed businesses and threatened the livelihoods and lives of millions of people. he is someone who appears to have no qualms about relying on his marriage as an atm machine, providing him with free cable, a roof over his head and a comfortable armchair to settle into. while you see the contrasts in your lifestyles and work ethics, he appears to see a square box on the wall.\n\ndispatches from a pandemic:dating during a global health crisis: this couple got coronavirus on a first date — and they've been quarantining (together) ever since\n\nunless he had a complete personality change when you got married, i'm guessing that you had a pretty good idea what you were getting before you got it. you read the description on the box and you chose to overlook it. perhaps you were convinced that the companionship and love you felt for each other would nudge him to be the best version of himself. here's the bad news: this could be the best version of himself — and if it's not, he may not be willing to show it to you or, indeed, himself.\n\nlove is not a feeling. hollywood producers and 17th-century french romantic novelists wanted us to believe that romance is an antidote to life's problems. let's hope we have a vaccine for coronavirus before next winter, assuming social distancing works, and together we burn this pandemic out. but there is no cure for what you are dealing with here. do the opposite of what millions of people who are doing as they wait this crisis out: take action. because love is an action.\n\nyour husband can tell you what you want to hear, or whisper sweet nothings in your ear to soften your resolve, or opine about the state of the world, and buy himself another week, month or year on your couch. but my guess is that when this pandemic has passed, you still won't have to go to the store for potatoes, because you will already have one big uncooked potato sitting at home on the couch. love is respect, first and foremost. a successful marriage requires that above all else.\n\nthe moneyist: 'your boss is playing god': my grocery store banned face masks for staff. how on earth can i stay safe from coronavirus now?\n\nthe good thing about extreme situations like death and divorce — and a time such as this, when the world seems to come to a standstill — is that they force our hand. if we allow them to, they can bring us new strength and perspective, the knowledge that we deserve to be happy, and the motivation to ensure that we invite positivity and good things into our lives. this is an opportunity for you to do that. tell your husband what you need to happen and, if it does not happen, you have your answer.\n\nby all means, do everything you can to make this marriage work. but he must join you in that quest. he must bring solutions, not problems. if you put his excuses for not wanting to work above your needs, you could spend a lifetime trying to fix something that doesn't really want to be fixed. do not merge your finances, do not buy property together, and do not blink and do nothing. because if you blink, it will be 22 years from now, and you will look back at this letter and wonder, what if?\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email newsletter of the moneyist columns?

a pair of technology firms—eventbrite and upwork—have taken steps toward going public in the u.s., the latest sign that more privately held, richly valued companies see the initial-public-offering market as an attractive venue for raising capital.\n\nboth of the california companies, the first, a platform for event planning and the second, a site that connects freelancers to job leads, are expected to go public in the second half of this year, said people familiar with their plans.
divorce continues to be on the rise for those approaching retirement. according pew research center; the rate of divorce for adults ages 50 plus has doubled in the past 25 years and continues to grow.\n\nread: this is why baby boomers are divorcing at a stunning rate\n\ngoing through a divorce, at any age, can be emotionally unnerving and affect your ability to think clearly. since you can't escape being involved, make every effort to be prepared for your legal counsel. a good place to start is to research your resident state laws as they relate to the dissolution of marriage. then review the following 7 considerations, for the purpose of helping you prepare yourself, prior to meeting with your divorce attorney.\n\n1. do not rely totally on your attorney. it is important that you be attentive to the process. attorneys are people, too, and they sometimes make mistakes and could inadvertently make a material omission. i am reminded of a woman whose 401(k) was not added to the total assets to be divided, because her soon-to-be ex-husband's attorney, forgot to request the information; it was left out of the settlement agreement. that is a significant oversight which could work for you or against you, depending on what side of the fence you are on.\n\n2. create an inventory of all assets, before meeting with your attorney. identify what assets are held jointly and what assets are held individually. be mindful of any inheritance received over the years that you may have co-mingled in a joint account; bring this to the attention of your attorney. generally speaking, inheritance is not subject to division and is usually considered sole and separate property. your attorney will advise you of the applicable law as it relates to the laws of your resident state and your specific situation.\n\n3. past employment records are important. create a detailed list of all present and past employers of both spouses. check with former employers, as well as current employers, for any pension money that you may be entitled to from employment that occurred during the early years of the marriage. it is not unusual to have forgotten money from a pension, profit sharing, defined benefit plan, deferred compensation plan or stock options.\n\nfor example, some 22 years ago the soon-to-be ex-spouse was a participant in an employee stock option plan (esop). the value of the shares at issue were minimal. the stock options were forgotten by both parties during the divorce preparation and proceedings. fast forward five years following the divorce, the company that initially issued the esop was sold and the esop shares paid out — they were worth $650,000.00.\n\n4. if you are entitled to alimony ask how you will be protected if there is; job loss, lowered income, disability or death. where will the resources come from to honor your agreed-upon settlement? if you are advised that there is insurance coverage; request a copy of the insurance contracts and review them carefully. consider negotiating a lump sum settlement versus monthly alimony. this one consideration could keep you from experiencing a break in your expected monthly alimony payments, should your ex-spouse fall on difficult times financially.\n\n5. life insurance. this is a very important issue. if the ex-spouse, who is responsible for making alimony payments, dies following the divorce, during the alimony payment period, it could be catastrophic financially for the recipient ex-spouse. to avoid any potential hardship for the alimony recipient, request that you be named both owner and beneficiary of the insurance contract. this will put the premium payment responsibility into your hands, thus giving you total control over the continuance of the insurance contract. the expense of the life insurance premium is usually arranged as part of the settlement agreement.\n\nif the procurement of life insurance is not possible due to health reasons, then be sure to get a satisfactory answer to this question; how will your settlement be paid in the event of the death of your ex-spouse?\n\n6. social security benefits. many divorcees are unaware that they may be eligible to collect on the social security benefit of their ex-spouse; as long as they were married for 10 years or more. it doesn't matter if your ex-spouse has had multiple marriages or is currently remarried and is collecting a retirement benefit. if each marriage lasted 10 years, then each and every ex-spouse can collect a benefit. and no, the ex-spouse will not be made aware of anyone collecting based on their benefit — that will be between you and the social security administration. do your research; check with the social security administration — or for independent additional research regarding your social security options contact social security choices at — www.socialsecuritychoices.com.\n\n7. and lastly; be sure to change the beneficiaries and titles on all your accounts. this is sometimes neglected following the divorce process. i met a gentleman who had been married to his second wife for 15 years and the first wife was still on the title of the primary residence.\n\ndivorce is never easy; there are a lot of moving parts to attend to, not to mention the increased stress and emotional toll it can take. protect yourself by being well organized and thorough in your planning.
uber technologies inc.'s merger talks with grubhub inc. were called a new low in pandemic profiteering by a member of congress on tuesday, and that's just one issue that could thwart a potential combination of the food-delivery companies.\n\nthe wall street journal reported that uber uber, -2.23% was in talks to acquire grubhub grub, -2.35% in a deal that would trade 2.15 uber shares for each grubhub share, fueling a 29% jump in grubhub's shares. but the journal and cnbc reported later that the two companies remain far apart on price, with uber balking at the exchange rate.\n\nthe deal has strong support on wall street, with many noting that consolidation in the crowded, low-margin food-delivery space seems inevitable. however, beyond the price argument, uber and grubhub could find a lot of resistance from capitol hill.\n\nuber is a notoriously predatory company that has long denied its drivers a living wage. its attempt to acquire grubhub — which has a history of exploiting local restaurants through deceptive tactics and extortionate fees — marks a new low in pandemic profiteering, rep. david cicilline, d-r.i., said in a statement.\n\ncicilline, who is also the house antitrust subcommittee chairman, asked lawmakers just last week to include language in the next relief package that would ban mergers that do not involve companies that are severely distressed. neither uber nor grubhub, with their cash reserves and hefty market valuations, could be seen as severely distressed.\n\nmore from therese: uber admits that ride-hailing is worth less because of covid-19, but investors still think uber is worth more\n\nin addition to pressure from congress, such a deal between the two of the top three players in food delivery would be expected to get a review by u.s. antitrust regulators. according to wedbush securities, a combination of uber eats and grubhub would represent about 55% market share in the u.s. food-delivery market. currently, wedbush estimates grubhub has 24%, uber eats 32%, and doordash at 35%, with the remaining share held by postmates, caviar — which doordash acquired from square inc. sq, -3.13% last year — and other smaller players.\n\nthat would be within the danger zone, it means that the government would generally look at it fairly closely to see what exactly is going on, said herbert hovenkamp, a professor with the university of pennsylvania law school and the wharton school.\n\nhe also said that regulators would look at each major city where the companies operate for further market-share data.\n\nuber itself is not equally successful in every city, some cities have been harsher on them than others. when you have two companies that operate nationally, you need to look at what's going on in each geographic area. that's fairly common in cases like this, hovenkamp said.\n\nsee also: luckin coffee shows how risky chinese ipos can be, but investors are just not listening\n\nindeed, wedbush analyst ygal arounian noted that any acquirer of grubhub would ultimately be buying market strength in cities like new york city, boston and chicago at a premium, in order to speed up rationalization through market-share dominance. raymond james analyst aaron kessler said that uber covets grubhub's dominance in new york city, where it has a 62% share.\n\non top of that, regulators and congress are keen to the current woes in the restaurant industry, which already gets a bum deal from food-delivery companies, as was seen in a recent grubhub invoice shared on social media.\n\nthe status of doordash is another thing that could derail an uber/grubhub marriage. a couple of analysts have predicted that grubhub, which has a history of making its own acquisitions, could go after doordash, which had been set to go public before covid-19 roiled the market for initial public offerings.\n\ni think a deal on some level is inevitable, wedbush's arounian said in an email, adding that he does not think antitrust will be a problem. but the deal will certainly get political attention. especially today, when delivery companies' fees are seen as putting more pressure on restaurants in this environment.\n\nwhatever happens next, it's pretty clear that this deal would undergo serious scrutiny on many different levels. the optics, as pr people like to say, are not good for any kind of deal that stinks of pandemic profiteering.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy father was always fair, but a bit of a pushover. he had a great career as a computer engineer, was retired, divorced my mom, lived alone in his home and developed dementia 10 years ago.\n\nmy sister made herself his power of attorney without consulting me or my brother. i didn't find out until i did a public-record search on his property three years after the dementia diagnosis. she also signed a reverse mortgage on his property. i was stunned. i talked to my dad and he said did not do this.\n\nmy father's lawyer said he wouldn't do anything about my complaints unless my father initiated it. my sister made it difficult to see him or talk to him, and watched him like a hawk. she installed a camera and she moved down the street so, if visitors like myself went to his house, she would show up immediately.\n\n 'my father's lawyer said he wouldn't do anything about my complaints unless my father initiated it.' \n\nmy sister maintained secrecy. her son moved into the house without paying rent and developed a drug problem. he went to rehab, which must have been expensive since he had no job and no insurance. i hate to think he may have stolen my father's insulin syringes to use for his drug habit.\n\ntwo years ago my father passed away. in the weeks leading up to this, my mother told me he wasn't well and was in a nursing home, but she didn't know which one. i frantically called dozens in the area, but i couldn't find out. it was distressing and sad.\n\nthe moneyist:my elderly father was physically abusive, and will leave his farm to my two sisters. should i contest his will?\n\nmy father's attorney said he now represents my sister, not the estate. my mother said this lawyer — our cousin — also mishandled my father's 401(k), losing it all. the lawyer said it was lost in the stock market crash. the will said my sister is the executor of his estate. but it was signed and written after he became ill. my father's will left everything equally to each of my siblings, but it also said gifts didn't have to be distributed equally.\n\nmy sister refused to tell us how the cash from the reverse mortgage was spent. my father had a good retirement income. over $435,000 was spent in the six years before his death from the reverse mortgage. the lawyer said if my father were in a nursing home during that time he would have had nothing left.\n\n 'my father's will left everything equally to each of my siblings, but it also said gifts didn't have to be distributed equally.' \n\nthe house was sold and the proceeds split. i can't help feeling that my sister did not hold up her fiduciary duty as power of attorney, and gave it to herself because my father was so frugal.\n\nmy sister had no job, and no income other than her boyfriend's income. but her boyfriend and her son must have six cars by now. her boyfriend is from another country and works in construction. i fear they sent money overseas when his sister evidently visited at one point. i know my sister feels her boyfriend is entitled to top dollar for his work and most likely bilked my father's estate on home repairs.\n\nwhat should my brother and i do? the estate hasn't closed yet, i think, but she isn't talking.\n\ndisturbed sister\n\nthe moneyist:my wife and i have 3 kids. i also have 3 kids from a previous marriage. how should we split our house among these 6 children?\n\ndear disturbed,\n\nthe time to act is now.\n\nthere's something fishy about your father's lawyer's reluctance to take any of your concerns seriously. it's time to hire another lawyer, contact your father's bank and file a petition with the probate court to replace her as executor. your father's bank accounts may be empty, but i would freeze those, and any other retirement and life insurance policies too. you can go through mail at your father's house, with your mother's permission, and write a list of all of the banks and insurance companies with which he did business.\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\nit's always more difficult to retrieve money that has been pilfered from an estate or, in this case, when an elderly parent's home is used as an atm. if $435,000 was spent on your father's nursing-home care, there should be a paper trail for that. you may also decide to report your father's lawyer to your state's bar association, if he does not cooperate and/or continues to leave questions unanswered. as you say, a power of attorney has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the individual and only make investments with his/her permission.\n\ndon't ruminate on this situation. there is a statute of limitations on wills, and the clock usually starts ticking after the will has been filed with the probate court. it may be a case of restoring some kind of justice and fairness to this process, and holding your sister accountable, rather than being able to claw back the money that has been drained from your father's estate, assuming it was done so in a nefarious manner.\n\nyour father cannot act on his own behalf in a legal manner if he suffered from dementia. his lawyer knows that. your sister knows that. as does every court in the land.\n\nthe moneyist: i didn't receive a $1,200 stimulus check during the first surge of covid-19. will i get a $600 check this time around?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. by emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch.
few events are more jarring than the premature death of a spouse. it's a life transition of monumental proportions. when it comes to the implications for finances, we tend to first think of this as a matter of quantity: will the surviving spouse have enough assets and income as they move forward with their life?\n\nbut also important is a question of strategy: can these assets and income be constructed to mitigate the cruelest tax increase in our tax code, which occurs when a survivor becomes a single taxpayer?\n\nespecially when a surviving spouse is well along in retirement, the toll can be rather shocking. single taxpayers reach each tax bracket at far lower incomes than married couples. for singles, this happens twice as quickly when moving from the 15% federal bracket to the next bracket, 25%. it's the biggest jump in the tax code.\n\nthe key to avoiding it often depends on the couple's planning moves while still in their 60s.\n\nin 2016, the line separating these two brackets is $37,650 taxable income for singles and $75,300 for married couples. in other words, single taxpayers get there twice as soon as married couples — a consequence of no marriage penalty at these income levels. while this may seems fair enough, it can be a cruel surprise to the recently widowed spouse the year after her beloved's death. adding insult to injury, she will almost always have a larger portion of her social security benefit included as taxable income than when married.\n\nimagine a married couple with $100,000 in income from social security, ira withdrawals and/or pensions. after deductions/exemptions, assume $73,000 is taxable. they land in the 15% bracket and owe approximately $10,000 in federal tax — or about 10% of income. now imagine that the widowed spouse, on keeping the larger social security check and all financial assets (since, as the movie tell us, you can't take it with you), still has an $80,000 income with $61,000 taxable after deductions/exemptions. this places her above the $37,650 line and well into the 25% single federal bracket; it generates an approximately $11,000 federal tax bill — or about 14% of income and about $1,000 more than when married, even with $20,000 less income. ouch!\n\nfortunately, planning strategies can mitigate some impact of this widow's penalty. the key is lessening the taxable income, which, due to the spouse's death, now finds itself in the 25+% marginal tax brackets for the widow's remaining life.\n\nto illustrate, consider a same-aged couple with $1 million in financial assets the first year of their required minimum distributions (rmds); assume that $750,000 are iras, with the rest in a brokerage account. assume further that they rebalance annually to a 50/50 stock/bond asset allocation with the simplistic assumption that stocks return 7% and bonds 3% each and every year. thus, they earn 5% annually. their first rmd is about $27,400. a decade later, after withdrawing each rmd, their ira value is $785,000. the age 80 rmd is now about $42,000, 53% higher, regardless of who is/is not living. the higher this rmd amount, the more social security will also be taxable and the more likely that taxable income crosses into the 25% bracket. and should this year be the first as a survivor, she would almost certainly be well over that line.\n\nby contrast, suppose that by age 70 this couple had completed annual roth ira conversions that moved 20% ($150,000) of their ira assets to a roth ira. by withdrawing from brokerage assets for income these years, the tax rate on these annual conversions could easily have stayed at 15% bracket. rmd amounts are now also 20% lower; the first year's is about $21,900, and the age 80 amount is about $33,600.\n\nthis is not only over $8,000 less taxable income at age 80, which can be replaced by tax-free roth withdrawals, there's likely more social security that also can remain tax-free. if these lower taxable ira and social security amounts are on a widow's tax return, the lower taxable portion avoids what would otherwise be taxed at 25%. savings could easily be $1,000 annually.\n\nnote that these roth conversions would probably not be worth doing had they also made significantly more social security taxable. however, if the couple was waiting until age 70 to claim the larger benefit and using brokerage assets for income, this would be a nonissue. even if full social security was already being collected, conversions could be worthwhile if they occurred while living in a state with no income tax and where a future move to a higher-tax state was likely.\n\nso it's important to keep doing long-term planning even after retirement begins. couples can't escape the likelihood that one spouse will outlive the other. but they can protect that survivor better through strategies such as this.
recent deaths of public figures, including aretha franklin, billy graham, stephen hawking and margot kidder, raise an important issue that many people just don't want to think about: estate planning.\n\nchances are you've spent plenty of time pondering how much money you'll have available at retirement. but what have you done to plan for your estate? the sad truth is that most of us — some 70% of adult americans — have neglected to write a will.\n\nsome think their assets are too puny to worry about, others worry that the costs of writing a last will and testament are too high. others just don't get around to it. the queen of soul, aretha franklin, reportedly left an estate worth $80 million, but no will.\n\nbut wills aren't just vehicles for the wealthy or the morbid. if you've got a family and a home — not to mention a savings account — you should definitely have one. cost is no excuse. while the average will drawn up by a lawyer typically runs from $500 to $1,000, you can get a simple will at a legal clinic for as little as $75 or create your own with an online vendor for even less.\n\nfor most people, the first time in your life that a will becomes imperative is when you have children. forget about your assets for a minute. in the terrible event that you and your spouse die at the same time without a will, it falls to a probate court judge to name a guardian for your minor children — not a pleasant prospect. that's why it is a crucial first step to name a guardian for your minor kids. our experts recommend naming an alternate guardian in the document, as well, in case something happens to your first choice.\n\nwriting a will, of course, is also your chance to clarify who gets what in your estate. before you can do that, however, you have to tally up your assets. that includes your house, your investment portfolio, the value of your retirement plan account(s), and the payout(s) from any life insurance coverage. after adding these things up, most folks discover that they are worth more than they initially suspected.\n\nonce you've got your assets listed, you can decide what you want to leave to whom and who will be executor of your estate. one important caveat: make sure that the beneficiaries listed in your will match the beneficiaries you name for your insurance policy and for your 401(k) and any other retirement accounts. if not, the beneficiaries named in these other documents will be the ones who actually get the money.\n\nnow, if you want to do any more complex estate planning, chances are you'll have to set up a trust, which isn't cheap. they can cost as much as $2,000 to $3,000 or more. the primary reason people go to this kind of trouble is to protect their heirs from having to pay hefty estate taxes that can turn their carefully built nest egg into chicken feed. or to protect their heirs from themselves if they are—to put it kindly—not very financially astute.\n\nremember: for every dollar you leave behind over the unified federal gift and estate tax exemption amount (a whopping 11.4 million for 2019), the irs will take 40 cents for the federal estate tax. so not many folks need to worry about the federal estate tax under the current rules.\n\nonce you have a will in place, don't forget to update it regularly. you'll need to amend it whenever there is a big change in your family's circumstances — a birth, a death or marriage, or even if you move out of state. a will might seem like a hassle, but that's nothing compared with the hassles your heirs will experience if you die without one.\n\nthis story was updated on feb. 1, 2019.
over the past few decades the question of whether affirmative action is an appropriate antidote to centuries of discriminatory policies have animated the court system and voting booth. as americans have become increasingly focused on systemic racism over the past several weeks, those questions have taken on new urgency.\n\nnow, california voters will have a chance to weigh in with potentially precedent-setting consequences for the way colleges consider race in admissions — one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds in the affirmative action debate.\n\non wednesday, the california senate voted to approve california assembly constitutional amendment no. 5, which seeks to repeal proposition 209. the law, passed in 1996, bans the state from discriminating against or offering preferential treatment on the basis of race, gender and other criteria in hiring public employees, awarding public contracts and admissions to public universities in the state.\n\nif approved by voters, the law would allow the state's public colleges to consider race in their admissions process. but the decision could also have implications for the higher education landscape beyond california.\n\n 'there is a growing recognition that there is an inexcusable gap between who we profess to want to be as a society and who we are.'  — jonathan feingold, a professor at boston university's school of law\n\nit's not a far reach to think that if voters in california begin to think differently about college admissions and understand the importance of racial equity and racial diversity and rescind their ban, that might prompt people in other states to think similarly, said ralph richard banks, a professor at stanford law school. it could even affect supreme court decision making.\n\nthe role of race in college admissions\n\nalready, the u.s. supreme court has limited the ability of colleges to use race as a factor in admissions decisions. colleges are allowed to consider race only as part of a broader goal of achieving educational diversity. in addition, they can only weigh race as part of a holistic evaluation process that considers many factors — strategies such as quota systems are effectively banned.\n\nthese restrictions set a ceiling for how large of a role race can play in college admissions. it's possible that bar could change. lawsuits against harvard university and the university of north carolina chapel hill over the schools' admissions practices are winding their way through the court system and could make their way to the supreme court.\n\nstakeholders have expected that if given the opportunity to weigh in again, the court would likely restrict colleges' ability to use race even further, given the conservative majority of the justices. but the decision of california voters could change that calculus, said banks, the author of the forthcoming book, meritocracy in an age of inequality: race, class and college admissions.\n\nthroughout history there are examples of politics at the state level influencing the supreme court. before the court outlawed state bans on interracial marriage, several states repealed their own laws. before the supreme court legalized gay marriage in 2015, dozens of states had already done so.\n\nin those cases, public opinion shifted and the atmosphere changed and then it seemed more sensible or less radical even for the supreme court to step in, banks said.\n\ninfluence of protests\n\nnow, there's a major force shifting public opinion — the demonstrations and attention to systemic racism in the aftermath of the killing of george floyd by police.\n\nit's impossible to extricate this from the protests we're seeing, jonathan feingold, a professor at boston university's school of law, said of the debate over affirmative action. there is a growing recognition that there is an inexcusable gap between who we profess to want to be as a society and who we are. one way to close that gap is to account for race and gender in college admissions, hiring and other decisions, he said.\n\nwhen the university of california's board of regents announced their endorsement of aca 5, they referenced the current political moment. there is amazing momentum for righting the wrongs caused by centuries of systemic racism in our country, john pérez, the chair of the board of regents, said in a statement, the uc board of regents' votes to endorse aca 5 and to repeal proposition 209 plays a part in that effort.\n\namerica's higher education system is plagued with inequities. the colleges and universities that educate the bulk of low-income students and students of color tend to have fewer resources. the segment of elite, wealthy schools that have the funds to get students to and through school with minimal debt educate a relatively small share of these students.\n\nin addition, metrics that are often the gateways to these schools — like standardized test scores — often benefit students with access to resources like well-funded public schools and test prep courses. the uc system announced earlier this year that it would suspend the requirement that california applicants submit an sat or act score and eventually move to a test-blind system, where admissions officers can't consider these scores in their decisions.\n\ndebate over affirmative action mirrors others around the country\n\nadvocates of repealing proposition 209 say that the restrictions it has imposed over the past 24 years have made it difficult for california's public colleges and universities to address these diversity issues.\n\nwe can't ignore the fact that racism does exist, said elisha smith-arrillaga, the executive director of education trust-west, an organization focused on equity in education. the way that we think about affirmative action is that having race is one of many tools that you use in allocating resources just helps to level the playing field.\n\nbefore 1996, when the law was enacted, the share of freshman in the university of california system from underrepresented racial groups averaged around 20%, according to a fact-sheet from the uc system. in 1998, that share dropped to 15%. by 2016, that share had increased to 37%. during the same period, the share of high school graduates from underrepresented racial groups grew from 39% to 56%.\n\nsupporters of the 1996 law look at that same data and argue that the state's schools have become more diverse during the period proposition 209 has been in place. they also worry that getting rid of it could effectively discriminate against some groups.\n\nsimilar debates are raging in other settings. the organization suing harvard has argued that the school's policies discriminate against high-achieving asian-american applicants while giving a boost to students from other racial groups. in new york city, the mayor's proposal to eliminate the use of a standardized test in admissions to elite public high schools, as a way to ensure the institutions better reflect the diversity of the city, was met with opposition, particularly from some asian-american families who said the plan would unfairly cut off their kids' access to these schools.\n\nyou're putting the thumb on the scale, said crystal lu, the president of the silicon valley chinese association foundation, which opposes aca 5. you are hurting somebody by propping someone else up. lu and other supporters of proposition 209 say instead of repealing it, lawmakers should focus on addressing issues like inequality in the kindergarten through 12th grade school system, which contributes to the inequity in higher education.\n\nfor kyndall dowell, a rising junior at uc berkeley, repealing proposition 209 is about more than just ensuring there are more students who look like her on campus. dowell said one of the reasons she got involved in efforts to repeal the provision is because she's aware that once she graduates from a prestigious university, she'll still enter a job market where black women like her make 61% of what white men do on average.\n\nshe hopes that allowing government employers and agencies to consider race more explicitly in hiring and contracting could help to level that playing field.\n\nthis current climate has exposed a lot of the ugliness, a lot of the baggage, that america has yet to clean and make right, dowell said. while aca 5 may not be the end all be all, it may not solve all of our issues as a state, i do think it is a step in the right direction.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband recently inherited a big sum of money when his father passed away. his father left 75% of his estate to my husband, which is worth around $3 million. my husband has been having an affair for some time now and i will confront him about it soon and, after that, i intend to divorce him.\n\nwhat rights do i have to his inheritance? we have five children together and i went through a lot with him for many years and i want to punish him for going behind my back and having an affair. i know i'm a bitter and scorned wife, but what are my rights with his inheritance?\n\nlucy in delaware\n\ndear lucy,\n\nten u.s. states have community property laws where assets acquired during a marriage are divided 50/50. delaware, however, is not one of them. it's an equitable distribution state, meaning you both get what a judge deems fair and appropriate. in delaware, a divorce court would likely divide the assets based on what is fair and equitable. however, your husband would likely keep his inheritance if the money is not co-mingled as inheritance is not typically considered marital property. given that you have borne him five children and, from what i can glean from your letter, have endured some bad behavior, you still have a good case for at least 50/50 of what remains.\n\n tell your husband that it's time to be honest with each other now and, despite what has happened during your marriage, say you owe it to yourselves to show respect to the people you were when you first met.  — the moneyist\n\nthat said, delaware also takes anticipated inheritances into account when dividing assets — so even if your husband has not received his money and he keeps all $3 million inheritance — it could still be a factor deciding how much you both walk away with in the event of a divorce. (if i were advising your husband, i'd say keep the paperwork.) in delaware, you could receive more of the marital property if you can prove that your husband was cruel or unfaithful, and whether there is a big gap in your wealth and earnings after you divorce. your age differences and health may also play a part. (other states like california are what's known as no fault divorce states, meaning bad behavior does not necessarily result in larger payouts.)\n\ndon't miss:divorcing in 2016? get your affairs in order first\n\ntalk to a lawyer. then talk to your husband. ask him, are you having an affair? if he says no, present him with your evidence. tell him that you raised five children together and you both did the best you could for many of those years and that it's time to be honest with each other now and, despite what has happened during your marriage, say you owe it to yourselves to show respect to the people you were when you first met. bring him back to the moment he proposed and tell him that you want to end this marriage with the same dignity and respect that you brought into it. it's not good to remain in a marriage where you are resentful and unhappy.\n\ntake heart: you're not the only person who has written about marital infidelity. this unfaithful and soon-to-be-divorced partner lamented the financial consequences of his decision. there will always be a reason to wait. don't be like this acrimonious couple. start the process today, if you are sure you want to divorce him. the rest of your life awaits.\n\nfollow marketwatch on facebook\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to the moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
i have a lot of married friends, and seeing them tie the knot has prepared me for my own trip down the aisle someday. i know things like invitations should be proofread before they're sent out, red wine should never be placed near the bride and overspending can stress out newlyweds (and land them in debt if they're not careful).\n\nbut one thing i never expected to learn was how you can never prepare for what's inside the wedding presents. sure, there are registries filled with everything from cookware and linens to cash and gift cards. but what happens when guests go rogue and get a little too creative?\n\nhilarity — that's what.\n\nmy friends are chock full of stories about crazy, inappropriate gifts they received for saying i do. now i'm passing these gems on to you so you can avoid giving a cringe-worthy gift this season. (note: i've kept this on a first-name-only basis to help protect them from any more gift-giver cruelty.)\n\n1. soaps from city hall\n\nchristy and her husband said their nuptials at the local courthouse, but walked away with more than a marriage certificate. when we arrived, they gave us a little bag full of sample laundry soaps, she said.\n\n2. a gift from mom\n\nthings got weird for annalisa when she received a gift from her future mother-in-law. i received a bottle of emotion lotion – 'blow on it, and it gets hot' – from his mother! awkward!\n\n3. tarnished silver\n\nthere's re-gifting, and then there's what happened to alexia. we got a 'silver' platter with someone else's initials engraved on it, she said.\n\n4. not well done\n\nstephanie's family sounds like they were thinking more of themselves than the couple. the gift in question? a giant 30-piece outdoor grilling set, probably from costco, she said. at the time, we were living in a 350-square-foot studio. also, we're vegetarians.\n\n5. the book that keeps giving\n\nspencer's weird gift actually came in handy years later when he had another wedding to attend. someone — still, to this day, i'm not sure who — gave us a kama sutra book with a subtitle that read something, like '70-plus mind-blowing positions.' about five years into our marriage, my wife's cousin got married, and we needed to get them a gift, he said. so rather than spend money on them like normal people, we decided to impart some marital wisdom — we re-gifted the book. but instead of giving it to them in the pristine condition it was in after five years, we roughed it up a bit. we bent a few page corners and wrote a bunch of notes throughout, like 'spencer's favorite,' or 'remember to stretch first' or 'do not attempt on a wood floor.'\n\n6. advice from the '90s\n\ncourtenay wouldn't have minded some tips on how to combine finances after marriage, but she didn't expect them to be so outdated. we got a used dave ramsey cassette tape on how to manage your personal finances, she explained, and this was in 2010, so it's not like cassette players were still widely in use.\n\n7. painting the future\n\ntiffany likes her creative friends, but she didn't expect this gift: my future mother-in-law's friend painted a picture of baby jesus and mary and paired it with a box that contained a marriage advice cd. we're not religious at all.\n\n8. as seen on tv\n\nlate-night infomercials and self-promotion seemed to be the theme for megan's wedding gifts: my husband and i got an 'as seen on tv' slider burger press, even though we've both been vegan for years. i did actually try to make black bean veggie patties in it once, but it was a huge fail. we also had someone give us a signed copy of their own book.\n\n9. the junk drawer\n\nleilla and her husband didn't receive a kitchen sink, but they got nearly everything else. someone gave us candles, a cheese knife, a bread knife and other random items that were obviously from their kitchen drawers, she said.\n\n10. a not-so-sweet gesture\n\njaime didn't expect a huge surprise, but this gift was a bit hard to swallow: my cousin got me two packs of old, half-melted gummies. i kept thinking there was something else, like maybe a gift card or a 'just kidding!', but no, nothing.\n\nwho knew there were so many bad gift-givers out there? these are just 10 of the stories i heard, and they kept coming. if you have a wedding to attend, there are gifts that won't require you to run up a big credit card bill (which could hurt your bank account and your credit score) and will even be useful to the couple. for some ideas, check out our list of 30 wedding gifts that keep giving.\n\nmore from credit.com:\n\nwhat's a good credit score?\n\nwhat's a bad credit score?\n\nhow credit impacts your day-to-day life

the bottle: dewar's ilegal smooth, $21.99.\n\nthe back story: here's a boozy wedding we didn't quite see coming: scotch and mezcal.\n\nthis new bottle from the bacardi-owned dewar's brand, one of the most popular blended scotches in the world, is indeed a marriage of sorts with ilegal, a leading name in mezcal, the smoky, mexican-made spirit. to be specific, it's traditional dewar's eight-year-old scotch that has been finished — that is, aged at the very end — in casks that previously contained ilegal.\n\nsee also: this 'tantalizing' under-$20 wine is the perfect sip to get you through coronavirus lockdown\n\nthe idea has its roots in new rules that have allowed scotch producers to expand the range of booze they can use for the final period of aging. indeed, dewar's has already released a scotch finished in caribbean rum, appropriately called caribbean smooth. the dewar's team says mezcal — and ilegal mezcal in particular — was a logical next choice. it was a natural, fortuitous partnership to help achieve our goal of breaking boundaries in the whisky genre, says dewar's master blender stephanie macleod.\n\nit also helps that mezcal has been surging in popularity of late. sales are expected to grow globally by almost 18% through 2022 to $840 million.\n\nwhat we think about it: this is dewar's at its core — a very approachable scotch with a mellow flavor. it's a bit harder to detect the earthy, fiery notes of the ilegal, but it's there at the very end — a wisp of smoke, as the dewar's team calls it. given the bottle's low price, it's worth a try, though hard-core mezcal fans may be disappointed.\n\nhow to enjoy it: this is fine on its own — neat or with ice. but the dewar's team suggests playing around with it in cocktails. they have come up with a toasted citrus highball that joins the whisky with pink grapefruit juice, lemon juice, honey water and soda water.
single, financially savvy, unattached and with plenty of money to spare.\n\nit sounds like an enviable position, but according to a recent reddit thread, it can actually pose some challenges in the dating world.\n\na writer on reddit by the name of minimalistmillennial, who described herself as a 24-year-old woman with a $50,000 net worth, said she has concerns about dating while she pursues financial independence and early retirement.\n\nthat concept, which typically means someone is trying to live completely off savings and investments without having to rely on a paycheck, is called fire, which stands for financial independence, retire early.\n\nshe is now finishing her master's degree, she wrote, and expects to make about $100,000 when she graduates.\n\nher goal: to retire between the ages of 35 and 40, with $1.5 million to $2 million saved.\n\nto do that, she plans to move to an area with a low cost of living, where a safe withdrawal rate of $35,000 to $40,000 will give her a high quality of life.\n\ni'd like to buy a small house, get a cat, teach pilates classes 2-3x a week, travel a few times a year, and maybe get a social work or education certificate at a community college to do some really rewarding part-time work, she said. my biggest concern is that i am going to have to do this alone.\n\nto be sure, this is a risky strategy, and several other commenters on reddit pointed out that $2 million may not be enough to support the rest of her life, if unexpected circumstances like health scares or market downturns happen.\n\nshe doesn't want children, she said, nor luxury items like nice cars or big houses.\n\ni fear that i am so odd and particular with my dreams that finding a partner will be impossible, she said.\n\nsoon, her post had hundreds of comments.\n\none commenter, ejk1199, said she is a 33-year-old woman and could relate. she also had no interest in children or big houses, she said.\n\nit took a long time but i found someone who wants the same things, isn't a huge spender, and also isn't intimidated by a woman who makes good money, she said. they're out there. go into any dating or relationship with pure honesty about what you want.\n\nanother commenter asked ejk1199 how she finally met her partner.\n\nonline dating actually, she said. i've had my share of horrible/hilarious dates but i definitely got lucky.\n\nafter that, another commenter, throwaway-notthrown, said she met her financially savvy husband while traveling.\n\ni've never specifically talked with him about fire but our goals are to save as much money as possible at all times, we are frugal, we don't want children, and we both are minimalists, she said.\n\nyou'll find someone who's into fire, another commenter said. just be yourself … but if you meet someone you realize, 'this person seems to live below their means and has similar thoughts/dreams … they might be the one.'\n\nothers reminded the original poster she is young and has time.\n\ndon't try to plan your entire life, one said. some things just happen in the right moment.\n\nplus, it's not impossible to teach someone about fire after meeting them, if that's what you want, another said.\n\na commenter sabshier said she and her husband have been married for eight years, after meeting on eharmony. mtch, +0.17%\n\nat the time neither of us knew about fire. however, we are both extremely frugal, tended to invest heavily and apparently have cheap hobbies, she wrote. i honestly believe we were both truthful with the questions that were posed and therefore became a perfect 'firey' match.\n\nthe original poster isn't alone in wanting to find a partner who aligns with her financial values.\n\nsome 56% of americans say they want a partner who provides financial security more than head over heels love (44%), according to a survey released by merrill edge, an online discount brokerage and division of bank of america merrill lynch.\n\nand some 59% of couples cite financial problems as playing somewhat of a role in their divorce, a 2017 study from experian expn, +2.88% found. another 20% said financial problems played a big role in the divorce, and 26% said their spouse's credit score specifically was a source of stress in the marriage.\n\nif you are waiting to discuss finances until after you're married, you have waited too long, experts say.\n\nas for the original poster, she may have inadvertently started a business idea.\n\na fire dating app would be a great idea, one commenter said. except no fire people would ever pay for it.

dear moneyologist,\n\ni was hoping you could give us some advice regarding two first time homebuyers with vastly different credit scores. what would the ramifications be for not putting my husband's name on the deed or the mortgage so we could qualify for lower payments?\n\nmy husband and i got married six months ago and are looking to purchase our first home together. we live in southern california where the median house in our town is currently listed at over $550,000 and condos around $450,000 and i will be putting at least 10% down. when we got pre-approved for a mortgage it revealed more than a 50-point difference in our credit as his credit score was below 700, partly due to a single late payment by my husband.\n\ndon't miss: this daughter lived rent-free in the family home for a decade — and now wants $100,000 for renovations\n\nour broker said this will make for a bit less than a $300 a month difference in interest payments should we buy jointly versus buying individually. my husband missed a credit card payment after i was in an accident that left me temporarily disabled two weeks before the wedding as he was taking care of me.\n\ni would qualify for a mortgage to buy a condo based on my income alone, and i am the only one contributing to the down payment. what would the ramifications be for us if i were to not put my husband's name on the deed or the mortgage so we could qualify for lower payments? i want to make sure i do right by my husband as he took care of me, but i feel like taking care of us would also mean making sure we get the lowest payments possible since we are shopping at the top of our budget.\n\nbee in southern california\n\ndear bee,\n\nit's not uncommon for couples in your situation to go ahead with one person's name on the deed if they can (a) still afford to buy a home and (b) buy a home of similar value and (c) not sacrifice any of their non-negotiable requirements such as the neighborhood or whether it has a large garden or extra bedroom. if you're buying the home with a veteran affairs loan or federal housing administration loan, the bank will likely look into your husband's financials and, for instance, take any debt into consideration. but from what you say it doesn't sound like your husband has any problem other than a missed credit card payment.\n\nalso read: millionaires can't seem to flee this european country fast enough\n\nideally, the names on the deed should match those on the mortgage. you could at some later date refinance and add your husband to the mortgage or, at closing, add your husband to the deed at closing. be aware, however, this would make him a co-owner but not responsible for repaying the loan. of course, you could change that at a later date, but california is a community property state and his contributions to the mortgage and the fact that you bought the home during your marriage would mean your home would become marital property, if you divorced. this is a good time to make a will specifying your husband as the sole heir to your home should you predecease him.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
managing money can be complicated, and myths are often born from people's struggles to make it simpler. but simplistic solutions can cost you instead of saving you money.\n\nif you believe any of these five money myths, it's time to take a closer look at the financial realities.\n\n1. myth: everyone needs a fat emergency fund\n\ncertified financial planners typically recommend clients have enough savings to cover expenses for three to six months. if you're living paycheck to paycheck, though, it can take you years to amass that much.\n\nsay you spend $5,000 each month and somehow manage to trim your expenses by 10%. to accumulate three months' expenses ($4,500 times three, or $13,500), you would have to put aside every dime of that $500 savings for 27 months. accumulating a six-month stash could take nearly five years. either way, it's too long to put off other important goals, such as saving for retirement and paying off high-interest-rate debt.\n\na better course: shoot for a starter emergency fund of $500, which would cover small car repairs or an insurance deductible. once you're on track with retirement and debt repayment, you can focus on building up your savings.\n\nmeanwhile, identify other sources of fast cash: items you can sell, nonretirement investments you can tap or low-cost ways to borrow, such as a home equity line of credit.\n\n2. myth: getting married means higher taxes\n\nmany couples don't pay a marriage penalty — and some get a marriage bonus, meaning their tax burden is lower because they married. that's particularly true for couples with disparate incomes; together they pay less in tax than they would as singles.\n\ncongress tried to eliminate marriage penalties for most taxpayers by expanding the 10% and 15% federal income tax brackets, which are twice as wide for married couples as for singles. in addition, the standard deduction for married couples is twice that for singles.\n\nthe couples most likely to pay a marriage penalty are those at the top and bottom of the income scale. the higher tax brackets aren't twice as wide for married couples as for singles. at the lower-income end, couples that combine their incomes through marriage could lose some or all of the valuable earned-income tax credit.\n\neven if you do pay a tax penalty, the cost is likely outweighed by the many other financial and legal benefits marriage provides.\n\n3. myth: roth iras are a great way to save for retirement\n\nwithdrawals from a roth ira are tax-free in retirement, and there are no required minimum distributions, which means you can pass unused money to your heirs, free of income tax. that makes roths a pretty good deal for wealthier taxpayers and those who expect to be in a higher tax bracket when they withdraw the money than when they contributed it.\n\nmany people, though, will be in a lower tax bracket when they retire. they'd be better off taking a tax break now by making deductible contributions to 401(k)s and regular iras.\n\nof course, no one knows what future tax rates may be. if you want to hedge your bets, you can stash some money in a roth ira or roth 401(k) in addition to making contributions to tax-deductible plans.\n\n4. myth: you should roll your 401(k) into an ira\n\nyou definitely shouldn't cash out a 401(k) when you leave a job, but rolling over your account into an ira may not be the best option, either. you may be better off leaving your money in the old plan if it's a good one, or transferring it to a new employer's plan if that's an option.\n\nfinancial services firms encourage rollovers because that means you'll be investing in their retail investment options, which cost more than the institutional funds found in many 401(k)s.\n\nyour 401(k) account has other advantages:\n\nyou can withdraw money penalty-free if you leave the company at or after age 55, while iras typically make you wait until 59½.\n\nif you continue to work, you can put off withdrawals from your current employer's 401(k), while ira withdrawals must start after age 70½.\n\nyou can't borrow money from an ira for more than 60 days without the withdrawal being taxed and penalized, but most 401(k)s offer loans that can last five years — and sometimes longer for a home purchase.\n\nworkplace plans also are better protected against creditor claims than iras if you're sued or go bankrupt.\n\nif any of these issues might affect you, consider leaving your money in a 401(k).\n\n5. myth: scholarships will help reduce college costs\n\nscholarships can reduce the amount of financial aid students get, leaving families no better off.\n\nthat's because federal financial aid rules require colleges to ratchet back need-based aid when students win money from outside sources such as corporations, nonprofits and fraternal organizations.\n\ncolleges have some leeway in how they implement these rules. the most generous may reduce the amount students are expected to contribute from their own earnings or lower the amount they'll have to borrow. other schools that don't fully meet a student's financial need will allow scholarship money to fill the gap. most, however, reduce grant aid dollar for dollar.\n\naffluent families who don't qualify for financial aid tend to be the ones who benefit most from scholarships. if you have financial need, though, you'd be smart to ask about a college's scholarship displacement policy before you spend too much time applying for supposedly free money.\n\nmore from nerdwallet
dear moneyist,\n\ni am a 30-year-old woman who has built a stable and happy life for myself, after growing up in a family that was often unstable emotionally and financially. i love my family, but as i become more successful, my family needs more and more of my support.\n\nmy sister and her son moved into my father's one-bedroom apartment in july (which is going against the lease). i was very against this living situation due to it being way too small for two adults and a rambunctious child.\n\nlearn to master your money:sign up for marketwatch's free live series to boost your financial iq\n\nmy sister said she had no other options because her credit is terrible, she has little savings, and she was brought to court around an eviction (that was dismissed but she says it still hinders her). she has now been laid off for not having child care and is collecting unemployment. my father was struggling to pay for his apartment on his own, as well.\n\ntheir relationship has now deteriorated to a level where i do not think they will be able to continue living together. my aunt is the co-signer for my father's apartment, and says she can let my father stay in her spare bedroom if he works with her to fix his finances. my aunt has been trying to help me, as she knows i am overwhelmed mediating their arguments and finances.\n\nthe moneyist:i want to propose to my girlfriend — but how do i divide my estate between her and my daughter from a previous marriage?\n\ni told my sister we will need to find another place for her to live after april, and that i would co-sign if she sat down with me to go over her finances. she cried and said it would be impossible to find a place being unemployed, and that no one cares about her ending up homeless.\n\nshe thinks 'squatter rights' is the way to secure housing in the pandemic. she said she will refuse to leave the apartment if management doesn't let her take over the lease. she believes that since she is a single mother with a child, they will not be able to evict her.\n\ni have tried to explain there could be very negative consequences on her tenant record and my aunt as a co-signer (since my sister is in the apartment illegitimately to begin with), but she says everything will be fine.\n\ni do not want to hold my sister's past mistakes against her, and covid-19 has had a disproportionate impact on single mothers. she has been better with her money the last three months, but she has been very irresponsible in her spending the last few years (paying for breast implants, for example). she cannot stay with me, because i am serving as a head of house in one of my alma mater's dorms, which grants me and my partner a free apartment.\n\nhow should i proceed with my sister, in regards to her squatter rights argument and me co-signing in the future for her? am i being too supportive, or not supportive enough? for me, it is not about the money so much, i am glad to support my family as i make more than they do.\n\ni feel guilty even having my own financial goals (paying down student debt, down payment for a home, travel), when they are struggling in this way. i am becoming more and more dispirited as i feel immense empathy for their legitimate struggles, frustrated by their lack of agency, and guilty for the stable life i have built for myself.\n\nsincerely,\n\nsister struggles\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\ndear sister,\n\ni will answer your letter in two parts.\n\nfirstly, your sister. the hard, bitter truth is you can only help people who want to be helped. your sister appears to want what she wants when she wants it. she wants to be accommodated by you, her father, and her landlord. the world owes her a favor, and she is going to call in that favor again and again. for her to exclaim that no one cares if she ends up homeless when you are actually trying to help put a roof over her head suggests that she is using the same manipulations that may or may not have worked in the past.\n\nif she walks close enough to the edge, one of her family members will pull her back and bail her out. perhaps it's a test of your love for her, or maybe it's because she has and will continue to put herself first. the covid-19 pandemic has been hard on single mothers, but i don't think your sister can blame the pandemic for her current plight. it sounds as if she has been making questionable decisions before the pandemic and, unless she has some kind of white-light moment, she will continue to make them afterwards.\n\nif you are putting your credit rating and money on the line, she should meet you more than half way. as it is, she seems unwilling to play by the rules and see how her actions impact those around her: people who care about her, and the landlord of this property, who is likely to be struggling too. nothing appears to be her fault. even the reason she lost her job does not lie at her doorstep. in order to change, people have to take accountability for their own actions, and they have to be willing to change. based on your letter, your sister shows no signs of either.\n\nthe moneyist:we were friendly with our neighbors for decades, until recently. one day, they introduced us to their financial adviser…\n\nnow, to you. the guiltier you feel for the life that you have earned for yourself, the more those around you will be able to turn their problems into your problems. given your father and sister's unsuccessful and dysfunctional cohabiting arrangement, your family system may be based on a series of co-dependent relationships, where chaotic personalities and family discord are a familiar space. sometimes, we are attracted to situations that feel familiar to us. although it may feel wrong and uncomfortable, we have been conditioned to return there again and again.\n\nyou are not responsible for your sister. she is responsible for herself. it may be hard to watch her make bad life decisions, especially when she has a child, but you have worked hard for the life that you have, and you have every right to enjoy it. you are not beholden to your family for a lifetime of debt that will be paid time and again with your peace of mind and happiness. whether your sister's problems are related to borderline or narcissistic personality disorder, or substance abuse, and/or a sense that she is always done wrong, that's her gig.\n\nyour father moved out. there is no reason you should be left holding your sister and her baby. try this: you didn't create her problems, you are not responsible for them, and you can't cure them. (i am not the first person to say that. it is a popular mantra for people who are trying to disconnect from co-dependent relationships.) your father is your father, but he is also just another human being in the world doing the best he can with the life skills that were given to him. the same is true for your sister. you have a right to live your life, free from her drama.\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. by emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch.
the sussexes have the all-clear to move to north america — and experts say they're wise to choose canada over the u.s.\n\nprince harry's grandmother queen elizabeth ii, the head of state of the commonwealth and effectively ceo of the family business, gave him and his wife, meghan markle, her public blessing on their likely partial move to canada.\n\n experts have generally agreed that the couple will have ample opportunities to cash in on their celebrity status once they are independent of the royal family and have a base in north america. \n\nthe queen confirmed that she would have preferred the couple continue in the family business as working members of the royal family. she confirmed that, after a period of transition, they would no longer be reliant on public funds.\n\nthe statement followed a sandringham summit of senior royal family members and advisers at the queen's country estate. meghan markle did not attend in person, but reportedly planned to join the summit by phone from vancouver. prince philip left the house before the meeting, and prince william reportedly turned up with just 15 minutes to spare.\n\nsee also: royal relief for harry and meghan as vancouver is revealed as the most affordable city for luxurious lifestyles\n\nexperts have generally agreed that the couple will have ample opportunities to cash in on their celebrity status once they are independent from the royal family and have a base in north america.\n\nthey have already trademarked the label sussex royal, raising speculation that ranges of branded tea towels, kitchenware and other consumer goods may soon appear in nordstrom jwn, -2.03% , macy's m, -3.03% or marshall's tjx, -1.91% .\n\nthere are significant tax advantages to living in canada\n\nthe couple appear to be moving to canada rather than the united states. observers note several key financial advantages, including that moving to canada will keep prince harry out of the complex web of u.s. international tax law.\n\nthe u.s., almost uniquely among countries, taxes citizens and other u.s. persons worldwide, even if they move abroad and never return. if harry became a resident in the u.s., he would become subject to u.s. tax law, potentially raising a situation in which the internal revenue service started sending notices to buckingham palace demanding that british royal trusts file accounts and pay u.s. taxes.\n\nmeghan and harry may have a lot of taxable income, as they could be hoping to follow in the footsteps of oprah winfrey, martha stewart and the kardashians. martha stewart sold her branded goods company for $350 million in 2015, though she was once reportedly worth more than $1 billion. more recently, kylie jenner has launched a cosmetics business that has reportedly already made her a billionaire.\n\ncanada makes more sense from a security point of view\n\ncanada is a member of the british commonwealth, and the queen is head of state, so the couple may be able to draw on the canadian state for help with security. when the sussexes spent six weeks in canada over the holidays, scotland yard provided protection with support from the canadian police.\n\nbut they will face an easier time arranging security at the cost of the state in canada than the u.s. the governor general, who represents the queen in canada, is protected by the royal canadian mounted police and as a prince of the realm of canada, harry and his family will be protected by the same team of guards, which will have to be expanded, according to the london evening standard.\n\nroyal protection by armed metropolitan police officers is mandated by the home office, it added. until now their official roles mean the duke and duchess and their son are classified as internationally protected people.\n\none problem for the pair is that brexit has left the british pound very weak on international exchanges. as a result, harry's royal fortune — inherited from his mother, the late princess diana, and great-grandmother — will go a lot less far on this side of the pond than it would have a few years ago. the pound is about 20% below the peaks seen before the 2016 brexit referendum.\n\nit's a smarter move than moving to the u.s., said attorney david lesperance, who helps high-net worth individuals and families from all countries navigate immigration and taxation issues when they move across borders.\n\nlesperance, founder and managing partner of lesperance & associates, is a canadian citizen but lives in gdansk, poland. a number of his clients, like wealthy brazilians, mexicans and europeans, consider canada a wise destination for tax purposes. they are close enough to america for travel, without involving themselves in the country's tax code.\n\nlesperance noted canada does not impose a capital gains tax for homes that increase in value, so long as the place is a person or family's main residence. if meghan and harry bought a palatial estate that soared in value, perhaps because of who they are, or the renovations they applied, the couple could pocket the entire profit minus brokers' fees.\n\nin the u.s., the internal revenue service only allows a married couple to exclude the first $500,000 in capital gains on the sale of a main home; however, homeowners can also deduct mortgage interest on their taxes every year, but canadians have no such write off, lesperance added.\n\ndivorce law is less complicated in canada than the u.k. or u.s.\n\nbut what will happen to all of that earned wealth in the event of a split? it seems highly unlikely in 2020, but how about years or even decades from now? canadian divorce law generally splits all new marital wealth equally. that's good news if the couple manages to cash in on their celebrity status, even if their adventure ultimately ends in tears.\n\nmeanwhile, canadian family-law experts confirm that if the couple were ever to separate, harry would be entitled under canadian law to half of any new wealth they'd built up during their marriage. essentially…any form of property that's built up during the relationship would be divided 50/50, says sophie bartholomew, family attorney at the vancouver-based law firm maclean law.\n\nalso see: 'real housewives' tv mogul wants to broker a deal with meghan and harry: 'they've got lightning in a bottle'\n\nthis applies both to assets acquired during the marriage, and to increases in asset values that took place during the marriage, says denise whitehead, a professor of family and legal studies at canada's university of waterloo. (there are wrinkles to account for excluded assets, typically the money each party brought into a marriage, and to reflect matters like debts, she adds.)\n\nin the event of a divorce, neither harry nor meghan could claim the assets that the other party brought into the marriage, say experts. but all the money from, say, the sussex royal collection at j.c. penney us:jcp ? they would split those 50/50. (in the u.s., divorce law depends on which state couples file for divorce.)\n\ndon't miss:queen elizabeth's statement on harry and meghan: 'we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family'\n\nand in the u.k.? the law surrounding the division of matrimonial property and assets is lengthy and complicated, according to bennett oakley solicitors. unfortunately, the law is far from clear on what constitutes matrimonial property.\n\nif the marriage has lasted for many years it is likely that any property acquired prior to the marriage will be considered part of the matrimonial pot, the company adds. however, if the marriage was one of short duration, fewer than five years, then it is less likely that one party to the marriage can make a claim on the extra-marital property of the other party.\n\n(andrew keshner contributed to this story.)
it takes patience being married to the second richest man in the world.\n\nmelinda gates celebrated her 25th wedding anniversary with billionaire microsoft msft, +1.24% co-founder bill gates on new year's day, and she revealed in a recent interview with the sunday times that their marriage has been incredibly hard sometimes.\n\n we've just gotten to a point in life where bill and i can both laugh about more things. and, believe me, i can remember some days that were so incredibly hard in our marriage where you thought, 'can i do this?'  — melinda gates\n\none recurring problem was bill's struggle to find work-life balance. she recalled being angry with him years ago because the voracious reader was paging through a book about winston churchill instead of helping her get their three children ready to go out, or packing up the car.\n\nsee: melinda gates says the u.s. is 'lucky' to have capitalism\n\nshe said that being patient helped them both weather the ups and downs. in fact, work-life balance was an issue before they even tied the knot. he reportedly worked 16-hour days for five years. 'when he was having trouble making the decision about getting married, he was incredibly clear that it was not about me, it was about 'can i get the balance right between work and family life?' she said.\n\n he needs a little training, and he'd tell you that too.  — melinda gates\n\nmelinda, 54, who is no. 6 on the forbes list of power women (and named the most powerful woman in philanthropy as co-chair of the bill and melinda gates foundation) spoke while promoting her new book, the moment of lift: how empowering women changes the world. the book also shares tidbits from her personal life, such as how she won bill over by beating him at a math game when she began working at microsoft.\n\n look, i wasn't going for a certain type, obviously, when i fell in love with bill, right? but i think i was a little bit predisposed because i'm a computer science major, so when i was in college the people i spent a lot of time with were young men and a lot of them were geeky.  — melinda gates\n\nand it has been important to melinda to raise their three children to live as normal lives as possible. melinda left microsoft to raise them as outside of the spotlight as possible, for example, and enrolled them in school under her maiden name. and even though bill's worth just recently surpassed $100 billion, their three children — jennifer, 22; rory, 19; and phoebe, 16 — will inherit just $10 million each, she explained.\n\nsee: bill gates: being free from worry about financial things is a real blessing\n\nand that can be pretty intimidating for the younger gates' dates. melinda also dished that when their grown children now bring home new boyfriends or girlfriends for the first time, it can get awkward.\n\nyes, we try to break the ice, but it's not the easiest, she said, recalling one memorable incident when one of their daughters brought a boy home. turns out, the gates family has a tradition of going around the table before dinner to share one thing that they are each thankful for. they do this while holding hands — and this new beau was seated next to tech titan bill. and he had to go last.\n\ni thought, 'oh my god, this boy is going to pass out,' melinda said.
as if all those smug couples on valentine's day weren't enough reason to lament the single life, it turns out that going stag also has some financial drawbacks.\n\nthe disadvantages of being single are particularly relevant at a time when the average age of first marriage is higher than ever before — 27 for women and 29 for men, up from 20 for women and 23 for men in 1960, according to u.s. census bureau data that pew research center.\n\nsee also:this common career move could cost you $500,000\n\nmarried people tend to have significantly more savings in retirement than people who are single, according to a study from economists james poterba, david wise and steven venti, in 2012. for example, of those in the 90th percentile of wealth between the ages 65 to 69, two-person households had $878,000 in assets, versus $380,000 for those in the same demographic who are single.\n\ni got myself into this debt, and i'll get myself out of it, said a 40-year-old blogger who uses the pseudonym denise while writing on her blog, double debt, single woman. but it would be great to have the support, even just emotional support.\n\nhere are a few times it pays to be single, and when it pays to be married:\n\nmarried men spend more hours at work\n\nmen are more motivated to work longer hours and are less likely to quit a job without a new job lined up if they are married, said bradford wilcox, a sociologist and the author of several reports on marriage. marriage provides a kind of motivation and institutional status that tends to help men, he said.\n\nmarried men spend more hours at work than their single counterparts, whereas married women spend fewer hours at work than single women do. married men between the ages of 28 and 30 work 441 more paid hours a year than their single peers; married men between 44 and 46 work 403 more hours a year than single men.\n\nmarried women between 28 and 30 work 196 fewer paid hours than their single peers; married women between 44 and 46 work 131 fewer hours a year than single women, according to a report from the american enterprise institute, a washington, d.c.-based think tank.\n\nwomen still do more housework than men\n\nalthough men today do more housework than in previous years, women still spend one hour and 31 minutes on average a day doing housework, compared with one hour and 20 minutes for men, according to the bureau of labor statistics' american time use survey. women also spend 32 minutes a day on average caring for and helping a child, compared with 16 minutes for men (not including pregnancy).\n\nemployed married women spend almost twice as much time on housework and child care as married men do — 2.6 hours each day to 1.4 for men. married men made more than their single peers, according to aei's report, with young married men making nearly $16,000 more a year than single men. young married women made $1,349 less than their single peers.\n\nsome employers treat married men more favorably\n\nof course, the higher income isn't necessarily the direct result of the marriage for men; those with higher incomes might make the decision to get married, whereas those with lower incomes might find it harder to date or find a partner, or may put off marriage until their financial situations are better.\n\nbut wilcox said there's a marriage premium that benefits men, even when controlling for those factors and comparing those from similar demographic backgrounds. employers are more likely to treat married fathers favorably, he said. that's not legal, but it's the implicit cultural practice.\n\nmen are perceived as more suitable for employment after they get married, whereas women are perceived as less suitable, according to researchers from cornell and stanford in 2012. the expectation that married women could become mothers may create a bias against them, the authors of the report wrote.\n\ndelaying marriage actually helps women's earnings\n\ncollege-educated women who waited to get married until they were 30 or older made more annually than women who got married younger — about $10,000 more a year than those who got married at ages 24 to 26, according to an analysis of the u.s. census bureau's 2008 to 2010 american community survey by university of virginia researchers. (the authors said they controlled for factors besides age and attributed the difference to delayed motherhood and greater career focus.)\n\nof course, having children can dramatically change a single person or couple's financial future. the cost of raising one child in the u.s. is approximately $245,340.\n\nliving with a partner can save you thousands of dollars a year\n\nliving with a partner could save thousands of dollars a year — even more so than having roommates, considering sharing a studio or one-bedroom apartment would be tight quarters for two people who aren't romantically involved.\n\nnow, one quarter of never-married americans ages 25 to 34 live with a partner, according to pew research center. this shift has challenged the whole idea of the nuclear family unit being the main unit of society, said moira weigel, a yale university ph.d. candidate and author of the 2016 book labor of love: the invention of dating.\n\nco-habitating not only saves couples money on rent but allows them to save on daily expenses, such as sharing groceries and household responsibilities, said rachel podnos, a financial adviser based in washington, d.c. for those reasons, dual-income households with no children tend to be able to save more than single people living alone, podnos said.\n\nif i were to get married, it would be because of how much money it would save me in housing, said marina adshade, a professor of economics at the vancouver school of economics at the university of british columbia and author of the book dollars and sex: how economics influences sex and love\n\nwhile it's possible to purchase a house with someone who isn't a spouse, adshade said few single people would likely want that commitment to someone they have no legal tie to. you have to really love one of your friends to buy a house with them, she said.\n\ni'm not going to buy anything until i have someone i can buy with, said personal-finance blogger cait flanders, 31, who lives outside vancouver.\n\ndating costs hundreds of dollars — and weddings costs thousands\n\ndating is expensive. this 26-year-old new york male broke out his dating budget on refinery29. he spent $771 on 14 dates in a single month. date no. 1: wine bar ($91). date no. 2: bar ($40). date no. 3: dinner and drinks ($70), date no. 4: ingredients for dinner at home ($40). and that was just the first week.\n\nfor single people who have low incomes, the time and money involved in dating can be a huge hurdle toward eventually getting married, weigel said. and for those who can afford to date, there are numerous costs in addition to the time it takes to find a partner. in a way, it's the most ingenious commercial invention ever, to make the basic human desires for sex and affection engines of the consumer economy, weigel said.\n\nfrom the cost of dating apps and websites to the cost of dates, to personal maintenance including fitness and beauty, the desire to partner up supports multiple industries, she said.\n\nsee also:the death of the dinner date\n\nthere can be an emotional cost to being single, too, said bella depaulo, a social psychologist and the author of several books, including singled out: how singles are stereotyped, stigmatized and ignored, and still live happily ever after. she believes popular culture has an over-the-top obsession with celebrating marriage, weddings and proposals, a phenomenon she calls matrimania, while sending a message to single people that there's something wrong with them.\n\nthe looks of pity when you say you're not married, the lists of 'why, you're single,' it's all basically saying to single people, 'you're lesser than, and married people are better than you,' she said. the assumption is that what you want more than anything else is to become unsingle.\n\nof course, the amount many couples choose to spend on weddings offsets some of those dating costs single people face. the average cost of a wedding is more than $31,000, according to a survey of more than 16,000 brides who use the wedding website the knot, in 2014. (other data on people who don't use wedding planning websites put the cost at half that amount.) those who responded to the survey said $5,855 of that total was spent on the engagement ring.\n\ndating profile pics: seek professional help?\n\nemployment and tax benefits of being hitched\n\nperhaps one of the most significant benefits to marriage is the employer and government benefits only married people can receive. spouses can qualify for the other's social security benefits, contribute to their ira even when an individual has no taxable compensation, can inherit an estate with no tax penalty (for estates up to nearly $11 million in assets) and can take advantage of a spouse's health benefits.\n\ndepending on each spouse's income, married couples may also receive a tax benefit when filing taxes jointly, said mark steber, the chief tax officer at jackson hewitt, a tax-preparation company based in new jersey. (he noted that combining incomes could also mean moving into a higher tax bracket, which wouldn't be beneficial).\n\nplus, according to the family and medical leave act, employees of public agencies, schools and at companies of 50 or more people are allowed to take 12 work weeks off to care for a spouse, child or parent, but single people can't take that time for those they are close to but not related to; and if a single person is to become ill, it may be harder for someone else in their life to take time off to care for them, depaulo said.\n\nmarried couples may also be able to support one another when one person is temporarily out of work, or one spouse wants to take a lower-paying or riskier job, depaulo said. on the other hand, single people may be more free to make decisions about their careers without having to worry about the way it would impact others. depaulo said she was able to move across the country and change the focus of her research without having to worry about uprooting a family, she said.\n\nsee also:what unhappy couples can learn from johnny depp's divorce\n\ni'm more responsible and independent with my own finances, said denise, the single-named (and single) blogger. i'm learning the skills i need so i'm leading the life i want, and i'm not dependent on someone else.\n\nof course, marriage isn't so great if you have an acrimonious breakup. if you think paying taxes is bad, think about paying taxes and writing a check to your ex-spouse, podnos said. maybe the single life, she said, isn't so bad after all.
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nmany new couples inquire about a potential mate's age or how many previous partners they've had. others are more interested in another number.\n\napproximately 42% of adults say knowing someone's credit score would affect their willingness to date that person, according to a recent survey of 1,000 adults by personal finance website bankrate.com. that's up from nearly 40% last year. women were nearly three times as likely to consider credit score a major influence on a potential partner compared to men (20% versus 7%). younger daters are not as concerned about these three digits: 45% of older millennials, defined here as those aged 27 to 36, said they care about these three digits.\n\n credit scores reveal an individual's relationship skill and level of commitment, and trustworthiness. \n\nthis can be useful for people using dating sites like tinder, bumble, okcupid iac, -1.73% and match.com. a high credit score can help predict whether someone is trustworthy. similar credit scores are highly predictive of whether couples stay together, according to another 2015 paper by researchers at ucla, the brookings institution and federal reserve board, washington, d.c. initial credit scores and match quality predict subsequent credit usage and financial distress, which in turn are correlated with relationship dissolution, they wrote. credit scores reveal an individual's relationship skill and level of commitment.\n\nalso see:women don't see men who drive flashy cars as husband material\n\nprevious studies have documented the various traits by which individuals sort themselves into committed relationships, including race, educational attainment, and earning capacity, parental wealth, social caste and physical appearance, they wrote. credit scores are arguably the most prominent individual-level characteristic lenders use to underwrite credit. these three digits, therefore, help give single people a bird's eye view into a person's ability to meet future financial (and familial) obligations.\n\nby showing an interest in these three digits, people are probably being smart rather than shallow, says jeffrey hall, associate professor of communications at the university of kansas. finances, education, and job prospects all factor into the value of a potential mate, he says. assuming that people can actually interpret a credit score meaningfully, it makes sense they would think a credit score is useful in evaluating mate value.\n\n low credit scores can deny one access to a mortgage and increase the costs of loans by thousands of dollars. \n\nwhat people do and say in the early days of dating might have an impact later on. people are combining their finances when they marry, after all, and that can impact their future happiness. in fact, the higher your credit score, the less likely you'll separate from your partner — and a lower score often means you'll be less lucky in love. more than half of americans (58%) said they wouldn't marry someone with significant debt, according to a study released in march 2017 of more than 2,300 adults from legal industry site avvo.\n\nwhile knowing someone's credit score doesn't necessarily reveal whether that person has a medical or student debt or even their annual income, it does indicate whether they are eligible for a loan. a bank will look at each person's middle scores— from the three major credit bureaus, experian, equifax, and transunion — and then take a couple's average score to determine their overall credit worthiness. and a low credit score doesn't necessarily mean that you are irresponsible with money or even have no money. credit scoring models look at the amount a consumer owes versus the total amount of credit available, known as the credit utilization ratio.\n\nalso see: americans will talk about sex and infidelity before they talk about this…\n\nlow credit scores can deny one access to a mortgage or increase the costs of credit by thousands of dollars, says stephen brobeck, executive director of the consumer federation of america, a consumer advocacy group. credit scores are likely to increase the finance charges on a $20,000, 60-month car loan by more than $5,000.\n\nfor those who are interested in talking about this during a candle-lit dinner, they should know what it means. a score between 661 and 780 is considered good credit and between 781 and 850 is regarded as excellent credit, according to financial website credit.com. the site rates fair credit as between 601 and 660, poor credit between 501 and 600 and bad credit as anything below 500.\n\n previous research suggests women are more concerned about their potential partner's earning power than men. \n\nbut different lenders may have different criteria when it comes to loaning money, and may approve borrowers with a credit score of below 700. a high score effectively means that their prospective date has been paying their bills off on time, or only uses a small percentage of their available credit on credit cards.\n\ndon't miss: the larger the rock, the rockier the marriage\n\nstill, those millennials in bankrate's study might be too quick to judge. that age group also has the lowest credit scores of any generation of americans, a separate report released by credit bureau experian concluded. the report, based on anonymous data from experian's consumer credit database, found that millennials have an average credit score of 625 on an average debt of $52,120.\n\nby comparison, generation x (aged 35 to 49) have a credit score of 650 on average debt of $125,000, while both baby boomers and the greatest generation (with a combined age of between 50 and 87) have credit scores of 709 on average debt of $87,438. credit scores, experts say, are built on experience, and millennials have plenty of time to improve their digits.\n\nprevious research also supports the proposition that women are more concerned about their potential partner's earning power than men. too many women are still overly-focused on their romantic partner's holdings. in their minds, money equals power, and women want powerful men, says fran walfish, a beverly hills, calif.-based psychotherapist. money comes and goes, and you are always faced with each other.\n\nwalfish says the rich, famous and privileged flock into her office with the same ailments and issues as regular people, namely communication, sexual issues, parenting, and, most importantly, conflict resolution skills. financial responsibility runs through most of these issues, and can be a test for how willing people are to work together as a team to build a future. the goal for every person is to evolve as a complete, whole and self-reliant individual, she says.\n\n(this story was updated on feb. 14, 2019.)
pete buttigieg got personal about his marriage and his faith during a fundraising brunch with the lgbtq victory fund on sunday.\n\nthe openly gay south bend, ind., mayor and democratic presidential hopeful took aim at vice president mike pence, who has cited his evangelical christian faith as his reason for opposing the legalization of gay marriage.\n\nbuttigieg, who is episcopalian, countered that his same-sex marriage to chasten buttigieg has brought him closer to god.\n\n 'being married to chasten has made me a better human being because it has made me more compassionate, more understanding, more self-aware and more decent. my marriage to chasten has made me a better man. and yes, mr. vice president, it has moved me closer to god.'  — pete buttigieg\n\nbut buttigieg, 37, a lieutenant in the navy reserve who served a tour in afghanistan in 2014 and was also a rhodes scholar and a mckinsey & co. consultant, also admitted before the audience of lgbtq rights supporters that accepting his sexual orientation and coming out was a kind of war.\n\n 'it's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, i would have cut it out with a knife. if you had offered me a pill to make me straight, i would've swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water... thank god there was no pill. thank god there was no knife.'  — pete buttigieg\n\nhe noted that this is a struggle shared by many young people coming to terms with their sexuality and gender identity — but that if he hadn't accepted who he was, he never would have found his way to his husband chasten. he described his marriage as the best thing in his life.\n\nsee: south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg, an openly gay veteran, joins 2020 presidential race\n\nbuttigieg's added that he agrees marriage equality is a moral issue because of all the good that his relationship with his husband has brought him. and he recognized that many in the country are questioning whether america is ready for a gay president, or a same-sex first family in the white house. after all, three in 10 adults said they had some reservations toward, or would be very uncomfortable with, a gay candidate, according to a february nbc news/wall street journal poll.\n\nbuttigieg said that if fellow indianan pence and those who share his opposition to gay marriage have a problem with who he is, then they have a problem with his creator. because if being gay had been a choice, he said, than the choice was made far, far above my pay grade.\n\n 'and that's the thing i wish the mike pences of the world would understand: that if you have a problem with who i am, your problem is not with me. your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.'  — paul buttigieg\n\nhe said that in his youth, if there were a pill that would turn him straight, he'd have swallowed it before even being handed a glass of water, and if there were a part of his body that made him gay, he'd have cut it out with a knife, adding:\n\n 'thank god there was no pill. thank god there was no knife.'  — pete buttigieg\n\nbuttigieg's campaign has raised $7 million from nearly 159,000 donors in the year's first quarter. vermont sen. bernie sanders leads the pack opposing president trump's re-election in 2020 with $18 million from about 900,000 donations, followed by california democratic sen. kamala harris's campaign with $12 million and former texas rep. beto o'rourke's team with $9 million.\n\nsee:democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg is not a fan of chick-fil-a's politics — but does like its chicken
dear moneyist,\n\nmy sisters and i disagree on most things, but never could i have imagined how our relationship would end.\n\nmy parents put me down as the trustee and power of attorney for both their health care and finances in 1985, again in 2002 when they created a trust, and once again in 2014 when they updated the trust, and their various codicils since then.\n\ni am the oldest child, and i have also been the one responsible for them. i helped them with moving, i cleaned their house, and i took off work and cared for them when they were ill. my sisters were what i call armchair daughters. they yelled and screamed their opinions from their la-z-boys, but they never actually helped on any level.\n\nafter some difficult memory issues with my mom, she and i agreed to move her into assisted living in 2017. mom signed herself in and made her large one-bedroom apartment into a happy home. she played cards with new friends, gossiped with each other, and they called each other from their rooms.\n\n'mom was formally diagnosed with alzheimer's'\n\nin 2019, mom was formally diagnosed with alzheimer's. as her symptoms grew worse in the middle of last year, she became unhappy. her friends didn't want to play cards as much, as she couldn't remember the rules, which made her sad. some of her friends also passed away. she couldn't drive anymore or visit her sisters-in-law or brothers-in-law due to covid-19.\n\nmom asked to live with me, and i agreed. by this time, i was able to retire with sufficient income, and we happily started packing. one sister hated the idea of mom living with me. while most families would kill for this home-care option, and a sibling willing to do it, my sister railed against it.\n\nthis sister is the her way or the highway type of person, and she basically hates me. this was an issue growing up too. she displayed anger and jealousy, way beyond normal sibling rivalry, but dad and mom protected me. my parents even sent me to a boarding school for high school at my request, to get away from her. even my mom was scared of her.\n\n'my sister had mom taken away from me'\n\nthis sister decided to do things her way to get her result. mom fell and had a bruise on her leg, so without my knowledge or consent, my sister used that against me and had mom sign a new health-care power of attorney, putting her in charge.\n\nmy sister had mom taken away from me and thrown into a nursing home. i immediately hired an attorney and filed for guardianship. while we waited for the courts, i had a zoom visit with mom as she sobbed to get her out of there. mom caught covid and died days later.\n\n'my sister finally agreed with our attorneys to allow mom to live in my home, but this was only after she had been told mom tested positive for covid.'\n\nmy sister finally agreed with our attorneys to allow mom to live in my home, after wasting everyone's time and money, but this was only after she had been told mom tested positive for covid.\n\ni am so heartbroken and guilt-ridden that i couldn't do anything, and i am angry that the courts were slow to act. my mom died alone, thinking we had forgotten her.\n\nhow did my sister get this far? during the guardianship process, we discovered that the hospital would only admit mom for observation, but the administrative people at the assisted living facility said my sister threatened them if they didn't go along with the new health-care power of attorney.\n\nthe bank tellers who signed as witnesses on the new health-care power of attorney submitted letters to the courts pulling back their signed statements.\n\n'she lied about my mom's condition'\n\nwe also submitted requests for health records, and found out that my sister had lied about mom's condition. my sister also took all of mom's belongings out of her assisted-living home, including jewelry, tv and furniture, even though i am in charge of property for the trust.\n\ni am now executor of the small remaining trust, which is worth about $30,000 to $40,000. i have hired an attorney to help me administer it, but i have a few questions outside of her responsibilities. because my sister threw mom into the nursing home without researching the facility, i also consider that negligent.\n\nthis facility already had several covid deaths in early spring, and had terrible scores with the state throughout the year. what's more, a majority of the facility's employees were fired for alleged elder abuse. mom's best interests were never protected, and her request to live with me was denied. clearly my sister's interest was only controlling our mom and keeping her away from me.\n\nmom wrote me a check in 2016 for $48,000 out of money from the sale of their house (dad had passed away by then). this check was made out to me alone, and it came out of mom's personal account rather than the trust account.\n\neven though mom gave it to me, i used this money to pay for her assisted-living expenses. i also deposited money into her checking account over the years to cover her assisted-living costs. none of my sisters helped out with costs.\n\nthere is $20,000 left of this money, and it remains outside the trust. i also spent $18,000 on guardianship and attorney costs trying to get mom released from the nursing home. my family thinks i am required to place this $20,000 back into the family trust, for their benefit.\n\nwhat do you think?\n\ndistraught\n\nwant to read more? follow quentin fottrell on twitter and read more of his columns here.\n\ndear distraught,\n\nthank you for sharing your story. it must have taken a lot for you to write it down.\n\nwhat do you do now? you could use the evidence you have gathered to launch a case against your sister for elder and/or financial abuse, given the alleged subterfuge she engaged in to appoint herself as power of attorney and have your mother put in a nursing home, but that would likely be a lengthy and expensive process. a satisfying result against your sister or a suitable penalty is far from guaranteed. you have been through a lot, but this will not undo what has happened.\n\nyou may want to discuss with your family and/or your lawyer taking action against the nursing home where your mother stayed, or at the very least report the home to state authorities. what you described does not sound dissimilar from this case in pennsylvania filed by five current residents and 10 families of residents who died, alleging the home was understaffed, forcing the staff to cut corners while struggling to care for hundreds of residents during the pandemic.\n\n ask yourself how much restitution or retribution will satisfy you, and if it would satisfy you at all.  — the moneyist\n\nseparately, assuming that your mother was not diagnosed with dementia and was of sound mind in 2016, i see absolutely no reason why you should not keep the $20,000. you did your fair share of the work and more. you deposited money into her account to help your mother out with expenses, and spent years taking care of her. even if she gave this money to you as a gift to say thank you, it still belongs to you. you are under no legal, ethical or moral obligation to deposit it in a trust.\n\nwith that said, i do hope you manage to do something nice with the $20,000, perhaps as a way to remember your mother and the time you shared together. you could take a post-vaccination, post-covid vacation somewhere that your mother dreamed of going, or even take classes in a subject that you have always wanted to learn more about. using the money in a way that serves to elevate your spirit and improve your quality of life could mark the beginning of a healing journey.\n\nand your sister? ask yourself how much restitution or retribution will satisfy you, and if it would satisfy you at all. we all have a limited amount of time left on this earth, and how we choose to spend it is the most important decision we make every moment of every day. what we choose to dwell on while we roam the corridors of our mind should not take lightly. there's no point in flying to paris in 2022, for example, if you are still ruminating about your sister's misdeeds.\n\nultimately, this is your time and your money to use wisely. your mother would want that for you.\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group, where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com.\n\nby emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch. by submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
google and fitbit inc. announced last week that their merger had closed, but alphabet inc.'s antitrust woes may make the megadeal far from complete.\n\nthe controversial acquisition's conclusion sparked immediate pushback from sen. amy klobuchar, d-minn., ranking member and possible future chair of the senate's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, as well as several privacy-rights organizations, who object to the personal information that fitbit could feed into alphabet's googl, -0.08% goog, -0.07% data machine.\n\nwhile fitbit is firstly a personal health appliance, it gathers information, and highly personal information at that, st. john's university law professor anthony sabino told marketwatch. i can see justice being deeply concerned about google having access to such intimate customer information via fitbit, and it would not surprise me in the least to see it raised as an issue in the antitrust lawsuit.\n\nfor its part, the u.s. justice department maintains it has not given formal clearance to the deal and it is still under scrutiny, even though it let the deadline pass on formal opposition last week, according to a wall street journal report. next steps may depend on who president-elect joe biden installs in key positions.\n\nantitrust experts are keenly following who will lead the justice department's antitrust efforts in the biden administration — candidates range from terrell mcsweeney, who is considered corporate-friendly, to the progressive jonathan kanter. federal trade commission chairman joseph simons, set to step down jan. 29, oversaw antitrust investigations of facebook inc. fb, +1.69% and amazon.com inc. amzn, +1.42% . his replacement will not only play a big role in how investigations are done, but will face pressure from the two democrats on the five-member commission who say simons wasn't aggressive enough, said duane pozza, a former assistant director in the division of financial practices at the ftc.\n\nsuch are the stakes as the federal government and state attorneys general press on with antitrust investigations of google, and a democratic-controlled white house and senate takeover.\n\nlegal actions against other members of big tech are gaining steam. last week, connecticut attorney general william tong disclosed that state has an active and ongoing antitrust investigation into amazon regarding potentially anticompetitive terms in distribution agreements the company has for electronic books with some publishers.\n\nfor now, however, the focus is on google, which has been sued by the doj, a group of state ags led by the state of texas, and another group led by the ags of colorado and nebraska in recent months.\n\ngoogle and antitrust: big tech's first target is facing mounting legal action\n\ngoogle has maintained — as it does for most of its actions — that the fitbit deal will greatly benefit consumers and has been properly vetted by regulators.\n\ngoogle will continue to protect fitbit users' privacy and has made a series of binding commitments with global regulators, confirming that fitbit users' health and wellness data won't be used for google ads and this data will be kept separate from other google ad data, fitbit chief executive james park said in a letter to fitbit users thursday.\n\nbut could the justice department or the two state suits undermine the deal's status under a new administration and democratic-controlled senate? technically, yes, though it would be highly unusual since it has already been approved, said douglas gansler, an expert in antitrust law and former attorney general of maryland.\n\naccording to the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, deals can proceed if no official objection is received from the justice department during the waiting period. google completed the waiting period, and is thus within its rights to close the deal. by the same token, the justice department can also maintain its investigation after the waiting period. it is unusual for regulators to undo a transaction after the waiting period, but there is a certain risk that it might happen, according to miller.\n\na theory floated by bhaskar chakravorti, dean of global business at tufts university's the fletcher school, is that democrats could apply a plan for a glass-steagall act for the internet. the 1933 law forced banks to separate their commercial and investment banking activities to ensure the combinations did not dampen competition. in the context of tech, that could mean forcing social-media companies to run their platforms separately from applications and businesses that profit from user data.\n\nany deal that google makes, especially with a device maker, has some instability built into it, he said.\n\nstill, the justice department passed on the opportunity to file an objection before the deal closed, making it extremely difficult to reverse course, say legal scholars.\n\nsabino of st. john's university said it is highly unlikely the doj will rescind its approval of the deal. it passed on opposition even as it was conducting an investigation that led to its antitrust lawsuit in october, and the european union gave the acquisition an ok last month. it would simply be inequitable to go back now, sabino told marketwatch.\n\nhe added, however, that the purchase of fitbit shall have implications in the pending [doj] antitrust lawsuit. after all, a linchpin of the federal government's litigation (as joined in by about two dozen or more states now) is google's ability to gather information about users from google searches, youtube usage, and so forth.\n\nand then there is the matter of the historic pandemic and economic mess inherited by the biden administration, which could put antitrust cases against big tech on the back burner.\n\ntech antitrust issues are not going to get the necessary pushing and prodding from the white house, so the entire agenda may be on simmer even if there are many house democrats — and prominent senators, such as amy klobuchar — keen to pursue it, chakravorti said.\n\nklobuchar does seem very keen on going after the deal.\n\ngoogle's announcement that it is closing its acquisition of fitbit while the transaction is still under review by the justice department is yet another sign of the company's troubling lack of concern for complying with the antitrust laws, klobuchar said in a statement last week.\n\nthe rush to complete its deal before biden administration enforcers take charge is all the more disturbing, said the senator, who opposes large tech acquisitions. despite the premature completion of this merger, i continue to urge the department to seek all appropriate remedies under the law to protect competition and consumers from any anticompetitive effects caused by this transaction.\n\nthe appetite to challenge the merger over antitrust concerns also remains high among privacy advocates, who fear the repercussions of megadeals like fitbit.\n\nthe justice department's failure to stop google's acquisition of fitbit is not only incoherent and embarrassing, it is also dangerous. this deal poses serious security risks to fitbit consumers' personal data, said sarah miller, executive director of the american economic liberties project. google uses its vast portfolio of internet services to spy on its users and profit off of highly personal information. there is no reason to believe they will not do the same thing with fitbit.\n\nin fact, google has lied to antitrust enforcers about data before. as a blockbuster antitrust suit against google explained last month, the company made promises to both the federal trade commission and congress about how it would manage its acquisition of doubleclick, which google then ignored, added miller.\n\npresident-elect biden should ensure his administration acts to reverse this deal as soon as possible, miller said.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband is a divorced father of three dependents. we will soon be married for 10 years. we filed joint tax returns the first 5 years. however, after learning that my husband was in trouble with back taxes i quickly moved to filing separately. i already filed bankruptcy with him in 2012 and sacrificed my credit for the cause, but i've been able to show excellent credit worthiness and currently show a fico score of 645.\n\nif i could just learn how to move the chess pieces on the board correctly, i could get us out of the mess my husband has caused.\n\ndon't miss:my boyfriend and i have two kids — should i pay off his $130,000 student debt?\n\ni am self employed as a massage therapist and i also work a second job on weekends. while it's impossible to show my entire income due to the nature of my job, i would say that i make approximately $65,000 per year. i pay all of my bills on time, make much more than minimum payments, no longer use my credit cards so that i can get rid of my debt and raise my credit rating, and i'm saving cash in several different places from a cash box under the bed to trowe price online. every week, i save as much as i can and i am no longer living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n 'i believe he was simply overwhelmed at the time and wasn't thinking clearly how all of this would impact my life.' \n\nmy credit does, however, show the irs debt that my husband racked up without my knowledge, back when he was unemployed and then employed as a consultant. unfortunately, his three children were abandoned by their mother, and due to their special needs, my husband was unable to put money aside to pay his taxes while they were living with us for two years.\n\nafter i became ill from the stress of the situation, the children went back to living with their mother and i got better in about six months. but i was not aware of the debt my husband racked up, even when tax time came around and he asked me to sign our joint tax returns. i don't think my husband kept it from me on purpose. i believe he was simply overwhelmed at the time and wasn't thinking clearly how all of this would impact my life, our marriage and our credit.\n\nalso without my knowledge, my husband allowed the irs as well as the state of new jersey to put liens on our home. the state even went as far as to levy my bank account and even put a stop on my vehicle, which blocked me from even registering my car. this problem has all but taken the life out of our marriage and i now realize that marrying him truly was a mistake.\n\n 'the state even went as far as to levy my bank account and vehicle, which blocked me from even registering my car.' \n\nsadly, i must keep going on and trying to repair at least my own life. my husband continues to make minimum payments, runs his credit cards right back up to maximum, and even misses payments. most recently, we received an insurance check to repair our roof that's been leaking for many years, and i've just been made aware that he spent it; all of it. i am beyond upset over this.\n\nfurthermore, the other half of our home, which we moved out of three years ago to allow for a tenant to help our financial situation, has still not been completed. while i don't understand what my husband is doing or even thinking at this point, i've got to get this home repaired, the rental completed, or to sell the whole house and get out of here!\n\nalso see:before i give my fiancée a $7,000 diamond engagement ring, i want her to promise to bequeath it to my daughter\n\nall of that said, i am now looking to get a bit of the equity out of the house in order to make the desperately needed repairs and to get to the point where we can sell, take in the tenant for extra income in order to save for retirement and to increase the value of the house overall. the problem is that my husband makes the money ($160,000 a year), but has bad credit. i can't show my income and i have the good credit.\n\n 'we have only have my secret savings and the irs debt on the mortgage. my name is not on the mortgage.' \n\nwe have my secret savings and the irs debt on the mortgage. my name is not on the mortgage. i am listed as a debtor through marriage, so even if i were to up and leave this man, the debt would follow. if my husband were to refile for bankruptcy, the irs lien on the house would open up the equity and release the lien on the house, but they would still come after me, and all of the hard work i've done for my credit will be abolished.\n\nwhat can we do? my thoughts are that he files for bankruptcy, we then pay the irs on a plan together for a time, use my credit to get ahead and then work out some sort of amnesty with the irs. between the mortgage, the child support he pays and the extra state and irs expenses, we are in a stalemate position. please help with any suggestion possible!\n\nplease feel free to post this story if you think it might help others.\n\ndistraught wife\n\ndear distraught,\n\nif you were a chess piece, you would be the pawn.\n\ni'm not sure what piece your husband represents. i do know, however, that he only makes his move when you are not looking. you helped him, you suffered, and now you face the same financial maelstrom again. your next move should be a knight in the form of a lawyer, who can advise you (not your husband) on how to extricate you from his finances and figure out what you are responsible for.\n\nrecommended:should two people with $1 million in debt even consider getting married?\n\ni have two pieces of advice for you: 1. he lied to you by omission. people don't change. your husband has proven that. all the signs point to a future where you spend a lifetime digging him out of holes. 2. your trust has been broken. separate your emotions from your finances. he asked you sign documents without giving you the facts, involving you in his misdeeds.\n\n he lied to you. people don't change. your husband has proven that. you will spend a lifetime digging him out of holes. \n\nbeing overwhelmed is no excuse for premeditated financial infidelity. he has lured you unwittingly into his mess and now you are desperate to find a way out because you feel you are trapped. a tax attorney can help advise you on your options regarding your home, a divorce and/or legal separation, and spousal forgiveness from the internal revenue service.\n\nyou must meet all of these criteria to qualify, according to the irs. read them here. among them: you establish that at the time you signed the joint return you did not know, and had no reason to know, that there was an understatement of tax. taking into account all the facts and circumstances, it would be unfair to hold you liable for the understatement of tax.\n\n your trust has been broken. he involved you in his misdeeds. it's time to separate your emotions from your finances. \n\nyour husband's salary may provide you with a feeling of financial security and give him leverage to overspend, but it's no way to live. you can live within your means in a smaller home, according to your own rules of fiscal responsibility. you're better off paying tax on your tips than using them to pay your husband's debt. that only draws you further into this moral maze.\n\ntake heart from this comment on the moneyist facebook group: i had a similar situation with my ex-husband but it involved his gambling debt. divorce and a good attorney was my solution. today, nine years later, i have a good job, savings, retirement savings, and i have found a good man/husband who believes in the financial peace we both work toward.\n\nbe the king or queen in your next relationship. or both.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

are we in the midst of a great religious recession?\n\na number of studies show that younger people are less religious than older people, and religiosity has declined with each successive generation. in the 2015 pew research center report on religion and public life, 36% of 21- to 27-year-olds are classified as unaffiliated, a far higher proportion than among their parents' (17%) or grandparents' (11%) generations.\n\nin extensive interviews with parents and their 18- to 29-year-olds for our book, getting to 30: a parent's guide to the 20-something years, we found that religious questioning is part of the identity explorations woven into this life stage.\n\nwhen a family's religious beliefs are questioned\n\nmost emerging adults feel that it would be wrong for them simply to accept what their parents and others have taught them about religious issues. their inquiry sometimes leads to a confirmation of their childhood beliefs, but more often to modifying them, and sometimes to a wholesale rejection.\n\nrather than holding to traditional beliefs, the majority of 20-somethings typically have a vague but inclusive belief in a god who watches over the world and wants people to be good to each other.\n\n criticizing young people for their beliefs (or absence of beliefs) will not bring them back to your religion and make them accept what you believe. \n\nfor some parents, their children's religious choices are a hot button topic; for others, the subject is almost a nonissue. if parents don't have a strong religious affiliation or commitment to spiritual seeking, then what their 20-somethings believe is of little interest or concern to them; they may not even know.\n\nparents can see religious acceptance as a measure of success\n\nbut when parents' religious beliefs are central to their worldview and daily lives, their emerging adult's beliefs may be one of the most important measures of their success or failure as parents: success if their children accept and embrace the beliefs they were taught, and failure if they don't.\n\nfor these parents, their responses to what their grown-up kids believe may be emotionally complex, fraught with meaning about their worthiness as parents. below are some questions you may be facing, and our answers.\n\nwhat if your 20-something doesn't want to celebrate religious occasions with you?\n\neven if older and younger generations no longer share religious beliefs, it is not unreasonable for parents to expect their children to take part in family traditions — easter at uncle mike's or passover at grandma's. some young people may resist, because they feel it would be hypocritical (not to mention boring) for them to take part in rituals they no longer believe in.\n\ngrowing up as digital natives, connected to high-speed media all day, they may feel the pace and peace of a typical religious service is like walking through the door to an earlier (and much less exciting) century, a place where they may feel like strangers in a strange land.\n\nin truth, it will be a sign of their maturity when they can go along with such family occasions out of respect for their parents, without feeling threatened or defensive. but if they're not willing, at this age they can't be forced to go.\n\nwhat if your emerging adult moves away from your faith?\n\nfor some parents with deeply-held traditional beliefs, emotions run especially strong on this topic: they may criticize or even reject their children as punishment for not remaining in the fold.\n\nwe sympathize with parents who find themselves in this situation, where children are straying from their family's core beliefs. however, keep in mind that a rejecting response is unlikely to be effective.\n\ncriticizing young people for their beliefs (or absence of beliefs) will not bring them back to your religion and make them accept what you believe. in fact, given the importance that emerging adults place on making their own decisions, trying to force them to believe anything is more likely to make them dig in their heels and become even more resistant.\n\na reality of modern life is that people get to decide for themselves what to believe, and emerging adults today feel they have not just a right but an obligation to make that decision (among others) on their own.\n\nturn the other cheek may be the wisest course here. the best way to persuade children of the value of your faith is to show the fruits of it in your life, including your capacity to forgive your sons and daughters for not believing what you believe.\n\nwhat if your 20-something is more religious than you?\n\nthere are also parents who are surprised to find that their children grow up to be more religious in emerging adulthood than they were at younger ages, and more devout than their parents are — young jewish adults who keep strictly kosher when their parents were more laissez-faire or young muslim women who wear head scarves when their mothers did not.\n\nthe national study of youth and religion surveyed more than 2,500 young people and found that about a quarter of 13- to 17-year-olds who were classified as nonreligious became christians by the time they were 18 to 23.\n\nthis switch can be as hard for nonreligious parents as the change from believer to nonbeliever is for devout parents. in both cases, it is jarring for parents to realize that their children have adopted a way of seeing the world that is radically different than their own.\n\nbut for nonreligious parents, it may be helpful to see this as a measure of their belief in the value of encouraging their children to think for themselves. if you believed they should make their own decisions about matters of faith, it makes sense that you should respect what they have decided upon, even if their choice is different than yours.\n\nwhat if your son or daughter marries someone from a different faith?\n\ninterfaith marriage and wedding ceremonies bring many religious issues to center stage. where will the wedding be held and who will officiate, if there are two different traditions to accommodate?\n\nsometimes a compromise is reached with a clergy person from each tradition present. or, for example, an interfaith hindu and christian couple may have a traditional hindu henna-painting ritual first and later a less formally religious ceremony. sometimes the path of least resistance is a nondenominational ceremony with a judge or nonreligious officiant.\n\nit's also true, statistically, that people in interfaith marriages are less likely to practice any religion, and children of interfaith marriages tend to receive less religious training. however, there are exceptions, and if your son's or daughter's faith is important to them, they may be among them.\n\nin any case, your job is done here. you did your best to raise them in the faith that is important to you. the more you express your faith through love, forgiveness and generosity of heart, the more attractive the faith is likely to seem, to your grown children, their partners and their family-to-be.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy brother had been staying at my mother's home at the time of her passing in march 2000. shortly after she died, he told me, don't worry, you have been handsomely provided for. he said that he hadn't actually seen her will yet, but that is what he had been told.\n\na few days later he called me to tell me that she had left me $10,000. he also said that he needed to go through all of her paperwork, get her affairs in order, pay off her bills, etc. and then he would get back to me.\n\nin about a week or so, he called again to say that after paying her bills, there was barely any money left. i found this very hard to believe but a few weeks after that, the exact amount of cash that i finally received from him was $300.\n\nshe had left him her condo that she bought in 1996 and also her 1995 ford probe that she had paid cash for in 1995. at that time, both my brother and his girlfriend each had their own cars but my husband and i did not even have one. i asked him, since i am only getting $300, do you think that at least i could please have the car? i was very happily surprised when he quickly agreed and suggested we go to the department of motor vehicles to transfer the title and registration the following day.\n\n my mother's will is handwritten in a legal format. it did stated that i was to receive $10,000 from her investments. my brother said that after paying her bills, there was barely any money left. i found this very hard to believe, but a few weeks later he sent me $300.  — betrayed sister\n\nwhile at the dmv the next day, the clerk asked him for all of the relevant paperwork needed for the transfer to be completed. this included her will. after she was finished looking at it and handed it back to him, he said, here, would you like this. it's only a copy. you can have it. i gratefully took it as i had never actually seen it before.\n\nthe will is handwritten in a legal format. it did indeed state that i was to receive $10,000 from her investments as well as some specific items of hers which i had already received. it also stated for my brother to receive her condo and her car as well as for many different items of hers to go to specific people. (to my aunt and to several of her dear friends)\n\nmy brother and i had always been close with each other and we were both very close to our mom. on the way home from the dmv, my brother began to say things to me that were unusually harsh. in essence, the condo was his now, not mom's. don't just be stopping by anytime. come get your stuff out from the garage, etc. i found this really strange and hurtful. i was in tears driving back to my house in the probe that was now mine. i told my husband what had happened and neither of us could understand why he would say such things.\n\nanyway, one day i decided to go to [redacted] bank for myself just to see what the status was with my mom's accounts. they told me that my brother had closed them out back in april of that year and they no longer existed. they did not have the amount of what her balance had been at that time.\n\nthe moneyist: what to do about your finances during a divorce\n\none afternoon about six months later, i cannot tell you why but something was telling me that i needed to look at the will again. i ran to the dresser where i kept it and i began to re-read it very closely looking at every written word and every letter of my mom's writing. then i took out my magnifying glass because i wanted to be 100% sure.\n\nto my amazement, this is what i found. he (or somebody) had created a dollar sign ($) out of the first original digit in the figure making it $10,000. she had left me $110,000. i have never told my brother that i know about this. i have barely spoken with him more than a handful of times over the last 16 years.\n\nhiring an attorney has always been out of the question because of how much they charge just to get a case started. unfortunately, my husband and i have never had the extra dollars in our budget. i do know that there is no statute of limitations in the california family court. this has been bothering me for years. that dirty rotten, piece of **** brother of mine had stolen all of my inheritance!\n\nbetrayed sister\n\nlisten to our podcast about the ethics and legalities of caring for parents in old age\n\ndear betrayed,\n\nfirst, your frustration and feelings about your brother are palpable. i took the liberty of inserting some asterisks into your letter and i redacted the name of the bank. (and your exclamation mark already illustrates your feelings about your brother nicely.) secondly, you have sat on this resentment and legal issue for 16 years. johnny rotten of the sex pistols once sang anger is an energy and, as unpleasant and corrosive as that emotion can be, it can also serve a purpose. it can either motivate us to take action and/or become a constant reminder that someone has done us wrong. unfortunately, your anger appears to have led to the latter.\n\n the more time that goes by, the harder it becomes to prove a case such as this. but it's never too late to see what, if anything, can be done — so you can either find a resolution.  — the moneyist\n\nthe more time that goes by, the harder it becomes to prove a case such as this. but it's never too late to see what, if anything, can be done — so you can either find a resolution (one that involves a check for $110,000) or put this issue to bed with the knowledge that you have done everything you can, and move on with your life. i understand that you can't afford a fancy lawyer, but there are free legal services in california and some attorneys do take cases on a pro bono basis (that is, without charging) if they think that you have a chance of winning. in this case, the court that administrated the estate should have a copy of the original will.\n\ndon't miss:my mother wants to give me 70% of her estate — my sister is furious\n\ntime is not your friend when filing a case. in california, any interested person has 120 days after a will is admitted to probate to contest the will and may petition the court to revoke the probate of the will. allowing so much time to slip by could cause another problem.\n\nthere are exceptions to this 120-day rule, however: the presence of extrinsic fraud in the procurement of the court order. and: the court order is based on the erroneous determination of the decedent's death. even if you won, state law may have little impact, says george teitelbaum, a lawyer specializing in wills, probate and trusts in wheaton, md. if there were not enough funds to pay her $10,000 there certainly were not enough for $110,000.\n\nmaybe there was $110,000 in your mother's estate at the time of her death and maybe not. and perhaps your brother did alter your mother's will. or maybe he didn't. (for what it's worth, it seems like a rather crude way to steal a family inheritance and i am surprised that a court would overlook a clumsily doctored will.)\n\nrevisit this with your brother to get to the truth, with the help of a pro bono lawyer or free legal aid. people get greedy when they see an easy way of dipping their hand into the proverbial cookie jar. i'm thinking here of the brother who wanted his mother to sign over her house and the stepmother who wondered if the death of her stepchildren would hurt her husband's credit score. that cookie jar makes people crazy.\n\ndon't let it make you crazy. if you have been the victim of fraud and your valiant legal efforts still come to naught, light a candle for your mother and move on.\n\ndo you want to find out what happened? read here in moneyist revisited.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
i restarted my career five years ago, after a decadeslong hiatus. previously, i'd been editor in chief of five national consumer publications with hundreds of bylines. but by the time i re-entered the field (after having my now 7-year-old daughter in my 40s), it was no longer recognizable. suddenly working with much younger colleagues has been challenging, but i've figured out how to do it well. if you follow my advice, i think you will, too.\n\nalthough at first i felt like a dinosaur, today i'm a respected member of the publishing and blogging community, as well as a writing coach. my circuitous path from seasoned newbie to valued mentor and inspiring role model comprised several strategies. these days, i love working with young people, and i'd like to say i think they love working with me.\n\n6 tips to work with much younger colleagues\n\nmy six tips for working well with much younger colleagues:\n\n1. play to your experience. you have decades to draw on, and your younger workers may find that valuable. when i was reinventing myself, i drew up a short list of what i thought i could offer millennials. for example i had worked on small-staffed print publications that were run much like the way digital staffs are. i also had contacts, deep knowledge of the publishing industry and access to professional associations like the american society of journalists and authors (asja), where i've been working with younger staff in my role as chair for the asja writer's conference.\n\nmy experience has also helped ease the mental state of some of my younger colleagues. because i have worked with so many personality types in my long career, i don't freak out with setbacks like production delays or sources gone dry. my now calm demeanor (speaking as someone who was very high strung when i was younger) helps soothe the nerves of people i work with in their 20s and 30s.\n\nhow to make sure you never run out of money\n\n2. elevate your social media profile. younger workers — who spend more time on social media sites than older generations — feel that you can relate to their lives better if you're on social media channels. unfortunately, many workers in their 50s and 60s don't know how to maximize their social media and don't even try. that's a mistake.\n\nafter making a conscious effort to be more visible on social media, i now have a widely followed blog, large profiles on most social media sites and a verified twitter account with nearly 12,000 followers. younger workers respect me for that.\n\ni recommend that older workers get a twitter twtr, -4.75% and snapchat snap, -8.73% account, tell their younger colleagues about this, retweet them and share their business-oriented posts on social media.\n\n3. surrender the phone. here's what rajean blomquist, digital content manager at everywhereagency.com, says about how she has accommodated to younger workers' style: i use abbreviated text and giphy.com to share gifs to express my feelings and reactions. i know i won't be communicating by phone, it is nearly all online via slack, email, and skype, peppered with humor, and more profanity acceptable in the workforce than i have been used to, but i roll with it.\n\ni couldn't agree more. conversing through technology that millennials prefer has been a big change for me, but a big help working with a younger generation.\n\n4. act as if. i used to try too hard to ingratiate myself with younger colleagues, but eventually i realized i didn't have to expend that much energy. that realization gave me confidence, and millennials tend to find confidence appealing.\n\nthink about the jungle: the lion is the most powerful animal, but doesn't exert energy until necessary. these days, i am calm when working and when i speak, i do so with authority, while avoiding long-winded monologues (which younger workers hate).\n\n5. ask for reverse mentoring. many companies such as target, tgt, +0.73% cisco, csco, -1.10% colgate palmolive, cl, +0.31% unitedhealth group unh, +2.96% and ey (formerly ernst & young) find reverse mentoring effective. it's an opportunity for younger workers to advise senior ones on the technology their generation prefers and how they like to engage. at ey, says reverse mentoring program manager jeff stiers, topics can include technology, social media, change management and flexibility; the younger worker sets the agenda.\n\nmillennials respond really well if they feel you value, trust and empower them, says stiers.\n\nmodeling that approach, i have asked people in their 20s and 30s for help on things they're experts at, like snapchat or google analytics. most have been glad to help. that makes sense to stiers. because they aren't used to it, if you do get face time with them, it can hold a lot of value, he says.\n\nlaney zukerman, author and relationship expert says:  by creating a mind-set that we can learn from them, the relationship can be harmonious. in turn, they respect and admire the life lessons we offer.\n\n6. do the time shift. millennials entered the workforce during one of the most economically challenging times since the great depression, so they've typically adapted a live now mentality. to better relate to them, i read the book time shifting: creating more time to enjoy your life, which says that by focusing on the now, we can take back control of our lives.\n\ni've since learned how to stop dwelling on disappointments or the past, and i'm much happier. when stressed, i repeat this mantra from 'time shifting:' i'm fine just as i am right now, this moment in time. this helped stabilize my breathing and my emotions. it makes me easier to work with and wouldn't have happened without the inspiration of my younger colleagues.\n\nthe bottom line\n\nshow younger workers that they can benefit from the wisdom of your age and resourcefulness and that you value what they value — social media and technology. then, you'll reap the professional and financial rewards.
brangelina like it quick.\n\nat least, when it comes to their divorce. brad pitt and angelina jolie have reportedly asked retired judge john ouderkirk, who officiated at their wedding, to oversee the divorce. it's a move that could mean their divorce is finalized as soon as march: hiring a private judge — typically a retired attorney or judge who oversees a civil case — means they don't have the deal with the famously backlogged california courts. all parties must agree on a private judge — which means that both jolie and pitt gave ouderkirk the go ahead.\n\nhis cost: $450 an hour, according to alternative resolution centers, a legal services provider ouderkirk works with. that's cheap by la standards, where private judges often charge anywhere from $500 or $700 an hour. (alternative resolution centers declined to comment on ouderkirk's professional relationship with pitt and jolie.)\n\nof course, pitt and jolie will also have to pay their divorce lawyers. top divorce lawyers charge fees of about $1,000 an hour, so 60 minutes in family court could run pitt and jolie upwards of $1,225 each. (the firm of jolie's divorce attorney, laura wasser, declined comment on her fees; the firm of pitt's representative, lance spiegel, didn't have information immediately available.)\n\nthe ex-lovers likely chose the private judge route as it offers more privacy. while all divorce hearings are technically public, private judges typically hold sessions in offices that aren't easily accessible to reporters. california also requires that strict criteria be met before court documents can be sealed as the press and public have a right to know, says anita rae shapiro, a private judge who sat on the la county superior court. however, private judges aren't required to file their judgments publicly if both sides comply with terms. (when pitt divorced jennifer aniston in 2005, they also used a private judge.)\n\nthe rub: private judges can't order that an agreement be enforced by the authorities, so if you want to take action, you have to go back to the court system, says shapiro. still, unless pitt and jolie end up fighting over alimony and child custody, their divorce agreement could never see the light of day.\n\nhow credit scores predict what you will buy next\n\nnon bold-faced names could still have reason to hire a private judge. this route can end your marriage quickly, especially if there's a backlog in their local courts, and sometimes save you money. private judges, which typically run $300 to $700 an hour, are often available for full day hearings that start punctually. when you use a regular judge, you could wind up compensating your lawyer for hanging out at the courthouse if a previous session runs late. this route is also good for someone who doesn't want the public to have access to intimate details of their marriage, especially if there's a fear of identity theft or being extorted by someone who chances across their divorce papers, says florida lawyer jorge cestero.
dear moneyist,\n\nwe've been married for five years — happily, or so i thought.\n\nwe have shared all our assets prior to our marriage, including our current accounts and bank accounts, etc. i continued to work for five years after we married, and i just retired at 65. my husband is 71 and was retired before i met him, his only income being social security benefits. as an only child, he recently inherited his parents' home and a large sum of money.\n\nthe moneyist:my mom asked for a divorce. my dad made his mother his pension beneficiary — and then he killed himself. now my mom and grandma are feuding. who's right?\n\nto my surprise, he has not added my name to the house or the bank accounts that belonged to his parents. we have no wills at this point, and we live in california. i understand that an inheritance is not community property unless you make it so. if the shoe were on the other foot, i would have added his name to the deed. i'm hurt and i'm apprehensive about where i stand.\n\nshould i tell him how i feel? can you give me some advice?\n\nhurt wife\n\ndear hurt,\n\nhere's the good news: you stand exactly where you stood the moment before your husband received word of his inheritance. your place in this relationship has not changed. i do have a question for you: if you were married 35 years, would you still be hurt that he did not add you to the deed? i wonder if your apprehension is related to a feeling of financial and emotional insecurity within the relationship that would, perhaps, not have existed if you were married longer.\n\nafter all, how well do we really know someone? after 35 years, we may have a pretty good handle on that. after five years, there is still so much we don't know about other people, like how they handle stressful situations like job loss, death and serious illness, and unexpected surprises like a sudden promotion at work, a surge in their stock portfolio or a windfall. i've been on this planet for 40-something years and, honestly, i'm still getting to know myself. it's a process.\n\nthe moneyist: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\nyou say that if the shoe were on the other foot, you would have added him to the deed. how soon would you add him? within 24 hours, one week, six months or a year? or would life get in the way and — given that you consider that this property belongs to both of you, anyway — perhaps you wouldn't get around to doing it? i ask because we never really know what any of us would do in any situation until it actually happens. we are comforted by the certainty of our own theoretical actions.\n\nit's worth looking at this scenario from your husband's perspective, too. if you inherited this estate, would he have expected you to add his name by now, or even at all? if he told you that he was hurt that you had not added him, would you say, i was just about to do it! and would you quietly think, why does he care so much? is he not as happy as i thought? does he think i'm hedging my bets in the event we divorce? does he want to make sure he inherits half in case we divorce?\n\n\n\nthe moneyist: my father left everything to my son. when i called the attorney about the will, my son got very upset. i now need financial help. should i ask him for money?\n\nexpectations that a person should do something we believe to be the correct action often leads to hurt feelings. but there's no right or wrong decision here. inheritance is not community property because the court regards it as fair and equitable for a married spouse not to inherit half of the home should they divorce. that seems fair to me. your husband has maintained that status quo. he has taken no action. indeed, he could be hurt or offended if you asked him to put your name on the deed.\n\nthere are caveats: if you refinanced the home or undertook a major renovation using joint assets, that would likely convert it from separate to community property. but that would obviously be a disingenuous (at best) way of dealing with this situation. i'm not for a moment suggesting you would do such a thing, but i have no doubt that people have made this mistake and were taken by surprise that the home was no longer considered separate property when they divorced.\n\nthe moneyist: my stepfather and mother pooled resources to buy a home. my mom died in 2003 and he just passed away. his kids are selling their house — am i entitled to anything?\n\ni suggest you continue living your life — and do nothing. if your husband does contemplate an action that would convert this home into community property, make him aware of the implications of his decision. perhaps say, are you aware that this would commingle your family home with our marital assets? i would hate for it to happen, and i don't think it ever would, but what if something went wrong in our marriage and we decided to divorce? it may be unlikely, but it's not impossible.\n\nmost people retire at 65 or older. you continued working after you met, i assume, to maximize your retirement benefits and because getting married is not a reason to give up work and/or retire early. be happy for your husband's inheritance. help him celebrate. there are no perfect marriages. they do not exist, because perfect people don't exist. that's ok. give your husband and yourself a break. we're all human. participate in his joy. ask him about his memories of growing up in the house.\n\nmake this inheritance about him rather than about you.\n\nthe moneyist:my father-in-law's business went south and my mother-in-law has never worked a day in her life. how can i avoid supporting them?\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published?

andy hill, the 37-year-old blogger and podcaster behind marriage, kids and money, went from sorely lacking in retirement savings — to maxing out his 401(k) plan the last six years.\n\nthe father of two, who is also a sales director for a marketing company in michigan, said he's been amazed by the power of automation, and has already saved more than $130,000. aside from setting it and forgetting it, hill said he researched low-cost index funds and rode the stock market as it climbed upward. when you're in your 30s, it is tough to think of what retirement might look like in your 60s, but what gets us both excited is how compound interest can make a big leap, he said.\n\nhill and his wife, nicole, also paid off their mortgage in four years, and already max out their roth individual retirement accounts.\n\nsee: this 24-year-old is on track to save $100,000 by age 25, and she has advice for other women who want to be rich\n\nreaching the maximum limit for 401(k) contributions (which is $19,000 in 2019 and an additional $6,000 for those 50 and older) is not an easy feat, and only a fraction of investors actually accomplish it. only 13% of participants maxed out their 401(k) in 2017 (when the limit was $18,000), according to a 2018 vanguard report about its investors. what's more, these investors had higher incomes, were older and had longer tenure at their employers. comparatively, 9.1% of workers whose 401(k) plans are managed by fidelity investments reached the cap, up slightly from 9% at the end of 2017 and 8.1% at the end of 2013. boomers were most likely to max out their 401(k) plans, followed by generation x, and lastly millennials.\n\nwhere should i retire? marketwatch will give you a customized list of the best places for you\n\nhill acknowledges income growth is a crucial part of maxing out a 401(k) or other workplace retirement account, but that may not come naturally. a few ways to see an increase in earnings include looking for jobs with upward mobility (when possible) or negotiating a salary during the hiring process. employees should also take the company match for a 401(k), which is often called free money, if they can, and look at how their retirement portfolio is invested, as not all funds are the same.\n\ndon't miss:this is what it really takes to become a 401(k) millionaire\n\nthey didn't deprive themselves of everything, occasionally going out with friends or taking a vacation, but they used other savings techniques, like eating many home-cooked meals. the pastor, who also blogs at pfgeeks, acknowledges he and his wife were also privileged to graduate college without student debt. they recently bought a home, and have a car loan, but didn't put as much down on the mortgage or paid off their auto loan because they know they'll be able to do that in a timely manner, unlike saving for retirement. you can get a loan for a car, but when you're 65, you can't get a loan to live, he said.\n\nmaxing out a 401(k) at any age will help in retirement, but especially the sooner one starts. the same is true of simply beginning to save any bit for retirement. the amount ultimately accumulated for retirement is a function of not only the amount set aside, but also the time frame and rate of return, said peter palion, a financial adviser and president of master plan advisory in east meadow, n.y. a younger person (say in their 20s or early 30s) may not necessarily have to max out (although it certainly won't hurt anything).\n\nthinking of 401(k) contributions in dollar figures can be overwhelming, so fidelity suggests focusing on percentages, and aiming for 15% of salary shared between employee and employer, said eliza badeau, director of workplace thought leadership at fidelity. this is not something everyone can do right away so the most important thing is to start early and increase over the course of years, she said. companies are beginning to automatically enroll their employees in retirement accounts, but workers should periodically check in to adjust contribution rates and make incremental increases after a raise or job change. traditional 401(k) plans use pretax contributions, which means a paycheck do\n\nes not reflect as large of a decline as it would if the account was made up of after-tax dollars.\n\nalso see:this common retirement savings advice is sneakily wrecking people's finances\n\nthere's one more reason saving the maximum amount allowed in a 401(k) will benefit workers: to prepare for the unexpected. that's one reason why hiro nishimura, a 29-year-old it specialist in new york, is aiming to max out her 401(k) plan — and why she's deferring nearly a quarter of her salary to do so. nishimura sustained brain injuries from a brain surgery in her early 20s and last year was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. i feel like i'm at this point in my life where i can and should do it, because i don't know when i will stop being able to work, she said.\n\nnishimura slowly increased her contributions, and said the process was almost like an experimentation — upping the percentage a few points at a time, worried it would take too much of a chunk of her paycheck, and then realizing it didn't hurt so much. when she got a raise, she'd put it all toward her retirement contribution, so she wouldn't feel as though she lost anything. her diagnosis may prevent her from working for the next few decades, or it might not — but she wants to be prepared, and maxing out her 401(k) plan while she's working is one way to do that. (also, the internal revenue service waives the early withdrawal penalty for 401(k) assets if the individual claims he or she has a long-term disability.) i realize how fleeting this moment could be, she said.
the walt disney co. could break the cable bundle completely. instead, disney is going to collect some of the money that runs through its channels while building streaming ammunition in case a war with the bundlers ever happens.\n\nthat is why the recent launch of the espn+ streaming service in a new espn app are important in the continuing transformation of how video content is consumed. it is the first step in disney's dis, -1.52% role in supporting and helping solidify a new normal for how we will interact with our televisions: taking the additional targeted tiers and other goodies that cable companies have traditionally offered and selling them directly to consumers in separate apps.\n\nopinion: the espn streaming service is not new, disney just wants you to pay for it\n\nin the traditional cable system, companies like comcast corp. cmcsa, -2.83% would sell consumers a base collection of channels, then offer smaller bundles aimed at specific interests, such as sports, for additional monthly fees. the content providers who produced the channels were paid, which made disney—and especially espn, with more than a half-dozen channels that could be the base of additional sports tiers—a monster money machine.\n\nas consumers have moved away from the bundle and toward ad-free streaming services like netflix inc. nflx, -3.75% , espn has lost subscribers just as the price of live sports content has skyrocketed because fans will watch games live and stomach the commercials that come with it. that squeeze from both sides—lower revenue, higher costs—has damaged disney's stock price, but not enough for disney to go nuclear with a streaming espn option that would forego the billions it collects from cable companies.\n\ninstead, we have reached a middle ground. cable companies and other providers are offering skinny bundles, mobile-friendly packages that offer fewer channels at a lower price. while many of those offer the same additional tiers as their larger predecessors, consumers are instead supplementing with netflix or other streaming services, most of which are not the traditional content providers like disney.\n\ndon't miss: netflix is growing at a stunning rate—and so is its profit\n\ndisney has decided that a system of smaller bundles and outside additions is the future, buying a majority stake in streaming-technology company bamtech to deliver its own on-demand services. the first offspring of that marriage is espn+, which will be followed next year by a disney offering that includes popular content that will eventually be removed from netflix.\n\nwhile the espn+ that disney announced ahead of launch mostly comprised sports and content that subscribers already had access to, it is rapidly growing with the addition of niche sports and targeted studio shows. the plan feels similar both to espn's beginning as a cable network in the early 1980s—when sports like lacrosse and low-budget studio shows were the norm—and the approach on its website, which parcels out the wonkiest content for hard-core fans into a subscription plan called espn insider.\n\nhow nba teams are using esports to find new revenue streams\n\nat a media event in oakland, calif., just after the launch last month, espn executives stressed that espn+ was a work in progress, with plenty of plans for studio shows and new deals aimed at these niche fans. they especially played up deals for boxing, american soccer leagues and cricket, and discussed potential additions of more content.\n\nespn proved executives weren't blowing smoke tuesday morning with the biggest addition to espn+ yet. the company landed a five-year deal with ufc, the mixed martial-arts league that has devoted followers, for 15 fights and an assortment of series and studio shows to be aired on espn+. most important, it will include the rights to sell pay-per-view fights, an additional avenue for espn to collect viewers' money.\n\ndisney chief executive robert iger had previously hinted that espn+ could move into pay-per-view for specific events, but ufc will be the first test. that is disney taking yet another moneymaker that has typically been the domain of cable companies for itself, cutting out a middleman and helping to make up for the lost espn subscription fees while setting espn+ to eventually become something much more than it is now.\n\nread: with fox merger and espn streaming effort, disney has a confusing mess to sort out\n\nour goal here is to create a sports marketplace on espn+, and that will include a number of sports that we've already licensed and sports that we are in the process of licensing, including the deal that we announced today, as well as the sum of the sports that we would be acquiring as part of the 21st century fox fox, -0.12% acquisition and then there are opportunities to license beyond what we've already done, iger said in a conference call tuesday after disney reported second-quarter earnings.\n\ndisney could try a similar approach with its other streaming service, which will include premium content from marvel, star wars studio lucasfilm, pixar and its own disney-branded material. for instance, it could sell or rent its movies not long after they leave movie theaters, or even while they are still in theaters, avoiding any of the typical windows for such content that offers middlemen exclusive time periods to rent or sell such content. many consumers are currently renting or buying digital movies through apple inc. aapl, -3.39% or alphabet inc.'s googl, -2.92% goog, -2.62% google services, and disney could aim to cut them out just as it has netflix.\n\nsee also: netflix sees sharks approaching from both sides in apple and disney\n\nin order for [the disney streaming service] to be successful longer term, it has to become the destination to watch disney, marvel, 'star wars,' and pixar product, iger said tuesday. and that means ultimately weaning ourselves of product being available any other place except for the current linear channels that are in the marketplace.\n\nthe key for disney is to be in control of its own future, so it is not caught flat-footed if the video ecosystem continues to undergo seismic change. in a few years, it could theoretically bundle all its assets into a direct-to-consumer offering that completely bypasses the bundle, or just continue on the path of picking off easy money from others to make up for lost fees from cable subscribers. either way, it has power in negotiations with cable companies desperate to stay in consumers' lives.\n\nfor those consumers, the approach means the dream of full a-la-carte television purchasing is not in sight, and the current version is not always easy to use. the new espn app, for example, requires a user to sign in with an espn account for espn+, and a cable login for access to streams of content airing on linear networks. espn has a deal with major league baseball, which created bamtech, to stream its mlb.tv package of games on the platform, but launched without the ability for current mlb subscribers to access that content due to technical issues involving all the different authentications.\n\nthe result so far is a reorganized bundle spread across different apps with separate billing—a more confusing system that at least has more on-demand options and choice, and works on a multitude of devices. if that system is where the future of television lies, thank (or blame) disney.

dear moneyist,\n\nmy wife of 15 years makes about five times what i make — approximately $500,000 a year — and she always has. she and i had an agreement, which of course has been long forgotten by her, that her money would pay for the household expenses and mine would pay for our entertainment.\n\nwe eat out once or twice a week, usually around $60 each time, with the occasional $200 to $300 meal three to four times a year, which i pay for. we also usually take a $3,000 to $5,000 vacation once a year, which i also pay for.\n\nthe moneyist: 'what did he do with all the money?' my dying husband cashed his $700k life insurance and emptied his bank accounts\n\ni shower her with expensive gifts two to three times a year. she loves quality jewelry, but i love her and love to make her happy. we have substantial savings (mid six figures). most all that came from her earnings since our marriage. she had none to mention when we first married.\n\nthe problem is that we bought a new home a few years ago — when she still remembered our agreement. the home is out of my affordability range. she refers to it as her house, and has started hounding me for half the mortgage payment and saying she pays for everything so it's all hers.\n\nthe moneyist:my mom asked for a divorce. my dad made his mother his pension beneficiary and then he killed himself. now my mom and grandma are feuding. who's right?\n\ni travel quite a bit for my work and bought a motor home a few years ago to stay in while i'm away. i pay for it, but she is excited to use it for outings and calls it ours. i also pay for my vehicle, insurance, and business insurance along with my credit-card balances in full each month.\n\nshe has been threatening at times, telling me i can go live in my motor home and she'll take everything else. i don't like being threatened and just wonder how much would i be entitled to in texas in a divorce, if it ever came about. we also have over $100,000 equity in the house.\n\nfeeling financially bullied husband\n\ndear financially bullied,\n\nyour problems are all about money — and they have nothing to do with money. there are so many other issues here: how you speak to each other, the spoken or unspoken covenant of mutual respect in this relationship has been broken, feelings of ill-will in relation to perceived entitlements.\n\nsometimes, you have to risk walking away from something you value in order to save it. you can't allow this increasingly toxic status quo to continue because of either your fear of being alone or your fear of economic insecurity. you can't save your marriage by ignoring the problems.\n\nyour wife did not forget about your arrangement. she chose to forget about it. you need a new financial and personal blueprint to make this marriage work. if you both love each other and want to return to that place of respect, it's worth giving it a shot.\n\nthe moneyist: my stepfather and mother pooled resources to buy a home. my mom died in 2003 and he just passed away. his kids are selling their house — am i entitled to anything?\n\ni don't know what she was thinking, but i'll give it my best shot. she was, i imagine, resentful by the imbalance in incomes and the division of financial responsibilities that you had agreed upon, and decided that they no longer suited her. she just didn't inform you of her change of heart.\n\nyou have a lot of discretionary expenses — gifts of jewelry, expensive meals etc. — that you can ill-afford. she has come to expect these gifts and, perhaps, sees these gifts as a reward and/or payback for what she sees as shouldering the lion's share of the mortgage and other bills.\n\na better arrangement would be to live in a house that you can both afford to split 50/50. that means splitting everything down the middle: the mortgage, the utilities, and everything else. you could agree to deposit a certain amount in a joint bank account, and keep the remainder separate.\n\nthe moneyist:my father-in-law's business went south and my mother-in-law has never worked a day in her life. how can i avoid supporting them?\n\nyour traditional, some would say archaic, gender roles are topsy-turvy. your wife is the biggest earner. that is increasingly common, although men still tend to earn more than their spouses. but you are trying to keep up with other, more old-fashioned gender roles (expensive jewels).\n\nif your wife wants to live in a larger house that you cannot afford, and you are ok with that, you could agree to split the mortgage and other bills, as a percentage of your respective incomes. but agree to revisit that arrangement in one year. it may be that you either move, or agree to separate.\n\nyou are both having your cake and eating it. your wife is enjoying the lifestyle to which she wants to become accustomed to with her mid-six-figure earnings, and you are trying to keep up, while enjoying the spoils of this relatively lavish lifestyle. you are, at least, splitting your lifestyle 50/50.\n\nthe moneyist: 'she injected my dad with ketamine, enough to kill him.' my father died in hospice care — and left almost everything to his nurse\n\nbut while your wife's resentments have grown, so too have your feelings of discomfort. it's time to see a financial therapist, a couple's therapist, a financial adviser, or all three. put your cards on the table, talk about how you feel without judgement, and allow your wife to do the same.\n\nthe worst that can happen is not that you separate. at least, not if you are both happier as a result. the worst that can happen is living in this situation where your wife says cruel things, and you either suck them up and maintain a fearful silence, or say cruel things back to your wife.\n\nyou live in a community property state. assuming that you did not sign a prenuptial agreement, everything you both earned during your marriage will be split 50/50. that includes your joint savings accounts and your home. bottom line: this has gone on long enough, my friend.\n\nit's time to bite the gold necklace — and talk.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings,

bitcoin prices have been scaling new heights recently, and the basic dynamic of tighter supply and increased demand has underpinned that climb, according to a report compiled by london-based crypto custodian copper.co.\n\ncopper made the case that the recent price ascent is a function of steadily rising demand for bitcoins btcusd, +1.68% and the growing scarcity of the asset that has a maximum supply of 21 million, which is projected to be hit by 2140. the researcher also said that the most of the interest in new bitcoins is coming from north america, and the u.s. in particular.\n\napproximately, 18.625 million bitcoins have been created, or digitally mined in the parlance of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, according to coinmarketcap.com, but a good chunk of that has been lost, wrote the folks at copper.\n\nby their estimates, 56% of bitcoins are owned by investors, 18% are lost, 15% are held by so-called traders and the remainder has yet to be mined (see attached chart):\n\nvia copper.co\n\ncopper said that because the majority of investors are long-term owners, representing eight out of 10 holders of the cryptocurrency, rising appetite for the world's most popular digital asset can have an outsize effect on values.\n\nthe researchers said that bitcoin's rise above $40,000 was already in play even before tesla inc. tsla, +3.68% made its surprise filing with regulators on monday, declaring its investment of $1.5 billion in bitcoin, and its decision to eventually allow customers to purchase its products with bitcoin.\n\ndata shows that new investors pushed prices much higher in the\n\nlast six months of 2020, to acquire north of 2 [million] bitcoins, wrote copper's researchers in the study.\n\nin order to be able to buy bitcoin in such deep quantities, the price rallied\n\nwell above the $20,000 mark that helped persuade early investors\n\nto sell their cryptocurrency above its previous all-time high, they said.\n\nthe crypto market is reliant on a new supply of some 3.2 million bitcoins on exchanges and held by traders, according to the report.\n\nthe study also found that investors who have been owners of at least 1,000 bitcoins for about three month increased their holdings in 2020 by 173%.\n\nthat rising demand, combined with that constrained supply, helped to lift bitcoin values to a total market value of around $800 billion, and copper said that the main driver of demand has been north american buyers taking supply from asian miners.\n\nthe price increase is a result of a demand and liquidity-crunch marriage that\n\nhappened early in 2020 when outflows from exchanges—that is,\n\nbitcoins being moved into self-custody—increased significantly, the company's research found.\n\ncopper also made an interesting finding, noting that nearly a third of bitcoin trading volume occurs during the period when the new york stock exchange is open and investors should be focused on trading in the dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% and the s&p 500 index spx, +0.29% .\n\nthat so much of trading in bitcoin occurs during stock-market hours, between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. eastern, may explain why s&p 500 moves are seen at times as correlated with bitcoin prices, copper wrote.
dear moneyist,\n\ni'm a 28-year-old male marrying a 30-year-old woman. i have racked up about $100,000 in student-loan debt by earning two graduate degrees. luckily, i obtained a finance job with unlimited earning potential, just heavy work hours, so i am not too worried about repaying my loans if the biden administration doesn't assist.\n\nhowever, my fiancée does not have any student loans and doesn't have as high an earning ceiling as i do, but she has a heavy spending problem, whereas i am a saver by nature. we are getting married next year, and will be purchasing a home next year as well. both expenses will be covered by us with limited assistance from our parents.\n\nthe moneyist:i married my husband 20 years ago. he has 4 kids and i have 1. i paid for our home. who should inherit it after we're gone?\n\ndue to my fianceé's inability to save and her excessive spending, i know the financial burden will fall on my shoulders. we've discussed her habits, but she isn't able to change so i've recommended keeping our finances separate until i can see more financial responsibility from her. i've also mentioned prenuptial agreements to safeguard my assets in case things go south.\n\nthat conversation didn't go over well and i believe it will create resentment before we marry and could possibly be the cause for divorce down the line if she felt forced into signing one. i love her dearly, but i am really concerned. an estate-attorney friend has recommended that i move my assets into a trust and even purchase our first home in trust.\n\nam i wrong for considering this plan and not discussing it with my wife-to-be, given that i already know that she won't agree to a prenup? if things don't work out, i don't have any intention of leaving her high and dry, but i also don't want to lose everything i've earned from being an aggressive saver my entire life. p.s. i live in a community-property state.\n\nk.c.\n\nthe moneyist: my wife found a half brother through ancestry.com. are we morally or ethically obligated to share her father's estate?\n\nwant to read more?follow quentin fottrell on twitterand read more of his columns here.\n\ndear k.c.,\n\nputting your home and other assets in a trust without telling your fiancée would break the trust in the relationship, as much as that trust currently exists, and that would end your marriage sooner than if she felt strong-armed into signing a prenuptial agreement. she would find out sooner or later, probably sooner. it doesn't sound like you trust her very much, as it is.\n\nyou can't have any kind of relationship without trust — a friendship or professional partnership or even a boss-employee relationship founders when that trust is broken. namely because you are always waiting for something untoward to happen, and no one likes to live or work under a cloud of suspicion. it certainly does not bode well for a loving, long and happy marriage.\n\nfamily attorneys don't, on principle, rule out a trust to protect yourself in the event you divorce. the key to using a trust to protect assets in a divorce is what is listed in the fine print, according to lomurro, munson, comer, brown & schottland, a law firm based in freehold, n.j. the terms and conditions of the trust must be written carefully.\n\nif a spouse established a trust prior to the marriage, the assets placed in that trust are typically considered separate property as long as the funds are not combined with marital funds at any point, the law firm adds. but there are drawbacks to setting up such a trust too, including costs, filing tax returns, and other restrictions on those assets.\n\nultimately, if you have to put so much time and effort into setting up some kind of domestic asset trust, you should pay the same close attention — for now, at least — to whether or not you should be getting married. interview 100 divorced couples and 50% of the people will say, you can't change people. the other 50% will be that person in that marriage who could not be changed.\n\nyour wife has made her shopping stance clear. she is not for turning. that only leaves you.\n\nthe moneyist:my sister became my father's power of attorney, took out a reverse mortgage, and drained his equity. what can i do?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas.\n\nquentin fottrell is marketwatch's moneyist columnist. you can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions at qfottrell@marketwatch.com. by emailing your questions, you agree to having them published anonymously on marketwatch.
while rosie the riveter has become an indelible feminist symbol, the woman who inspired the famous image may have unknowingly been a member of the first generation to experience the same gender wage gap that women do today.\n\nnaomi parker fraley, who is believed to be the inspiration behind the wartime poster, died last year at the age of 96. the rosie the riveter image was created by pittsburgh-based artist j. howard miller, and researchers believe that he based the poster on a photograph of a woman factory worker that was widely published in magazines in 1943.\n\nanother woman, geraldine doyle, originally came forward saying she was the person in the photograph, and received plaudits when she died in december 2010. subsequently, james kimble, a professor at seton hall university, uncovered evidence identifying parker fraley as the person in the image.\n\nthe image originally served as a rallying cry for women to take on jobs in factories and shipyards as men served in the military overseas during world war ii. but the real rosies across america during the 1940s may have inadvertently made matters more difficult for women today, said joanna krotz, author of being equal doesn't mean being the same. unions were trying to make sure that women did not usurp men's pay while our guys were overseas fighting for us, krotz said.\n\n companies wanted to ensure that women in the workforce would not depress wages for men when they returned home from war. \n\nthe wage gap then and now\n\nthough government agencies proclaimed otherwise, there was a significant gap in the pay men and women received in the post-world war ii era. and that gap persists today.\n\nin the immediate post-war years, women workers earned roughly 60 cents for every dollar a man made. the median annual wage for female workers in 1950 was $1,579, as compared with $2,702 for men, according to u.s. census bureau data. in 2017 dollars, that's $14,417 and $24,671 respectively.\n\nsimilar disparities played out in specific professions: women in manufacturing made a median annual wage of $1,524 ($13,914 when adjusted for inflation), while men earned $2,635 ($24,059 adjusted for inflation), or 58% more than women.\n\nalso see:disney is offering a free education program — why women might benefit more than men\n\nin 1944, skilled female workers made an average weekly wage of $31.21 ($442 in 2017 dollars) while skilled male workers earned $54.65 weekly ($774 in 2017 dollars), according to the home front and beyond: american women in the 1940s by historian susan hartmann. between 1943 and 1945, polls showed that 47% to 68% of married women workers wanted to keep working after world war ii.\n\nmatters have certainly gotten better for women today, but there's definitely still room for improvement. in 2014, women who worked full time on average made roughly 83 cents for every dollar a man earned, according to a the bureau of labor statistics. but rosie the riveters in today's workforce aren't as well off: they earned barely 71 cents on the dollar of what men were paid, according to the bls report.\n\n in the immediate post-war years, women workers only earned roughly 60 cents for every dollar a man made. today, it's 83 cents on the dollar. \n\nperhaps the greatest irony of all: the biggest wage gap is seen among personal financial advisers — women advisers make just over half what their male colleagues earn, according to an analysis from the institute for women's policy research. one theory: male clients, who have built more wealth because of the disparities in male and female earning power and seniority, may prefer male advisers.\n\nin other fields, women are closer to achieving true wage parity. women in food service, office administration and construction jobs earned more than 90 cents for every dollar a man made. overall though, the gender pay gap worldwide isn't expected to close for another century, according to the world economic forum.\n\nworld war ii influenced equal pay policies\n\nthe war labor board, which included representatives from the government, unions, and employers, was set up in 1942 to handle labor disputes. also under its jurisdiction were issues related industry wages. in 1942, the agency put out an order mandating equal pay for equal work— but in reality, women often got the short end of the stick, according to krotz.\n\ndon't miss:'roseanne' is coming back to tv — how american families have changed since 1988\n\ncompanies wanted to ensure that women in the workforce would not depress wages for men when they returned home from war. therefore, some employers would make multiple women undertake a task that would typically be completed by one male worker so that the women weren't doing the same work as men, krotz said. and after the war, employers used the wave the flag mentality to justify laying off female employees in favor of wwii veterans returning home or moving women into other lower paid positions. women just got screwed — they were hardly feeling rosy, krotz said.\n\nthat trend didn't only have negative repercussions though – some researchers have argued that it helped spark entrepreneurship among women in the post-war era who could no longer find work and who had fewer marriage prospects.\n\n some researchers have argued that it helped spark entrepreneurship among women in the post-war era who could no longer find work and who had fewer marriage prospects. \n\nhow the #metoo movement could make a difference\n\nthe feminist activism spurred by the election of president donald trump and in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against men in many industries could make a major difference, krotz said. the second women's march, for instance, focused on the need to elect more women into government, with activists calling for a pink wave.\n\nthe path to legislative and social change is to elect more women to office, particularly on the state level where change is needed most, krotz said. i'm hoping the me too movement will do that.\n\nkrotz emphasized the importance of legislators passing the paycheck fairness act, which would force employers to justify pay discrepancies and penalize those who pay women less than their male coworkers.\n\nbut she also warned that developments need to be made in other arenas to ensure equality in the workplace — namely, men need to take on more of the burdens related to child care. until that becomes a men's problem, i don't know how we'll solve the wage gap, krotz said.\n\nand that is something, one imagines, rosie the riveter would have been very happy about.\n\nthis story was updated on april 2, 2019.
survivor contestant jeff varner learned the hard way that outing someone as queer or transgender often doesn't end well.\n\nvarner, a north carolina-based realtor and former news anchor who is gay himself, revealed that fellow contestant zeke smith is transgender during this week's episode of the long-running reality series. other competitors and viewers alike were shocked, and varner was eliminated from season 34 of the competition quickly thereafter. (notably, both contestants had been on the series before — the current iteration, dubbed game changers, features competitors from past seasons.)\n\non twitter, varner issued an apology, saying that outing someone is assault. smith, a 29-year-old asset manager from brooklyn, told people that he didn't want to be known as the show's first transgender contestant. i just wanted to be known for my game, he told the magazine. (smith and varner did not return requests for comment.)\n\nzeke smith from survivor: game changers on being outed as transgender: i just wanted to be known for my game. timothy kuratek/cbs entertainment\n\nsurvivor's fijian location may not resemble a typical workplace, but the same rules should apply. and in this case, that means never disclosing another co-worker's sexual orientation or gender identity, workplace experts say. at the same time, it's unlikely that varner would face any litigation over his transgression. it's not illegal to out someone in the workplace, said darnley stewart, an employment attorney with the law firm outten & golden in new york.\n\nthat doesn't mean employees who out each other will go scot-free. twenty states and the district of columbia have employment non-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation and gender identity. another two states — wisconsin and new hampshire — have laws that protect only sexual orientation. in these states, if outing a fellow employee leads to them facing a more hostile work environment, that person could have grounds for a lawsuit, stewart said.\n\ngranted, most states do not have protections for lgbt individuals from workplace discrimination on the books. and in late march, president trump issued an executive order that rescinded a component of a previous order from the obama administration that banned federal contractors from discriminating against lgbt employees based on their orientation or identity.\n\nbut recently, the tides have also started to shift in lgbt workers' favor at the federal level. earlier this month, the seventh circuit court of appeals issued a full-court ruling that title vii of the 1964 civil rights act, which bars sex discrimination, applies to sexual orientation. (the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission adopted this stance in 2015.)\n\nthe case may now head to the supreme court, where its fate is less clear. it's a little uncertain now with the new supreme court justice, stewart said referring to neil gorsuch. it seems to be a fairly sensible decision, and given the court's decision on same-sex marriage i don't see why it shouldn't prevail at the supreme court as well.\n\nof course, people shouldn't just respect others' privacy when it comes to their lgbt identities just for fear of being sued. studies have shown that workplace discrimination is linked with depression and other mental health issues. and recent surveys indicate that despite the progress made on issues like same-sex marriage, lgbt people feel less comfortable being out in the workplace.\n\na study conducted by out now, an lgbt consulting firm based in the netherlands, found that the share of lgbt individuals in the u.s. who were out to everyone at work dropped from 44% in 2010 to 38% in 2015. the u.s. was the only place in the multi-country study where this metric declined. one possible explanation for that figure: nearly half of lgbt u.s. workers reported having heard something homophobic in the workplace in the past year.\n\nsee also:apple's tim cook on being gay: 'i have the skin of a rhinoceros'\n\ntransgender people face even more pronounced difficulties in the workplace. more than a quarter of transgender individuals said they have lost their job because of their gender identity, according to a 2009 report from the national center for transgender equality and the national gay and lesbian task force. and a staggering 97% of transgender people reported being mistreated at work, including being denied access to an appropriate bathroom or being removed from contact with clients.\n\nlgbt employees feeling comfortable being open in the workplace has real ramifications for businesses. employees who were out to everyone they worked with were 11% more likely to stay in their job than those who were out to nobody in the workplace. and losing lgbt employees who feel unwelcome adds up: a company in the u.s. with 50,000 workers could spend anywhere from $633,000 to $4.7 million to re-staff and retrain these positions, according to out now. a corporation can save simply by helping their lgbt staff come out to their colleagues, said ian johnson, chief executive of out now.

breaking up and getting back together with the same person eight times over the course of two years may seem like surprising behavior for someone who provides relationship advice for a living. and yet that's the situation jordan gray, a vancouver-based sex and relationship consultant, found himself in a few years ago.\n\none of the major factors that kept gray and his then-girlfriend returning to one another: the time and emotional energy they had already invested in the relationship.\n\n investors will continue to pour money into an asset — stocks, bonds, a house or even for a bus that never comes — in hopes that it will ultimately pay off. the same is true for relationships. \n\nthere was a mutual narrative of this pain has to be worth something because we've been through so many rounds of it, gray, 30, said, reflecting on the relationship recently. there has to be a payoff or we just have to face how foolish we've been.\n\ngray's experience of feeling an internal pressure to extend a relationship past its prime is one to which many of us can relate. but it also has a parallel in the world of finance and economics. investors will continue to pour money into an asset — stocks, bonds, a house or even a bus that never comes — in hopes that it will ultimately pay off, even when it's already clear that it won't.\n\nthe sunk cost fallacy can be a cycle of misery\n\nthis phenomenon is so common that it even has its own name — the sunk cost fallacy. the idea is that an investor worries so much about the money they've sunk into a bad investment that they choose to keep investing instead of giving it up — even when giving up on it would be more worthwhile.\n\na typical example: students who continue to accumulate debt to attend a school they've realized won't provide them with good education because they don't want the money they've already invested in their degree to feel like a waste.\n\n students who continue to accumulate debt to attend a school they've realized won't provide them with good education because they don't want the money they've already invested in their degree to feel like a waste. \n\nthe sunk cost fallacy is the first of many concepts that applies to both finance and romance that marketwatch is exploring as part of a new column called datenomics.\n\nit's an issue that relationship experts, like rachel sussman, a new york-based therapist, say they see often. sussman said it's especially common among clients who are in the period of their life where many of their friends and acquaintances are getting married.\n\neven if they have concerns about their relationship, they're hesitant to give it up out of fear they will have wasted some of their prime dating years with the wrong person and won't find someone to spend their life with. fertility realities can make this pressure especially acute among women, she said.\n\nthe devil you know is better than the devil you don't know, is what they think, she said.\n\nthe more you give, the more you are likely to stay\n\nonce people get older, it can also be hard to leave a relationship because that can mean turning your back on decades of time and energy, said natalia juarez, a break-up coach and dating strategist. she recently encountered a woman who remained in a marriage for 34 years, even though she knew it was wrong just eight months after it began. the woman told juarez she waited so long to end the relationship because she didn't know how to and felt social pressure to stay.\n\nwhile that story may be an extreme example, juarez said it's pretty typical for people who know they should leave a relationship to, nonetheless, feel stuck. they're in a state of paralysis, she said.\n\n when a partner has spent years performing small gestures like cooking dinner or buying flowers for their significant other, that breeds an attachment that's hard to break, even if the couple might be better off apart. \n\nin some cases, that paralysis is fueled by specific, tangible things they may have to give up, like a shared home or children, juarez said. but sometimes the investment being left behind is more elusive.\n\nwhen a partner has spent years performing small gestures like cooking dinner or buying flowers for their significant other, that breeds an attachment that's hard to break, even if the couple might be better off apart, said amy chan, the founder of renew, a breakup bootcamp. the more you give, the more invested you become, she said. [you] keep trying, trying, trying instead of just saying it was a bad stock.\n\nover the course of about a year and a half, joshua lombardo-bottema and his then-girlfriend, struggled to end their volatile relationship to bed. part of what kept them coming back to each other was the emotional energy they had expelled coping with the highs and lows of their relationship.\n\nyou put your whole heart into something, you've invested in that and you're like if i pull out of this it's going to hurt even more, the 31-year-old entrepreneur said. it's not like you can cut your losses right when you decide to leave.\n\npeople have a need to be proved right rather than wrong\n\neven once someone realizes it's time to end a relationship, external pressures may make it difficult for them to break it off, chan said. we as human beings have a psychological tendency to want to prove that our decision is right, chan said.\n\nand in an age where relationship milestones as small as going out for ice cream become fodder for instagram and facebook posts, the need to prove we've made the right choice is only exacerbated. when gray and his then-girlfriend were considering ending their relationship for the last time, one of his concerns was how his readers — he has a popular relationship blog where he had already introduced her — would react.\n\nthere's definitely a piece of me that didn't want to seem inconsistent, he said. i wanted to double down and make it work. while gray's following is certainly larger than most, it's a feeling to which most of us can relate. there's an audience that's aware of you.\n\nwhat marriage-phobic millennials mean for the wedding-ring industry\n\nultimately, gray was able to leave the relationship for good and he and other experts have tips for people struggling to get out of a relationship they know it's time to leave:\n\navoid ending up in the situation in the first place\n\nchan suggests making a list of your top values and ranking yourself according to how you're fulfilling them. then look at your last five partners to see how they rank on these values -- it's not uncommon to find that you may not match. keep that check list and ranking system in mind before getting too serious with a new partner, she says.\n\nif you're unhappy determine whether it's fixable\n\nno relationship is perfect, so when her clients are questioning theirs, sussman suggests they create a list of pros and cons and take a close look at the cons to determine if they're deal breakers.\n\nset a deadline for working on issues\n\nwhen clients want to try to work through challenges with their partner, sussman suggests setting a deadline, say three months, and evaluating whether they feel any differently at the end of that period. if they don't, that's when it makes sense to start talking about a breakup, she said.\n\nkeep the future, instead of the past, in your sights\n\nwhen she sees clients whose lives are financially or otherwise intertwined with another person they may want to leave, juarez suggests they try to focus on the opportunities a new future could provide, instead of the energy they've spent building up their past. the power of a great relationship, it charges your life and so you do have more to gain — financially, energetically — in every way, she tells clients.\n\nwhat's more, she reminds her clients that extending their relationship too long is hurting their partner too. it's not really fair to be with someone if you don't want to be with them.\n\nif you decide to break up, start creating an exit strategy\n\neven when clients realize the best decision is to break up with their partner, the logistics of the break-up can make them very anxious, sussman said. she tries to talk through the practical details of a break-up with her clients so they can feel more comfortable moving forward.\n\nthat can include introducing the idea of breaking up before it actually happens, according to juarez. one of the things that that leads to traumatic break ups is when someone hasn't communicated to their partner that they're having these feelings, she said.\n\nfinally, remember, a relationship isn't a bad investment just because it didn't work out\n\nwhen it comes to bad investments, there's rarely a life-long less to be learned so it's probably best to cut your losses when you can. but even bad relationships teach us something about ourselves and can prepare us for future partners, sussman said. what i try to say to them, is 'it's never a waste,' she said.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy girlfriend and i make about the same income monthly of approximately $19,000. i have gone through a divorce and several downturns in the economy as an entrepreneur so i have $55,000 in credit-card debt and $34,000 in irs debt, plus a car and mortgage. my gross income is approximately $225,000, so well within my abilities to pay down my debt in a year or so.\n\n 'she's so focused on medicine that she has forgotten about her financial obligations and defaulted on her loan.' \n\nmy concern is actually my girlfriend who makes as much as i do, but her medical school debt is through the roof at $350,000. she has no other debt, but she — like many other students — has had high interest rates of 10% on that loan. she's so focused on medicine that she has forgotten about her financial obligations and defaulted on her loan.\n\nalso see:before i give my fiancée a $7,000 diamond engagement ring, i want her to promise to bequeath it to my daughter\n\nshe's a doctor and i'm an entrepreneur, but dreams of us living a comfortable life are on hold until she's able to get that settled. should two people with nearly $1 million in debt even consider taking it to the next level in a relationship, or should we fix that before considering marriage and the complexities that will bring to our already troubled finances?\n\ned\n\ndear awkward,\n\ndear ed,\n\nlooks like you both have debts that are through the roof that both forgot to pay off. sorry to state the obvious, but there's two of you in it. the good news: there's not much room for blame and recrimination. you've both made the same mistakes, but for different reasons. it's time for you to put all your debts on paper and, with the help of an adviser or accountant, figure out a repayment plan that you agree to stick to. like sticking to a diet, it's often easier to be disciplined when you're cheering each other on and doing it as part of a team.\n\n debt can be crippling, but there's no reason why you should punish yourselves by putting your lives on hold. \n\nas long as you both have a plan, you should proceed with your lives together. while debt can be crippling, there's no long-term reason why you should punish yourselves by never marrying or putting your relationship on hold. you did, after all, incur these debts so you could live a better life. one word of caution: if you incur debts during your marriage and you live in a community property state, you may both be responsible for those debts. so you should be aware of this before refinancing any debts, should you decide to marry.\n\ndon't miss: my boyfriend and i have two kids — should i pay off his $130,000 student debt?\n\nyour spouse is generally not responsible for your debt, but a debt collector may decide to collect from the estate if one of you dies. jared snider, a senior wealth adviser at exencial in oklahoma city, says, debt collectors will use addresses and phone numbers of record to attempt to collect on a debt owed. this may mean that a debt collector calls the home or cell phone numbers for both spouses in an attempt to reach the spouse owing the debt, which can lead to stressful conversations for both spouses.\n\nyou both got into the red for different reasons and you both fell foul to the pressures of repaying this money. you should have an honest talk with each other and yourselves about how things got so out of hand that you are jointly facing $1 million in debt before you begin a life together. you need to pull back on your entrepreneurial risk taking. your girlfriend, meanwhile, may wish to examine whatever anxieties or stress or financial issues led her to default on her student loans. it's a good exercise in how you decide to live the rest of your lives.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\na new study gives a clue to the secret to a long, blissful marriage: genetics.\n\nyale university researchers concluded that the happiest, most secure-feeling couples in an experiment had at least one person in the pair with a variation in their gene receptor for oxytocin, known as the love hormone.\n\nthis study shows that how we feel in our close relationships is influenced by more than just our shared experiences with our partners over time, said joan monin, associate professor at the yale school of public health. in marriage, people are also influenced by their own and their partner's genetic predispositions.\n\nalmost 180 married couples participated in the study, ranging from age 37 to 90. they filled out surveys on marital satisfaction and gave a saliva sample that was used to map their genes.\n\noxytocin is linked to bonding and has all kinds of feel-good nicknames like the cuddle hormone. it's also known as a pain reliever.\n\nthe study noted researchers have previously looked at the gene variant at issue — termed oxtr rs53576 — for its connection to emotional stability and empathy. the yale study, however, is thought to be the first looking into its role in a happy marriage.\n\nbusinesses like instant chemistry and genepartner let couples see how their genes match up. instant chemistry, based in canada, puts a $149 price on it services, while genepartner, in switzerland, charges $249.\n\ndr. ron gonzalez, instant chemistry's co-founder, said the yale findings were consistent with what his staff has been tracking internally about genetic makeup and oxytocin. gonzalez said the toronto-based company has served thousands of people since its 2013 start.\n\nit checks for genes linked to oxytocin, as well as genes associated with how people experience stress and pleasure. the fee includes a psychological profile too.\n\nit's a great way to start a conversation to learn about yourself and your partner, he said.\n\nshelling out some cash on genetic profiles might be an easy expense, at least compared to the costs of divorce. amicable divorces where the splitting couples do the paperwork themselves can hover around three digits, but if lawyers get involved and issues get complex and dragged out, those costs can surge far higher.\n\nthere's something to be said for the power of genetic makeup. but there are lots of ingredients in the recipe for long-term romance, like personality mixes, how families mesh and how couples choose to spend their free time.\n\nand, of course, there's also the role of money in a relationship.\n\nindeed, a merrill lynch study looked into what people wanted most in a partner. fifty-six percent of the participants said they would prefer a mate who could give them financial security, compared to the 44% who said they were in search of someone who would send them head over heels.\n\ngonzalez himself acknowledges genes are only part of the equation and the extent of their influence is not yet known. your predisposition of your genes does not predetermine what you do, he said — but it might help people be more conscious of their inclinations.\n\na separate study looked at the same issue of genetic makeup, oxytocin and couples' chemistry.\n\nthat research revealed that less happy husbands, who perceived their spouses as less supportive, had a particular makeup to their gene related to oxytocin.\n\neven there, the lead researcher cautioned against reading too much into genetic makeup and a solid marital bond. the understanding of chromosomes and couples' chemistry is just at the very beginning, said richard mattson, a psychology professor at binghamton university, state university of new york.
some things always seem to signal the change from winter to spring. the first crocus. the sound of birds chirping. turning the clocks ahead an hour.\n\non sunday, march 14, at 2 a.m., people in most areas of the u.s. will turn their clocks ahead one hour to daylight-saving (not savings) time.\n\nyou may have already noticed that it's staying lighter later, thanks to the normal course of the earth's movements in relation to the sun, but daylight-saving time turbocharges this process. of course, no daylight is actually being saved. we're just moving an hour of daylight to later in the day — so, for example, on march 14 when the clock reads 6 p.m., it will look pretty much as bright as it was at 5 p.m. the day before. by the time june is here, we'll be able to enjoy the twilight well into the evening.\n\nread: why daylight saving and 'march madness' could cause you to lose sleep over your investments\n\nnot everyone participates in this temporal engineering. a handful of u.s. states and territories, including much of arizona (excluding the navajo nation), hawaii, american samoa, guam, and the u.s. virgin islands, stick to standard time.\n\nmany people welcome the tradition of springing forward. it means an extra hour of daylight in the evenings, and signals the approach of spring and summer. so what's the problem?\n\nwell, some people complain about the lost hour of sleep (although they'll probably be back on their game within a day or so), as well as the dark mornings for early risers. and be careful: some studies show there's an uptick in morning car accidents after the switch because people aren't used to traveling in the darkness. it might even be bad for your marriage.\n\nread: 5 ways life would be better if we remained on daylight time forever\n\nhaters can start counting down the days until we (in the u.s.) turn our clocks back an hour and fall back to standard time on the first sunday in november.\n\ntake note: in europe, daylight-saving time doesn't begin until the last sunday in march (march 28 this year), and asia, for the most part, doesn't get involved.\n\nso even though we still have a few weeks to go until it's officially spring, and in much of the country a lot longer until it actually feels like spring, celebrating daylight-saving time is a first step.\n\n(this story has been updated because this occurs yearly.)
 'it just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.' \n\ndr. anthony fauci says two masks are better than one.\n\nit just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective, fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, told nbc's today show this week. that's the reason why you see people either double masking or doing a version of an n95.\n\nthe u.s. centers for disease control and prevention has not issued official guidance on double masking. it did not advocate wearing face coverings until april 3 last year to help prevent the wearer from spreading coronavirus, but since then health professionals say it also helps prevent the wearer from being infected.\n\na mask is like an obstacle course for particles to get through, linsey marr, an expert in virus transmission and a professor of civil and environmental engineering at virginia tech, told aarp. a second mask increases the chance that the particle will be trapped before it gets through.\n\nas of wednesday, covid-19 had infected more than 100.4 million people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, one of the major ways in which the virus has spread around the world so quickly.\n\nthe virus had killed nearly 2.2 million globally, including at least 425,406 in the u.s. the u.s. has the world's highest number of covid-19 cases (25.4 million), followed by india (10.7 million), brazil (8.9 million) and russia (3.7 million), according to data aggregated by johns hopkins university.\n\nthe dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% , s&p 500 spx, +0.29% and nasdaq composite comp, +0.40% were lower wednesday, as reports showed that lockdown measures to combat the pandemic are taking an economic toll in europe, and as biden's proposed new round of fiscal stimulus ran into opposition in the senate.\n\nfauci recently said that he expects more people will be able to get vaccines by april to help prevent the spread of covid-19. i would expect by the time we get to april, it will be what we call open season on vaccines, fauci told npr. everyone will be able to get a vaccine. so i think by the end of the summer, if we get 70% to 85% of the population vaccinated and get a good herd immunity, i think by the fall we could start to approach some form of normality.\n\nlearn to master your money:sign up for marketwatch's free live series to boost your financial iq\n\nu.s. president joe biden last week signed a mask mandate for all federal workers and anyone on federal property. they should, the mandate said, all wear masks, maintain physical distance, and adhere to other public health measures, as provided in cdc guidelines.\n\nfauci told npr, we want to get it to 1 million vaccinations per day. the idea about having everyone for at least 100 days — at least — wear a mask. everyone uniformly, so we don't have disparities where some people are adhering to public-health measures, and others are not.\n\ndispatches from a pandemic:it's 2:30 a.m. in wyoming: 'you're holding a smartphone to let a husband say goodbye to his wife via facetime after 60 years of marriage'\n\npfizer pfe, -0.11% and german partner biontech se bntx, -1.33% have said that a final analysis of their vaccine candidate showed 95% efficacy. meanwhile,moderna mrna, -5.43% said its vaccine candidate was about 94% effective.\n\nbiontech and pfizer said an in vitro study found that their covid-19 vaccine neutralizes the two new highly infectious variants that have emerged in the u.k. and south africa. the results were published on the preprint service biorxiv and have not yet been peer-reviewed.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband and i have been married for 12 years. we have two small kids, and we both work and are doing well financially. we've paid off all our student loans, we put down 20% on our mortgage when we purchased our home, we have a great income-to-debt ratio, we've already amassed a great 401(k) nest egg and, overall, we're in a good, comfortable place.\n\nmy in-laws, on the other hand, are not faring so well. my father-in-law owned his own business that went south and is still trying to revive it, and my mother-in-law has never worked a day in her life, even now with four kids grown and gone. they are an old-school couple in which the wife is completely in the dark about the finances and the husband is too proud to share any details.\n\ndon't miss:my father left everything to my son. when i called the attorney about the will, my son got very upset. i now need financial help. should i ask him for money?\n\na few years ago, they asked us to co-sign student loans for my husband's younger brother, who was on his sixth year as an undergraduate at the time. that was my first inkling that things were not going well. i told my husband, we're not mixing family and finances. i'm worried that as his parents get to an advanced age, they will come asking for money.\n\ni'm not spending all my days as a working mom away from my kids only to support my in-laws. what can we do? these are people who have never worked and have made poor financial decisions. no one has the courage to speak frankly with my in-laws to ask things such as, have you maxed out your credit cards? how many mortgages do you have?\n\neveryone is just ignoring it to avoid the drama and confrontation. how can we proactively manage this to keep the peace? am i wrong to not feel obligated to support them should it come to that?\n\nworried wife\n\ndear worried wife,\n\nsometimes, family elders are the ones who need parenting. if you're lucky, you get to step in.\n\nif you talk to your in-laws about their finances when you feel fearful and resentful about the role you believe you will have to play, it will probably go as well as you expect it to go: not very well. those who say, i don't like confrontation! may find it difficult to speak about an awkward situation without showing their displeasure or losing their cool. it's only a confrontation if you believe it to be one.\n\nmy point: it's all a matter of perception. the last time i went to the optometrist she tried having me look through different lenses. i could read some lines on the chart better than others. you too need to look at all of this through a different lens. rather than approaching it with a long-simmering grievance (i'm not responsible for these people), say this instead: what can i do to help?\n\nalso see:my stepfather and mother pooled resources to buy a home. my mom died in 2003 and he just passed away. his kids are selling their house c am i entitled to anything?\n\nthe financial therapy association takes a holistic approach to managing personal finances, including your history, anxieties, relationships and emotional life. other organizations that may be worth contacting include the american association of daily money managers, the national academy of elder law attorneys and the national consumer law center.\n\norganizations such as these and the help of a financial adviser will give you and your in-laws the information they need. put on paper their income and expenses, and any plans for paying off any debt. an adviser will also show them how much money they will need to live comfortably in retirement, inform them about long-term care insurance and help them set tangible goals.\n\nalso see: 'my daughter has been chiding me for frivolously spending her inheritance. now she won't speak to me'\n\ntelling your husband that you shouldn't feel obligated to support his parents because you don't believe they have handled their lives responsibly will hurt him, damage your relationship with your wider family and, possibly, cause discord in your own marriage. instead, empower your in-laws to make better decisions. paying for a financial adviser today as a gift would be a good first step.\n\nit's not a question of who is wrong and who is right. you are all on the same side here. it's a question of what is the best path for your in-laws to take, and what support system you can put in place to help them get back in the black. your husband's parents are getting older. this is a good time to act, and it provides you with a valuable moment to build stronger finances and stronger relationships.\n\nthis is your chance to take the lead in your family and to be the grownup. take it.\n\nalso see: 'he owed a lot of back taxes.' my ex-husband forgot to split a $100,000 investment account — then he died. can his estate come after me for the money?\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

my colleagues just published a review of recent research on the impact of three risks that households face at older ages.\n\nthese late-life risks include: 1) high out-of-pocket medical costs; 2) cognitive decline; and 3) widowhood. the takeaway from the research is that, so far, these risks have affected only a few households severely.\n\nin the future, however, the adverse effects of these risks are likely to become more significant, because the age 75+ population is projected to more than double between now and 2040; the likelihood of physical and cognitive problems rises sharply after 75; health care costs will grow more rapidly than income, and the older population will increasingly rely on modest 401(k) balances that are difficult to manage.\n\nout-of-pocket medical costs\n\nthe percentage of people with health limitations increases dramatically at ages 75+ (see figure below).\n\neven though medicare provides universal health coverage to retirees, medicare enrollees pay premiums for medicare parts b and d and any supplemental coverage; contribute a portion of the cost of medicare-covered services they receive through copayments and deductibles; and face the full cost of the many services not covered by medicare (e.g., dental and vision).\n\nresearch shows that the typical household devotes about 20% of income to these health related expenditures — a noticeable, but manageable burden. for about 5% of households, however, these standard out-of-pocket expenses eat up over half their total incomes. moreover, long-term care costs are very expensive today and will become a major problem for an increasing number of households.\n\ndeclining cognition and finances\n\nin addition to physical limitations, the likelihood of declining cognition and dementia increases with age (see below). these impairments can lead not only to high out-of-pocket medical costs, but also to a decline in the ability to manage household finances, leading to the risk of financial mistakes and fraud. so far, a mitigating factor seems to be that most people have help. however, the need for help will be more important in the future, as reliance on 401(k) balances increases.\n\nthe risk of widowhood\n\nin the past, widowhood resulted in poverty for many women — but recently that risk has declined. furthermore, the poverty rate will continue to drop even in the future, partially because marriage has become more selective — higher socioeconomic status (ses) individuals are more likely to be married today than those with lower ses.\n\npoverty, however, is an extreme measure of financial stress. a broader concern is how widowhood will affect the ability of women to maintain their standard of living in retirement. one counterintuitive reason that widowhood might cause increasing hardship is that women are working more and earning more relative to their husbands. because a widow is entitled to the larger of her own social security benefit or her husband's, a widow's income drops more than it used to — relative to the combined household benefit — when her husband dies (see below).\n\nthe bottom line is that most households can navigate late-life risks today, but the challenges will increase going forward.
dear quentin,\n\nmy father and mother divorced about 40 years ago. my father moved out and purchased a home that is now worth approximately $900,000. the divorce agreement, signed by both parties, called for my father in his will to leave his home to my sister and i.\n\nfast forward to today, my father (an attorney) has been married to his third wife for almost 30 years. she and her 2 daughters moved into his home soon after they were married. my father is now 85 and has late-stage cancer. he informed me that he has placed his home in an irrevocable trust, with his third wife named as trustee.\n\nhis third wife will also receive all of his assets, valued at around $1.5 million, as well as 60% of his annual government pension payments for the remainder of her life. believe it or not, this pension currently pays my father just over $200,000 annually, so his third wife will receive about $120,000 annually. the government is quite generous to some of its retired workers, and with taxpayers' money.\n\nmy sister and i will split the proceeds from a life-insurance policy valued at approximately $1 million.\n\n 'my father is now 85 and has late-stage cancer.' \n\nthe third wife has not been on speaking terms with my sister or i for the past 25 years. her focus has been on directing my father's income, assets, and now substantial annual pension payments towards herself, her children, and her grandchildren. for 30 years, my father's wife has been a materialistic and domineering force who worked hard to turn my father against my sister and i.\n\nshe has plenty of her own resources. ten years ago, the third wife received an inheritance from her father of over $2 million. as they live off of my father's pension and assets, the third wife's inheritance from her father was invested and has now grown to $3.5 million. how do i know all of these facts? my father told me. he felt very guilty about the entire situation, and stated he wished he had not done as his third wife demanded.\n\ni have the signed divorce agreement in my possession, and am wondering if, once my father passes, if i were to contest the irrevocable trust, is there a chance that my sister and i would be awarded the house?\n\nsincerely,\n\nscrewed over, but not surprised\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ndear unsurprised,\n\nthere are some things here in your control, and other things that are beyond your control. identify the latter, and let them go. you risk stewing for years and years, otherwise. whether your father's estate is worth $2 million or $20 million, it's not worth it. do what you can, and move on.\n\nfirst off, things you can control. while divorce decrees supercede post-marriage changes in life-insurance beneficiaries that go against such agreements, this situation seems more complex, given that it involves a divorce decree, a last will and testament, and an irrevocable trust.\n\nthis is a very tough issue that depends on the specifics of the trust and the laws of the state, says divorce attorney randall kessler. but generally a court order takes priority; however, it will take a lot of effort to have the trust set aside as having been violative of the court order.\n\nit might be appropriate to consider an attack by the former spouse, who is the other party to the divorce, to return to that court on a claim for contempt which is another way of saying a claim to enforce the court order and its requirement of keeping the money as directed by the court, he adds.\n\n 'your father did what he did what he did because he decided to do it. telling you that he wished he had not done what he did is not fair to you or his wife.'  — the moneyist\n\nif you believe this is worth the legal bills and time, then go for it and, while it's very possible that you will get the result you want, there is no guarantee that the court will rule in your favor. people try everything to outsmart or do an end run with divorce decrees, kessler adds.\n\nnow to the other stuff. how much uncle sam pays government employees in state pensions? beyond your control.you don't want to roll the federal government into this family business too. your stepmother's net worth independent of your father? her life, her money, her business.\n\nyour stepmother's management of your father's estate? she was married to him for 30 years. again, that is her prerogative, whether you like it or not, or you believe she is fair or not. is she focused on dividing this estate equally between your father's children? no. but it's your father's decision.\n\nlet's be clear: your father did what he did when he did because he decided to do it. telling you that he wished he had not done what he did is disingenuous, and not fair to you or his wife. it's easy to blame his estate planning on a domineering wife and pass the buck so he looks better in your eyes.\n\npeople are rarely all good or all bad. we are complicated creatures, and giving yourself the space to feel less anger and more grief over what this money and your father's decision-making process represents would help you let go of your anger and resentments.\n\nin the meantime, try calling her his wife rather than the third wife. i understand that you have great feelings of antipathy toward her based on behavior that may or may not have been kind. if you want to lead by example, objectifying her in this way only really hurts you.\n\nthe moneyist: 'warren buffett and harry potter couldn't get those two retired early': our spendthrift neighbors said our adviser was 'lousy.' so how come we retired early?\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
millennials can't get a break.\n\nwhen they aren't spending all of their retirement funds on avocado toast (or eating out in restaurants, to be more exact), they're getting rid off beloved american staples like movies by binge-watching shows online, putting the death knell in sitcoms, and even single-handedly bringing about the end of churchgoing.\n\nsome of these trends may be overstated, but millennials do have different tastes and priorities than past generations, a new study from travel site contiki found. they prioritize activities over physical purchases, with 71% of 18- to 35-year-olds citing experiences as the most important thing in their lives. generation z, those born between 1995 and 2012, takes it even further, with 97% saying experiences are the most important.\n\nmillennials, those born between 1977 and 1994, are also more socially and politically aware: 61% believe in equality and 75% feel the economic and political state of the world will have a big impact on their generation. we also are living under the weight of massive student loan debt and a less-than-ideal job market.\n\nthese shifting values have led to the death of more than a handful of now-outdated norms. with the help of a recent twitter roundup on the topic, here are some of the things the generation has been accused of ruining in recent years. and, no, marketwatch isn't exactly innocent when it comes to blaming millennials for some of these trends.\n\n1. the 9 to 5 work week\n\nmillennials are demanding more flexibility in their jobs, and now nearly 40% of u.s. workers can work from home at least one day a week, according to a 2016 study. they also don't unplug at 5 p.m., with 68% saying they check work emails from home. the extension of our work lives into the home may concern some who are more tied to the traditional 40-hour workweek, but studies show employees in a flexible workplace can be more productive and happier with their careers.\n\n2. focus groups\n\namericans in their 20s and 30s are too cynical to reveal their hopes, dreams and buying habits to advertisers directly, one marketing officer told digital marketing site digiday. this means more companies have to abandon traditional marketing strategies like focus groups and instead rely on social media sourcing and native advertising. this can also be to the detriment of millennials, as companies amass a wealth of personal data on them.\n\n3. dinner dates\n\nwith the ceaseless mix of tinder swipes and okcupid matches they are subjected to, millennials have essentially given up on the dinner date. experts say they are dating more often and more casually, making the idea of sitting across from someone at a pricey dinner for a potentially long amount of time less desirable. online dating creates an enormous number of first dates in a short period of time, said relationship and etiquette expert april masini.\n\nstill, some millennials don't think they are missing out on anything: sure, getting asked to dinner might seem more exciting, but if you really like the person, isn't it just as good to hang out and watch netflix? does it matter what you're doing if you enjoy one another's company? wrote college student amanda spina at the odyssey.\n\n4. cruises\n\nmaybe millennials weren't exactly accused of ruining cruises, but they haven't been too supportive of the industry either. for some time, cruising had been designated as a vacation option for an older crowd, taking an additional hit after a string of high-profile gaffes including on-sea disasters and ship-wide illnesses. after being accused of nearly getting rid of the cruise, millennials are showing signs of bringing it back to life, after the industry took a number of measures to attract them.\n\n5. napkins\n\nmillennials are giving up the paper napkin, with 86% saying they are opting instead to use a paper towel as a napkin at the dinner table according to a 2016 study from market research company mintel. the good news: experts say the paper towel's ability to clean up messes make it a more versatile and economical choice, especially as fewer millennials eat dinner at home.\n\n6. running\n\nlast year, the wall street journal informed us millennials were ruining the sport of running. despite being the largest living generation and traditionally the largest share of runners, 18-to-34-year-olds made up only 33% runners in 2015 and 35% the year earlier, according to a study from industry-funded research group running usa. this decline comes despite a peak in 2013, when the number of runners reached an all-time high of 19 million. instead of continuing its increase as expected, the numbers plunged. thanks a lot, millennials.\n\nhere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\n7. golf\n\nanother sport millennials have been blamed for doing away with is golf. they are playing fewer rounds and even watching it on tv less frequently, the guardian reported in 2016. in fact, it is estimated that if such apathy continues, golf as we know it could disappear in 52 years.\n\n8. soap bars\n\nyoung people are over the soap bar — not because they are a dirty generation, but because they prefer liquid soap, a study from consumer-research firm mintel found. millennials found soap bars gross, with 60% saying they believe it is covered in germs after use.\n\n9. sex\n\ndo we live in a more permissive society? not where teenagers and people in their early 20s are concerned. it seems that members of the younger millennial cohort are apparently over sex as well. despite being pegged as the hookup generation, a 2016 study published in the archives of sexual behavior found 15% of millennials had not had sex since they turned 18. the sexual revolution is passé. people born in the 1970s reported an abstinence rate of 11.5% between the ages of 18 and 24 and 6.3% for those born in the late 60s.\n\n10. relationships\n\nmillennials aren't just having less sex, they're also dating less frequently and more casually. only 14% of people ages 18 to 29 were living with their partner in 2014, and few millennials use boyfriend or girlfriend to describe dating partners, according to a report from mic. a 2014 study also found that college students today are significantly less likely to have a regular sexual partner.\n\n11. marriage\n\nmillennials are marrying less often and later in life. with more debt to overcome, millennials are frequently living at home with their parents or with roommates according to analyses from real estate listing site trulia. they're also pushing off marriage until they are financially stable, which could be years for many of them. don't blame them, however. blame the $1.3 trillion in student debt that college graduates in america are currently shouldering.\n\n12. face-to-face interaction\n\nmillennials have replaced face-to-face communication with the smartphone, some studies say. nearly 4 in 10 millennials interact more with their phones than they do with parents, friends, children, significant others or co-workers, a 2016 bank of america study found.\n\n13. vacations\n\nmillennials are neglecting to take their allotted vacation time, with 43% qualifying as work martyrs — a category of people who feel guilty about taking time off and overworking themselves. this compares with just 29% of all workers, a study by 'project: time off', which promotes vacation time for america's workers and obviously has a vested interest in the subject. many millennials also don't have the funds to go for vacation, unless they take out additional debt.\n\n14. homeownership\n\nperhaps the most prominent norm millennials are accused of undermining: homeownership. if they're unable to afford vacations, they certainly can't put a down payment on a house in most places. under crippling student loan debt, many millennials are opting instead to move back in with parents or have a roommate long into their 30s. given stagnant wages and rising house prices, however, who can blame them?\n\n15. wine corks\n\nmillennials love wine but they don't love uncorking it. that's why the generation, which consumes nearly half of all wine in the u.s., is opting for cans of wine and bottles with twist-off caps, according to market measurement organization nielsen.\n\n16. diamonds\n\nthe diamond industry has struggled to woo millennials to the luxury item, with companies like de beers slashing prices by 9% to reach out to the generation, which prefers to spend money on experiences like travel rather than expensive goods, the daily beast reported. young consumers increasingly shun the taint of conflict and exploitation, and middlemen have been hit as banks balk at gemstones' untraceability, according to the economist.\n\n17. department stores\n\nas online shopping grows in popularity and millennial shopping habits shift, stores like macy's m and j.c. penney jcp have had to close hundreds of stores. studies show millennials are instead boosting traffic to outlet malls, preferring to shop for specific brands at stores devoted to them rather than picking up a piece of apparel here and there at department stores.
european stocks finished firmly in the green monday, underpinned by a rally in j sainsbury plc shares after enthusiasm around merger news offset losses among resource companies. most major european bourses also logged solid monthly gains.\n\nwhat are markets doing?\n\nthe stoxx europe 600 index sxxp, +0.40% was up 0.2% to end at 385.32, rising for the third session in a row. for the month, the pan-european index nabbed a gain of 3.9%, it is best monthly return since december 2016, cutting its year-to-date drop to 1%.
netflix's tax affairs in britain were thrown into the spotlight last night, reigniting the debate over how much tax tech companies pay in the countries where they are not physically present.\n\nthe u.s. streaming giant, which is home to popular tv shows and films like the crown and marriage story, was accused of committing superhighway robbery by taking the british taxpayer for a ride in a heated late-night debate held in the british parliament.\n\ncalculations by investigative think tank tax watch published last month suggested that netflix would have a tax bill of £13 million on annual pre-tax profits of £68.5 million. the think tank estimated that netflix made revenues of £1.08 billion from its british customers in 2019. however, customers are billed through a company registered in the netherlands, which means the streaming service is unlikely to help bulk up britain's tax coffers.\n\nnetflix said there were a number of inaccuracies in tax watch's report. netflix continues to invest heavily in the u.k. — spending more than £400 million on local productions in 2019, which helped to create over 25,000 jobs and training placements, a spokesperson for the streaming company told marketwatch in an emailed statement.\n\nthe person added that netflix nflx, +0.73% believes that international taxation needs reform and [it supports] the oecd's proposal for companies to pay more tax in the countries where their operations help generate value.\n\nnetflix takes out of the public purse more than it contributes in corporation tax, labour party mp margaret hodge said at the parliamentary debate.\n\nshe said that video streaming services must be included in the new digital-services tax. the british government has said it would introduce a 2% levy on the revenues of search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces which derive value from u.k. users in april. it claims this would generate £500 million a year for the treasury.\n\nbig tech companies like amazon amzn, +0.33% , facebook fb, +2.02% and google's parent company alphabet googl, +1.43% goog, +1.26% , have stretched existing international tax law to the limits, as they are able to book profits in low-tax countries like ireland regardless of where their customers reside.\n\nthe oecd has proposed a sweeping overhaul of corporate taxation designed to extract more from large multinationals, which would include companies in the digital, luxury goods and auto sectors. but several countries have still failed to reach a collective agreement.\n\nmiles dean, head of international tax at consultant andersen tax u.k. said: the furor over netflix's and other foreign corporates' tax bills continues. the consumer's contract is with a u.s. business. netflix does not trade in the u.k. and has no connection to the u.k. other than sales, marketing and of course its customer.\n\nhe added: under current law, netflix is paying all the tax it is obliged to pay. the only profit allocated to the u.k. is the amount paid to the sales and marketing function, on which tax is paid. forcing corporates to pay more in tax than what is required runs the risk of pushing these costs onto consumers, resulting in higher fees and costs for goods.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy husband cheated on me, moved out of our home, and moved in with his girlfriend in october 2019. he stopped paying all the bills and doesn't pay child support, or much of anything. he filed for divorce, but because we are unable to finish paying the lawyers, our divorce is on pause.\n\nthe internal revenue service has deposited all the stimulus money into his account, and he will not share it with me. i finally started working this past october, and this most current stimulus check went to him again! why did i not receive my own?\n\nwe have one minor child, and he took her share as well.\n\nstill married,\n\ndear married,\n\nyou may not have received a check because you did not file a tax return.\n\nit's not 100% clear from your letter whether you have a formal separation agreement. the irs has clear instructions on reporting people who falsely claim dependents. there are exceptions to the rules, but a child must live with the qualifying parent for more than half of the calendar year.\n\nyour estranged husband should tread carefully, as you have not lived together for over a year. when you knowingly claim a false dependent on your taxes, you risk sanctions and a potential audit from the irs, according to communitytax.com.\n\ngiven the unclear legal status of your marriage, you could use the irs policy as leverage when speaking to your husband. you can also follow the irs instructions on reporting false claims regarding dependents, if that is what has happened here.\n\nthe government is using the irs database as a way to determine people's eligibility for the stimulus payments. they are recoverable rebate credits on your 2020 return. the irs is using 2019 tax returns to gauge people's incomes; 2018 tax returns are used as a plan b.\n\nthis is not the first letter of this kind i have received during the pandemic about spouses pilfering stimulus payments. and it won't be the last. yours may be less clear cut than some of the other cases, but i would not give up hope on receiving your due in 2021 just yet.\n\nthe moneyist: i filed for bankruptcy after rehabbing my husband's home. now he wants an open marriage and says i own nothing. i feel trapped and bamboozled\n\nprevious letters have included financial abuse: this husband actually took the economic stimulus payment from his wife, a classic case of financial abuse where the abuser controls all the finances to maintain the power over his or her spouse in the relationship.\n\nin another such case, this former wife forged her husband's signature on an irs tax form (a classic case of old-fashioned fraud) and one that could be punishable with a custodial sentence, if it could be proven that she acted maliciously and/or with criminal intent.\n\nin the hat-trick of skulduggery of the moneyist's archive, this ex-wife dipped into her former husband's bank account and helped herself to his stimulus payment (a classic case of sharp practice, given that she had every right to withdraw money from a joint account).\n\nyour case highlights the importance of filing a tax return with the irs and keeping track of bank accounts. you can make a note of your husband's refusal to hand this over during any future divorce proceedings. a judge is unlikely to look kindly on such stingy stimulus shenanigans.\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group, where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nmore from quentin fottrell
amazon, berkshire hathaway and jpmorgan chase's announcement that they will create an independent company to offer health care to their employees free from profit-making incentives and constraints sent a shock through the health-care industry, with share prices of some incumbents tumbling on jan. 30.\n\nof course, this is not a surprise since anything amazon, for one, takes on shakes the incumbents. but this one might be different.\n\nas a former health-insurance ceo and professor, i see that based on their history and financial power, this new company could be a disruptive force in the industry.\n\na complex system\n\nwhile most people experience insurance and doctors as the face of the health-care sector, the moving parts of health care are much more complex. only recently have doctors and insurers even been able to talk the same language through a massive federally financed move toward electronic medical records. and even then, insurers talk in terms of billing codes, while doctors deal with diagnoses and outcomes.\n\nthe marriage of the two through new organizational forms such as accountable care organizations and payment units like bundled payments — for something like a hip or knee replacement, for example — show promise that the elements can collaborate but only in defined areas. mainly these approaches are designed to bring the most excessive doctors and hospitals back toward the average in terms of cost. but even average health care costs are too high, and the outcomes are too poor to satisfy most americans.\n\ninto this maelstrom comes the party with the most to gain and the best leverage to change the system — and i mean employers, not the government.\n\nread:jamie dimon, jeff bezos and warren buffett lost patience with skyrocketing health costs — these charts explain why\n\nmost insurance isn't really insurance\n\nyou may not know that most employer-based insurance isn't insurance at all. it's just a way for a contracted entity that looks like an insurer to act as a purchasing agent and paymaster for the real deep pockets: the self-insured employer.\n\nany employer with at least 100 or 200 employees can do much better just writing the check for what is spent on health care rather than paying an insurance company to bear the risk. they only have to have reinsurance to cover the costs above the level that they can finance themselves.\n\nit is interesting to note that one of the largest u.s. reinsurance companies, gen re, is at the core of berkshire hathaway's brk.a, +0.53% brk.b, +0.18% empire.\n\nclearly, there's a potentially powerful force for change in the self-insured employer who, in aggregate, covers over 100 million people and is exempted from much state regulation by federal law.\n\nin the past, there have been five major ways these employers have attacked the health-care tapeworm described by warren buffett. through their insurance company agents, they can:\n\n• hire a manager to do it (i.e., managed care), or pay them a flat amount each year (i.e., fixed amount per employee per year), or both.\n\n• channel employees to the best providers (i.e., narrow networks and direct contracts with centers of excellence).\n\n• change the incentives for the employee to be more careful (i.e., high deductible health plans) and help them save for routine needs through, for instance, health savings accounts.\n\n• encourage them to shop more carefully with online comparison tools for quality plus differential copays for favored providers.\n\n• maintain a lifestyle of wellness through, for example offering membership to health clubs, discounts for fitbit us:fit health-tracking devices, or a direct bonus or penalty.\n\nbut none of these have done the job.\n\nso what do these three big disrupters expect?\n\nbesides being large employers themselves, warren buffett knows insurance through his gen re reinsurance company. amazon amzn, -3.44% has taught everyone how to shop far better online than in stores, and jpmorgan jpm, +1.65% has had extensive experience with health savings accounts, which are tax-sheltered savings accounts paired with high-deductible insurance polices that eligible people can use to pay for health care costs. they know the elements of the past playbook individually.\n\nbut their announcement signals that the goal is something much more: an integrated technology-driven approach to all facets of health care beyond the earlier individual initiatives.\n\nread:here's what we actually know about the amazon, berkshire and j.p. morgan health initiative (hint: very little)\n\nwhile they did not mention the changes that must happen in the delivery sector, implied is the assumption that doctors and hospitals will adapt to this new world, holding down their costs, making prices more transparent, and innovating in their physical and electronic delivery of care.\n\nwhile these issues are all important, this partnership does not address other problems of the broken u.s. health care system and its ever-expanding costs. also of concern are the role of skyrocketing drug prices protected by patents and direct-to-consumer advertising; expensive end-of-life decisions; explosive potential use of genetic information; and prevention and management of chronic conditions derived from personal choices.\n\nand the most critical factor in the success of their plan is the fact that the doctor knows the medical facts better than the patient or purchaser. we want a medical expert to tell us what must be done in any situation. but when the incentives for the physician agent are not aligned with broader objectives, their decisions may be less than optimal, and this is often the case.\n\none has to applaud the initiative if you are outside the health-care sector and fear it if you are inside. when these three threaten to disrupt an industry, those in it had better listen carefully and adapt as quickly as they can.\n\nj.b. silvers is a professor of health finance at case western reserve university. this was first published on the conversation — why amazon and friends' plan could be a major disrupter of health care system
albany, n.y. (ap) — as the democratic party turned sharply against new york gov. andrew cuomo and he faces growing allegations of sexual harassment, he insisted friday he wouldn't resign and castigated politicians calling for him to quit as reckless and dangerous and engaging in cancel culture.\n\ni did not do what has been alleged. period, he said, again calling on the public to let ongoing investigations into his conduct to play out. wait for the facts.\n\npoliticians who don't know a single fact but yet form a conclusion and an opinion are, in my opinion, reckless and dangerous, he added.\n\nwith a sprawling coalition of congressional leaders joining dozens of state lawmakers in calling for the embattled governor to step down, the democrat hit back.\n\nsee also: duke, kentucky and virginia could all miss the ncaa tournament — will ratings suffer?\n\nyou need to know the facts before you make a decision, he said. people know the difference between playing politics, bowing to cancel culture and the truth.\n\ncuomo's growing list of detractors now covers virtually every region in the state and the political power centers of new york city and washington. his allies insist he will not resign, but as allegations of sexual harassment grow, his political isolation has reached unprecedented levels.\n\nthe victims of sexual assault concern me more than politics or other narrow considerations, and i believe governor cuomo must step aside, said rep. sean patrick maloney, a new york democrat who leads his party's house campaign arm.\n\nprominent progressive rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, a new york democrat, said she believes the women who have accused the three-term democratic governor of wrongdoing.\n\nafter two accounts of sexual assault, four accounts of harassment, the attorney general's investigation finding the governor's admin hid nursing home data from the legislature and public, we agree with the 55+ members of the new york state legislature that the governor must resign, ocasio-cortez tweeted.\n\nsee also: here's how far the nasdaq could fall if bond yields reach 2%\n\ncuomo has denied he ever touched anyone inappropriately and has said he's sorry if he ever made anyone uncomfortable. he reiterated that friday while insisting: i never harassed anyone. i never assaulted anyone. i never abused anyone.\n\nbut, he said, what is being alleged simply did not happen.\n\nthe escalating scandal jeopardizes cuomo's 2022 reelection in an overwhelmingly democratic state, but also threatens to cast a cloud over president joe biden's earliest days in office. republicans across the country have seized on the growing allegations against cuomo to try to distract from biden's success with the pandemic and challenge his party's well-established advantage with female voters.\n\nwhite house press secretary jen psaki has repeatedly said that biden and vice president kamala harris support the state attorney general's investigation into the harassment allegations.\n\nthe governor in recent days has been calling lawmakers and supporters asking them to refrain from calling for his resignation, and instead support the ongoing investigations. his strategy does not appear to be working.\n\nthe state assembly allowed an impeachment investigation into cuomo on thursday as lawmakers investigate whether there are grounds for his forcible removal from office.\n\nalong with an allegation that the governor groped a female aide at the executive mansion last year, cuomo is facing allegations of sexually suggestive remarks and behavior toward women, including female aides. one aide said he asked her if she would ever have sex with an older man. and another aide claimed the governor once kissed her without consent, and said governor's aides publicly smeared her after she accused him of sexual harassment.\n\nin weeks past, calls for the governor's impeachment or resignation have come from republicans or left-leaning democrats in new york city. but more democratic lawmakers from surrounding and upstate communities have joined in as the week progressed.\n\na majority of state lawmakers and more than half of new york's democratic congressional members are now calling for him to step down.\n\non friday, u.s. reps. jerry nadler, ocasio-cortez, jamaal bowman, mondaire jones, nydia velazquez, adriano espaillat, carolyn maloney, grace meng, antonio delgado, brian higgins and yvette clarke pushed for cuomo's resignation, joining kathleen rice, who called for cuomo's resignation previously.\n\nother republicans in new york's congressional delegation previously called for cuomo's resignation, including nicole malliotakis, elise stefanik, claudia tenney and lee zeldin.\n\nnadler said cuomo has lost the confidence of new yorkers.\n\nthe repeated accusations against the governor, and the manner in which he has responded to them, have made it impossible for him to continue to govern at this point, nadler said.\n\nnew york democrats also pointed to sweeping criticism of cuomo for keeping secret how many nursing home residents died of covid-19 for months. the governor has claimed his administration had to verify deaths of residents at hospitals, but critics question why that hasn't held up the release of data in other states.\n\nspokespeople for new york's democratic u.s. senators, chuck schumer and kirsten gillibrand, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment friday.\n\nthe 63-year-old governor is seeking his fourth four-year term next year. new york has no term limits. he has touted his administration's passage of liberal goals such as same-sex marriage as evidence that his hard-nosed approach to politics works.\n\nyet cuomo has increasingly faced criticism that he's too often aggressively wielded his power to bolster his own image rather than to benefit new yorkers.\n\na state attorney general report in january correctly estimated that his administration had yet to reveal thousands of deaths among nursing residents to covid-19, while a democratic assemblyman accused the governor of bullying and threatening him for speaking up against the governor.\n\nin recent days, more moderate democrats in new york have raised concerns about the allegations against cuomo, who has long enjoyed support from suburban and centrist voters. on friday, a bloc of five moderate democrats from long island called for cuomo to step aside, at least until the attorney general's investigation is complete.\n\nthe long island lawmakers said the allegations are beyond troubling and describe a disturbing pattern of behavior that also now includes a potentially criminal act.\n\nthe governor cannot lead the state while faithfully responding to multiple investigations, they wrote.
retail is dead, and amazon and other faang companies are taking over the world.\n\nnot so fast, says brian milligan, the lead manager of the ave maria growth fund, which has a five-star ranking, the highest, from morningstar.\n\nfaang companies comprise facebook fb, -1.90% , amazon amzn, -3.44% , apple aapl, -3.39% , netflix nflx, -3.75% and google holding company alphabet goog, -2.62% googl, -2.92% . a common theme for the u.s. economy and for investors has been the demise of brick-and-mortar retailers in the age of amazon.\n\nbut milligan argued during an interview that there are plenty of companies that are either well-positioned to benefit from the dominance of amazon and the other faangs or are sufficiently competitive to weather the storm and even thrive.\n\no'reilly automotive\n\no'reilly automotive orly, -0.17% a car-parts retailer with more than 5,000 stores in the u.s., is rapidly expanding. what milligan loves about the company is its focus on providing best-in-class inventory through an established supply chain built to serve professional service providers, as well as people who fix their own cars.\n\nmilligan says there are two areas of retail that are not amazonable: home improvement and car parts. he names o'reilly as a prime example of a company with a wide moat and strong network.\n\nwith auto parts, time is of the essence, milligan says. some mechanics get six to eight deliveries a day from an o'reilly store and they often expect deliveries within 30 minutes.\n\nbrian d. milligan, lead manager of the ave maria growth fund. ave maria mutual funds\n\nhe expects a tremendous growth opportunity for o'reilly in the years ahead as more repairs that people have traditionally done at home are moved to repair shops and some jobs move from the shops to auto dealers that are better equipped for certain high-tech repairs. the company can enter a market where they are not the first call, and then gain share because they have the parts, milligan said.\n\nhe went on to say that during 2017 o'reilly and its competitors blamed the financial crisis for a slowdown that helped lead to a significant decline (and then recovery) for the shares:\n\nfactset\n\nthe car-parts retailers have a sweet spot that is cars four to seven years old, milligan said. and the slowdown of car sales from 2008 through 2011 means a temporary decline in the number of vehicles in the sweet spot.\n\nmilligan said he was aggressively buying the shares as they declined last year. you can see in the chart that the stock has recovered and the company's first-quarter numbers looked good, with sales increasing 6% from a year earlier and comparable-store sales rising 3.4%. meanwhile, the company's gross margin (sales less the cost of goods sold, divided by sales) improved from a year earlier, according to data provided by factset.\n\ncopart\n\nmilligan called copart cprt, -1.38% the favorite company i have ever invested in. copart runs online auctions of salvaged cars. the business of salvaging cars is growing because insurers are more likely to consider a car totaled because the increasing number of high-tech components can more easily make it not worthwhile to repair a car after a serious accident.\n\nthe number of vehicles being totaled is going up by double digits, plus the average selling price per unit is going up in the mid-teens. the higher the price, the higher the service fee copart earns, milligan said.\n\ngraco\n\ngraco ggg, -0.89% makes fluid-handling systems, including paint sprayers, and according to milligan spends three times as much as its peer group on research and development.\n\nmilligan loves graco's moat for painting high-ticket machinery. if you are putting together a $70,000 piece of equipment, you are not going to skimp on paint. they have a lot of pricing power, he said.\n\nrockwell automation\n\nmilligan called rockwell automation rok, -0.39% best in class, for industrial automation, which he called an extremely attractive market with strong global growth potential. the company rejected three takeout offers from emerson electric last year.\n\npayment processors\n\ntying into the growth of amazon and ecommerce in general, visa v, -1.06% and mastercard ma, -3.08% are both among the top holdings of the ave maria growth fund. the companies together control more than 80% of card spending in the u.s., he said.\n\nwith strong incremental margins, there is tremendous room for growth, with tens of trillions of dollars of payment opportunities across cash/check, digital and new segments, milligan added.\n\nan outperforming fund\n\nthe $579 million ave maria growth fund avegx, -1.28% has had an excellent track record, with expenses that morningstar considers below average and with very low turnover in its portfolio of 26% during 2017.\n\nave maria mutual funds describes itself as the largest catholic mutual fund family in the u.s., with about $2.4 billion in assets under

when certified financial planner christina empedocles leads money workshops, she doesn't start with dollars-and-cents details, like how much to save for retirement or stash in an emergency fund.\n\ninstead she asks people to recall childhood memories about money. who were their positive and negative role models? what did they learn about money from them?\n\nthe idea is you have your own money story, says empedocles, owner of insight personal finance in san francisco.\n\nthe story's underlying themes provide clues about what drives your behavior. ever wonder why you can't save a dime, no matter how many raises you get? or why you're afraid to talk to your spouse about the checking account? or why you can't even think about making a financial plan?\n\nif money stresses you out, it's probably worth looking back at your childhood.\n\nthere is a connection, says ed coambs, a marriage and family therapist with carolinas couples counseling in matthews, north carolina. he is also a certified financial planner and board member of the financial therapy association. but those money connections may require a little digging to find and understand them.\n\nwhat's your money story?\n\nunraveling your money story can be an eye-opener.\n\nthere is so often an 'aha' moment — 'now i know why i do this!' empedocles says. i have seen people have that realization and go on to make big changes.\n\nempedocles recalls one woman whose coupon-clipping mother watched every dollar. growing up, the woman found her mom's frugality painfully restrictive, so as an adult, she reveled in her ability to spend freely. even small decisions, such as buying the most expensive crackers in the snack aisle or using out-of-network atms regardless of the extra fees, served as affirmations of i'm an adult, not a kid, empedocles says.\n\nthe result was a chaotic financial life. but the woman didn't realize what was driving her until she wrote down her money story and examined how it was affecting her.\n\nshe realized, 'i'm battling my mom, but i'm just hurting myself,' empedocles says.\n\ndon't miss: millennials say anxiety about money is literally making them sick\n\nafter that, the woman evaluated her money habits and eliminated meaningless spending. in one year, she saved $12,000.\n\nhere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\ncarrying emotional money baggage\n\noverspending isn't the only symptom of a distorted relationship with money.\n\nhaving gobs of money and not feeling like you have enough, is another, says marty kurtz, a certified financial planner and founder and partner of the planning center in moline, illinois.\n\nfor example, someone who grows up in a family with too little money could carry that sense of scarcity into adulthood, even after making a fortune, kurtz says.\n\nmost people pick up cues on how to deal with money from their parents, says j.j. sessions, a certified financial planner and partner of the planning center in maple grove, minnesota.\n\nsometimes children misinterpret those cues, and the lessons kids absorb aren't what parents intended. one of sessions' earliest money memories was working out an agreement with his parents to do a certain number of chores to earn a bicycle. he worked hard, and occasionally his mom cut him a break and counted one chore as two.\n\nhis mom was being kind, sessions says, but the breaks ultimately cheapened the reward in his mind. as an adult, he often felt like he didn't do enough to earn whatever money he made, until he realized how he had been carrying the distorted bike lesson with him.\n\nclearing the way for a financial plan\n\nbringing awareness to the unconscious forces driving behavior helps clarify your relationship with money. then, you can think about your true values and modify your financial habits to line up with them.\n\nyou might like: how a financial pro turned a money crisis into a valuable lesson\n\nare unresolved issues getting in your way?\n\nhere are some steps to find out and start addressing them.\n\ntune in. pay attention to physical sensations when you think about money issues, coambs says. is your body calm and at ease, or do you feel a tightness in your chest, stomach or shoulders?

how did you feel? what are your earliest money memories? what did you learn from them?\n\ntalk to someone you trust. everybody needs a third party to talk about life and money with, kurtz says. the trusted person might be a spouse, a good friend or a professional adviser. a financial adviser can help you create a plan to match your goals.\n\nget help if you need it. if you're struggling, it might help to talk to a counselor or financial therapist. you can find one through the financial therapy association's member directory.\n\nnobody has a perfect relationship with money, but the more self-awareness you can bring to finances, the better off you'll be.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
love & money is a marketwatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.\n\nmany new couples inquire about a potential mate's age or how many previous partners they've had. others are more interested in another number.\n\napproximately 42% of adults say knowing someone's credit score would affect their willingness to date that person, according to a recent survey by personal-finance website bankrate.com. that's up from nearly 40% last year. women were nearly three times as likely to consider credit score a major influence on a potential partner compared to men (20% versus 7%). younger daters are not as concerned about these three digits: 45% of older millennials, defined here as those aged 27 to 36, said they care about these three digits.\n\n credit scores reveal an individual's relationship skill and level of commitment, and trustworthiness. \n\nthis can be useful for people using dating sites like tinder, bumble, okcupid iac, +0.09% and match.com. a high credit score can help predict whether someone is trustworthy. similar credit scores are highly predictive of whether couples stay together, according to another 2015 paper by researchers at ucla, the brookings institution and federal reserve board, washington, d.c. initial credit scores and match quality predict subsequent credit usage and financial distress, which in turn are correlated with relationship dissolution, they wrote. credit scores reveal an individual's relationship skill and level of commitment.\n\nalso see:women don't see men who drive flashy cars as husband material\n\nprevious studies have documented the various traits by which individuals sort themselves into committed relationships, including race, educational attainment, and earning capacity, parental wealth, social caste and physical appearance, they wrote. credit scores are arguably the most prominent individual-level characteristic lenders use to underwrite credit. these three digits, therefore, help give single people a bird's eye view into a person's ability to meet future financial (and familial) obligations.\n\nby showing an interest in these three digits, people are probably being smart rather than shallow, says jeffrey hall, associate professor of communications at the university of kansas. finances, education, and job prospects all factor into the value of a potential mate, he says. assuming that people can actually interpret a credit score meaningfully, it makes sense they would think a credit score is useful in evaluating mate value.\n\n low credit scores can deny one access to a mortgage and increase the costs of loans by thousands of dollars. \n\nwhat people do and say in the early days of dating might have an impact later on. people are combining their finances when they marry, after all, and that can impact their future happiness. in fact, the higher your credit score, the less likely you'll separate from your partner — and a lower score often means you'll be less lucky in love. more than half of americans (58%) said they wouldn't marry someone with significant debt, according to a study released in march 2017 of more than 2,300 adults from legal industry site avvo.\n\nwhile knowing someone's credit score doesn't necessarily reveal whether that person has a medical or student debt or even their annual income, it does indicate whether they are eligible for a loan. a bank will look at each person's middle scores— from the three major credit bureaus, experian, equifax, and transunion — and then take a couple's average score to determine their overall credit worthiness. and a low credit score doesn't necessarily mean that you are irresponsible with money or even have no money. credit scoring models look at the amount a consumer owes versus the total amount of credit available, known as the credit utilization ratio.\n\nalso see: americans will talk about sex and infidelity before they talk about this…\n\nlow credit scores can deny one access to a mortgage or increase the costs of credit by thousands of dollars, says stephen brobeck, executive director of the consumer federation of america, a consumer advocacy group. credit scores are likely to increase the finance charges on a $20,000, 60-month car loan by more than $5,000.\n\nfor those who are interested in talking about this during a candle-lit dinner, they should know what it means. a score between 661 and 780 is considered good credit and between 781 and 850 is regarded as excellent credit, according to financial website credit.com. the site rates fair credit as between 601 and 660, poor credit between 501 and 600 and bad credit as anything below 500.\n\n previous research suggests women are more concerned about their potential partner's earning power than men. \n\nbut different lenders may have different criteria when it comes to loaning money, and may approve borrowers with a credit score of below 700. a high score effectively means that their prospective date has been paying their bills off on time, or only uses a small percentage of their available credit on credit cards.\n\ndon't miss: the larger the rock, the rockier the marriage\n\nstill, those millennials in bankrate's study might be too quick to judge. that age group also has the lowest credit scores of any generation of americans, a separate report released by credit bureau experian concluded. the report, based on anonymous data from experian's consumer credit database, found that millennials have an average credit score of 625 on an average debt of $52,120.\n\nby comparison, generation x (aged 35 to 49) have a credit score of 650 on average debt of $125,000, while both baby boomers and the greatest generation (with a combined age of between 50 and 87) have credit scores of 709 on average debt of $87,438. credit scores, experts say, are built on experience, and millennials have plenty of time to improve their digits.\n\nprevious research also supports the proposition that women are more concerned about their potential partner's earning power than men. too many women are still overly-focused on their romantic partner's holdings. in their minds, money equals power, and women want powerful men, says fran walfish, a beverly hills, calif.-based psychotherapist. money comes and goes, and you are always faced with each other.\n\nwalfish says the rich, famous and privileged flock into her office with the same ailments and issues as regular people, namely communication, sexual issues, parenting, and, most importantly, conflict resolution skills. financial responsibility runs through most of these issues, and can be a test for how willing people are to work together as a team to build a future. the goal for every person is to evolve as a complete, whole and self-reliant individual, she says.\n\n(this story was updated on july 22, 2019.)
most retirees regret not saving more. a 2018 study by transamerica center for retirement studies found 73% wish they'd put aside more money on a consistent basis, and half felt they waited too long to get serious about retirement saving.\n\nbut retirement is about more than the balance in your 401(k). even people with sizable nest eggs can wish they handled certain aspects of retirement differently.\n\nhoping to learn from others' mistakes, i asked advisers with the financial planning association and the alliance of comprehensive planners to share their clients' biggest regrets about retirement. thirty-one advisers responded, and their answers revealed some common themes. among them:\n\n'i wish we had traveled more while we could'\n\nall too often, health issues derail people's travel plans, says certified financial planner serina shyu of atlanta. they don't get around to taking that dream trip or get to see as many places as they'd hoped. even homebodies regret missed chances to see loved ones.\n\nanother version is where the health issue isn't [the retiree's]. 'i wish we had gone to see so-and-so,' says cfp daniel b. moisand of melbourne, florida. sometimes we wait to reconnect with friends or family and that person dies or suffers a stroke or dementia.\n\nfinancial planners can help people get clarity about how much money they can safely spend in retirement. cfp linda y. leitz of colorado springs, colorado, says she's been able to reassure several clients so they could get started on their bucket lists.\n\nas they aged and either had health concerns or just didn't enjoy being away from home as much, they all were really glad that they traveled, leitz says. they don't mind cutting back in later years because they had done the things that were important to them, early in retirement, while they could enjoy them.\n\n'i wish i'd had something to retire to'\n\npeople can be so tired of working, or sick of their particular job, that they retire at the first opportunity without thinking through how they will spend their time. many struggle to replace the structure, meaning and purpose their work provided.\n\nalso on marketwatch: retiree warning: history suggests we're overdue for a bear market\n\nthey look back five or six years after they have retired to realize the time has flown by and they have not done anything, says cfp jonathan p. bednar of knoxville, tennessee.\n\ncfp jennifer weber of lake success, new york, counsels her clients to think about how to spend their days with meaning. that could mean a part-time job, consulting gigs, volunteering or spending more time with friends and family, she says.\n\n'i wish i had more friends'\n\nsomething else work provides: social contact. people often don't realize how much social interaction their workplace provides, says cfp patti b. black of birmingham, alabama. black recommends volunteer groups, clubs and classes as potential sources of new friends.\n\npeople may feel 'out of the loop' in retirement, black says. it takes time and effort to find a new tribe.\n\n'i wish we hadn't bought that house'\n\ncfp kevin m. o'brien of northborough, massachusetts, says some of his clients' retirement home purchases triggered serious buyer's remorse. the clients hadn't spent enough time in the community before buying, and now wish they lived somewhere else.\n\nthe cost and stress of changing homes is usually significant. although moving may be the right choice, no one should buy a retirement home in haste, o'brien says.\n\nsee: the no. 1 thing people with fat savings accounts scrimp on that you likely don't\n\nretirees should rent in areas they're interested in retiring to before making a major purchase, o'brien says.\n\n'i wish we'd talked about our expectations for retirement'\n\nit's not uncommon for spouses to have dramatically different visions of retirement. o'brien has advised couples where one spouse was thrilled to be the grandkids' child care provider while the other longed to travel and be more spontaneous.\n\nthey can't just up and go because they are relied on to watch the grandchildren, o'brien says.\n\ndifferent expectations can cause serious ruptures in relationships, and they may be among the reasons why divorce rates for people 55 and older have more than doubled since 1990 even as the overall divorce rate subsides, black says.\n\nblack urges spouses to discuss how they will spend their time, including how the division of household chores might change and even whether they'll have lunch together every day. as with so many other aspects of marriage, the willingness to talk through disagreements and find compromises is essential, she says.\n\nretirement is a major life transition, and you have to be patient with yourself and your spouse, black says.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
on a scale of 1 to 10, meghan markle's interview with oprah winfrey was a 50.\n\nallegations of racism within the royal household and conversations about how dark her son archie's skin color would be, and the duchess of sussex's despair at the alleged lack of support from the firm and her suicidal thoughts were perhaps among the most shocking revelations. for those reasons and others, the couple needed to get out.\n\nprince harry said one thing made their escape to the u.s. possible, allowing them to pay for the security they required. i brought what my mom left me and, without that, we would not have been able to do this, so touching back on what my mother would think of this, i think she saw it coming. i certainly felt her presence throughout this whole process.\n\n prince harry served in the british army and, showing his entreprenurial chops, created the invictus games for wounded armed services personnel. \n\nharry's late mother, princess diana, died in a car crash in paris in 1997 while being pursued by photographers — the culmination of a long battle against the relentless, prying eyes of the british red tops, which dissected her every move in the years following her 1981 marriage to prince charles, and 1996 divorce. she passed her love of service onto her son.\n\nprincess diana had reportedly long dreamed of starting a new life in the u.s. she was 36, the same age prince harry is now. ultimately, he found the freedom in the u.s. his mother never found; she died in a high-speed car chase and portentously no longer had u.k. security. i'm just really relieved and happy to be sitting here, talking to you with my wife by my side, he told oprah.\n\nprince harry served in the british army and, showing his entreprenurial chops, created the invictus games for wounded armed services personnel. while the couple's break for the border releases them from the drab ribbon-cutting, handshaking daily duties of royal life, and alleged racism both inside and outside of the royal family, it has a golden lesson for us all: adversity + planning = growth.\n\nthe conservation of energy theory states that energy is neither created nor destroyed, but merely transforms from one kind to another. the duke and duchess of sussex were committed to royal life at first, but their difficulties with the british royal family and the reported racist onslaught from the u.k. media led to new opportunities, innovation and change.\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\ni was trapped, but i had no idea i was trapped, prince harry told oprah. my father and my brother, they are trapped. they don't get to leave. and i have compassion for that. but prince harry said he was saved, first by his american wife, but also by his late mother, princess diana. their financial know-how made their bid for financial freedom possible.\n\nharry said his family literally cut me off financially in the first quarter of 2020. the couple's deals to create streaming content with netflix nflx, +0.08% and spotify came, he said, after they realized they needed to earn money for a security detail that had also been cut off, despite the unchanged level of threat to the couple.\n\n working at a young age builds character and a work ethic. meghan markle was no stranger to hard work. \n\ncrucially, princess diana, who was still in her 30s, made a will. harry inherited approximately 7 million british pounds ($9.2 million) from his mother's estate, the bbc estimated. (his father's side of the family is far richer — worth more than $88 billion, according to forbes — including investments, properties, castles and land.)\n\nanother key to their escape for the border: markle is financially independent, primarily from her acting career. she told oprah, i've always worked. i've always valued independence ...my first job was when i was 13, at a frozen yogurt shop called humphrey yogart. mixing her cause-driven work and royal brand, they have embarked on a series of content deals in the u.s.\n\nworking at a young age builds character and a work ethic. markle was no stranger to hard work. mark cuban worked as a garbage-bag salesman, richard branson sold christmas trees, warren buffet delivered newspapers and, yes, meghan markle held a suitcase full of money on deal or no deal. she told oprah she thanked god for her life experience and work ethic.\n\nwork hard. make a will, even if you are in your 30s and especially if you have children. save money. all of this will help you be prepared for the unexpected: whether it's a recession, a pandemic or a break from the family firm. when life knocks you sideways, you will be able to adapt, and change course. and you don't need millions of dollars or a royal title to do that.\n\nultimately, you have to know when to make your move, whether it's a job, a bad marriage or, in this case, a dysfunctional family system and a family business that appears to value some members over others. even after working so hard toward something or for someone, be it an institution or a person, there is also a great freedom in not wanting or needing that something anymore.\n\nthe national suicide prevention lifeline provides help and support for people with suicidal thoughts. anyone wishing to connect to the lifeline can call 1-800-273-talk (8255).\n\nyou can email the moneyist with any financial and ethical questions related to coronavirus at qfottrell@marketwatch.com\n\nhello there, marketwatchers. check out the moneyist private facebook fb, +1.69% group where we look for answers to life's thorniest money issues. readers write in to me with all sorts of dilemmas. post your questions, tell me what you want to know more about, or weigh in on the latest moneyist columns.\n\nby submitting your story to dow jones & company, the publisher of marketwatch, you understand and agree that we may use your story, or versions of it, in all media and platforms, including via third parties.
dear moneyologist,\n\nmy husband and i have been married 14 years. we live in california and i am contemplating divorce. i am 62 and he is 65. when we married, he owned a home (with a mortgage) purchased five years prior. a few years into our marriage, when interest rates fell, he refinanced the home. a couple of days before submitting the application, he asked me to sign an inter-spousal transfer of ownership (known as a quitclaim).\n\nthe reason: he said i had a student loan which had at one time been in default and we would not be able to receive a good interest rate, or that the loan might be altogether denied. he promised that as soon as the loan was approved, he would follow up by putting me back on title.\n\ndon't miss: my wife gives our wayward son $25,000 a year — what should i do?\n\na few weeks later, we purchased a second home (cabin). just a few minutes before going in to finalize the purchase, he asked to sign another quitclaim, citing the same circumstances. the mortgage on the cabin is underwater at this time.\n\nit has been 14 years since this happened, and he refuses to add me to the title. he finally admitted that he indeed had an ulterior motive, as he witnessed a friend who underwent a divorce and lost a house to his former spouse and that he was not going to be taken advantage of if we divorced.\n\nwhat are my options? i feel that i was deceived and that this constitutes fraud. about 90% of his investments were made before we were married, and i am also aware that he has made no provisions for me in his will nor named me as a beneficiary to his life insurance.\n\nbeverly in california\n\ndear beverly,\n\nthe investments he had prior to your marriage belong to your husband and he is free to name anyone from the next-door neighbor to the window cleaner on his life insurance. now, the good news:\n\ncalifornia — in addition to arizona, idaho, louisiana, texas, nevada, new mexico and washington — treat all marital assets as community property. that means that assets acquired during the marriage are divided equally between the two spouses. notwithstanding an agreement otherwise, upon the death of a married person, one-half of the community property belongs to the surviving spouse and the other half belongs to the decedent, according to california probate code section 100(a).\n\nwhy is that important to you? because the refinancing of this home and the purchase of the cabin were made during your marriage, so it's irrelevant whether your husband had you sign a quitclaim or not. and as i advised this woman, many states have laws stating that an increase in the property value of a separate property could move it to community property, especially if it was due to a renovation.\n\nread:i will disinherit my daughter if she marries this man\n\nyour husband's shady behavior could end up doing him more harm than good in any divorce settlement. there are a lot of good, honest people out there waiting for you post-divorce. a judge could look unfavorably on your husband's behavior and your testimony (if you don't have it in an email) that your husband did this because he wanted to prevent you from even owning the property you both bought during your marriage.\n\nthere is a precedent for this: in 1996, a california woman won $1.3 million in the lottery and filed for divorce 11 days later without even telling her husband or anyone else about her windfall. a couple of years later her husband discovered her deception and sued. superior court judge richard denner ruled that she acted out of fraud or malice and awarded her husband all of her winnings. a judge could, in theory, take a similar view and punish your husband.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to the moneyologist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyologist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
we already know divorce can be bad for your check book and your emotional health. it turns out, it can be bad for your physical health, too.\n\na recent study published in the annals of behavioral medicine, an academic journal, suggests people who divorce have a greater likelihood of smoking and lower amounts of physical activity.\n\nresearchers at the university of arizona studied more than 5,700 people, using the english longitudinal study of aging, a long-term health study of adults over 50 in the u.k. there are seven sets of data in the study, collected every two years, beginning in 2002. some 900 of the study participants were divorced or separated and had not remarried. the rest were married.\n\nthey reported their life satisfaction, their exercise frequency, smoking status and measurements of their lung function and levels of inflammation. those who were divorced or separated had a 46% greater risk of dying during the study than their counterparts who were still married. (the researchers controlled for factors like gender, health, age and socioeconomic status.)\n\nwhy the deterioration in divorcees' health? divorced or separated participants, especially women, were less satisfied with life than their married counterparts in the study, the researchers found. that creates an unhealthy and potentially fatal spiral: lower satisfaction with life was also linked to lower levels of physical activity and lower levels of physical activity is linked to greater risk for an early death.\n\nthe fertility market is projected to reach over $30 billion by 2023\n\nthat said, not all marriages are the same, and it's important to distinguish between healthy, happy ones and toxic ones, that might be impacting one or both partners' health negatively, said jennifer behnke, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in juno beach, fla. in a miserable relationship, you're sitting on the couch, watching tv, feeling that toxicity of resentment and not getting your needs met, she said.\n\nbut this isn't the first study that has shown a link between divorce and a negative impact on health. a 2009 study from researchers at the university of chicago and johns hopkins university found that divorced or widowed people have 20% more chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer, than married people.\n\ndivorced or widowed people also have 23% more mobility limitations than married people, such as trouble climbing stairs or walking one block. people who never married have about the same number of chronic health conditions as married people. but they do report 13% more depressive symptoms and 12% more mobility limitations than people who are married.\n\nhealthier partners might actually help their spouse stay healthier, too, bourassa said. if you imagine a husband or wife who doesn't smoke and their partner does, one might try to influence the other's behavior. in many ways, when relationships end, we lose that important social control of our health behaviors.\n\nstill, divorce doesn't have to lead to poor health outcomes, the researchers of the latest study said. quality of life can actually improve for people who have ended relationships that are unhealthy for them. in fact, right after a divorce, individuals will often hit the gym even more, as they re-enter the dating world, behnke said.\n\nit's called a 'revenge body' for a reason.\n\nbut smoking and exercise could be important factors to watch in divorcees, bourassa said. if we know someone who is divorced, maybe we should ask, 'are you smoking? are you getting enough physical activity?' he said.
karen pence, wife of vp mike pence since 1985, said tuesday that she's excited to get back to doing what she loves to do — teach!\n\nwhat the second lady didn't mention is she'll be working under a strict biblical morality policy, which is pretty specific about who's allowed at the school.\n\nhere's a snippet from the application:\n\n 'moral misconduct which violates the bona fide occupational qualifications for employees includes, but is not limited to, such behaviors as the following: heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites.' \n\nthe school also asks applicants to pledge to live a personal life of moral purity by signing off on sections, including one that says god intended sexual acts occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other.\n\nthose are just some of the guidelines laid out by immanuel christian school, a private k-8 school just outside of washington, d.c., where pence had previously worked for many years.\n\nperhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise, considering the pences have long been known for their staunch religious convictions.\n\nregardless, her decision was widely criticized.\n\nwhy not teach at a school that welcomes everyone, instead of choosing one that won't serve lgbtq kids, kids of lgbtq parents? jodee winterhof of the human rights campaign told huffpost in a statement. the pences never seem to miss an opportunity to show their public service only extends to some.\n\nmore of the same on twitter:\n\nkara brooks, a spokeswoman for pence, responded to the backlash.\n\nit's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack, brooks told huffpo in a statement.
if you're married or have a partner: want to boost your chances of having a secure retirement? interested in reducing some of the tension at home? keen on avoiding an irreparable split? then you should take a look at how you make financial decisions about retirement together.\n\nstudy after study point to arguments about money as being one of the top reasons couples fall apart. and don't be complacent just because you've been together for decades. sadly, more people over 50 with long marriages are calling it quits these days.\n\neven if the situation doesn't become that dire, it's important to work together effectively to finance your retirement. by doing so, you'll maximize opportunities, save money and prevent unnecessary unhappiness.\n\nbut how exactly do you accomplish this? i'm not a marriage counselor, but as a financial planner who has worked with hundreds of couples over 30 years, i've noticed a few distinct patterns for success:\n\nclarify, prioritize & dollarize your goals\n\nbefore considering constraints, discuss your retirement dreams and write them down. answer questions like these:\n\nwhere would you both like to you live when you retire? how much would you like to travel? would you prefer to own a home or rent (and how much will that cost)? is helping the kids financially a priority and, if so, how much support do you have in mind? is it important that you're both debt-free when you retire and, if so, what will it cost to achieve that?\n\ndon't go to the next step until you agree on what you both want the broad picture to look like and how much it'll cost. if you or your partner has goals that the other doesn't, that's ok. write them down, too.\n\nchances are, you'll have to compromise; i'll deal with that shortly. but for now, the critical point is: clarify what you both want your retirement lives to look like, what your priorities are and your best estimate of what each item costs.\n\nmark each item as either a must have, want or wish. that will be invaluable when it comes time to putting your plan into action.\n\nproject what the future might look like\n\nnow that you both know what you are aiming at, it's time to objectively determine if you are on track to achieve your goals. you do that by taking stock of your investments, anticipated retirement income and potential future costs.\n\nproject how much money you'll need to pay for the lifestyle you both dream of. it doesn't have to be an exact figure; a ballpark number is good enough to start with. then, compare that amount to what you can reasonably expect to receive from pensions, social security and investment income.\n\ntake the time to get buy-in from your partner on this. make sure you both understand how the math works and that you agree with the numbers. this way, you will address any challenges as a team rather than as adversaries.\n\none note about social security: there will be some big changes to the rules for claiming benefits starting later this year and they will impact the way couples plan their retirement income. one change in particular that's worth noting: the file and suspend strategy is ending april 30; it was especially attractive to married couples where one had a significantly higher salary than the other, increasing the size of their combined benefits. but if you'll turn 62 after jan. 1, 2016, this option will no longer be available.\n\ntalk to your financial adviser to hammer out the best social security claiming strategy for your situation.\n\namend your strategy together\n\nif you and your spouse or partner determine that there is a great divide between your retirement dreams and what you think you can afford, don't despair. there is plenty you can do to build your bridge.\n\nfirst, go back to your priority list. how many of the need items can you afford? if you have enough resources to pay for all of these, your work may be done. at this point, it's just a question of how much money you'll have left over to pay for the wants and wishes as well as your ability to compromise with your partner.\n\nbut if you won't have enough to cover all the things you agree you need, it's time to compromise together.\n\nwould you both agree to retire in a different, less expensive area? if so, you could save a bundle. for example, according to bankrate.com, if you retire to amarillo, texas from los angeles, you might be able to maintain the same standard of living with 41% less income. that's impressive.\n\nif you aren't both willing to move, could you agree to sell your house and rent instead? that can free up a great deal of capital and reduce your costs.\n\nif neither of these options work, would you be willing to cut spending, invest differently or do both? this shift could be meaningful.\n\nremove remaining obstacles\n\nif you and your partner are still stuck, it may be time to call in professional help. this could be a financial adviser or a therapist.\n\noften, the problem is the ability to listen to each other and communicate effectively. sometimes a third party is all you need to resolve this impasse and find agreement.\n\nissues such as one partner's debt or spending problems may be easier to overlook while at least one of you is working. but when it comes time to plan for retirement, they take on more urgency to address.\n\nthe bottom line for your retirement: recognize where you are now as a couple, where you want to be, what it will take to achieve your goals and the need to make a joint commitment to put your plan into gear. then do it.
twenty years ago, as a money magazine staff writer, i had the idea to write a money book aimed at my peers in their 20s and 30s. my mom came up with a snappy title, and i started pitching publishers. the general consensus: young people don't care about money — and they don't buy books either. i was in my late 20s at the time, and knew neither was true.\n\na young editor at simon & schuster got it, too. soon after, get a financial life was born.\n\nthis week simon & schuster is publishing a totally revised and updated get a financial life: personal finance in your twenties and thirties. and much has changed. i have a 21-year-old child of my own. no one thinks young people don't care about money. and this book is for, you guessed it, millennials.\n\nwhat did i learn?\n\nafter i dug into the data, i realized that this generation feels, in some ways, very familiar. they aren't like the wayward generation x crowd i grew up in or even like my big brother's baby boomers. with some exceptions, today's young people resemble my parents — born in 1929 at the time of the great depression.\n\nauthor beth kobliner ben baker\n\nlike their elders, today's young people came of age in a decade of economic upheaval that was not of their own making. the housing bust and ensuing recession showed millennials the hazards of buying more than they can afford. as a result, they tend to assume less high-interest debt compared to the previous two generations, they're more cautious about taking on mortgages, and they're more likely to keep to a budget and, overall, they value thriftiness.\n\nbut like every generation, millennials have landed in their own spot in history — and they're living very different financial lives than the boomers or gen xers before them.\n\nread: these are the 4 most important things you can teach your kids about money\n\nhere are five ways that managing money has changed for them.\n\nit's harder to get a good job\n\nin 2016, according to data from the economic policy institute, the unemployment rate for college grads was 5.6%, only a tenth of a point higher than the pre-recession rate in 2007. not too shabby. what's a concern, though, is underemployment — a figure that includes jobless people looking for work, part-time workers who want to go full time, and unemployed people who have recently given up looking. the current underemployment rate for young college grads? 12.6%. a three-percentage-point jump from 2007. the picture is worse if you don't have a college diploma: the underemployment rate for high school grads is 33.7%. (in 2007, it was 26.8%.)\n\nthey'll need their money to last longer\n\nthree-quarters of millennials have been socking away money for retirement, and almost a third of them are setting aside more than 10% of their salary. sounds pretty promising, right? but they need to beware: 62% of them have already siphoned money from their retirement savings — that's about twice the percentage of gen-xers or boomers — and they'll had a lot more time to tap into those iras and 401(k)s. with longer life expectancies meaning longer retirements, it's more important than ever to save as much as you can — i recommend at least 15% of your income. (some prognosticators put this at over 20%.) and, unless it's a serious emergency, don't jeopardize your retirement by treating your 401(k) like an atm.\n\nread: workers can sabotage their retirements by dipping into their 401(k) accounts early\n\nmany will be paying off college debt for a very long time\n\nwhen i graduated from college, i had $10,000 in debt, which was more than just about anyone else i knew. today, grads who borrow money (and that's about 70% of them) are coming out of college with an average of $37,000 in student loans hanging over their heads. at a little less than half that figure, the median is a bit more manageable.\n\nread: yet another reminder that it's nearly impossible to work your way through school\n\nregardless of which stat you choose, all that student debt is a source of daily anxiety. more than half of young workers worry about their college loans often or all the time. that's just one finding american student assistance published early this year — and 44% say they have no clue how they'll pay them off. when i was a kid, city university of new york colleges were tuition-free for a brief, glorious period. and once upon a time you could avoid serious debt by going to college in-state. not so much anymore. since 1995, tuition and fees at in-state public college have ballooned, on average, almost 300%.\n\ncan employers solve the student-loan crisis?\n\nit's harder to buy a home\n\nscary student loans and uncertain employment prospects have made millennials postpone lots of life's biggest steps, from marriage to kids to that first home purchase. stats from zillow z, -8.09% say millennials are renting twice as long before buying than people did 40 years ago, pushing the median age of a first-time buyer in 2016 to 32. (when boomers were just starting out, the age was 28.) of course the disappearance of zero-money-down mortgages has meant that millennials have to wait until they've saved up for a down payment. and one of the main hurdles that's keeping young people from putting aside all that cash? you guessed it, student debt.\n\nread: why american millennials may never get to live alone\n\nthey're less cautious about financial data online\n\nmillennials grew up on the web, but when it comes to cybersecurity, they need to be more aware. call it caution or call it paranoia, but half of baby boomers use secure passwords for all their online accounts. so how come only a third of millennials do? experts have speculated that growing up online has made young people trust the web more than they probably should. one example: 20% admit to using public wi-fi to check banking information or pay bills online — a big no-no. which could explain why more of them have had been hacked, compared to the national average. millennials may be experts when it comes to the web, but they may want to take a page from the old folks to make sure they're protected.\n\nread: your browser history can now be sold to advertisers without your consent\n\nbeth kobliner is a commentator and journalist, and the author of two new york times bestsellers get a financial life: personal finance in your twenties and thirties, and make your kid a money genius (even if you're not). she was a member of president barack obama's president's advisory council on financial capability, where she created moneyasyougrow.org.
dear moneyologist,\n\ni'm 50 years of age and terminally ill. my husband has said he is not sure if he will include my son in his will. he said he may leave everything to his children. he may be inheriting property which brings a very generous annual income. i feel that should not be included. i do feel that assets earned during the time of our marriage until my death — with exception of that additional inheritance — should be divided equally. do i have legal and moral grounds to request such a request? if so, can it be made legal without dispute from himself or his heirs prior to my death and after his? we reside in california, community property state.\n\nthe house in question was purchased prior to our marriage because of my health problems. i realize that by not getting anything in writing i may have not protected myself nor my son.\n\nconcerned wife and mother\n\ndear concerned,\n\ni'm sorry to hear that any stress surrounding your diagnosis is further complicated by your uncertainty about your son's inheritance. on the one hand, your husband has at least been honest with you (instead of saying one thing and doing another). on the other hand, your son is a big part of your life and, clearly, your husband's reluctance to leave him a share of your home is an unwelcome development. you're absolutely right to have this conversation with your husband now. so many people neglect to talk about such uncomfortable subjects. first step: talk to your husband and let him know how you feel. it would mean a great deal to me if you would remember my son. and, aside from helping him out, i know it would mean a great deal to him too.\n\nlisten to our latest podcast:money, markets & more (or subscribe on itunes): walking a mile in dead men's shoes and millennials tap home equity for frivolities.\n\n you may be able to change your home from separate to community property. did you contribute to the mortgage? or did money to pay the mortgage come from join funds?  — the moneyologist\n\nwhat happens to the home you share with your husband after you're gone depends on whether it's a separate property or community property under california law. a separate property would be one bought prior to your marriage by your husband with his name only on the deed. in that case, the property can be freely transferred to your husband's children upon his death, according to william sweeney, a california-based probate attorney. given that your home appears to have been purchased prior to your marriage, even if the value of that property increased during your marriage, the house belongs to him. (if you bought it prior to your marriage, it would be all yours.)\n\nread: can i leave my stepchildren nothing if my husband dies?\n\ncommunity property is different. california — along with arizona, idaho, louisiana, texas, nevada, new mexico and washington — treat all marital assets as community property, meaning that assets acquired during the marriage are divided equally between the two spouses. california probate code section 100(a) puts it more formally than that: notwithstanding an agreement otherwise, upon the death of a married person, one-half of the community property belongs to the surviving spouse and the other half belongs to the decedent. there are exceptions, however. if you can prove your home is community property, however, you could bequeath your share of the home to your son.\n\nsome questions to ask to decide if you could change the status of your home from separate to community property. did you contribute to the mortgage? or did money to pay the mortgage come from join funds? if separate and community property or funds are commingled in such a manner that it is impossible to trace the source of the property or funds, the whole must be treated as community property, according to the law firm of thurman arnold in palm spring, calif. it can include one time down payments from joint bank accounts that contain community income or earnings (or separate property accounts that may have been commingled with joint funds) further complicated in the case of a refinance, and more.\n\ndon't miss: the three digit number that predicts lasting love?\n\nsweeney recommends seeking an experienced california estate planning attorney for advice as to what estate plan you can create to protect your legal interests. the moneyologist seconds that. one option to consider: create a living trust for your son, funded with your own separate assets (bank accounts, jewelry, stocks, for instance) and your share of any other joint assets. trusts are dealt with outside of local probate court which would keep things private, takes less time to distribute than assets in a will and cuts down on administrative expenses. taking these measures should help give you peace of mind, and ensure that your son doesn't get any unexpected surprises.\n\nas to the ethical side of your question: although it seems unfair, your husband is free to leave his assets to his children alone and, yes, you may do the same.\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyologist.
dear moneyist,\n\nmy late mother remarried in 1954. my biological father — the only father my other brothers and sisters have known — died in 2005. i found out recently that my stepfather has a will and left everything to our half-sister. however, our half-sister died six months ago leaving behind a husband. what are your recommendations for when my stepfather dies? i am planning on retaining a lawyer to petition the court to be named executor of his estate.\n\nalso see:this woman's husband gave $600,000 to a cult\n\ni saw a bank statement once and he had about $100,000 in the account. i was amazed that he had that much, but i know he has been investing some. the house is probably worth between $50,000 and $75,000. a couple of family members (aunts on my mother's side) have told me that the social security checks my mom received for each of her children until they turned 18 was used to finance their buying the current house.\n\ngale\n\ndear gale,\n\nyou have one thing in your favor and it's something that went against many other people who have written into this column in recent times: your stepfather is still alive.\n\nand, i trust, he is also well and is not planning to slip this mortal coil anytime soon. talk to him, and explain how he may know wish to rewrite his will given that his heir is dead. (you may want to put it a little more delicately than that.) you're more influential and helpful now as a stepdaughter when he is alive than you will be as an executor when he is dead. this is the time to help him get his affairs in order, make plans for what happens to his estate after he's gone and, yes, make a case for his stepchildren.\n\n even if you break bread on thanksgiving and have known each other for most of your lives, you are not considered his child under the eyes of the law. \n\nthis is all the more important if your mother brought assets into the marriage and left them to your stepfather in her will. if your mother did not leave a will, then your stepfather is not necessarily in line to inherit 100% of her estate. in california, for instance, your stepfather would inherit all of the deceased spouse's community property. that's the wealth they accumulated during their marriage. but you and your siblings would under california law inherit between one-half and one-third of your mother's separate property.\n\ndon't miss:my stepmother inherited my late father's estate — i want my fair share\n\nit is all the more important for stepchildren to make such a case. stepchildren are not legal heirs. even if you break bread on thanksgiving and have known each other for most of your lives, you are not considered his child under the eyes of the law. if your stepfather wants to make sure you and your siblings are taken care of after he's gone, or even if he wants to leave you something of sentimental value — anything from a diamond ring to an empty jewelry box — he will have to make those provisions in his will. an alternative: your stepfather could adopt you and your siblings.\n\nyou're not entitled to his estate. but you could give him a gentle reminder that you wouldn't mind a few bob either.\n\nread also:how do i cancel 10 credit cards without damaging my credit score?\n\ndo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money? send them to marketwatch's moneyist and please include the state where you live (no full names will be used).\n\nwould you like to sign up to an email alert when a new moneyist column has been published? if so, click on this link.
